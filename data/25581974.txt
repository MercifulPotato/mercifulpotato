The best thing i could think up for now is to modify the wiki&#x27;s UI and UX for personal note taking usage. To create &quot;networked-notetaking application&quot;. Pivoting my research goal from &quot;organization-knowledge-management&quot; to &quot;personal-knowledge-management&quot;.<p>The idea of &quot;knowledge-graph-based social networks&quot; is cool, but dont you think that the &quot;post + comment thread&quot; pattern, the &quot;interest group&quot; pattern and the &quot;one-to-one direct communication&quot; pattern are irreplaceable in a social network ?<p>Even the wiki itself is using a rudimentary system to simulate those pattern on top of its knowledge graph structure. Lot of people, communicating together by editing the same single page, just like using a single blackboard together. (For example, see the &quot;Talk&quot; page on wikipedia)')
