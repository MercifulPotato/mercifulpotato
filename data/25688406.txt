Like my friend recently sent me a recipe. That&#x27;s nice to save. Everything else I&#x27;m fine cutting off at like 500 messages or something. I guess a lot of this saving doesn&#x27;t bother me because back in the T9ing days you couldn&#x27;t save many messages and no one batted an eye. I&#x27;m surprised at the major paradigm shift, but also most communication happens through text now which is also interesting.')
