It&#x27;s intended to be a thought experiment, not anything that&#x27;s likely (or even possible). And I have no quarrel with you taking the latter position either - the point I&#x27;m making in my comment is merely that the argument against prosocial lying is a bad one, not that I think my defense of economists lying is particularly strong.<p>Since multiple people have thought my point hinges on whether the example is reasonable, let me reconstruct the argument given in the post.<p>1. It&#x27;s <i>always</i> morally unacceptable for a doctor to lie to a patient, regardless of his &#x2F; her reasons for doing so.<p>2. The economist&#x27;s profession is like that of the doctor in certain important respects: &quot;The central problem with allowing for, and consenting to, any untruthfulness is that it undermines essential trust between professionals of the field and the rest of us.&quot;<p>3. Therefore pro-social lying by economists is wrong (just as it&#x27;s wrong in the case of the doctor).<p>I think the claims in the article rely quite heavily on our intuition that it&#x27;s never acceptable for a doctor to lie to us, even for &quot;prosocial&quot; reasons. (We don&#x27;t have such intuitions for economists, apparently, and that&#x27;s why our intuitions about doctors are so important for the argument.)<p>But this claim is basically not defended, and my point is that it&#x27;s very easy to come up with cases in which it&#x27;s not only morally acceptable for a doctor to lie to you, but in fact might be morally obligatory. This means that the argument fails.<p>The fact that the argument fails doesn&#x27;t mean that it <i>is</i> okay (in any real life situation) for a doctor (or an economist) to lie to you. But the fact that the argument fails is something worth noting, I think, in comments about the article.')
