Do research to expand knowledge.\n2. Educate new researchers.\nBig tech just wants highly skilled researchers in their workforce, but there only N students graduating every year. So it is only logical for them to &quot;help&quot; (can be good or bad) the university so n+m students graduate. But the bad thing is that the push for more education can negativly impact the available research time professors have.')
