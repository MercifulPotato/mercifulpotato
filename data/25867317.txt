There was no need for &quot;another&quot; other than PR.<p>I feel compelled to note that your summary of SSPL is wholly inaccurate. SSPL is very clearly a GPL derivative. It&#x27;s language though leaves a lot to be desired, but the intent was clear. It does NOT prohibit making money offering the software as a service. It does require to contribute your changes back to the software if you are doing so.<p>The real failure is that companies have danced well enough around the edges of GPLv3 for so long that Amazon running a service which is basically just the software with modifications, but without the source code being contributed to open source, is feasible. This is even becoming a problem for Linux.<p>The reality is that Amazon Elasticsearch is clearly a derivative work under copyright law, and under GPL should be re-contributed. But major companies have &quot;danced&quot; the line so it does not have to be. SSPL is an attempt to bridge that gap, a poor one, but an attempt. The OSI appears more interested in defending their license than helping resolve this egregious situation. The SSPL sucks, but not having a solution for it sucks more.')
