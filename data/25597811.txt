The reality of the time is that they regarded those folks as the &quot;undesirables.&quot;  Those musicians tended to live in the <i>really</i> slummy areas because they were so poor ...<p>When we walked on 6th Street on New Year&#x27;s a couple years ago, it was DJ after DJ after DJ ... all nice and clean and corporate.  No scummy bars selling to minors here.<p>If you want vibe, you&#x27;re probably talking cities like Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Detroit, etc.<p>I will caution you a bit about Pittsburgh, it seems to be gentrifying fast in a lot of areas.  I know that practically all of the excellent little family bars and restaurants that I used to go to are all gone.  The O disappearing simply reinforces that.  :(')
