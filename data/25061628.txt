There is nothing inherently white about patents. Japan, China, and India would be pretty shocked to hear it for one. If anything the tribal situation is either colonalism in not recognizing the indigenous people&#x27;s prior art or &quot;loopholes&quot; that they deal with purified and quantified products and the long time users didn&#x27;t. The intent of promoting purification and dose control was by design.<p>Then it gets into the Postmodernism mental illness in complaininf about a laboratory being preferred over a farm field or forrest for invention and acting like it is a cultural construct.
