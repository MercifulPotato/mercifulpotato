It turns out to be empty. The customs officers inspect wagon after wagon. All of them are empty. When they come to the last there is a very drunk railroad official lying on some straw sleeping off a fairly obvious round of heavy drinking. They sober him up and interrogate him. &quot;Where is all the wodka?&quot; &quot;I sold it!&quot;. &quot;Then where is all the money?&quot; &quot;I drank it!&quot;.')
