Wisp introduces a lot of syntax, and abstractions to pretend it&#x27;s on a lisp runtime, which make it harder to learn, and makes it less obvious what happened when stuff breaks.  And you can&#x27;t invoke the compiler inside macros.  Those are the things I&#x27;ve tried to improve in eslisp.<p>Finding traction for a new language is difficult.  It requires quite a large mass of work, documentation, and polish, before people view it as stable enough to invest their time in.<p>For now, I&#x27;m happy even if eslisp is viewed as a convoluted experiment.  If it dies, perhaps like I found Wisp and had ideas, someone will find this and have ideas.  Projects die, progress continues.')
