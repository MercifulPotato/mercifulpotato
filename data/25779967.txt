The last 3 working fully remote)<p>- I would like to work for an American company (fully remote)<p>- I never been a freelancer, always an employee<p>My questions are:<p>- do American companies hire senior engineers from western Europe for 100% remote positions? I would say it&#x27;s not very likely because: a) timezone differences and b) if timezone is not a problem then they could just hire eastern europeans for a cheaper price (hell, they can hire engineers from Latin America as well for cheaper prices)<p>- if American companies hire western europeans, is freelancing the most common way to go? I guess it&#x27;s hard (legally) for American companies to hire european as employees.')
