Because your argument seems to be the opposite of your conclusion.<p>Ok, let me make it clear: I agree with your quoted response, but I disagree with the substance and the narrative of your view from which it is told. It&#x27;s very obviously a skewed perception from someone who frankly takes a very poor view of the overall health of what Big Tech has created to the detriment of us all. If you really think Microsoft is any less despised now, than it was back then now you are out of touch entirely as they are the epitome of the panopticon business model that colludes with Military and Intelligence agencies for contracts [0].<p>And just so it clear, a lot of people on HN do not work for FAANG, YC funds many startups that challenge those business models after all; so many here have no desire to work there, myself included.<p>What I take issue with is with the over-glorification of the &#x27;intellectual lobotimization&#x27; and what are clearly very intelligent and talented people and the motivation(s) and consequences behind them and the acceptance of it as a casual dismissal of it with statements like &#x27;well, I didn&#x27;t see any of that when I was there.&#x27;<p>Of course you didn&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s the point about FAANG: things are purposely compartmentalized, isolated, and people there are kept content with infantile based distractions and financial incentives so much that they lose touch with reality entirely while within it.<p>You see this within Military and Intelligence agencies as well but that differs in that it is undertaken with some sort of perverse cult-like fraternal <i>code of conduct</i> and unquestionable loyalty to the State instead. The guy maintaining the bomber&#x27;s engines is in a different department as the guy working on the engineering of the weapons and guidance systems on those &#x27;smart weapons,&#x27; who is also in a different department than the guy piloting the plane that ultimately drops said weapons that kills everyone in a remote village, but that system doesn&#x27;t warrant the rampant diffusion of responsibility for the death of countless innocent people who are deemed &#x27;collateral damage&#x27; in the end, are they? They&#x27;re all responsible.<p>And as seen in the military (Snowden, Manning), as well as in FAANG, should someone decide to even mention some obvious truths about these places in an attempt to make progress no less, they instantly get crucified: James Damore. And other activist Googlers [1] who dare to speak up and instantly become persona non-grata in a way to contain the PR backlash and distract from the nefarious acts of said perpetrator.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tech-news&#x2F;thousands-contracts-highlight-quiet-ties-between-big-tech-u-s-n1233171" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tech-news&#x2F;thousands-contracts-h...</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;dec&#x2F;17&#x2F;fifth-google-worker-activist-fired-in-a-month-says-company-is-targeting-the-vulnerable" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;dec&#x2F;17&#x2F;fifth-google...</a>')
