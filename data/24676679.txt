SOX for headers, RS as &quot;commas&quot;, and GS as &quot;newlines&quot;.  You&#x27;d be able to cleanly concatenate multiple files, since the first line is no longer special, and you&#x27;d be able to have commas, newlines, and in fact any printable text whatsoever inside the data.<p>And the semantics are perfectly clean. Again, that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re there for.  Some small challenges for hand-editing that a competent text editor can easily rise to.')
