The distributions probably won&#x27;t keep that lib around either, so the easiest solution for proprietary vendors who don&#x27;t care about dependency updates is to ship it all in a self contained bundle.<p>It also makes it easier to clean up when uninstalling and makes for better damage control by limiting what can be broken if done right, but like the article said this is not what it&#x27;s actually all about since noone seems to care about these points.')
