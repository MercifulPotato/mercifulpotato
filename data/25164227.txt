Is that what you are implying?  My outsider view is that large-scale phased testing of medication is the primary cost required by regulations, and the primary assurance of quality of a medication.  Since you can&#x27;t get rid of those test stages without sacrificing quality, removing regulation would have the primary effect of allowing companies to sacrifice quality.')
