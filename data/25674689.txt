Actively censoring &quot;misinformation&quot; regarding election irregularities will achieve the exact opposite of what (I hope) is intended here: to prevent harm.<p>Trump has already been successful in creating the image of a rigged election in the minds of his supporters. He has been working on this for at least a year. This <i>already</i> happened. It can&#x27;t be undone by censorship.<p>The only thing that censorship will achieve is to further the &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality.
