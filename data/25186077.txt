That in itself allows for much better integration and utilisation.<p>&gt;As a weird sidenote to this: Whilst I was looking up the benchmarks of the iPhone I found out that basically every single tech mag is owned by the exact same company - you can tell because they all have the same adblocker nagware.<p>Not sure I&#x27;d read that far into that, maybe some company did a good nagware and sold&#x2F;open sourced to all those sites.  Though still, if the salient points still the same with different wording, that would be telling.  For me, YouTube seems to cut thru much of that, not that it don&#x27;t have it&#x27;s only area&#x27;s of concern but does seem to get more honest takes and individual opinions more.')
