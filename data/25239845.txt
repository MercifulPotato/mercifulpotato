Which doesn&#x27;t immediately seem a compelling location for glassmaking until you realise that a key input was found there.  Natural gas.<p>From the Indiana gas boom.  Of the 1880s, as the article mentions.  But not the hubris and decline which followed:<p><i>In 1886, Indiana&#x27;s first commercial gas well when George W. Carter, William W. Worthington, and Robert C. Bell, hired Almeron H. Crannell drill another well in Eaton. Crannell reached gas at a depth of 922 feet (281 m). When the escaping gas was ignited, the flame reached 10 feet into the air. Other gas wells were drilled, and in instances, the escaping gas was ignited to advertise the discovery, with the assumption the gas inexhaustible. The resultant flame was called a flambeaux.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Indiana_gas_boom" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Indiana_gas_boom</a><p>The gas attracted energy-intensive manufacturing, notably glas manufacture, including the Ball Corporation (in Muncie), and the Hemmingray Bottle and Insulating Glass Company.<p>Of course the supply was not infinite, as much as 90% was burned in flambeaux, and by the early 20th century other energy sources were substituted as the last dregs were exhausted.<p>But the echo of a squandered nonrenewable resource remains in Ball canning jars.')
