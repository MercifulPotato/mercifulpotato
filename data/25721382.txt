And far greater percentage tried to secede ( civil war ).<p>&gt; Except they were allied with the US and deals were drawn up that should be honored.<p>We were never &quot;allied&quot; with taiwan. The chinese who fled to taiwan were our vassals. After they lost the chinese civil war, we foolishly and greedily, intervened to keep taiwan separate from china. Sooner or later, that&#x27;s gonna cost us. All anybody has to do is look at a map.<p>&gt; He said in a strategic industry, which semiconductors are.<p>As opposed to everything else right?<p>&gt; If there is TSMC spam it&#x27;s probably because this is a tech forum and they is a lot of movement in the field in the last year, mostly related to the failings of Intel and the rise of TSMC.<p>There is this bullshit TSMC spam because there is a trade war with china and people are funding it. No different than any other propaganda campaign whether it involves suits or geopolitic issues.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;submarine.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;submarine.html</a><p>All the propaganda campaigns you see news, media and online are pretty much funded by some billionaire elites somewhere.<p>If you really cared, then you should be demanding the &quot;taiwanese&quot; be forced out and return taiwan to the aborigines who live there. But then we&#x27;d have to return the land back to the natives, aborigines, etc ourselves so I doubt that&#x27;ll happen any time soon.')
