I learned in my 20s that money buys very little short term happiness. And then you’re stuck with a loan and a “cool” car that you’ve normalized into “just another car”. So happy I made that mistake early and now I can puerilely laugh with a bit of schadenfreude whenever I see an expensive car knowing the owner loved it for all of 2 weeks and now likely laments dumping a wad of cash into a hunk of depreciating metal.<p>On the flip side, when I see someone driving around in an old BMW they got for $3k and cleaned up themselves, I look on in awe. That’s the person to look up to. Not the person working themselves to death in a job they hate to drive a car that’s only the best for 6 months till the next year’s model comes out.')
