So just comparing April-to-April, and then putting it in percentage terms, and then not comparing to other waves of excess mortality that are normal, obscures what&#x27;s really going on. Your image seems to show that, prior peaks are of course clustered around January.<p>But look at total mortality so far in Sweden for 2020. Nothing special, on track to be a normal year. They had a very mild 2019 so it&#x27;ll probably be higher than that, but nothing special in context. Same for Switzerland.<p><i>It&#x27;s definitely not comparable to any flu year</i><p>I suspect you&#x27;re using the word &quot;comparable&quot; differently to me. Biologically, sure it is. It hits the older a bit harder and the young not at all, so in some ways it&#x27;s actually better than flu. However with flu since ~2000 there have been vaccines, and for COVID there isn&#x27;t, so that makes it a bit worse. But if you widen your historical context and look at years before the flu vaccines arrived, then it&#x27;s entirely comparable to flu years in the sense that mortality numbers are ending up very similar or even the same.<p>Look at the long term data for Sweden to put things in perspective:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swprs.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;sweden-monthly-deaths-1851.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swprs.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;sweden-monthly-...</a><p>Or for the UK<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inproportion2.talkigy.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inproportion2.talkigy.com&#x2F;</a><p>The world has seen far worse within living memory.<p>W.R.T. Poland, you didn&#x27;t have a COVID first wave at all, and your second is correlated with the rest of Europe so you&#x27;re going to be &quot;doubling up&quot; compared to some other places. But your epidemic peaked on November 11th, which means death will also soon peak, and therefore your results will look hardly different to other countries, none of which have experienced the huge waves of death that were supposedly going to engulf any country that didn&#x27;t lock down. <i>That&#x27;s</i> what matters: not whether COVID is 10% or 30% worse than a typical post-vaccine flu wave, or whether it&#x27;s the same as a pre-vaccine flu wave. Those are all minor details. What matters is that the world is being put through crazy totalitarian restrictions and evil based on predictions that it&#x27;d be 10,000x worse than flu. And those predictions are all totally, completely, unambiguously wrong.')
