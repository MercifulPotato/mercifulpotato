The only relevant rights in the US are the rights of twitter to not be compelled to publish someone&#x27;s speech, and freedom of association. That unlike in China, Trump is subject to the TOS of Twitter is as American and as free-speech faithful as it gets. The only shameful thing was that Twitter carved out exceptions for him because they were afraid of political retaliation over the last four years.<p>In fact having the government and the executive exercise influence over private business would make the US more like China, not less. When a politician is kicked off a platform for violating its terms it&#x27;s not a violation of &quot;free speech&quot;, it&#x27;s the politician behaving like a five year old who says &quot;mom, the other kids don&#x27;t want me on the playground!&quot; Free speech is not &quot;in your face&quot;-ism. It does not entitle anyone to scream on someone else&#x27;s property.')
