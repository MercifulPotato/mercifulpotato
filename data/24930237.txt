Speakers in the woods with wolf noises?  This sounds like a bad Disney halloween movie.  Or that episode of Father Ted.  Or that PSA in Talladega Nights about the packs of vicious dogs who control most major cities.<p>I&#x27;m concerned about the negative portrayal of wolves.  No matter who is saying it, making people overly afraid of wolves endangers <i>the wolves</i>.  Even in wolf country, you are still far more likely to be shot by a hunter than eaten by a wolfpack.  Wolves are to be respected, not demonized.')
