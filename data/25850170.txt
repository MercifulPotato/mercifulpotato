I think I see what happened here, HN formatting. :)</i><p>I may be in the minority here, but I wish HN supported just a bit more formatting (such as bolding&#x2F;strong) than it currently does.<p>I also wish the current formatting was a bit more aggressive in recovering from obvious errors, for example emphasis should probably be closed at the end of a block like a paragraph, rather than making the whole rest of a comment emphasized when someone forgets to add or accidentally deletes a closing asterisk.')
