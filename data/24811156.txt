You have at best 120 quarters left to make something of yourself. A year wasted at a poor job or role is equivalent to you throwing away 3.3% of your career. The older you get, the steeper your loss is.<p>Which sort of implies that what matters is where you end up at the end of your career, not enjoying yourself a long the way. I guess this isn&#x27;t so much &quot;status&#x2F;money&quot; as it is &quot;destination vs. journey&quot;, but I feel like those can be related.<p>That said, I found most of the rest of the post to be much more broadly applicable. The Accomplishment&#x2F;Impact&#x2F;Growth&#x2F;Challenge&#x2F;Community framework I thought was especially good&#x2F;useful to keep in mind.')
