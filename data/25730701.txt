It’s only good for ecosystems that rely heavily on context or libraries installed by operating system package managers. Languages that have self contained package managers like JavaScript, Haskell or python don’t benefit. In fact in those cases nix actually makes things worse by making almost everything way more complex and error prone then necessary as literally nothing is designed with nix in mind.')
