That&#x27;s obviously not ok, and it&#x27;s all I was reacting to. Nothing else. Please don&#x27;t do it again. That&#x27;s all.<p>&quot;Labeling as inflammatory any criticism of people this community venerates&quot; is  not a thing. Actually there&#x27;s not even such a thing as &quot;people this community venerates&quot;. Any $person venerated by some is criticized by others, and you&#x27;ll find plenty of such criticism in HN threads.<p>If you have that impression, you might be falling prey to the notice-dislike bias: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=notice%20dislike%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=notice%20dislike%20by:dang&amp;dat...</a>, a form of sample bias where the massively greater impact of the data points one dislikes leads to false feelings of generality. We all seem to suffer from this.')
