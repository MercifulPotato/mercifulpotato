Item(by='ElusiveOwl', descendants=None, kids=[25007502, 25006756], score=None, time=1604656504, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24998584, text='Yes, MuseScore has taken insane threatening stance to everyone who tries to defy them. Just by having the browser extension without actually using it got me a very menacing message from musescore about &quot;being reported to law enforcement&quot;. I believe this is very unprofessional and is mostly made to scare people rather than act as an actual warning or message. They could have said that due to the abuse of such extensions they will block the site access until you turn them off like with adblock. But no they have to say you are getting your ass handed to law enforcement. I wonder who will give any attention to a student just having a publicly available browser extension aimed to view and download music sheets based on previously publicly available museScore APIs.')
