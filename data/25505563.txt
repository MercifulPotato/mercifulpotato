But then there is the reality of modern software development.<p>A few years ago, the new CTO of a Union Square Ventures&#x27; investment tapped me as technical advisor to review this startups efforts to expand their software to new verticals. He came in as part of a reshuffle. He had brought his Director of Engineering from his previous (well known) company, and there was even a Star CEO (which is the reason I signed up!) with a monumentally impressive CV. As compensation, I was billing lawyer hourly rates.<p>After two months of reviewing their existing architecture, and picking the brains of the dev, support, and sales team the new verticals, I came with an <i>architectural</i> solution to their immediate and long-term needs. I gave them exactly what they said they wanted.<p>What then happened is that, for one, the Star CEO turned out to be an echo chamber of &quot;growth growth growth&quot; and entirely disappointing as a leader of a software company. And this was a SV veteran from both HW and SW side of SV. Huge disappointment.<p>The CTO, who was entirely clueless, apparently gave in to back channel efforts of his DoE to disregard my work product. A few days later I walk into an all hands meeting where the &quot;next generation&quot; was announced to be &quot;a ball of mud&quot; of &quot;microservices&quot;. This same CTO later took me aside and basically offered to give me hush money (&quot;will you be my personal advisor?&quot;) to keep quiet, while getting the same (insanely high) hourly rate for the remainder of my contract.<p>So this is the reality of modern software development. Architecture is simply not valued at extremities of tech orgnizations: the bottom ranks are young developers who simply don&#x27;t know enough to appreciate thoughtful design. And the management is facing incentives that simply do NOT align with thoughtful design and development.')
