[..] We seek to ensure they can do this for other types of electronic products. However, without the complete, corresponding source code (CCS), including the scripts to control its compilation and installation, the fundamental purpose of copyleft is frustrated. Consumers, hobbyists, non-profit e-recyclers and the general public are left without the necessary tools they need and deserve, and which the license promises them.<p>so true. OpenWrt is alot of networking fun and allows me to run a more current kernel on a measly (and perfectly fine for my uplink) MIPS device from 2012 than the one of the 450â‚¬ smartphone. But some chips will never see a reimplementation if datasheets and specs are missing. I pray for mainline kernel support, but while some SoC get integrated, GPU and peripherals are another story. As a consumer, this is sick. How is anybody even allowed to sell this way.<p>The 17th october marks the &quot;international repair day&quot; of the repair community.
