OTOH, their platform gives them influence over the democratic process. In theory people shouldn&#x27;t be censored. OTOH it is easy to fool people with targeted propaganda.<p>Philosophizing is not going to get you anywhere, really. It&#x27;s a technique of the past. There are many competing effects at play here. I think the more rational approach is to actually study the real world system to find a policy optimum that achieves a set goal. Philosophy should be relegated to figuring out that goal e.g. should it be democracy over all else or maybe individual rights or something else.')
