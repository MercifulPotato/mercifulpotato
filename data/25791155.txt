(I&#x27;m a moderator on a non-American political subreddit, so most of my opinions below come from my own observations and musings.)<p>Instead, the decay of social media happens as the platform transitions from a place where one talks <i>with</i> people to a place where one talks <i>at</i> people.<p>If I reply to your political thoughts by telling you off, I&#x27;m probably not trying to convince you to change your mind.  Instead, I&#x27;m performing for the attention (and upvotes &#x2F; retweets &#x2F; kind comments) of like-minded peers.<p>That&#x27;s obviously alienating for the person who gets attacked, but this kind of performance is also self-radicalizing.  The validating reinforcement preferentially goes to the strongest attacks or defenses, favouring rhetoric (as you noted) rather than substance.<p>One of the few things that suppresses this cycle is exactly what HN does reasonably well: have the community be about something else, diluting political content such that there&#x27;s less often a chain-reaction.')
