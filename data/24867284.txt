So his reinvestment of profits in the company, investments in clean energy, contributions to charity, profit losses due to forgiving debts owed by people in disaster zones...whatever it all was.<p>Someone making laws figured all of that was &quot;fair.&quot;<p>If someone followed the given rules, dealt fairly and openly with others and made 1 billion dollars they did it fairly. The huge amount of money does not make it unfair in any way.<p>See, my definition of &quot;fair&quot; is followed the law and didn&#x27;t deceive others.
