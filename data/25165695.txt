Been loving Google Voice &#x2F; Grand Central for allowing me to both call and text from any device, even through all the rough patches (e.g. no MMS support, losing group texts).  My wife cracked her screen and is looking at getting it fixed but the loss of her phone is making her hesitate.  I&#x27;m tempted to get her on Google Voice but the roughness and concern over its future is why I hesitate.<p>I&#x27;m going to miss Hangouts Integration.  It was great accessing GV directly from GMail.')
