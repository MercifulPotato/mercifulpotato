You don&#x27;t wait for a manager to tell you to pick up a debris that&#x27;s fallen in a forklift path. You clean it up. This doesn&#x27;t quite translate as well to software, you certainly don&#x27;t just want to make production code changes without some kind of review, but there are things like cleaning up some annoyance around a dev VM image that doesn&#x27;t require ticketing. A smart dev will likely tell people they fixed it (especially so teammates can update their VM), and a smart manager might document that fix with a ticket for their metrics, but my experience, is that organizations that laud autonomy in these kinds of improvements tend to have significantly greater actual velocity than ones that don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve lived through an org that reprimanded any change that wasn&#x27;t documented (or really dictated) and it creates an atmosphere of apathy and distrust. The same org over time finally had enough personalities who lauded initiative that it was transformative, and the apathy evaporated.')
