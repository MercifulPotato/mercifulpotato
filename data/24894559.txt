The extremist pushing &quot;culture wars&quot; do like to <i>argue</i> it&#x27;s about &quot;Marxist ideology&quot;, but what they paint as Marxist rarely has anything whatsoever to do with Marxism.<p>EDIT: It&#x27;s fascinating to see the votes on this change without anyone even trying to make an argument to justify the claim it has to do with Marxism. I&#x27;d love to see one of those downvoters explain exactly <i>how</i> it has anything to do with Marxism. I&#x27;m not holding my breath.')
