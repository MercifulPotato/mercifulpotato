People used to call these things paperweights with a hint of irony because there are lots of fancy paperweight designs. Nowadays people view such devices to be as useful as bricks. They are heavy and take up space but they are still intact and jokingly enough you could actually use them as construction material.<p>A car that was destroyed in an accident would not be considered bricked because it has sustained cosmetic damage. You can&#x27;t use it for it&#x27;s aesthetics alone. e.g. in a museum.\nA Tesla car where the battery charger has died could be considered a bricked car though.')
