The process of getting to and away from the gate is so unpleasant and inefficient that it makes me a little angry if I think about it too long.<p>And that&#x27;s if everything goes well. Delays are frequent. Add on top of that the cramped cabin, luggage restrictions, and that they ask you to not get up or use the bathroom for so long while the plane is going up or coming down (most of the ride on these short hops).<p>And it&#x27;s _expensive_.<p>Flying is awful and I hate it and will gladly choose the train if it&#x27;s remotely competitive.')
