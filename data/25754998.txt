Unless you are a Nazi. Then it&#x27;s all about Fackelmärsche, of course.<p>I want to add, for context, because I understand when Americans don&#x27;t understand this: These types of &quot;jokes&quot; don&#x27;t fly _culturally _in _Germany. If you glorify national socialism or the holocaust, even in humor, you are likely pretty close to that mindset anyway. It&#x27;s really no joking matter here.
