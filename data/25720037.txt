Other roles like &quot;Business Analysts&quot; are there to ensure that lowly developers never have to worry about things like understanding the business themselves.<p>So I get funny looks when I suggest that engineers should go talk to people in the business, and write design docs. Silicon Valley engineering practices can look very non-Agile to a lot people from traditional companies that are doing Agile.')
