When two Texans want the same house, a bidding war is artificially capped (at, say $300k) because that&#x27;s all the average Texan can afford. But when a Californian moves in with high net worth and a higher paying job, they can bid much higher, and they don&#x27;t mind doing so (the mindset I have personally heard from most CA transplants to Dallas is that they don&#x27;t care if they paid more than the average Texan pays, because at the end of the day they&#x27;re still paying less than half what they were paying in CA).<p>And then there&#x27;s the issue of property taxes. A Texan lives in his nice $250k house and pays $X&#x2F;year in property taxes. Then someone comes in and buys the house next to them for $400k&#x2F;yr. Suddenly this neighborhood is now appraised at a much higher value than before, and the Texan&#x27;s property taxes are now twice as high, bordering on the edge of unaffordable. I&#x27;ve personally seen several people be priced out of an area due to this.')
