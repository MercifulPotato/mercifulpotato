I&#x27;ll list off life experiences that come to mind, though:<p>(1) I guess it probably started off back in 2015 when I read about Utah&#x27;s &quot;Housing First&quot; approach to ending homelessness which got quite a bit of national news coverage at the time[0].<p>(2) I started talking to some of the people experiencing homelessness who hung around the grocery stores I went to in Seattle, seeing them as a person and not an unsightly problem to be swept under a rug. Ask them what food they want then buy it for them sometime, you might get a good conversation out of it; if they&#x27;re not up to talking, well, someone got a meal out of it at least - and they shouldn&#x27;t really owe you anything.<p>(3) Then one year I went on a business trip to Copenhagen, and saw their hybrid system of both privately-owned &amp; socialized housing; went to a BBQ at a coworker&#x27;s place at one of the socialized housing complexes, which was very nice.<p>(4) I bought a condo myself, and cheered as the price went up on Zillow. Then was struck with the somehow extremely obvious yet little-noticed contradiction that house prices appreciating in value, which is more-or-less the driving thesis of investment the largest asset class in the world, is diametrically opposed to the goal of making housing affordable - as in, cost less &amp; thus be worth less!<p>(5) I met my current partner, who is a medical resident in combined internal medicine &amp; psychiatry. Their patient population is almost all homeless. I heard many of their patients&#x27; stories and the misery they experience.<p>(6) I started watching some urban planning videos by donoteat01 on youtube[1], who is an entertaining presenter that uses Cities: Skylines to illustrate common concepts. I especially liked their video on gentrification[2].<p>(6) Somehow I heard about the Tax Amazon movement in Seattle[3], which aims to put a payroll tax on workers at large corps &amp; use the proceeds to fund the creation of public housing. I thought - that sounds great! Even though I work at a large tech corp myself, I&#x27;ll participate. Speaking with people at the various planning meetings (who were almost all outside the bubble of friends-who-work-in-tech I had) was really educating and solidified my views on all this.<p>Sorry that isn&#x27;t a link, but more a story of how I arrived here. Hopefully it helps you in some way.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;12&#x2F;10&#x2F;459100751&#x2F;utah-reduced-chronic-homelessness-by-91-percent-heres-how" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;12&#x2F;10&#x2F;459100751&#x2F;utah-reduced-chroni...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;donoteat01&#x2F;videos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;donoteat01&#x2F;videos</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LdeirDrinWk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LdeirDrinWk</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taxamazon.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taxamazon.net&#x2F;</a>')
