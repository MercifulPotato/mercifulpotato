Marcel&#x27;s expertise was in simulations and theory.  As you note it&#x27;s (relatively) easy to get a job in telescope software development coming from industry, but it&#x27;s much harder on the theoretical (and probably experimental) side where it&#x27;s less about technical skills and more about being up-to-date on the literature and advocating for your ideas.  You would have to essentially start over at the thesis stage of grad school to regain the domain knowledge and build up a body of work.  You&#x27;d probably work faster than you were the first time just because of the additional knowledge and wisdom, but I doubt many professors would be willing to hire you at even a Postdoc salary without a second thesis-like investment.')
