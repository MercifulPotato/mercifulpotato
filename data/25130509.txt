About 1&#x2F;3 of the time I add !g, usually for weird error messages and tech stuff.<p>Honestly we shouldn&#x27;t be using Google for everything. Why not just search StackExchange or Github issues directly for known bug problems? If you need a movie, !imdb or !rt forward you to exactly where you want to really search on.<p>If DDG or Google also included independent small blogs for movie results, I could see the value in that. I&#x27;d prefer someone&#x27;s review on their own site or video channel, but it doesn&#x27;t. We&#x27;ve kinda lost that part of the Internet.')
