I interviewed with Google probably around the year 2000, and there was a genuinely hard ball packing problem. I&#x27;m kind of curious what happened. Anyone who could answer that question would find this one trivial -- and not just the dynamic programming solution, but the O(log n) one which apparently no one at Google (or even applying to Google) noticed.<p>Fwiw this is very much untrue. While this person may not have known the optimal solution, it&#x27;s well documented within google.<p>&gt; What I hate about Google is that everyone there still thinks they&#x27;re a genius. In 2000, it felt okay, since for the most part, they actually were. Today, it&#x27;s kind of obnoxious.<p>News to me ;)<p>There are certainly places where I think Google is a world-leader. But that doesn&#x27;t require or imply that everyone be a super genius.')
