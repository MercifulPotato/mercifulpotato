All other benefits remained the same. It&#x27;s not a formal policy at my company, but I was able to negotiate a reduced schedule during my annual salary review.<p>I don&#x27;t know that I did anything clever in the negotiation, I just raised it with my manager and we brought it to HR. Everyone was positive about the idea but unsure of how it would work in the broader scheme, including if other people would see my schedule and want to get on the 32-hour week train too. (I hope so, but I avoided saying that.)<p>When I say all benefits remained the same, I mean all of them. It&#x27;s probably an oversight, but I continue to accrue vacation days at a rate of 20&#x2F;yr - except for me, that&#x27;s 5 work weeks, not 4. I&#x27;ve avoided pointing that out.')
