Literally, no bullshit in between where you don&#x27;t have to worry about the CEO of the shitty CEX you&#x27;re using taking a powder for 33 day&#x27;s. There&#x27;s nothing permissionless about bitcoin infrastructure, it requires custodial counterparties to trade hands. ETH and all the many tokens do not. Economics aside, that&#x27;s probably the most bearish development for bitcoin<p>You can turn your nose and say ethereum dapps all have that admin key smell but things like uniswap, starks, the Dai stablecoin, yearn are dope as hell and I&#x27;d think worth a looksie')
