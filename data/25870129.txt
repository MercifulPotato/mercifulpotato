The most money I&#x27;ve ever earned before this is something like $25&#x2F;hr in an internship. They&#x27;re asking me to quote them my monthly rates and I&#x27;m worried about either under-quoting and looking unprofessional or over-charging and looking greedy. The company is European if that matters at all.<p>How much do you all feel would be appropriate &#x2F; non-presumptive to ask for as a student with high subject-expertise and low consultancy experience? Would something like $50&#x2F;hr be crazy high or crazy low?')
