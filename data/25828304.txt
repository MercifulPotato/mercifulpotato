That is the distinct irony of people saying we must control free speech, thought, and information, in order to prevent misinformation from compelling people to violence or what have you. It doesn’t work that way, and it’s openly promoted on this website quite fervently.<p>The only speech that brings people back to the middle, away from the extremes, is free speech and open debate.
