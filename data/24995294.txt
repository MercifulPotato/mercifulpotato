I did a little bit of looking and found a few options like rescuetime but after trying it out I found it was hard to track time because I had to have the application open while using apps&#x2F;software on my laptop and phone. I knew about screen time but was unaware that it was also available on macOS. When I found this out I thought that I had found my solution to tracking my time. However apple screen time lacks a lot of features and is quite limited. For example there is no way to look at weekly or monthly trends, the categories are unable to be changed, and I can&#x27;t access data from more than a month ago. In addition, when I select the metrics for all devices they differ on my iphone and mac. I was hoping that I could just download the data and create a better visualization&#x2F;user interface, however I could not find any easy way to do this. I can&#x27;t think of why Apple would not be able to allow this data to be downloaded if they are not willing to create a better screen time feature. This data should be accessible to the user especially if there are no third party alternatives that can accurately track screen time.')
