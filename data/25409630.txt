It seems a silly expense when they already have a smartphone. At high school in the UK in 1990s we were expected to buy our own calculators. Only primary school had boxes of (non-scientific) calculators.<p>I bought a graphing calculator for A-level maths, but only needed the graphing functionality a handful of times. At university graphing calculators were banned in exams. Only the basic scientific FX-82 was allowed (which cost about Â£15 IIRC.)')
