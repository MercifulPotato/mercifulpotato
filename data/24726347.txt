There is now over 100 days of videos of them attacking federal buildings and lighting the fucking mayor’s condo building on fire. The lasers they are shining into police eyes are powerful enough to ignite a piece of paper. That’s instant permanent eye damage if you get hit. You either have <i>no idea</i> what is actually going on or <i>you’re</i> spreading propaganda. This is a violent unhinged mob of proud antifa anarchists (and before some ignorant person says antifa is “an idea”, Portland antifa has their own website and wikipedia article - look up Rose City Antifa).
