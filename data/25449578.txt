In the initial stages it would essentially be a lottery with better odds than the lottery, but in the later stages it would turn into a system that funnels money into the hands of those who are more mathematically capable and can build better and more accurate models of the dynamics of human hype.<p>Good models of hype is something that I think hasn&#x27;t really been done well yet.
