This means actual privacy and not some bullshit substitution, such as anonymity.  If privacy were really important nothing would ever be anonymous, because you would always want to know who you are speaking to or otherwise deny access to the conversation.<p>* Portability.  Decentralization is too preoccupied with fixed addressing.  If I move my laptop from one building to another the network has either failed to resolve my device or considers it a different&#x2F;new user.  You can have both portability and decentralization.<p>* Services.  There is so much more to a valid social experience than texts, which is 70s era computation.<p>* Control.  End users should have the ability to deny any output, or else this entire conversation about decentralization is moot.<p>* Turing Complete.  The application should be able to build an instance of itself that can then perform an end-to-end self-assessment via test automation upon that instance.')
