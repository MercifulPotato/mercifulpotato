Y’all think that being a launch site for SpaceX, which remains a company with a California headquarters, and a majority California positioned engineering team is hot stuff.  Y’all celebrate how many tech jobs come to Texas when California companies open branch offices for support and secondary roles in your state and crow about how you one upped the Californians as you landed those amazing customer support roles by selling corporations pieces of Texans and the time of your citizens for cheaper.  Then y’all lecture us about how you just got HP’s enterprise spinoff, when we have the actual HP… y’all need to stop claiming to be doing better at areas you’re doing worse on if you want to figure out how to actually do better.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texastribune.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;houston-dallas-bullet-train-permits&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texastribune.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;houston-dallas-bulle...</a>')
