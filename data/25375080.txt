Antitrust overall is a sensible vector of attack. Separating Instagram into a different company could fuck them up.<p>This lawsuit doesn&#x27;t look like the most sensible mode of attack on the company itself though. Oculus is not strategic. They could sell it and it probably wouldn&#x27;t bother them. Its not Instagram.<p>I expect the DOJ is conscious that while their current boss doesn&#x27;t like Facebook, their incoming boss does.<p>So, this appears designed to look aggressive enough to appease Trump while he still has the power to dismiss but toothless enough to fizzle or cause minimal damage once he&#x27;s gone.<p>I&#x27;m half expecting all the tech antitrust lawsuits to just be dropped quietly a month or two after Biden enters office. Either way the tech companies are not really under threat here. Facebook won&#x27;t cry over losing oculus.')
