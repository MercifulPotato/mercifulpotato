But there&#x27;s no loan, so why are you talking about debt? The grandparent comment is talking about online subscriptions. If you stop paying your your subscription, then they&#x27;ll terminate service. Likewise if you stop paying your insurance premium you won&#x27;t be able to file any claims. But unpaid subscriptions don&#x27;t magically become debt.<p>If you don&#x27;t pay your electricity or water bill then that&#x27;s a different story because utilities are not allowed to just stop service for things people&#x27;s lives depend on. But utilities are more heavily regulated than normal subscriptions. For the most part, if a company tries to keep you from terminating a subscription and you say, &quot;well, I&#x27;m not paying anymore. Do you still want to keep providing the service for free?&quot; it&#x27;s an effective way to get them to terminate service.')
