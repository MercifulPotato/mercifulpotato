The two-strap design the author created for the Oculus reminds me of the strap system used for many swimming goggles.<p>I suppose they have some similar problems to solve; with VR the strap is supporting a fairly heavy load hanging in front of the wearer&#x27;s face, which would have a tendency to twist off if not held in place firmly.  Similarly swimming goggles may twist off when diving into the water, if they aren&#x27;t firmly held in place.  Furthermore the &#x27;big hair&#x27; situation seems similar in some ways to the difficulties you can have while wearing a swim cap (with lots of hair under it.)')
