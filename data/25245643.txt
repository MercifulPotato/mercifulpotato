This is not disclaimed clearly.<p>You are starting of by literally the last thing on the video which is the promotion of the uploader&#x27;s income stream, a standard practice for full-time youtubers... to prove what?<p>&gt; The video goes over criticism to the CIA, which are fair enough. But it takes some things as axioms, for example, that only the US are interfering&#x2F;meddling in the world. He presents it as &quot;the US is the bad guy and the world would be fair without the CIA.&quot; Which also is a form of propaganda.<p>There is no such claim in the video. Very dishonest of you to missinform people about it.<p>Apart from that, I agree with your overall conclusion. Youtube is not a public interest organization, they are a private company making money from ads, it is their right to do as they will on their platform. The sooner people realize that, the better. Beyond that, there is an argument here for having transparent practices. There is nothing preventing youtube from saying the truth about what they do.')
