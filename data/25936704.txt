As a junior (or even medior) software engineer no one expects you to be on-call, but as a senior software engineer the story changes dramatically. I have been avoiding being on-call successfully so far, but I don&#x27;t think I can avoid it anymore: my current company is encouraging more and more software engineers to be on-call (paid) and many have accepted already. I have had a couple of job interviews for senior roles and they require on-call availability.<p>I know that the rationale behind being on-call makes totally sense: teams own their products from conception to deployment and are fully responsible for the availability of their products (this nowadays means, 99.99% of the time, that the product has to be online 24h&#x2F;day 365 days&#x2F;year). This encourages teams to write &quot;good code&quot; that has minimum bugs and is performant. I know, it makes sense... but I value much more time than money and I cannot (I don&#x27;t want to) give more than 40h&#x2F;week to my employer. I cannot believe one cannot be a competent and professional senior software engineer without having to do on-calls. I mean, I have a damm master&#x27;s degree in CS and I read dozens of books about programming and software engineering per year; I follow (I try to follow) the best practices and being up-to-date by reading sites like HN, I do side projects and contribute to open source... I just don&#x27;t want to give away my free time just for more money.<p>Anybody else in the same situation?')
