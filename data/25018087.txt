Recounts have never moved a state election more than a thousand votes that I am aware of and Trump is behind by tens of thousands in the states that matter.  Lawsuits won&#x27;t do anything, because no on has standing to prevent someone else from legitimately voting according to the rules in place at the time of election, nor of preventing someone else from counting those votes as legally mandated.<p>Trump lost, get over it.')
