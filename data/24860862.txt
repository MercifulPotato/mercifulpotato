And you can set more things, like shutter speed, instead of having it all be automatic.<p>You also get features like a live histogram and focus peaking that can help when shooting even if you aren&#x27;t going to edit it afterward.<p>Can&#x27;t try the new version yet because of an update bug, but I like the old version a lot.')
