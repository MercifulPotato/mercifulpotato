Then you have people using nested for loops where a dictionary would do to look it up.<p>Things like this, in the same language and same framework, make things on average faster, and simpler.<p>And if that piece of badly architected code is fragile and breaks on every change, you will stop trying to find even the low hanging fruit of optimizations that usually pay off, because every change affects multiple different files and you have no tests to see quickly if it still works.')
