Usually they&#x27;re quite prose-heavy, and require a lot of linguistic parsing before you start to get the meaning out of them.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to think about, and makes me suspect that this is why I tend to prefer writing my own recipes out as tersely as possible, particularly if I know the general procedure. At this point I don&#x27;t need to be told to preheat an oven or to scrape down the sides of the stand mixer, so I&#x27;ll just write down things like &quot;Creaming method, 350Â° in 8x8 cake pan.&quot; I might even start writing them in pseudocode now.<p>My partner takes it a step further with her cranberry sauce recipe; the instructions just say &quot;C&#x27;mon.&quot;')
