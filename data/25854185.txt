A law has been passed in Russia (effective since April 1) that requires certain apps to be pre-installed on all smartphones that are sold or imported, and some of them (e.g. for the Wink streaming media service) are simply not available for desktop linux. Therefore, if the phone arrives later, the customs will turn the phone back and apply charges against me for an attempted smuggling. So unless they can ensure that it arrives earlier, I have to ask for a refund.')
