Assume that people try to self-quarantine as soon as they notice symptoms.  (They don&#x27;t need to be 100% effective at this.)  Consider &quot;mutations that affect how quickly it spreads within your body&quot;.  Those that increase said efficiency would presumably increase the likelihood of death; but they would also probably shorten the &quot;asymptomatic spreading&quot; period, which means they&#x27;d get selected against; this selection happens even among those that aren&#x27;t dying.<p>(Author background disclaimer: No biology beyond 9th grade.)')
