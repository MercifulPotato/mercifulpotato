They spied on US lawmakers, tortured, manufactured evidence... I find it hard to believe they WOULDN&#x27;T meddle in this case.<p>&gt;  Obama&#x27;s DoJ apparently decided not to pursue the case, why would we expect Biden&#x27;s DoJ to come to a different conclusion?<p>Because post 2016 election the Democrats are no friends of Assange and WiliLeaks, regardless of the implications for press freedom.')
