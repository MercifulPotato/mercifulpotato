I can&#x27;t answer a question directly when you don&#x27;t ask it directly. At least Grustaf and I have the fortitude to post with an account that wasn&#x27;t created on the same day as the comment. Grustaf didn&#x27;t address my question about high school directly, but zacmcloud, feel free to post a direct question to me and I&#x27;ll reply. I can&#x27;t read your mind, but your framing doesn&#x27;t seem to match Grustaf in any meaningful way. If anything, Grustaf and I are finding a narrowing spectrum of disagreement, whereas your post is mostly a trite argument made against corporate PR of all kinds.')
