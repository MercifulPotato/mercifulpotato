I am used to being around folks that know my deal, and am sometimes too casual in my interactions.<p>I suspect that we&#x27;d probably get along, IRL. I got a gander at your site, and it seems that we have a hardware interaction background.<p>I&#x27;m deliberately trying to reduce my scope. I worked for many years in a fairly major-league Japanese corporation, as part of a big, distributed team. The company was a hardware company, so a lot of our software was designed to either play with, or be embedded in, hardware.<p>Nowadays, I like to try keeping it to apps for Apple devices. My apps tend to be a fair bit more ambitious than you&#x27;d normally see from a one-man shop, but they are still fairly humble, compared to what our teams worked on.<p>However, I feel that the <i>quality</i> of what I do is better than before; mostly because of my craftsman approach. If you knew the company I worked for, you&#x27;d find that ironic.')
