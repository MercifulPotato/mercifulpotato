The two analog sticks on the GC controller would be an improvement over the single stick on the N64 controller for movement in 3D. I think that the main benefit of the N64 controller (besides a nostalgia factor, though that may just be me ;)) is how easy it is to connect. I actually just got some wire from the local hardware store, plugged pieces of it into the controller connector, and then attached some IC clips. For the GC controller, things are a bit trickier due to its connector layout, though I just found [1] which might be a nice solution; alternatively, buying a GC controller extension cord and wire stripping could be an option. I&#x27;ll consider it!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raphnet-tech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;gc_controller_connector&#x2F;index.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raphnet-tech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;gc_controller_connecto...</a>')
