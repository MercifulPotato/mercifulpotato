Even in Winston-Salem, NC where I live at &quot;Compare Foods&quot; supermarket.  It&#x27;s called &quot;Jugo de Marañón&quot; (juice of cashew).<p>I got in trouble in first grade in Rio de Janeiro (Our Lady of Mercy school).  I didn&#x27;t understand the concept of having to &quot;stay inside the premises&quot;.  For the first few days I wandered, unknowingly, outside the lower-elementary area, outside the upper-elementary area, outside the high school area.  I found the street vendor and bought a hot dog and a &quot;refresco de caju&quot; (cashew drink) those first several days.  A nun caught my innocent act and no more hot dogs and caju for lunch.')
