It&#x27;s not like the Covid situation in the USA is because of infected people crossing the border illegally: it happened because of legal travel.<p>Trump&#x27;s so-called China ban was a farce. It didn&#x27;t stop USA residents from flying into the USA, it didn&#x27;t even stop the immediate family of residents from flying to the USA.<p>Australia closed all travel from China initially and later from everywhere else in the world. There&#x27;s plenty of room for criticism as they also stopped Australians from returning home, but the results are tough to argue with.')
