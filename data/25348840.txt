There are lot of home routers that have started integrating that feature natively.  A few examples that I know off hand:<p>- Motorola MH7022<p>- Eero<p>- Disney Circle<p>Basically any of them that say &quot;content filtering&quot; in their product sheet are using DNS level filtering.<p>&gt; ...the trash resolver of their operating system...<p>I&#x27;m very curious why you think the well tested, vetted, and constantly updated resolvers built into OS&#x27;s are &quot;trash&quot;. Is it just because most don&#x27;t have support for DoH or DoT?')
