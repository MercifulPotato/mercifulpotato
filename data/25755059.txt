The voters were told that the winning party&#x27;s candidate would be the commission president. Now von der Leyen is. She did not run in the election.<p>Well, this is true for prime minister posts in most parliamentary democracies. The winner is not the leader of plurality-winning party, but one who can get majority support in parliament.<p>Usually it is the same person, but EP is too disintegrated for that (many small parties with only token loyality to party blocs), so plurality winner failed to get majority support. Had MEPs forged majority coalition, they would have rejected EC offer and have forced their commission president.')
