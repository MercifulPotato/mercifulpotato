Not having to ask &quot;what&#x27;s your WiFi password?&quot; again will be huge and people will trust Apple more than Google&#x2F;MS with an always-connected system.<p>Crazy future talk but you can imagine an &quot;Apple Air&quot; or a name like that which is a mesh network provided by Apple devices with partnerships from various ISPs and network providers. It will both provide a simple experience for their users and increase pressure to adopt their products in most urban areas.<p>The world of eSIMs abstracts cell providers away from users since like Google Fi, apple will switch you to whatever is strongest on your area.')
