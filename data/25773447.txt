Item(by='pm90', descendants=None, kids=[25773470], score=None, time=1610610859, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25773264, text='&gt; But I would want to point out the curious phrasing and of your first paragraph and what that says about USA way of thinking. All these points are business targeted while all european points are individual targeted.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is anything curious about this way of thinking. And US hegemony plays directly into this!<p>Pre-World Wars, European nations had their colonies and their militaries and the priority of thinking was along similar lines: access to expansive markets, large pools of labor, protection of business interests etc, chiefly through colonies.<p>WW2 changed all of that, reducing European nations to client states (no disrespect) of the US, that funded their reconstruction. Colonialism was no longer allowed, and European nations could not freely pursue foreign markets without competing with US companies, which would always get precedence. With no real way to compete with the US militarily, and with NATO aligning with their immediate geo-political needs anyways, European nations invested heavily on Social Services, rather than blow up their military budgets. This geopolitical equation hasn&#x27;t changed post WW2 and you have generations of people that consider social services as the primary function of their Government.<p>However, its a fundamental mistake to assume that a Government can provide effective social services without having a strong economy. Strong economies require successful businesses.')
