Lower land value taxes incentivize constructing more modest apartment buildings, as those will now be profitable. This process continues until housing supply meets demand.<p>Also many people prefer living in single-family houses. The bay area is full of people who won&#x27;t sell their single-family house even though the value has gone up 20x. They wouldn&#x27;t abandon their properties unless they had to. And if they have to it means they can sell them for a lot to a developer who will profitably build an apartment.')
