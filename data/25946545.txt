We don&#x27;t learn from our mistakes, and it becomes normal to have these cycles of collapse then build back. These cycles are caused by interest&#x2F;usury being at the core that drives the system (why did the government move away from the gold standard? because they want to be able to print their way out of their usurious debts, it&#x27;s all related).<p>Look up Iraq during Umar II&#x27;s rule, how there were no people left to take Zakat because there was a proper economic system.')
