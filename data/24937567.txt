When the telephone system was originally a monopoly (or even today) imagine if the phone company had started disconnecting lines or censoring calls? Alexander Graham Bell would&#x27;ve been hanged from the nearest tree.<p>But if you want to use a TV Network analogy it&#x27;s not like canceling an Anchor, it&#x27;s like canceling a &#x27;viewer&#x27;. It would be like if CNN had the power to stop any individual from either consuming CNN content or creating CNN content. Total Godlike control over the individual.')
