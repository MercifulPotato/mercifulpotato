In Jersey, Luxembourg or the like. You pay a lawyer who already does this for many funds to administer yours.<p>You then either rent the house from the trust for a minimal amount, or the trust lets you stay there rent-free as a guest. This is also how many of the wealthy get around inheritance tax. When you cash in your chips your will appoints your offspring&#x2F;significant other as the primary beneficiary and the wheel keeps turning.<p>As with all things in life knowing the thing is often the hard part. Most of us don&#x27;t know what questions to ask.')
