For example while the Fed isn&#x27;t buying public company equity directly yet, the bond market provides a transmission mechanism for a company to create otherwise worthless or at least discounted equity and sell it at face value to the Fed. Sure from a balance sheet perspective it all balances, because that&#x27;s how bookkeeping works, but as a practical matter it means more money available to the private sector.')
