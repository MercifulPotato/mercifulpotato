Something you are is a form of authentication that only <i>you</i> can use. Your face, fingerprints, blood, retinas are all public but try as you might you can&#x27;t make another living human with the same features.<p>If your view of fingerprint auth is &quot;a picture of your face is the password&quot; then of course it sounds stupid. It&#x27;s actually &quot;a face with the correct features attached to an alive human&quot; which is much harder to fake.<p>The whole point of biometric auth and all the advancements in the industry are about correctly identifying alive humans and the strength of any system that uses biometrics is directly related to that. You can say current systems aren&#x27;t good enough at this yet for your personal thread models but it&#x27;s real security, and beats the hell out of a 4&#x2F;5 digit lock screen passcode.')
