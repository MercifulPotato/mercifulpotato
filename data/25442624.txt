Also your local library has a selection of DVDs. I was just at mine yesterday and I saw lots of titles that aren&#x27;t available to stream on any of the big subscription platforms.<p>Plex doesn&#x27;t even require an NAS. I run mine off an old laptop. 100gb of storage is plenty if you have a DVD or are willing to burn one, since you don&#x27;t need to keep stuff you don&#x27;t watch in your library if it&#x27;s backed up to optical media.')
