No one is saying that the only two investment options are Bitcoin and stock. There are literally millions of other investment vehicles, from real estate to cattle to Legos.<p>You also have to acknowledge that most people don&#x27;t pick stocks. They have exposure to the stock market indirectly through pension funds, or they manage their retirement funds by investing in ETFs.<p>If your ETF is sufficiently broad, you&#x27;re not really betting on a single thing. Buying crypto is betting on the liquidity of that coin (or equity in a company or whatever the coin was made to track).<p>Buying a stock is betting on the dividends of that stock.<p>Buying industry-wide or nationwide index funds is betting on the long-term stability of society. If that society crashes (due to war, a pandemic, or climate change), you&#x27;re probably screwed anyway because, well, your entire society has crashed.<p>Perhaps you could argue that investing in crypto is the opposite bet -- that society <i>will</i> crash in our lifetimes -- but it seems unpalatable to most people to bet on a Mad Max-like future for themselves at an old age and for their children.')
