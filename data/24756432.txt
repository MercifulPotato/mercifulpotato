Most of it is dismissed as mass hysteria, rather than investigated to determine if that assumption is true.<p>That said, it’s not exactly a phenomenon that can easily be studied - the results are not repeatable. As Carl Sagan said, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.<p>I think we need to stop calling it a conspiracy theory, and instead call it just a theory.
