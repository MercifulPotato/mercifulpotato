In these approaches that don&#x27;t explain the grammar at all, you need to spend effort pattern matching to pick up the right grammatical rules to construct your own sentences, and you are never sure that you&#x27;re doing the right thing.<p>For example, in 猿はバナナを食べる, how should I understand what は and を <i>mean</i>? When should I use them? I can more or less easily understand that 猿 means monkey, バナナ means banana, and 食べる is related to eating. But to understand that は indicates the topic and を indicates that the word before is having an action done to them, I would have to see a LOT of examples.<p>I think a little grammatical explanation goes a very long way in terms of the number of examples you have to show.')
