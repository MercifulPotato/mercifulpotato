Instead of using system colors devs often hard-code a custom look.<p>After years of using MacOS, I made a commitment this year to use, support, and develop for Linux on a regular basis.<p>Starting off with little knowledge of GTK, I progressed from &quot;hello world&quot; to working on my first app, but end user customization has always been close to my heart, so naturally I started looking at what it takes to bring a GTK desktop app from &quot;stock system UI&quot; to &quot;developer and user themable&quot;.<p>All this to say, it could be my inexperience, but I&#x27;m finding that GTK seems to be very much &quot;all or nothing&quot; here. I can use all the default widgets and be 100% native, and I can &quot;* { background-color: pink; }&quot; my way into a blank canvas, but if I want to make custom controls that build on the user&#x27;s system theme and whatever accessibility he&#x2F;she has set up for him&#x2F;herself, I&#x27;m on my own to make my best guesses.<p>There&#x27;s no reliable way to determine whether the user is scaling text, using a dark or light theme, or something super high contrast for accessibility. I can try to query some built in widgets and make decisions from there, but I&#x27;ve found that quite flaky as well.<p>Moreover, even finding which classes to assign to widgets to &quot;piggy back&quot; off the common system colors when building my own widgets is a chore of hunting through themes like Adwaita to find the piece of the system widget I&#x27;m trying to utilize. It&#x27;s not quite WPF &quot;copy the entire widget&#x27;s XML and re-implement it from scratch to customize it&quot; bad, but for as powerful as the CSS support seems to be in GTK, it feels like there&#x27;s a layer in between &quot;full system UI&quot; and &quot;total rebrand&quot; that&#x27;s missing.')
