I am not speaking to that other than the public appears to find that equitable.<p>Now, these moves to censor and manage the political dialog have broken that trust, and with that goes the loss of perception of equity, or value.  That could be a very costly and litigious change of opinion.<p>And here we are today, beginning to see that change play out.<p>Frankly, being a product vs a platform is a part of that discussion.<p>Partisan politics is another concern.  People are talking about how say, FB aligns with the right, Twitter with the left, and so on.<p>I submit that won&#x27;t work and either we make it work and honor the Constitution and the idea of free speech, or we lose that idea and or see growing conflict that adds value to no one.')
