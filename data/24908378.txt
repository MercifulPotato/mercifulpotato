This ambiguity doesn&#x27;t really matter for the purposes of burn correction - you need to get to the correct reentry trajectory no matter what caused the deviation - but your sample mass estimate may be off.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a whole lot of utility in knowing the sample mass, as long as you&#x27;ve got enough (and they&#x27;ve definitely got enough!), it would just help satiate the curiosity of the scientists and engineers who otherwise have to wait a few more years to see their results.')
