I hope this gets traction. But I noticed that you serve 450KB of JS on initial load. This is not required at all for a site with such a minimal design and a single list. Ideally this site should be less than 10kb in total with no js and atomic css. This is loading slow even in desktop. The app loads first and the &#x2F;posts API response takes a lot of time to load. It could be server rendered for the initial load and served from a CDN.')
