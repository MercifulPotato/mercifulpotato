Kinda regretted upgrading from the outright simplicity of the Wii.\nGamecube games on the gamepad was about as close to a mindblowing moment in emulation that I&#x27;ve had since I got a PSP in 2006 that played PS1 games as well as my (admittedly terrible) PC.<p>and it was nowhere near as bad as the PS3 though, found CFW on that an absolute misery to the point it was probably a net negative for me ever doing it. Still pull it out for some 3D projector stuff occasionally but... man, so much hassle.')
