Almost daily in Java, Objective C, and C++ (Yes, I work actively on all three languages these months).<p>90% of the time I compile one file (the one I just changed) and then I link. Linking is not parallel and it takes about 4-15 seconds (dep. on the project&#x2F;lang.).<p>I use an i9 with 8 cores, but I suspect that a CPU with fewer cores, that go really fast for seconds before throttling would be quite good for most of what I do during the day. Including testing+debugging the executable.<p>Recompiling everything takes minutes. It happens maybe once per hour, and I often combine the recompile with a coffee-break. So since it happens rarely it doesn&#x27;t matter if that takes 0.5-5 minutes (dep. on project).<p>I don&#x27;t mind waiting for the recompile, but I hate changing a few lines, compiling, waiting for 20 seconds, and then testing. I find that hose medium length waits destroy flow and creativity during the day.<p>I would definitely prefer fast single-file compilation + linking + testing, over fast full project recompiles.<p>In summary, I think these M1 devices will actually be great for developers using compiled languages.')
