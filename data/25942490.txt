Also all-around bad performance. Maybe it&#x27;s improved since I last used it a year ago, but it was so infuriatingly buggy for such a long time that I&#x27;m just not willing to give them another chance. Especially when Sidebery just works (99% of the time) and it&#x27;s more performant than TST ever was.')
