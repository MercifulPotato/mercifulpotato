But this sort of thing takes decades of effort, and trillions of dollars of capital investment.<p>The same way that it&#x27;s been the year of Linux on the desktop [2] (for the past 20 years), every year has been the year of the EV. It&#x27;s going to happen someday [3], but it&#x27;s not going to happen <i>quickly</i>.<p>[1] When I did drive to my workplace at a fabulously wealthy tech company, it had <i>twelve</i> charging stations in a five-hundred vehicle parking lot. You look at that, and then tell me if EVs are ready for prime-time.<p>[2] Ironically, we&#x27;ve long hit, and passed the point where we hit the year of Linux in the car.<p>[3] Unless climate change (likely) or nuclear war (less likely) wrecks our civilization first.')
