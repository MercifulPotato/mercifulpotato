Firefox was just a faster, and better experience.<p>Chrome is handicapped by the need to support Google&#x27;s ad business. Open-source, and potentially freemium browsers do not have this limitation.  Non-google browsers can block most trackers, auto-fill privacy settings to be the best for the customer and hell, maybe even auto-deny cookies for websites that function fine without them.<p>This makes the internet noticeably faster, but the con is that there is more browser lock-in than before due to features like stored passwords, credit cards, search suggestions and other tedious to enter information.')
