Your email might not work anymore, like any other services within Google. But authorization does. That it does not, is an implementation detail.<p>2) Since internally i have created an account, that is only linked to your Google account, i can always allow you to also login via any other method. Maybe with your facebook account.<p>3) I think, things will become better. You use your devices to authorize yourself. And i then trust your device. Then there is no 3rd party involved anymore.')
