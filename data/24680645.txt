You&#x27;re also pointing to the report as an authority on the domain, but while it is an interesting document to start a discussion it isn&#x27;t in itself something that dictates what is useful or not.<p>The reason to standardize European English would be to give the 400+ millions people living in the EU a common, shared language they could identify with. These people already use in their daily life a form of English that doesn&#x27;t follow US or UK standards. It is obviously understandable by citizens, otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it. They are right now using this weird, bastardized version of English to do business, communicate with friends, with their families, etc. This European English is already a de-facto language used for communication between EU citizens. Instead of telling them to correct their use of the language because it fails to follow British standards, I would like this distinct form of English, as it is practiced, to be recognized.<p>And if that offenses British English speakers, then that&#x27;s fine, they will adapt the same way they already do.')
