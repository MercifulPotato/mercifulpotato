I guess it depends on how you define overhead, but if you compile a program that does not use exceptions with exceptions on, it will run slower if you benchmark it. That being said, I do use exceptions and think they&#x27;re obviously worth it, but there is an overhead to them, even if it&#x27;s not as simple as &quot;x additional instructions are executed&quot;')
