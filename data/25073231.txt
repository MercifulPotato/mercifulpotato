I&#x27;m now a Clojure programmer, so I totally understand the importance of a tight feedback loop. I guess in 2005 Lisp would have still been considered too &quot;different&quot; even though it had a longer history of backend development compared to JavaScript and an even tighter loop?<p>I&#x27;d be very interested in an origin story. The emphasis on tight feedback loop is very novel for the time I feel, over going with Java for example, which could have been a middleground between feedback loop and type safety with much more tooling available at the time. And now with bringing types back in, slowing down the build times again, hurting the feedback loop, but it seems safety has now been favored over it, was it a change of heart, what lead to that?<p>Anyways I&#x27;ll patiently await a maybe blog post about it :)<p>Thanks for the right up here, was very fascinating.')
