Should a person who literally lived next door to the office then be paid the same because they saved less on commuting? What if I “work from home” but actually choose to commute to work from a storage facility on the other side of town?<p>No. Commuting is irrelevant to the cost because it’s unrelated to the work or the cost of doing business.<p>The cost of utilities not required on site is a literal and measurable saving for the business. That cost is directly transferred to the employee.')
