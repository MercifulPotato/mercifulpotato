For us we can only really see footage and pictures a little over a century in the past (and exponentially more as we near the present) but 2000 years from now, should humanity make it that far, people will be able to watch some of your tiktok videos. They&#x27;ll even probably be able to read this very comment (modulo some translation software probably).<p>Can you imagine if we could watch millions and millions of hours of romans doing mundane things? Of vikings giving cooking tips? Of ancient mesopothamians freestyling on some ancient instruments? Our vision of the past would be radically different I think. We&#x27;re at the beginning of an entirely new era of human history, where future humans will be able to analyse the most mundane aspects of our existences documented thoroughly online.<p>I wonder how it&#x27;s going to influence languages and cultures. Can you imagine following a video of a recipe recorded 700 years ago for instance? That&#x27;d be wild, yet it&#x27;s probably going to become commonplace in the future.<p>Meanwhile I feel weird watching century old photos and videos because I can&#x27;t help thinking &quot;everybody I see here is now dead&quot;.')
