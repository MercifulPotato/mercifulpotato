The IFR has trended downwards fairly dramatically over time - it&#x27;s the rapidity and novelty of the spread which is driving deaths in an extremely (and I don&#x27;t use that word lightly, it is extreme) stratified by age manner.<p>If the vaccine doesn&#x27;t work, you&#x27;d seriously never consider going back to normal <i>ever</i>, in your entire lifetime? That&#x27;s absurd.<p>It&#x27;s rather concerning that people like you are pinning all your hopes on a vaccine. I don&#x27;t know about you, but at some point living a life with such restrictions and a complete halt or threat to halt many of the things that make life interesting becomes a trade-off that&#x27;s not worth making. If a vaccine does not work to protect the elderly particularly well, would you seriously be willing to close international borders for the next 5-10 years, for example? Even worse, since there&#x27;s zero endpoint to anything if you are unwilling to tolerate life as normal without a vaccine, why not just extend all restrictions indefinitely?')
