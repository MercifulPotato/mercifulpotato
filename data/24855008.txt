I can really relate to this journey. Lost my brother to Colorectal cancer 2.5 years back, he was 27 at the time. What happened with Boseman happened with us 15 years earlier(Stage III transitioning to IV). We didn&#x27;t have any family history of cancer. He was wild type for all kind of known mutations (KRAS, NRAS and BRAF) for the cancer. In simple terms, doctors didn&#x27;t know what exactly caused his cancer.<p>I&#x27;m also at a good risk of getting it at some point probably. I&#x27;m 23 rn, last colonoscopy didn&#x27;t show any polyps fortunately. Trying to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle. Every cancer writeup is kinda scary for me.<p>At the time of diagnosis, my brother was going through stressful situations(his startup, personal life), not able to focus much on physical and mental health. I&#x27;d like to know if Chris thinks there was something else that triggered&#x2F;fueled his cancer apart from genetics.')
