Item(by='terwey', descendants=None, kids=[25772829, 25770446], score=None, time=1610586411, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25770209, text='Denmark and the Netherlands have the highest income tax bracket at 52&#x2F;53%. Germany is 43%. However they are stacked taxes.<p>In Germany (where I reside), the first â‚¬9744 (2021) is untaxed, then 14% until a certain amount (can&#x27;t find it atm) and max 43%. However, if you do your tax returns your effective tax rate will drop significantly.\nI&#x27;d wager that most pay around 25% in total income taxes, excluding things like the health insurance and other taxes.<p>However, we indeed do not worry about saving up money to put our kids through school.<p>Earning 65k which what most companies in the tech scene now offer to lure them in as a SWE in Germany is a great salary realistically, considering for example an architect with a masters degree will earn around 55k and no real improvement in sight.<p>Also don&#x27;t forget to factor in that the concept of being fired for PROPER reason is nearly impossible in most European countries. Even if an employer hits hard times they cannot just lay off an entire department to quickly green out the numbers in the books, there needs to be proper grounds. I currently need to give my employer 3 months notice before I can even leave, same goes for them to me.')
