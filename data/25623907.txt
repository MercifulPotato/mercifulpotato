One price for locals, and another price for tourists. The latter is typically 10x as much as the local price, but does not confer much (if any at all) additional privileges or facilities.<p>Indonesia has a similar policy—higher prices for foreign tourists—but when I visited Borobudur and Prambanan I was pleasantly surprised to see that the higher price I paid did buy me extra amenities: a separate entrance point and some refreshments. Sure, the Indonesians came out better from that deal, but at least I didn&#x27;t feel ripped off.')
