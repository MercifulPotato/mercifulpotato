Hell you can experience much of the same in any size corporation and even have them within your own business inadvertently.<p>However I found that working for a Fortune 500 company to be both rewarding and comforting. I have been doing it for over two decades. I see the winds of change all the time but I also see incredible people I would have never met otherwise, new technologies that only were present because being so large we had teams for everything, and the opportunities expanded when working with large vendors who did not just ignore us or take us for granted.<p>Are there issues working in a company which probably lost more in a backroom than they pay you.

Here are countless agencies and officials who supposedly are there to look out for you and all the others but no one actually holds them to that. You can try but you are not going to get far. Hiding behind Sovereign Immunity and even Qualified Immunity; which applies to all officials not just police; when they do something wrong or even illegal. Play side games with grant money to fund each other or writing contracts to hire friends and family for big money.
