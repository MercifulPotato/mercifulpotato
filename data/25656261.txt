Why would I help someone make my life, and life of other people like me, worse?<p>The answer to that is to beat advertising down until it isn&#x27;t so blatantly customer-hostile. Then people may be more willing to help.<p>* I&#x27;m in a politically precarious situation and the government is asking questions - ostensibly for purposes that could benefit me, but if my honest answers were seen by a different government agency, it would cause me a world of hurt. I hide away. Or lie.<p>The answer to that is ideally to fix the politically precarious situation of a subset of your population - but at the very least, to foster the trust in information separation between government agencies, so that I can e.g. afford to be honest with the census bureau without worrying about the IRS or the police. That level of trust is not the default.')
