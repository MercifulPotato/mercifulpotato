The economy, society, relationships, nature, traffic.\nYou don&#x27;t need math to reverse engineer a system. You just need to pay attention to it. You can say the right words to make a date happy. You can figure out which lane is the fastest route, better than Google Maps can. You don&#x27;t need an app or data - your brain is a wonderful data processing machine.</i><p>&lt;snip&gt;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22043088" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22043088</a>')
