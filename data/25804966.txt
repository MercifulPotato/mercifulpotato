I suspect that they could have increased subscriptions by a large amount, but there were PR disasters all over the place. I suspect that a number of people decided not to move because of how things were handled. Or at least the appearance that Spotify might ban or censor Rogan&#x27;s podcast.<p>Right when the biggest hype for this acquisition was happening, all of the PR was negative. I wonder if as things cool off and no other issues occur, Joe Rogan fans will slowly move over, but time will tell.')
