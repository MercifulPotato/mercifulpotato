I no longer believe that because universally everyone who cares strongly about it is actually using it as cover for pushing opinions they don&#x27;t like out of public discourse. If that&#x27;s the result of free speech advocacy, then I don&#x27;t see how I can conclude that it&#x27;s good for society.')
