It means that Facebook is pro-beheading?<p>So how come if the US government doesn&#x27;t censor it, it doesn&#x27;t make the US a pro-beheading country? Empirically, compared to other countries the US manages to be pretty anti-beheading despite tolerating speech about beheading.<p>Do you think that any failure to censor speech constitutes an endorsement of that speech? Is it not possible to allow speech you disagree with? Does Facebook the company have to endorse every opinion someone posts on it?')
