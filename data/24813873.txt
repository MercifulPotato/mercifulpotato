I advice you to start attending gatherings where you are likely to meet C level managers. Basically,  high level pay is very influenced by who you know.<p>Where I used to work we had a consultant that did specific projects on behalf of the board of directors that had been their for years. She was recommended to or board by someone in another board. I don&#x27;t know how much she was paid but I suspect it was in the hundreds per hour. Not only that, she had a lot of power. Anything she wanted she got right away from any department. All the managers wanted to be sure she was kept happy.')
