Some people just have zero clue. They just don&#x27;t have self awareness of a good set of internal metrics on how to perform. These are almost always people that had flags when we hired them but we were hiring fast for a role and brought them in.<p>2. As a manager I didn&#x27;t give hard feedback early on. It is difficult, especially with people with potential to give that hard feedback (you&#x27;re moving too slowly, this isn&#x27;t up to snuff). I&#x27;ve had to do hard corrections later on that could have been solved if I had stepped up and spent the time early on to say hey this needs to be better and how.<p>Also, underinvesting in promising talent is a huge problem at startups. You often have first time managers or execs who are managing way too many people. So potential leaders don&#x27;t get the mentorship they need. Given that attracting new, good talent can cost tens of thousands of $s in time and recruiting costs, it is a smart move to put money into leveling up and retaining people! Find them mentors outside the company (YC has a great community for this, as do other VC funds and industry groups), pay for coaching, or find a mentor in the company that has more time. It really pays off.')
