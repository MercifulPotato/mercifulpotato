Item(by='buran77', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608291230, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25465738, text='&gt; the only reason the fees are that high is because Apple owns both the market and the only player<p>The fact that Google enforces the same fees while allowing competing app stores and varied OEMs access to that market paints a different conclusion than yours.<p>I agree with the &quot;free market&quot; point but in reality the market is just about as free as the biggest players (with the most capital, whatever that may represent) allow it to be. Sure, consumers have the same power as a whole to sway the market. Unfortunately it&#x27;s fragmented among billions of people all veering in their own direction, uncoordinated. On the other side the power is concentrated with a few big players who just happen to have more or less the same goals and aim to achieve them almost single-mindedly.<p>And unfortunately the free market comes at a cost even when it works: a sort of dictatorship of the majority. The free market will want cheaper and will accept the compromise of paying in other ways. You don&#x27;t get something for nothing and since laws aren&#x27;t keeping up with this it&#x27;s up to the tech giants to police themselves. You pay with money and with your data, the ratio is up to each company.<p>The reason this works to to the user&#x27;s advantage (read: more money - less data) with Apple is because they saw the business opportunity of this policing. They wanted to compete with Google and Facebook at their own game but had to admit defeat so they realized a much better business model is to position themselves as the antithesis of those and cater to a different market Google and FB cannot target, by design.<p>There probably are ways in which Apple can open up the store and still retain control on what is allowed or monetize on that but make no mistake, if an app is present on Apple&#x27;s (spun out?) app store for $1 but free of any shady data collection, and also present on the Apps&#x27;R&#x27;Us store for $0 but encrusted with data collection modules we all know what most users will pick.')
