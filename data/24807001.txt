Even without the diffusion layers I added, LCD displays are not really transparent. They block a lot of light due to the pair of polarizes on either side of a panel. I found that the term &quot;transparent LCD&quot; was used in industry wherever people use LCD panels without a blocking backer, so I used this term also.')
