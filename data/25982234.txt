America has tons of really high-level aptitude migrants, Germany doesn&#x27;t quite have that.<p>With respect to &#x27;glass ceilings&#x27; - it&#x27;s more complicated.<p>As a resident of Germany for some time, as an outsider ... I would have expected to be promoted well enough if I was materially &#x27;that much better&#x27;, but frankly, not otherwise.<p>I actually accepted the fact that &#x27;this is a German company, it&#x27;s going to be run by Germans&#x27;.<p>I was in France I felt the same way.<p>I don&#x27;t believe in the notion that a random person from country XYZ has the &#x27;right&#x27; to be an executive for example at a local company.<p>Definitely treated with respect and not face racism, definitely promoted rank and file based mostly on performance, definitely the same material, legal rights - but beyond that ... I always felt &#x27;it was their country, not really mine&#x27;.<p>Also, there are quite a number of these countries run by foreign nationals anyhow, it&#x27;s just not quite as common as in the US.')
