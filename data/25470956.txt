And it&#x27;s not necessary to know people to get great jobs, but I feel like it helps; 4 of the 6 jobs I&#x27;ve had came about through my undergrad network. One of them, as a founder, was partially funded by a prof. I met as an undergrad. My undergrad department helped my education and career in various ways including giving me a scholarship and RA and TA work, and publishing articles about me after graduating.<p>I am not an average case, partly because I went to graduate school, but for me it&#x27;s safe to say the value of the credential part of my undergrad degree is somewhere near zero. Definitely not zero, but I&#x27;ve never needed the credential for anything but passing the checklist of requirements for my first job. The value I got from my time spent in the 4 year degree is almost entirely from the relationships I formed.')
