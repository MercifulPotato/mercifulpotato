I would hate to have to travel every day to an office but I like the occasional visit.<p>I get enough interaction with my family and friends (current COVID restrictions not withstanding ofc) but I have a separate room upstairs where I work so I don&#x27;t have to sit in the kitchen.<p>It&#x27;s horses for courses imo... the future needs to be flexibility-based.')
