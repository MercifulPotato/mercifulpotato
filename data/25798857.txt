Many people only renew once dns stops resolving. I&#x27;ve seen govt agencies use this as their reminder to renew.<p>And yes, many scammers out there send postcards to businesses offering to assist for $1,000 on the renewals - and many people pay. So people do send out &quot;alerts&quot; the way you ask - most commonly exploitive and at least I give the advice to ignore ALL such renewal alerts. If you are telling people to respond to those you are sending people down scam ally.')
