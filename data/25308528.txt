Germany is again, here, a salient example.<p>I didn’t write “if we don&#x27;t let them treat people bad, they&#x27;ll make it even worse than we already helped them make it that.”  My example was intended to show that capital does go to wherever it’s cheapest, whether it be labor costs, lack of environmental regulations, etc.<p>&gt; You keep insisting this without providing evidence of its reality. What major worker protections have been advanced and put into law by Democrats since the Obama presidency?<p>The proof is that the Democratic states on the west and northeast coasts and Illinois have passed laws requiring mandatory sick days, family leave acts, higher minimum wages, better unemployment benefits, etc. (including since Obama, even though that’s irrelevant).<p>Just because Democrats in the federal legislature have to play a different game doesn’t mean the state level ones aren’t able to get anything done.<p>Lest we get off track, if you go back to the beginning of this discussion, my contention is that Democrats have done a better job enacting legislation to protect workers, especially lower income workers, than Republicans.  The proof is all the states that have better worker protections, did it with Democrat legislatures.  What happens on the federal level may or may not matter, but Democrats haven’t had solid control of Congress for a long time, and with the little control they did, they managed to pass ACA, which is still at least something for poorer people, especially workers, and which  Republicans continue to fight.')
