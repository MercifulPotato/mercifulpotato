I have a 3.5 year old daughter now and if she later wants to become a prostitute or work in porn, I&#x27;d support her. There are some people that really enjoy this kind of work, for example check out this interview with Lisa Ann [0] ... she really enjoyed her work in porn but was very careful to not catch diseases and it was always a worry for her.<p>But if my daughter would consider one of those jobs, I would make sure she would be very aware of the risks and I&#x27;m not just talking about the STDs. I&#x27;d make her aware that it could be extremely hard to find a different job, especially after a career in porn. And also, if my daughter would get children of her own, children could be bullied if they discover their mother worked in porn.<p>Also, it does seem a lot of actors and actresses in porn are from broken families and that is kind of sad.<p>---<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZPT1TKFmv_o" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZPT1TKFmv_o</a>')
