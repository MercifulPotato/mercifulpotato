Item(by='sidpatil', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608925454, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25531111, text='&gt; &quot;How do you know what files are directories?&quot;<p>`ls -F` helps with this on terminals without color.<p>&gt; &quot;I feel like I am inside a coat closet!&quot;<p>Some terminals do offer higher character resolutions than 80-by-25.<p>&gt; Sad because my memories of how great it was to have a terminal that could do line insert so when editing files over a 1200 baud modem it still felt fast, were now pitiable.<p>I use a terminal on a somewhat regular basis (an IBM 3151 emulating a VT100, connected to a Raspberry Pi running FreeBSD).<p>It can be a great tool for learning Unix command line fundamentals thoroughly (a prime example of blub studies [1]), and as you get comfortable with it, you might find it useful for deep work (George R.R. Martin&#x27;s use of WordStar 4.0 on DOS [2] is a famous example of modern-day usage of text-mode computing, which isn&#x27;t the same as using a hardware terminal on a Unix machine, but close enough in spirit).<p>The caveat is that it does require patience and commitment to the process, which is tough when more convenient and capable user interfaces exist. Oftentimes I&#x27;ll look up documentation on my phone while using the terminal, since it&#x27;s simply more convenient than trying to navigate through modern websites on a text-mode browser.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.benkuhn.net&#x2F;blub&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.benkuhn.net&#x2F;blub&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology-27407502" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology-27407502</a>')
