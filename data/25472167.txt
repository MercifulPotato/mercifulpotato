I&#x27;ve seen it recently in prominent journalists talking about disinformation, in the former Google AI researcher&#x27;s exit message to colleagues, in lots of people talking about politics and government and democracy and public affairs (such as racism). &#x27;Let&#x27;s leave the city - what&#x27;s the point of being here?&#x27;<p>It seems that people want to say: &#x27;it&#x27;s useless to try&#x27;, and &#x27;I don&#x27;t know what to do&#x27; ... sometimes they say they will quixotically continue (to drag out the despair, I suppose).<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s a consequence of the pandemic, which creates depressing environments for much of the world. Perhaps it&#x27;s a the reactionary concept of the &#x27;SJW&#x27; (a negative term, which mocked their supposed uselessness) seeping into broader society.<p>Whatever, despair is a pretty f*g stupid trend. Really? Despair? That&#x27;s cool now? You sound smart now? I promise you that you will never accomplish anything you don&#x27;t believe in. Remember the American Dream - anyone can accomplish anything they believe in and work hard for. A friend of mine (now hip to despair) once said, &#x27;the biggest obstacle most people face is that they don&#x27;t believe&#x27; - my friend was right. Who would even choose despair, given the options - what an unhappy life.<p>I believe. I believe we can do it. I believe that the biggest obstacle is all these people standing around talking about despair, and that we outnumber the actual bad people 100 to 1. I believe democracy and freedom and believing in people has an incredible history of success and we can solve these problems too. I believe we can make the open web work on mobile. I believe we can solve disinformation - it&#x27;s just a matter of engagement, of finding out what engages them and where; they reading that crap for the content. I believe in the city - the land of opportunities, on every block, at every corner, in every cafe and bar. I love the city, I love people.<p>Let&#x27;s do this! LET&#x27;S GOOOOOO!<p>(And I&#x27;m not being ironic. I am dead serious. Why are you standing there talking about irony? Is it so rare that someone could be earnest and enthusiastic these days? I&#x27;m going to leave you behind; I&#x27;m going to make the future while you despair. Let&#x27;s go!!!!)')
