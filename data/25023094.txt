The civil rights movement didn&#x27;t even start until the 50s. Political correctness wasn&#x27;t even a phrase before the 70s. If she meant black&#x2F;Italian&#x2F;Scottish&#x2F;whoever she&#x27;d have said it.<p>She is probably talking about things like Down syndrome and people who are stupid. You don&#x27;t have to like it, she may indeed be badly wrong on some points, but the problem with that is when governments start implementing forceful eugenics policies (a la the Nazis) and not the ideas themselves (and note she specifically argues against eugenics by statute). It seems likely that people will be choosing to genetically engineer their kids regardless if the option is available - how many parents would purposefully let their children have congenital issues if it could be avoided?<p>She is arguing for birth control - an issue which most people are very glad she and people like her won on. She makes a number of good points, and a couple of questionable but reasonable ones.')
