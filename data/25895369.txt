I’ve had users praise my homegrown CMSes before. There’s not much difficulty in pairing a WYSIWYG text editor and some form fields with modern web stacks these days.<p>I don&#x27;t think even the admin UI is well organised or consistent though. Most users just know how to create and edit posts. Once you start installing a few required plugins too, the UI becomes even more a mess of controls that users are scared to touch.')
