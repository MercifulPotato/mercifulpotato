He either didn&#x27;t want to know, or was so stupendously bad at  due diligence that he didn&#x27;t find out what anyone with 15 years history on cryptography could have told him. Either way, I&#x27;m not crying for him.<p>But the revocation of unrelated export licences this year by Switzerland out of embarrassment was deemed illegal, and that really is too bad.
