Look, it&#x27;s obvious how easy this is to manipulate. Tell people that every year people die at higher rates of these four causes, but in 2020 we don&#x27;t see that happen but the Covid numbers are where we saw the increase. So covid is really just no big deal and Trump was always right.&quot; Am I getting the gist of where you&#x27;re going with this? That the American right was always correct? Laughable.<p>What this says is that in 2020 they didn&#x27;t see the same numbers that they&#x27;ve always seen. Heart disease death counts aren&#x27;t as high as they&#x27;ve always been. But wow, take a look at covid - those numbers are WAY up. To the observer who wants to say that covid isn&#x27;t bad and is just the left&#x27;s fever dream, this is the proof in the pudding.<p>To the intelligent, highly educated left, this says &quot;Covid is the biggest cause of death in 2020. The right is just looking for something else to point at because Trump said so.&quot;<p>I believe the article is saying something, but it&#x27;s not saying the right thing. Covid, in 2020, has been the biggest killer. Trying to identify an alternative cause is just wishful thinking.')
