The overall point you&#x27;re making is that technology from several years later was better.<p>Not relevant. Years later, even the Apple IIc (1984) wasn&#x27;t close to a C64, not to mention an Amiga.<p>The thing you&#x27;re missing is, Commodore had purchased MOS Technology, just like Apple purchased PA Semi to make their own iPhone SoCs, and had spent years investing in custom silicon going back to the VIC in 1979.  The Apple II did not have a &quot;video chip&quot;. Wozniak had cobbled together a video chip out of a bunch of 74LS TTL chips.  Here, learn to built one yourself: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=l7rce6IQDWs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=l7rce6IQDWs</a><p>That&#x27;s what I meant by &quot;superior design&quot;. Commodore actually had <i>integrated</i> CMOS chips for video, audio, I&#x2F;O, that they had designed in house and fabbed themselves.  The Apple 2, well into the IIc days, was built like a semi-decent Arduino project. Even the Mac had gfx and DMA cobbled out of TTL chips.')
