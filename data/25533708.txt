You&#x27;re right--life isn&#x27;t for everyone. Death comes for everyone, one way or another, at some point. Normally we don&#x27;t pick when, but maybe you&#x27;re right and this is how it comes for you. That&#x27;s not up to me.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to go through it alone, though, you don&#x27;t have to. We could look that mystery in its face together. See what&#x27;s there. I&#x27;m not expecting to go through it myself yet, but I&#x27;d stand there with you while you do.<p>I&#x27;m not any kind of counselor. I&#x27;m a longtime lurker who just made an account to say your confrontation with and even path through your own death isn&#x27;t a burden for everyone. If you want to talk with someone about it, that option is available to you.')
