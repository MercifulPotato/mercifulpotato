(&quot;Groznyj&quot; means &quot;fearful&quot; and &quot;Vasil&#x27;evich&quot; is a patronymic name)<p>Koba was a nickname of Stalin during his Tsarist Russia work with Bolsheviks. So to refer to Stalin as &quot;Koba&quot; is about to refer to Obama as &quot;Barry&quot;.<p>Anyway, 1984 was about Britain and is a prediction based on what Blair endured working for BBC during WWII years.')
