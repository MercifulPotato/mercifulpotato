Studios A-D had hybrid models where leads and the most senior engineers often had very small glass offices and teams sat in bays (I think some of those might have reverted to all small glass offices). 16,17,18,40,41,42,43, some of the buildings in the 30s as well had all moved to open. Many of the newest buildings (which I forget the numbers of were open) and IIRC , the new campus when complete was to be open. There were still to be sure many many buildings with offices but as buildings were remodeled they were mostly converted to open offices.')
