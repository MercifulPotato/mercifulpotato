Item(by='skinkestek', descendants=None, kids=[25026142], score=None, time=1604840643, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25024780, text='&gt; @moderators: have I earned the automatic downvote? Whatever I post shows zero points as soon as it is posted.<p>Not a mod, but I&#x27;ll take an educated guess that this is what ires someone:<p>&gt; What is called far right in USA is the same thing we call neo-fascism anywhere else<p>The rest of your post is spot on IMO but I hesitate to upvote because of that part, and not because there isn&#x27;t a point but because it is a whole lot more nuanced:<p>Yes: a number of wackos exist on the &quot;far right&quot; (I hate that term as it frames conservatives with totalitarian ones.)<p>But there has also been a tendency by media to abuse the term as a rubber stamp for &quot;anything conservative we don&#x27;t like&quot;. It&#x27;s either that or a large number of facists are the ones to defend the jews this year, and despite 2020 being odd I don&#x27;t think that will ever happen.<p>(I collected a fair number of downvotes myself last election season, seemingly from both sides, which is why I feel somewhat qualified to explain ;-)')
