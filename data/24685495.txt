The tradeoffs are a consequence of limited resources, not the system.<p>That comes next, after there&#x27;s a collective commitment to resource that finite number of people to work on uncured diseases of some kind.<p>At the moment, I think we&#x27;re showing that the collective commitment is not in that direction.<p>We&#x27;re doing other things instead, that you can certainly argue are of value, but given the large proportion of &quot;earned income&quot; most people and businesses have to spend on somebody else&#x27;s &quot;unearned income&quot;, I have to wonder if money flow is a good indicator of value.')
