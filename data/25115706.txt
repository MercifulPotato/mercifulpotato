I potentially could get a record label to use your product but if I can&#x27;t get a clear picture on pricing I&#x27;m not going to get far. Something large like 60 videos a month or more would be good.<p>Also, there is no way to contact you on SongRender.com, no email and no contact form. If I couldn&#x27;t reach you here I would just give up on my idea of using the product for the record label.<p>Otherwise I liked the write up and your project !')
