Because last I checked, the &quot;smart&quot; people have largely outlawed working, destroyed any semblance of normal life, the average person is $5k behind on rent, <i>and</i> all the old people died.<p>The federal government has all but given up pretending money is a finite resource. Likewise states are much the same. There really is no such thing as fiscal discipline nowadays.<p>You can&#x27;t stimulate an economy if no one is allowed to work besides the already well-off that can work from home.<p>It&#x27;s just class war under the guise of public health.')
