But I think the perceived complexity(fear) of managing hardware is overblown. However as time goes on and people become more afraid of it due to the loss of institutional knowledge it won&#x27;t be an overblown fear anymore. At that point institutions will have no choice but to contract out their infrastructure to a centralized institution or an oligopoly of institutions.<p>And we&#x27;re approaching that because as these types of skills are outsourced to these institutions the amount of people with the skills necessary to carry them out are diminished in number from attrition. Amazon doesn&#x27;t need 10 company&#x27;s worth of engineers to have the requisite skills. If everyone buys into this model then eventually the market will only bear the number of engineers having that knowledge as Amazon needs.')
