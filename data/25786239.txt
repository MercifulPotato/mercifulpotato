If it looks like that, well, that&#x27;s real SwiftUI you&#x27;re looking at so it <i>can</i> look like that. If it looks off, well, you both know how SwiftUI works now so update the design and send a new copy!<p>Just working on adding necessary features to the app and growing the community<p>DetailsPro: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;detailspro.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;detailspro.app</a><p>If anyone has feedback, I would love nothing more than to hear it')
