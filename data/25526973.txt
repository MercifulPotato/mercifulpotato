I would say there are two ways to look at it: pledges and historical data.<p>I don&#x27;t think is necessary to demonstrate that the USA current pledges are below the Paris agreement countries.<p>For historical I just will take 2019 that was a specially good year for USA CO2 reductions.<p>from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;us-leads-world-reducing-co2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;us-leads-world-reducing-co...</a><p>&gt;&gt;&quot;It’s true that, according to the IEA’s February 2020 report, the U.S. achieved a greater absolute reduction in CO2 emissions than any other country, in 2019. However, claims that the U.S. therefore “led the entire world” or was a “global leader” in CO2 emissions were belied by the fact that other countries (including Germany, Japan, and likely others) achieved a superior rate of reduction in CO2 emissions. Although not a country, the European Union achieved both a larger absolute reduction and a greater rate of reduction in CO2 emissions than the US did. &quot;<p>(1) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;co2-emissions&#x2F;co2-emissions-by-country&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;co2-emissions&#x2F;co2-emissions-by...</a>')
