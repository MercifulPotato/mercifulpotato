We need authorship identification analysis tools to visually identify shills, astroturfers, bot armies, people paid to promote things and the koolaid drinkers who back them up.<p>For example, my posts would be marked as a F&#x2F;OSS Zealot&#x2F;Linux Fanboy. Or something like that.<p>And further, if my account downvotes something about Apple, it should have less impact than if someone who is an Apple fanboy does it. Balance.<p>Just an idea. ;)')
