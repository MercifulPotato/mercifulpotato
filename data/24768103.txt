It&#x27;s a given that failure is more likely than success; in fact it&#x27;s potentially worst-case-scenario catastrophic. You will encounter many optimists along the way, and these are your most dangerous enemies - get them off your team ASAP. The people you can trust are the pessimists who insist on double-checking every assumption (how old is that rope?) and worrying about the what-if&#x27;s. If folks can&#x27;t accept your &quot;attitude problem&quot;, walk away.')
