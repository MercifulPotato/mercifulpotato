I consider myself a life-long learner and have always dreamed of having the time and space to finish a degree in Computer Science.<p>Long story short, I started a startup and college at the same time. My startup was acqui-hired, college was put on hold, and well, that was around 2008. I have since continued to work at startups and big-tech. The last decade kind of just flew past.<p>But, I do have doubts and I question if it is time for me to finish my degree.')
