Sure, the observers can find out, and try to tell each other and the aliens, but since it takes at least a round trip of light from the aliens to the observers, the observers always find out after the aliens have made up their minds.<p>If the aliens find out that they make the decision when they make the decision, it seems to me at least that they actually made the decision rather than having it be predestined')
