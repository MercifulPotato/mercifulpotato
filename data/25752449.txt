Item(by='jamespitts', descendants=None, kids=[25753084], score=None, time=1610480968, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25751808, text='I can&#x27;t agree with this essay more.<p>In the early days of the Ethereum community a lot of open coordination was done on reddit and a threaded forum hosted on Vanilla Forums. Initially for privacy and convenience, Skype, gitter, Discord, and Telegram began to take hold, and later became the primary place for open, public discussions and some decision-making as well.<p>Threaded forums were still used but not central. It was a difficult era (but a lot of work still moved forward)! There emerged a kind of opacity due to ability to put attention on real-time threads, and IMO sometimes key voices were missing because they could not weigh in effectively.<p>What changed the dynamic was the introduction of Discourse for the critical <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethresear.ch" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethresear.ch</a> discussions (set up by Virgil Griffith), and later <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethereum-magicians.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethereum-magicians.org</a> (something I worked on). I was pushing for threaded at the time because of experiences I had here on Hacker News, reddit, and Slashdot. The person I collaborated with, Greg Colvin, wanted discussions like the threaded emails he was used to from the IETF and c++ communities.<p>We each knew from long experiences dealing with coordinating on tech issue remotely that the quality of the message is the medium.<p>From those successful experiments &#x2F; re-introductions, many teams then began to adopt and host Discourse instances. Later, DeFi picked it up for their governance &#x2F; coordination discussions. Of course, real-time never went away, with more gravitating toward Telegram and Discord. But tracing the emerging thinking, hashing out differences on what to do, and re-activating stale discussions improved a lot.<p>Threaded discussions are a core part of the community and work again.')
