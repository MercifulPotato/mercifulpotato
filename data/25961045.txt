Here&#x27;s a simple rule of thumb: if the result is completely counterintuitive in basic scenarios, then it&#x27;s probably not true.<p>Yes, yes, of course, the new response is &quot;but wait quantum physics is utterly unintuitive, yet it is correct! So is chemistry! etc, etc&quot; but look both you and I know that this is beside the point. Our simple and obvious priors are much more useful than we think, and they are right a lot more of the time than any of us want to give them credit for. Surely, there will be times when it&#x27;s flat-out wrong, but those times are very few and far in between.<p>Reading the paper, this certainly looks like the basic knee-jerk &quot;No&quot; is right by most useful metrics.')
