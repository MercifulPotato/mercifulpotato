Talking about it _at all_ will get you branded a racist.<p>However I&#x27;m saying that the definition of rape in Sweden is broader than other countries and encompasses more things, so the same action in the UK could be classified as domestic violence or sexual harassment (thus, not rape) but in Sweden it would be rape.<p>For one (of many) example(s), in the UK it&#x27;s impossible for a woman to rape a man, because legally the perpetrator needs to penetrate the victim. This is not the case in Sweden.')
