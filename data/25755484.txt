Lots more demand exists for building fintech tools, since significantly more transactions that would normally take place in-person have moved towards being online due to the pandemic. It makes a lot more sense for the whole ecosystem to move towards being data-driven and API-friendly both for consumers to to have less friction between services, and for businesses to deliver a better customer experience. Having the merger fall through is probably better on all sides such that one corporation doesn&#x27;t retain too much power and act as monopolistic gatekeeper driving up fee prices.<p>Also, wanted to say thanks to Zach for doing a Fireside Chat with Lambda School students last month! It&#x27;s great to hear from your perspective about industry knowledge &amp; experience in order to prepare for a career in tech.')
