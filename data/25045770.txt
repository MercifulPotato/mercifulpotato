I am an avid stasher, despite knowing the downsides. It’s just <i>so convenient</i> (until it’s not...at which point I usually give up and trash it, and yell at myself for not settling into a partial commit sooner).<p>But this workflow (which seems so very obvious in retrospect), keeps my current workflow, with so many benefits. The only place where it even requires extra steps is when you want to apply the stash to a different branch, and even there, it just <i>feels</i> right:<p>“Oh yeah, I was working on that feature over there, let’s pop it off and go put it on this feature over here.”<p>Since this generally requires careful diffing anyway to make sure things end up in the right place, there’s not much lost here, and without the downsides of stash.')
