Fact-check can be true, a middle ground (both true and false) or false. So there&#x27;s not this black and white as some people pretend it is. A few just want to pretend they should get away with lying, and getting people to go along with their villainry. Beware such sociopaths, they will do the same to you and loved ones at next turn. Never yield any power to such people. No cause is worth destruction.<p>If your statements don&#x27;t hold water, you should be held accountable for it, and there should be consequences according to your power. When those consequences is more power, you sooner or later arrive at Mussolini (look him up).<p>Though, for many people, facts, science, teachers, doctors, none of that matter. So this means the political system must get out of its stalemates and address the real issues that lie beneath the bullshitters. People don&#x27;t think alike, so you can&#x27;t reach everyone, even if you think you have all the facts. Besides, facts can always be disputed, though not unreasonably so.<p>My conclusion is, no fact-checking will ever be sexy and viral. People will die of boredom instead :)<p>Good try though!')
