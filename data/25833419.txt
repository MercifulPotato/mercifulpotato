This was in the 80s and CNC was what he evolved into from manual die cutting.  He did a lot of government work where they most often times didn&#x27;t know what the part was for or it was only a subset of the components. Most often times he&#x27;d be working on a 10+ ton die for a huge part, think landing gear, where the tolerances were in the thousandths. I always thought that was amazing the precision he could achieve by hand. That became even more remarkable to me as I got older and realized machines were now doing the math. About 4 years ago I built a homelab CNC. I wanted something more robust than a lot of the belt driven options out there and settled on a company called CNCRouterParts (now called AvidCNC) [0]. The downside is it consumes a fair bit of space. But between the laser cutter (Glowforge), 3D printer (Prusa) and CNC (CNCRouterParts) you can do quite a bit of light fabrication at home these days.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avidcnc.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avidcnc.com&#x2F;</a>')
