The native language in my country hardly has any literature published in it because it&#x27;s so obscure. How should the printing press solve this unfairness? The internet in general also doesn&#x27;t use it much at all, neither do all the popular movies and TV series. They don&#x27;t even get subtitled. Apple Maps can&#x27;t pronounce the street names  correctly for navigation either. It&#x27;s pretty hopeless but does it really matter?<p>Maybe if you have an unpopular language, that&#x27;s just unfortunate and please encourage your kids to learn English (which they probably do at school just about everywhere anyway) so you don&#x27;t perpetuate the same problem to the next generation.')
