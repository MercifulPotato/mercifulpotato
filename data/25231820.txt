The native UI search is horrible and is very slow as it needs to load gigabytes of info but it uses SQLite internally and I use my own software for doing serious things.<p>The author of the article is overcomplicating things. He wants the moon and as a result, gets nothing. He is paralyzed in the quest to perfection.<p>If instead of this, you start using your own tools today, you improve it over time. For example I use structured text files for hierarchical info storage and my tools are quite sophisticated compared with how I started. At first it was a simple S-expression lisp file done in an afternoon.<p>I also use databases.<p>I log the time I spend in HN and it is quite small. I just read as fast as I can(5 minutes) whatever interest me and organize it, every day. I write but don&#x27;t read replies or anything that goes over my allocated distributed time.<p>Then after a while I spend time for getting deep on something and then I read all the books, all the articles,ask my friends, watch all the videos of a given subject in parallel.<p>Take for example Clojure. I spend a week doing nothing but immersing myself on it, real work, and use Anki to learn it.<p>If I were to read just one book isolated, I would not understand anything. Multiple perspectives is much better and funnier.')
