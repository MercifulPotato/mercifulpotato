However one of my main objectives was to get my data away from cloud infrastructures. It sure is different to just put your photos on Google Images or pay for cloud storage which you access from your service.<p>Still I want to have full control over where and how my data is stored and I want a simple platform (at least for now, this is an MVP). So yes I agree that cloud storages have a clear value proposition but it is only an option for the future.<p>I also intend to at least offer some tools&#x2F;reminders for backups. In the end it is the user&#x27;s responsibility. Beside self-hosting on rented hardware I also think about putting a real box into my basement. This is obviously only a sensible solution for sharing in a small circle. But that&#x27;s what my project was intended for.<p>I will again have a look at LowEndBox and also LetBox.')
