In fact, that&#x27;s one of the intended uses of the Joint Simulation Environment that the article discusses.<p>DCS&#x27;s missile simulation models are so far from the real thing that DCS is what simulation engineers refer to as &quot;negative training&quot;. That is, if you train to fight using DCS, you&#x27;re training to fight <i>within DCS</i>, not training in a way that&#x27;s going to carry over to the real world. DCS is fine for what it is -- a simulation that reflects as much of the pilot&#x2F;vehicle interface of various aircraft as is possible. But when it comes to sensors and weapons, it&#x27;s very far from reality.<p>The Alpha Dogfight trials were a PR stunt but they were also a part of a larger program to see how AI technology can assist human pilots. Alpha Dogfight is akin to things like Deep Blue&#x2F;Alpha Go in that it has opened up a whole domain to further research and deployment of AI systems to assist humans.')
