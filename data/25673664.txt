It&#x27;s nothing like a perfect option, but if anything is going to beat WhatsApp for mindshare it&#x27;s something from Apple which already has an enormous non-tech userbase.<p>I know the reflex answer is &quot;they won&#x27;t do it because iPhone exclusivity sells iPhones&quot; but suspect that&#x27;s increasingly only true in the US.<p>People here are describing how phones there are increasingly WhatsApp-running platforms, and Apple would be wise to prevent that while it can. Might also offer them an upsell route for their other cross-platform services.')
