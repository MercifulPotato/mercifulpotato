That&#x27;s fair as the price needs to be high enough to roll the taxi.<p>If I didn&#x27;t, then the price was specified--$X from Zone A to B and $0.Y for time spent not moving.<p>&gt; And how do you know they took the quickest route?<p>This is questionable even with ridesharing.  I <i>regularly</i> have to fight with drivers going to my airport in the morning.  &quot;Look, I know your route says go via State 666.  Don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s completely green now but in 10 minutes at 6:45AM that road goes from green to black <i>AND</i> you can&#x27;t change route once you&#x27;re on it--it will take 40+ minutes.  Go via Interstate 13--it will take 20 minutes, tops.  Everything will be fine, and, if it isn&#x27;t, you can get off the Interstate and take another route, of which there are lots.&quot;<p>And those are exactly the kind of routes that cabbies use to inflate prices. See: Las Vegas--a good cabbie moves a couple of streets <i>in the wrong direction</i> to get away from the strip, moves most of the distance, and then works back to your destination.')
