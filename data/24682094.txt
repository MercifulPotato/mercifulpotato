By any chance do you live with others.  I thankfully have my wife and two kids which helped, though I just moved from LA to SC, because it was so draconian.  We have already talked to more neighbors in 5 days living here than we did in years living in LA.  Point being the isolation is much less here because people all walk in the neighborhood and actually say hello and mean it.  They don&#x27;t in LA.  But, I too am missing interactions at work terribly.')
