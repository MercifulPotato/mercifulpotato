Item(by='nikolay', descendants=None, kids=[25005294], score=None, time=1604641609, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25001975, text='I don&#x27;t deny there&#x27;s racism, but I&#x27;m not the offender, because of the appearance of my skin if I don&#x27;t see enough sun. Neither are my kids. People who believe in self-identity do not honor that I don&#x27;t identify myself as a white person. My people have never colonized countries, never had slaves - on the contrary, we&#x27;ve been slaves for a total of 7 centuries throughout our history! So, I sympathize and try to help, but, please, don&#x27;t send my kids home crying with the guilt of being perceived as white people! This is not helping solve the racial issues by building up more unfairness! Racism is an individual guilt, it cannot be a collective one - just like any other crime. Accusing people of profiling Arabs as terrorists while profiling white people as inherently racist - how is this fair?!')
