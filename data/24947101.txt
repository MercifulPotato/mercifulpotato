This also isn&#x27;t a binary condition (informed vs uninformed) but rather a spectrum. One can be reasonably informed (or worse! Misinformed!) and still not vote optimally, but would trend in the direction. Because of this spectrum it is reasonable to also want to handle strategic voting well. Especially because there&#x27;s nothing better to discourage strategic voting than to make it not very useful (think why would you perform this adversarial attack if it isn&#x27;t effective?).<p>While the Condorcet criterion itself is nice it is far from the most important (cardinal systems are going to do a good job here). VSE really is measuring the MSE distance between true voter preference and candidate policy. But there are other criteria that matters. Simplicity is one, as it allows for transparency and voters to understand the system. Ranked systems typically fail the favorite betrayer. This includes RP and Schulze (the most popular Condorcet methods, and what I assume you are specifically referring to). But also consider factors like: expressiveness, spoiling, monotonicity, scaling (do ballots look the same?), and momentum.<p>It is really easy to get caught up in a single metric, but the difficulty of voting is that there are a lot of metrics that matter and you really have to do a lot of tuning. But I&#x27;ll tell you that the researchers themselves, including Arrow, typically prefer cardinal systems because of the combination of criteria.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electionscience.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;approval-voting&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electionscience.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;approval-voting&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-4FXLQoLDBA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-4FXLQoLDBA</a>')
