Item(by='quietbritishjim', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601646692, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24662497, text='The ability of more people to get housing earlier in their lives is <i>only</i> correlated with the growth in housing stock. If the housing stock is growing more slowly than the population then it&#x27;s irrelevant if people manage to save more money towards it; that just increases the house prices for everyone. Conversely, if the housing stock is growing faster than the population growth then even a decreasing amount of disposable income wouldn&#x27;t stop people moving into the vacant properties... the prices would all come down to match.<p>Of course this sounds ridiculous because in a normal market the supply of a good or service would increase if prices go up (positive price elasticity of supply, as the economists would say). But housing markets are often not like that, and they&#x27;re certainly not like that in the UK suburbs (as I said, that&#x27;s partly because of the green belt).')
