Is it &#x27;new&#x27;? Or &#x27;nyew&#x27;? I&#x27;ve also heard &#x27;geh-new&#x27; and &#x27;G-new&#x27;. &#x27;new&#x27; is probably the easiest to say and is technically correct, but it is also an extremely ubiquitous adjective which can be placed next to literally any noun, and therefore a terrible way to brand something.<p>And I think that is the primary reason why GNU&#x2F;Linux never caught on and everybody just called it Linux. &quot;What OS do you use?&quot; &quot;GNU&#x2F;Linux&quot; &quot;Wait, I didn&#x27;t know there was a New Linux!&quot;.')
