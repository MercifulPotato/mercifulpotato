One extra suggestion that would at least be great for me with Haskell is specializing the names of the super generic functions. Like there’s no reason to keep the function names “traversable” and “sequenceA” for your specific Traversable. It’s the same as type synonyms being useful because, while it’s the same thing, intent is clearer.<p>I love the Haskell for its focus on reusable pieces, but I can’t keep up when I have to learn and remember all of those pieces to learn that ‘monoEndoSequentialAlternataverse mEmpty (.)’ is just a getter from your nifty key value store.')
