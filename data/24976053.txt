It is not the problem of consumers, who have legals rights.  And I don&#x27;t care what Tesla is &quot;concerned&quot; about, because consumers have the legal right to salvages cars, and Tesla does not get to ignore these laws.<p>&gt; Tesla is indeed responsible<p>Sucks to be Tesla then!  They can shut down their business and stop making cars, if they don&#x27;t like the laws that allow consumers to salvage cars.')
