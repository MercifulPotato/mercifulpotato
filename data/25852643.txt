I use Org-mode, so I&#x27;m thinking about doing this: I have a set of searches I run every week or so to find tasks or projects to archive (which places them in a separate file that I can still search, but is not in my face in my main TODO files): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;telotortium&#x2F;doom.d&#x2F;blob&#x2F;ceb88ea05a2c8a5d5a7b0d08fb6ae28072054d2b&#x2F;org-config.el#L530-L568" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;telotortium&#x2F;doom.d&#x2F;blob&#x2F;ceb88ea05a2c8a5d5...</a>.<p>Right now I just archive tasks and projects that have been completed or cancelled, but I&#x27;m thinking about archiving all tasks and projects I haven&#x27;t worked on for at least a quarter. That way I can essentially forget about them but still be able to locate them if I really need them.')
