It also does not have compression, unless you stick it in gzip, which makes it even worse because then you can&#x27;t even <i>skip</i> entries, you have to decompress the whole thing from the top.<p>.zip is better, at least that has an index, but at the end of the file, so it&#x27;s not linearly streamable.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, .pdf is structurally ~the same as .zip; the index is at the end, and blocks are compressed individually.<p>Choice of archive format matters :-)')
