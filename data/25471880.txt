Below are some options that leverage skills you&#x27;ve possibly developed.<p>* Writing technical books, columns. You can leverage your skills and teach them to others.<p>* Speaking engagements at conferences. This one requires some reputation, or reputation building, or social ins. It can be lucrative, and gives you the social aspect. Evangelizing a particular technology can go hand in hand with this.<p>* Fiction writing. As a consultant or senior dev you learned how to tell a story, or pitch a product&#x2F;approach.  That translates to fiction writing. If you are an avid Fantasy or Science Fiction reader then you could try your hand at writing what you love to read. It will take time to get good, just like when you learned programming or other tech skills.  This also involves a lot of socializing during marketing, signings, etc. - especially if you are self-publishing.<p>* Transition into management. The skills you learned are in high demand for leading a team of engineers, and senior management is often looking for someone who&#x27;s been an engineer and is looking to move into management.<p>* Change careers to something opposite - woodworking, etc., but keep your hand in programming by contributing to Open Source software. This allows you to build a reputation in the Open Source world as well.<p>Happy holidays and I hope this helps you in some small way')
