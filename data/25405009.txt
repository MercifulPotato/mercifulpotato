And I believe Dorsey said himself that misinformation is not against the Twitter rules (might have an exception for certain topics though).  Probably because half the users on the site would be kicked off in a year.<p>Also think we need to be careful about the term &quot;misinformation&quot; as that can at times mean my opinion vs your opinion.  For instance Fauci flipped on masks several times (im not hating on the guy)...but which time was it misinformation and not misinformation?  This is exactly why people need to be entitled to their opinions in a free expression form.  You can direct the conversation without kicking people off and censoring people. Another example is Twitter completely flopping when censoring the NY Post &quot;misinformation&quot; which turned out to be undeniably true.')
