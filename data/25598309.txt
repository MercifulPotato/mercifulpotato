There are different problems in civil service government entities, but the number of “below average” employees is usually based in size of org, not type of org. A big bank isn’t much smarter internally than a big government agency. A small company lacks the controls and depth of skill just like a town or small city.<p>I worked for a non-Federal US government, and my team was an amazing group of talented and passionate people.<p>Despite all of the nonsense of living in a bureaucracy where 500 people can say “no”, the mission and the impact on our neighbors was worth it. Compensation meh, total compensation was good.<p>But as time went on, the terms of the deal changed for new employees — generous pensions and benefits were tweaked in a way that marginally reduced cost, but dramatically reduced value to the employee. End result was average turnover of new hires was ~70% vs ~20%, and after I’m dead, the state pension fund will be sitting pretty as the new folks pay more to collect dramatically less benefits.')
