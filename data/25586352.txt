I ran some numbers the other day and if you&#x27;re distributing the vaccines exclusively via the 40-ish Belgian hospitals that can store the Pfizer one (and only 6 in Brussels), then there is no way to achieve herd immunity before end of 2020. The only <i>real</i> solution to that is to allow for more widespread distribution via pharmacies. (Yes, medium-term storage is an issue, but AIUI the Pfizer vaccines can still move around after thawing for some time so short term redistribution is possible if you&#x27;ve prepared for it).<p>So they&#x27;re trying whatever they can to compress the timeline. It&#x27;s not necessarily a <i>bad</i> decision, but it&#x27;s a workaround to a worse one.')
