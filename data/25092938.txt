When you work from home, you don&#x27;t put anywhere near the carbon into the atmosphere that you would commuting. You also spend a lot less on lunch, and you don&#x27;t need to put your children into state-run schools that are really there to function as daycare centers as much as they are to educate. If all of that office space in downtown areas stays dark, and the zoning laws are altered or removed, it can be redeveloped into housing that&#x27;s actually affordable.<p>We really are running into a wall on the methane crisis, and we we simply don&#x27;t have the time to integrate these changes at a slower pace.<p>Let&#x27;s focus on changing our regulations that prohibit building neighborhoods for pedestrians. Let&#x27;s work on getting homes with solar roofs and big batteries. Let&#x27;s get drone delivery everywhere. Let&#x27;s electrify the transport system with electric cars, electric trucks, eVTOL aircraft. Let&#x27;s tunnel underneath and between cities and connect them with hyperloops. Let&#x27;s connect people in rural areas with low-cost, low-latency satellite internet access.<p>Doing these things will directly provide a great number of jobs for a great number of people. It will make a great number of new jobs possible. It will improve the natural environment. I think this is a much more positive direction to take than to try to slow things down.')
