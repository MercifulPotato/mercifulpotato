That way open source is a win-win. Companies benefit from each other&#x27;s contributions.<p>It&#x27;s _not_ about just showing the code or a free-for-all.<p>Once you have free and non-free tiers it&#x27;s already broken. The incentives no longer align.<p>I&#x27;m being paid in part to work on the open source projects that we utilize for our service(s). Some of those we started, some of those we&#x27;re contributing to, but we _own_ none of them. We handed them off to external entities (Apache and others) for governance and we actively encourage others to participate.')
