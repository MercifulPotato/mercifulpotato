Item(by='Sodman', descendants=None, kids=[24944964], score=None, time=1604079916, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24944715, text='&gt; Letting cars have priority lets people with wealth and opportunity have priority.<p>I would actually argue the opposite. As the saying goes, &quot;Location, Location, Location.&quot; Many of the wealthiest people &#x2F; most expensive homes are either walking distance to or in the middle of big hubs. The next most expensive places are walking distance to public transport to take them to big hubs. You can get a much cheaper place if you go to somewhere that&#x27;s an hour&#x27;s drive outside the city with no public transport (or the only public transport available is by bus), and that&#x27;s what many people do to cut down on costs.<p>You&#x27;ve also mentioned that cars probably shouldn&#x27;t be able to go even as fast as 40kmph when pedestrians could cross... Should we be making all of our highways 30kmph now if we&#x27;re saying pedestrians should be able to cross them at-will?')
