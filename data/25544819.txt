Neither would have required a lawyer, and easyJet gate agents would probably have sorted the alternative flight on the day as the best option for all parties<p>Instead they chose to pursue a third option the law didn&#x27;t cover and purchased their own choice of alternative flight. Its not the law&#x27;s fault that if people choose alternatives they don&#x27;t have a statutory right to be compensated for when dealing with the sort of company that isn&#x27;t inclined to be generous, they don&#x27;t get resolution until the company decides it doesn&#x27;t want the risk and cost of fighting any further.')
