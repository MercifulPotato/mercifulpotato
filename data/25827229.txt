I _would_ even pay a (small) subscription for the service, as I&#x27;m an avid user of WebMD who is more often than not overwhelmed by potential treatments for any given symptom, but I admit that most likely would not scale.<p>I do, however, think it makes much more sense as a consumer tool rather than a doctor tool: if I&#x27;ve already gone through the trouble of making an appointment at a doctor, who I trust, I&#x27;ve either given up on trying to resolve the issue myself and will trust their prescription, or I have no idea how to approach the issue or symptoms I&#x27;m feeling as communicated by WebMD. Your value proposition is saving the consumer time and effort of booking an appointment to find out how to best fix a minor-medical issue they (or, say, their child) may have. Is that a sustainable proposition? I don&#x27;t know, but it makes much more sense to me than as a tool to tell doctors how to do their job &quot;better&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d imagine if you went the WebMD consumer route, too, once you reach a certain user-size, you&#x27;d have no problem partnering with pharmacies (or even pharmaceutical companies) to offer coupons for some OTC medicines in exchange for a referral fee, as is standard in the industry (a. la. GoodRx). Then you&#x27;re providing value to the consumer in the form of recommending useful medicines, providing the consumer a way to get that medicine for a lower cost, saving them time and money spent at the doctor&#x27;s office, and providing the pharmacy&#x2F;pharmaceutical company a new customer.')
