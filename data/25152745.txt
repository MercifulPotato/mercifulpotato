We&#x27;ve been quarantining at home for over two weeks now, so as long as we&#x27;re highly cautious on the drive when we have to stop at gas stations I think it&#x27;ll be OK.<p>As long as you can avoid risky situations the rest of the time, there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem doing the holidays with family. The trouble is that even going to the grocery store counts as &quot;risky&quot; in my book, so you need to plan well in advance.')
