Thanks for clarifying.<p>&gt;Having secret judges, secret tribunals, or anonymous judges, would only make oppression easier. This is what dictatorships do.<p>But I don&#x27;t really get what you mean by this.  We don&#x27;t have secret or anonymous judges.  And anyone who wants to address any particular judge knows <i>exactly</i> where to find them -- at the relevant courthouse.<p>In fairness, we do have the FISA court, whose <i>proceedings</i> are secret (and I don&#x27;t like that one bit), but the judges who sit on the FISA court aren&#x27;t anonymous or &quot;secret.&quot;  And again, if someone has an issue with any of those judges, they can just go to the relevant court and do so.<p>Going to people&#x27;s homes to <i>intimidate</i> or harm them or their families is repugnant to me personally and to a free society in general.<p>You said that &quot;Laws like this just give them more cover.&quot;<p>Are you advocating that people go to people&#x27;s homes to intimidate, threaten and harm people and&#x2F;or their families as a check on how they deal with others?<p>That sounds a lot like the vigilantism you appear to decry.<p>Or are you claiming that we live in a failed state, so any actions taken against public figures is not only acceptable, but encouraged?<p>I guess the tl;dr is that you didn&#x27;t answer my question.  Will you do so now?')
