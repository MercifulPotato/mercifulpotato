They are not paying drastically different amounts to those European employees. When I relocated from the US to Europe from a FAANG company my salary was market adjusted (about a 25% cut), but RSUs and stock were kept the same.<p>25% sounds like a lot, but my cost of living dropped more than 25% moving out of the Bay Area, so I was more than happy.<p>Once you become a senior enough engineer at FAANG the overwhelming majority of your compensation is stock, and when that happens the base salary becomes pretty irrelevant. My base salary is maybe 1&#x2F;5 of my total compensation at this point.')
