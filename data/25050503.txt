Both meaningless upgrades that are steps backwards in UX. I&#x27;m constantly switching between it for work and my personal 2015 MBP, and the 2015 is just much smoother and easier to use, and I&#x27;m not inadvertently activating keys with a mere graze of the touchbar. Once my 2015 MBP dies, I&#x27;ll migrate to Ubuntu and never deal with another Apple product again (aside from being forced to at work). I&#x27;d love to continue using macOS but their insufferable hardware choices make it impossible for compromise.')
