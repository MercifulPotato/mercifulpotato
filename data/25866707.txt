There&#x27;s a very strong prior (base assumption) that prices in a liquid market (like most housing) are determined by supply and demand.<p>The FDA has papers about how above 5-7 suppliers for a given drug the price radically drops (eg. the market becomes efficient due to competition), the same thing works for ISPs and other providers, why would it be different for housing?<p>Also, if the things you mention don&#x27;t happen, that means there&#x27;s no need for the rent control, since supply and demand are in balance and prices are stable (or they follow some larger trend, like inflation).')
