It’s pretty obvious that this is a common problem, but when so many people are arguing in bad faith the solution isn’t obvious since they will actively resist finding common ground upon which they might finally be pinned down. Simply making an “observation” might have been good enough “among US intellectuals 70 years ago”, but it’s certainly not going to be good enough today in these Hacker News comments.<p>In some contexts, I might love to talk for hours about what ‘2’ really is, but in this particular context the absurdity of following that rabbit hole is kind of the whole point: you can surely dissemble for hours if I press you on the ‘2’ issue, but what that amounts to here is you (the general you) retreating into intellectual masturbation to avoid admitting that there’s a difference between a truth and a lie (or directly arguing otherwise, though I think the same pitfalls apply there). I write comments like the one you replied to because I like to test what level of mental gymnastics these people are willing to resort to to avoid admitting that we can make any sort of factual statement about the world.<p>Often, as in this case, I don’t hear back.')
