There are plenty of areas where open source is what advances the state of the art. E.g programming languages (almost all are open source), compilers (LLVM and GCC is where a lot of innovation happens), GIS databases (PostGIS is the leader,the commercial ones follow) and in operating system kernels Linux is probably the most advanced while innovation at the same time happens in experimental kernels which are also open source. Plus some of the most complex beasts in software, web browsers, are all open source. Your snark against open source feels so 2005.<p>Open source dominates quite many areas but has admittedly some issues producing consumer facing products (but there are exceptions like Blender and vlc).')
