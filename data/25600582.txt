Thanks for sharing those experiences.<p>To clarify, the North Korean palace you refer to - which is the new building; is the boring blue and gray square shaped hospital looking one  (the one I describe with the official sign out front of the gated entrance)  ?<p>Fascinating to hear about it from the inside.  I was excited to see the building and lay foot on the sidewalk of the compound but not the type to ask for a tour; I didn&#x27;t want to be an annoying がいじん.  Settled for a selfie and pictures of the outside; Kyoto on its own is has no end of photogenic opportunities so it was one of many.')
