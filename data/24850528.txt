They accumulate in the MAC containers list. There is no way to mass delete them, nor set them to auto-delete when the tab is closed.<p>These WILL sync to your Firefox account and reappear on every machine. Over 3000 temp container made MAC unusably laggy. This was so destructive of my MAC experience that I uninstalled both extensions. Unfortunately, to my knowledge, there is no way to reset the data MAC syncs to Firefox Account.')
