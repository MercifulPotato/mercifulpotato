They seem more likely to leave or complain if it goes outside their desired bubble. It has the same logical flaw of the vapid cliche &quot;If you&#x27;re not paying you&#x27;re the product.&quot; - No you can still be the product even when you are paying. Paying more is never a guarantee of value - worse yet it has been found doing so sets a sunk cost fallacy to justify the quality of what was spent.<p>Cost may set a ceiling in terms of &quot;paying $20 for a rocket&quot; only getting you some fireworks or a model one at most but there is no guarantee that throwing $20M blindly won&#x27;t end with you getting the same model rocket with a coat of paint and the seller moving to a Caribbean Island.')
