Any software security engineer knows that. Everybody loves network connected new cars. Nobody thinks about the fact that they are &quot;fly by wire&quot;<p>I fully agree that automotive and medical equipment&#x2F;IT could greatly benefit from not having security as an afterthought.<p>However, I don&#x27;t know any vehicle with connectivity (other than that Jeep Cherokee controversy), which does not have safety critical CAN&#x2F;FlexRay buses segregated from user facing &#x27;infotainment&#x27; systems.<p>What that means is that the network bus in which your &#x27;compromised&#x27; infotainment system is able to operate is completely separate from Engine, ABS, AEB, ESP, Airbags etc.<p>The solutions vary but there is usually a physical gateway that prevents a passthrough MITM attacks, so for example you cannot simple send a message frame from your infotainment pretending to be an Emergency braking request to your ABS system.')
