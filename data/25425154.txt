Eventually they, and other branches of my family got their property restored or compensated. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, property in many of the former Soviet Union nations was returned to rightful owners, or compensation was issued. Expropriated property is restored in many cases. Compensation for expropriation is commonplace. American slavery was a business, and businesses keep records. There are no valid excuses.')
