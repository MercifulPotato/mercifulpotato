I feel like I should use it <i>way</i> more often, or at least <i>way</i> earlier than I tend to. That would probably eliminate a lot of headaches.<p>Anyway, great to see a fellow rubber duck debugger here on HN! You know I bet if we tried teaching <i>each other</i> about rubber duck debugging we&#x27;d reveal <i>even more</i> techniques to become more efficient at doing our work.<p>So much to talk about! So much to teach and do!<p>I love HN!')
