In reality, it&#x27;s not that the git commands are spaced out equidistantly, it&#x27;s that you have a flurry of git activity then go back to coding.<p>So, an individual commit can easily hit 5 commands.  I always do a `git status` before and after (2), plus maybe a few git adds (2), the commit (1), then potentially a push (1).  That&#x27;s already 6 commands for each commit.  In a day I usually do approx 15 commits(Â±10), as well as re-bases.  That&#x27;s around 90 git commands just for committing. Through in a few rebases, a fetch, and an  amend, and you&#x27;re easily over 100.<p>The quoted OP said &quot;several hundred&quot; commands.  Just with commits on a pretty typical workflow, I&#x27;m at over a hundred.  It  doesn&#x27;t surprise me that someone could double it.<p>I often wear the hat of the &quot;git expert&quot; on a project, and there are some days I&#x27;m doing significantly more than just commiting and pushing code too.  I have a lot of extra commands I&#x27;ll run like `git log HEAD..@{u}` which shows the diff in the logs between my current branch and the upstream.  And I use `git diff --cached` pretty heavily. Git blame is also invaluable when debugging.  These tools don&#x27;t take a way from actually writing software, they enhance it.')
