Is it because it has a cool name? Is it because it was the best when it came out?<p>Now, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have much for it besides its cool name. It is relatively complex, fast but not that fast, good randomness but not that good, and most importantly, it looks like there are RNGs that are better in every aspect. I used xorshifts in the past but now, PCGs seem to be the overall best.<p>Some people praise its ridiculously long period, but at that point, it is more of a disadvantage because it requires an equally large state.')
