I am of the opinion that we shouldn&#x27;t be using machine learning algorithms to make decisions of consequence in people&#x27;s lives without filtering those decisions through human operators. You can use machine learning to assist these human operators and empower them to do much more work than without the technology. But at the end of the day, you still have someone to hold responsible, and you still have checks on the ML doing something profoundly unethical.')
