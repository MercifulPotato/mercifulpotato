Item(by='hackerfromthefu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602998042, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24812932, text='XPS line is plagued by constant quality control issues that Dell doesn&#x27;t fix year after year, generation after generation. With XPS 15 look up the expanding&#x2F;exploding battery issue, thermal throttling etc. Mine (XPS 15 9550) also had issues with the hinge, the power cable, having to fight dell to get an adapter to fit the second drive which they stated stated it supports, and intense fan noise then especially after the Meltdown mitigations were applied I gave up on it completely.<p>Their strength is in quality peripherals, ie screen etc, but their weakness is garbage quality control and it&#x27;s so overpriced for that.<p>If you can, avoid XPS! If you can&#x27;t well .. purchase extended warranty with the on-site option, you&#x27;re gonna need it ..')
