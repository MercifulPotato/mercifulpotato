I agree that people need to be housed.<p>2. But I don’t agree that property rights ought to be snatched from owners.<p>3. I also don’t think we could keep on increasing the world population when we have clearly crossed carrying capacity.<p>They are all different issues and points. Not necessarily related.<p>You don’t need separate a person’s property from him just because a few million people are homeless.<p>You don’t need to keep on breeding homo sapiens to out breed all other species and destroying habits and environment to support the extra billions of human beings. Because the apex predator can wipe out every eco system to support itself. And at a faster rate if it outbreeds the rest of the species.<p>Half the planet needs to be uninhabitated and rewilded for species and habitat preservation, conservation and restoration.<p>As apex predators, if we don’t protect habitat and other species below us, it is like sawing off the main trunk of a tree below us while perching on the top most branch. We will become extinct as a species.<p>One day, I am going to be able to buy thousands and thousands of acres and let nature take it back. There is a better chance that we will survive as a species if we reduce our population rather than keep on increasing it exponentially. Because we are guaranteed to outbreed every other species upon whom we rely on for our survival.<p>The planet survives because of a delicate balance between the ocean’s temperature and carbon levels in our atmosphere. We really don’t understand it fully yet. It’s premature to assume that we can keep on breeding to perpetuate our species. It’s the most unscientific, irrational and illogical way to solve a problem. It certainly is a sure way to erase ourselves from the universe as we know it.')
