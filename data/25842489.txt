My 16” RMBP now has as much usable space as my 13”.<p>Keyboard navigation is bizarre.  Try this:<p>1) Open Mail.<p>2) Cmd W.<p>3) Cmd 1 (or is it Cmd 0?!, hint: it’s whatever Messages isn’t!)<p>4) Without using your mouse select a message in your inbox.<p>5) Without using your mouse navigate to a folder under your inbox.<p>6) Without using your mouse navigate to an inbox in another account.<p>All of this is possible in Catalina and earlier with zero confusion (selections are highlighted clearly) and can be done “backwards” using shift.  In Big Sur some of it is actually <i>impossible</i> and you have to just guess where you start.<p>When native apps aren’t even consistent in their behavior and appearance that is a trainwreck.<p>You may be able to read the tea leaves and see a grand vision  here but I have to use a half-baked desktop environment until  Not-Jony Ive is satisfied they have reminded me they are not Jony Ive.
