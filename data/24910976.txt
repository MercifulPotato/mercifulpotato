And what about that book by #Anonymous which not only was published (I guess the onus wasn&#x27;t on THAT publisher) but was bandied about in the rest of the mainstream media as a brilliant expose written by.... an unverifiable person. Who was supposed to reveal themselves before the election, but that went down the memory hole.<p>There have been many, many stories based on weaker evidence that the media has trotted out to judge Trump by, and then when the evidence is more closely examined, the accusations go down the memory hole.<p>The whole story about Carter Page should&#x27;ve been front page news. The FBI under direction of a Democrat interfered with a Republican&#x27;s campaign. This was the same FBI leadership that dismissed an investigation against the Democrat with stronger  evidence during the same election.<p>Then, James Comey, head of the FBI at the time of both of those events, after being rightfully fired, went on to disparage the President every chance he got.<p>But the American people, well, I guess we don&#x27;t have a right to know what&#x27;s on Hunter&#x27;s laptop.<p>Newsflash: he was engaged in a quid-pro-quo with Ukraine with the help of his father. Trump was impeached for investigating that corruption. And that&#x27;s the truth.')
