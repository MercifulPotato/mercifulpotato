Moreover, it&#x27;s not just bots and computational propaganda that we need to worry about (though that is serious problem too). Propaganda is just as &quot;real&quot; regardless of whether it&#x27;s computational and offered up by bots, or if it&#x27;s a guy with a megaphone, or if it&#x27;s a poster or newspaper article (like in the 1930&#x27;s).<p>What really matters is the intention behind the propaganda and that&#x27;s what needs to be uncovered and dealt with. Coming up with AI to deal with AI-backed disinformation campaigns can only ever be an infinite game of wack-a-mole, unless the root-causes are addressed. These are political problems and they require a political solution. Facebook and Google aren&#x27;t going to be the hero here.')
