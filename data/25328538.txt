At these price points these laptops are a far better value proposition than the competition - Intel thermal performance and power consumption is just terrible, AMD is better but not present in anything premium - in terms of value for money - anyone looking at a premium 13 inch new laptop right now should IMO get one of these devices unless they have a really good reason not to (and admittedly there are plenty of those).<p>I really hate this situation because Apple is not the company I want to buy hardware from - they really suck on giving options,  it&#x27;s all &quot;Apple know what&#x27;s best for you&quot; from them and their cult (for example I want a laptop with a touch screen, and ideally a 360 hinge, but there is no touch on MacOS because Apple). I would pay double for X1 Yoga with M1 class CPU. But right now Intel has dragged down the x86 laptop market down for soo long, and is still the only game in town for competition, it&#x27;s just sad. AMD has good chips but no good devices. Modern ultra portable laptops are throttling, overheating and die instantly or have no work performance - it&#x27;s just terrible tradeoffs for professionals.')
