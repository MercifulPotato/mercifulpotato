I really think it&#x27;s beyond a dumb-ass politician to orchestrate such a fraud as a hit against a really low key political adversary. How hard do you think it would be to find a hacker capable and willing to do such a thing, and money to fund that?<p>On one hand you have this pretty advanced conspiracy which would require high level coordination with very skilled people in order to frame someone who barely matters.<p>On the other you have a woman who was recently arrested and charged with stalking after enduring a year long restraining order... and the question is if there is enough evidence that she logged on to work computers to write inflammatory things to old colleagues.<p>What&#x27;s out there is surely enough for a search warrant.  You have to believe a lot of advanced conspiracy theories to say this search warrant isn&#x27;t valid.  Even then the justification is... well it stretches the imagination.  State-level framing for an inconsequential thorn in a republican governor&#x27;s side.<p>It is <i>possible</i>, but it isn&#x27;t reasonable.<p>I would fully expect a guilty plea in a month or two.')
