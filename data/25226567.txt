You&#x27;ll still be able to use big, powerful machines as workstations where you write and deploy software for smaller machines. At the same time the N64 came out, there were MUCH more powerful machines you could use.<p>Secondly, there&#x27;s really nothing in principle that would stop you from creating the late N64 games on less powerful computers. Certainly it would be more clunky to compile and deploy from an older, less powerful machine, but you could still do it.')
