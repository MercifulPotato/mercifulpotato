Most of us play chess by looking at an 8x8 black-and-white grid with pieces on it. That is a two-dimensional notation capable of expressing any chess position (castling, en passant, repeat-moves etc, excepted).<p>What if you could invent a more efficient &quot;notation&quot; for chess? For example, FEN is a chess notation that is very efficient <i>for computers</i>. So maybe something similar exists for humans? Perhaps a three-dimensional notation, or perhaps a rearrangement of the board using knight moves and octagons instead of squares. Knights can jump in eight directions at most so a board using octagons would make it easy to see where they land.')
