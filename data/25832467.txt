There are some hiccups here and there, but it&#x27;s well maintained and issues are quickly resolved.<p>Besides the combined search results, a big positive for me is having a simple and consistent UI, free of A&#x2F;B tests, ads or the concern that it may change some day because some overpaid design team discovered a change that maximizes engagement.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searx.me&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searx.me&#x2F;</a>')
