Likewise, I&#x27;ve received similar PRs (and issue reports).<p>I believe that all those were valuable even though they did not involve close participation in the project. But I have not always done that: only after learning how low the barrier to entry was by doing it the first few times, does the thought of submitting a PR now arrive automatically when I encounter such a situation.')
