Item(by='lqet', descendants=None, kids=[25155034, 25141670], score=None, time=1605727228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25138217, text='In Dostoyevski <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, there is a similar &#x27;reveal&#x27; monologue with an extremely interesting twist (spoiler alert): the narrator knows the murderer, the reader knows the murderer, the detective knows the murderer, the reader knows that the detective knows the murderer - but the murderer, a naive student who is convinced he is the Ãœbermensch and committed a perfect crime, is unaware that everyone knows he did it. It&#x27;s both an extremely tragic and extremely funny scene: at one point they have a lengthy conversation where both of them &quot;try&quot; to find out who the real murder is, and the student, thinking he is helping the dumb detective with his superior mind, suggests one murderer after the other, one theory after another. The detective dismisses them all. Finally, the student grows frustrated and blurts out: &quot;Then who <i>is</i> the murderer?&quot;. And the detective just answers: &quot;The murderer? Why, <i>you</i> are, of course!&quot;. The silence that follows is one of the best moments in literature and a testament to Dostoyevski&#x27;s genius regarding character development.<p>Of course, as many people know, that scene and in particular that seemingly clueless but extremely clever 19th century St. Petersburg detective inspired the Columbo series, which repeated this particular kind of &quot;reveal dialogue&quot; in basically every episode.')
