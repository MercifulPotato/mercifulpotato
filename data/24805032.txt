Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602882141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24804773, text='&gt; GPL is about freedom for the user, BSD&#x2F;MIT is about freedom for the devs.<p>Both are about freedom that is only directly meaningful for developers or people that can employ developers on their behalf; permissive license are about simply <i>providing</i> that freedom rather directly, with limitations that tend to be focussed mainly on avoiding unexpected costs to the original provider of the software (liability, reputational, or otherwise). Copyleft licenses compromise direct provision of freedom to acheive broader but less direct social goals which relate to that freedom.<p>If you both agree with the goal <i>and</i> agree with the pragmatic judgement involved in the design of the detailed mechanics in a particular license about how to acheived that goal, its quite possible that a copyleft license is better for your interest.<p>Personally, whether the goal is (and these are two very different goals I&#x27;ve seen cited by GPL proponents) <i>promoting</i> development of free software or <i>inhibiting</i> development of nonfree software, I&#x27;m not sure the GPL family (or any other copyleft license) does that better, in practice, than permissive licenses.<p>The GPL is better at inhibiting nonfree direct descendants of a particular code base, but I don&#x27;t generally see that as a valuable goal.')
