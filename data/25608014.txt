The pulse-width of the saw wave is very dependent on the amplitude of the saw, so when there&#x27;s a 1 volt deficit in the saw wave&#x27;s amplitude you lose about 8% of the pulse width. It&#x27;s really not that noticeable in practice, though, and if anything it adds to the sonic character of the juno.')
