For most people in the world, $500K pa is a preposterous amount of money.<p>There are developers at fintech startups making $50k&#x2F;year?  After 10 years of employement?  Maybe the author is just being superlative here, but I find this surprising.  Yes $500k a year is a very high salary, but 1&#x2F;10th of that is a pretty low salary for an experienced developer - particularly for the latter half of that decade.<p>Depends on skill level, but I&#x27;d suggest any developer making less than (70k + 10k * years of experience) take some interviews to check if they are working for below market rate.')
