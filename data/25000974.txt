Also the original build with the exception of replacing my existing GTX680 with a 980 a year or two in.<p>Amusingly, my thoughts of upgrading were initially triggered by wanting new storage.  I currently have the original 250GB SATA SSD I put in originally, along with a handful of hard drives from various older systems.  Motherboard doesn&#x27;t have an M.2 slot and I was thinking, hmmm...I bet there are a lot of things I can&#x27;t upgrade at this point.<p>Waiting on these new Zen 3 CPUs to be available, but not in a huge rush since I also can&#x27;t get my intended 3080, so we will see which comes into stock first.  It will be a nice bump to a new gen CPU, DDR4, and a few gens of GPU once I can actually buy the dang parts.  If they were around I would&#x27;ve built the thing a month ago.')
