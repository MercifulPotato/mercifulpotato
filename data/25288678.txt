Item(by='astura', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607002760, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25287325, text='&gt; the penalty clauses in the contract kick in, such as payment in lieu of notice<p>Penalty clauses in a non-union job in the US!??? How on earth does one get such a clause?<p>I&#x27;ve had five software jobs and four non-skilled jobs and never seen anything even approaching this sort of clause in an employment agreement, or heard of anyone ever having this sort of clause in their employment agreement, unless you&#x27;re talking about like CEOs.<p>The only employment agreements and&#x2F;or offer letters I&#x27;ve ever seen (from both myself and my spouse) were more-or-less &quot;here&#x27;s your starting salary and you are employed at will.&quot; In fact, the last offer letter I signed literally said something along the lines of &quot;this offer letter is not an employment contract or a guarantee of continued employment.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d love to see&#x2F;read these mythical supposedly &quot;contracts&quot; sometime to see the exact verbage. I very seriously doubt that one just gets to walk away with a big payday just because their employee changed the benefits plan. Not in the US.')
