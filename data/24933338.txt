And then set the taxes so high that the purchase price of land is as close to $0 as possible, which means that there will be both small positive and small negative valuations for the land (because of the tax burden).<p>This is equivalent to taxing away the land rents: the unearned appreciation of value in property that comes from those around you, rather than what you build.<p>In this sort of system, other taxes can decrease quite a bit as well.')
