I&#x27;d say there are at least three possible answers to the question you pose at the end of it:<p>1. As another commenter replied, Big Tech will have to start charging market prices for their services.<p>2. Big Tech will be unable to charge for their services, and the business relationship between them and their users will collapse, taking Big Tech with it.<p>3. The relationship between Big Tech and its customers will change from a business relationship to something else, where the truism you stated will no longer applies.<p>One might argue that (3) has already happened, and the &quot;something else&quot; is more like a manorial or totalitarian relationship, in which the interests of the users are irrelevant.')
