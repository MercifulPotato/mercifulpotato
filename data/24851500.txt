You got a disjointed experience akin to a hallmark movie split into short episodes.<p>We already tried that with “webisodes” in the past and they didn’t survive once streaming became a thing because they couldn’t match the quality of the content of Netflix and co.<p>Quibi failed because people don’t mind pausing and the few that do probably would rather watch a 20-30min episode of their favorite sitcoms during commute than 1 or 2 episodes of some Quibi show.<p>The format especially the portrait mode content was also annoying as fuck, this isn’t instagram.')
