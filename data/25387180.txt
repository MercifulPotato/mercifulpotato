Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607702440, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25386995, text='&gt; Physiology and psychology rely on delicately tuned equilibria, which are easy to disrupt.<p>Agreed. My point is just that we should look at physiology and psychology as guides, not anthropology (which is interesting but not necessarily prescriptive).<p>A diet of Twinkies and Coke is obviously terrible. But a finely tuned, balanced modern diet guided by nutritional science is likely superior to a primitive hunter-gatherer diet. There are plenty of people today who are in great physical condition; this is very feasible within our modern society.<p>Similarly, different modern countries often have differing familial arrangements, so we can look at empirical outcomes there instead of trying to guess at what our distant ancestors did, who had little choice but to do what they did, not having modern civilization as an option.')
