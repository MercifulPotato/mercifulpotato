Item(by='mtoohig', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1605656219, title='Ask HN: Cheap hosting for ML API with intermittent usage', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Does a VPS&#x2F;cloud provider exist that charges by the minute or has flexible RAM&#x2F;CPU needs? Currently, I have a $5&#x2F;month VM on Linode for my app but now I want to add some ML features; however, running the ML API on the same VM as my app causes oom errors and kills the process.<p>Of course I could purchase a larger VM at a greater fixed cost per month but since this API will only be called a few hundred times per month there must be an option for per minute or per call pricing while the API mostly sits idly waiting for a request.<p>I am aware of serverless but the time to load the ML models for each call seems like it would take way too long to get a response, unless I have a misunderstanding about serverless then do please inform me.<p>And if it matters for any of the answers I&#x27;m using FastAPI and Celery for the web side and task queue then I have Yolov3 to detect objects of interest from an image then pass the object image to another model for OCR and make a prediction of the text it finds. I&#x27;m new to ML, so I&#x27;ve got a lot to learn and appreciate all the feedback.')
