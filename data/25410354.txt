Problem fixed.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I only buy Lenovo hardware. I shun HP hardware (except their laserjet printers) like the plague. For me. Debian and its derivatives (Ubuntu, Mint) work &#x27;out of the box&#x27;. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had network problems. EDIT: Yes I can, it was when I last had a HP laptop and why I made the decision to never again buy a HP computer. That computer&#x27;s wifi didn&#x27;t even work with Windows. (Well, to be honest, it <i>was</i> Vista.)')
