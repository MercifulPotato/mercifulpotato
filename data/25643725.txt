Less instructions means it is easier to pick the best instructions in the first place. Variable length means you don&#x27;t have to hope your arrays are a multiple of the SIMD length. Your auto vectorized code also gets faster with each new CPU generation.<p>All these factors are especially important when the developer isn&#x27;t even aware of the auto vectorization and just wants performance increases for free.')
