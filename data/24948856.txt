After some time and a gigantic load of stress, I randomly stumbled upon a guy who had the exact same problem as mine. He did a shit ton of analysis, tests and scans. In his case, it ended up being a pain coming from a herniated disc. Coincidentally, he had the exact same disc being herniated as mine - L5S1. Once he told me about that, it all clicked for me, as I usually had pain sitting in a weird position. My brain just couldn’t identify the origin of the pain, and I thought it’s coming from my balls.')
