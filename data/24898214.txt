This is nothing new.<p>&gt; <i>The Nazi website Daily Stormer was deplatformed by their domain registrar, their payments platform, and basically everyone else</i><p>So what? How do you think things should be different? I am <i>personally</i> ok with companies coordinating to shut out Nazis, tens of millions of people died to deafeat them and it seems perfectly reasonable to me to say &quot;you know what, I don&#x27;t want to do businesses with nazis&quot;. I understand the fear of a slippery-slope, but keep in mind that the slippery slope argument is generally regarded as a fallacy, and I see no evidence to suggest that this is actually a widespread problem, with the example of the dailystormer and like two others constantly reused to emphasize your point. If there is enough demand for Nazi website hosting, someone will fill the market need, same as with porn and other things some people don&#x27;t like.<p>&gt; <i>Why should the owners of an arbitrarily popular restaurant lose their right to exclude Negroes?</i><p>What are you talking about? Racial discrimination is illegal in the U.S regardless of how popular your restaurant is. Also, refusing to serve food to black people isn&#x27;t the same thing as refusing to display nazi ideas on your website.')
