Space exploration and a beautiful future suddenly seems achievable with hard work and a lot of engineering instead of just feeling impossible.<p>That is the goal for me, I&#x27;m not going to Mars and I knew that as soon as I went to the MDRS. I also made it an effort to make the director (commander on several mission) to realize how important it is motivate the younger generation and not just the future astronauts that come aborad for analogue missions.<p>SpaceX doesn&#x27;t pay much, and you have to make a ton of sacrifices to even be considered, but I can tell you that being there you get this &#x27;I wouldn&#x27;t be any where else&#x27; feeling that I think is far superior to any monetary value.<p>Unfortunately, many of this year&#x27;s missions at the MDRS are postponed due to COVID, but the robot challenge (mainly comprised of college aged students) is the one I really felt felt disappointed about. I was going to try and make it out this year to help out with that.<p>I hope you decide to get involved in this space (pun intended); I know if I was in my 20s, I&#x27;d do it all over again.')
