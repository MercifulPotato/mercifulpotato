Still, I am convinced we can make an appealing game with the main real-life constraints of early planet colonization.<p>But as for the choice of time period, I find the close future much more appealing than the far future. It is easier to immerse into, and I expect that, in the years to come, the players could actually related there experience in the game to the events unfolding in real life.<p>Also, the period of the first pioneers is probably more exciting than the period where you manage complex cities. If you play Civilization, the first turns have a special flavour that you do not get anymore later in the game.')
