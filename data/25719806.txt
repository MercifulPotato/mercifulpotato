With the advent of the modern technology it was believed that people would spend three or so days per week doing &quot;work&quot; in the usual sense of the word, with leisure taking up the rest. Still, most people are denied any such benefits. Work is now more of a means of a social regulation:  people are supposed to spend most of their waking hours transfixed to a computer screen in exchange for the minimum amount of money that will keep them alive to repeat the cycle the next day, so as not to endanger those who distribute said money.')
