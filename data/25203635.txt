To be clear, by double the speed I mean half the latency between requesting a resource and page load, which is a significant amount of my usage pattern.<p>If something (like uploading a backup or streaming a movie) is going to run for a long time, I don&#x27;t care how fast the average speed is as long as it&#x27;s enough to stream 1080p.<p>But if my next task demands some info from a 20MB datasheet that I don&#x27;t have locally, I want that to load as fast as  possible. And I&#x27;m not going to do that 25,000 times a month.')
