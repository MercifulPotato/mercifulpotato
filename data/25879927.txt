Getting a charging solution for those units seems achievable. I&#x27;m also willing to bet that multifamily housing is generally massively over represented in blue cities, which might be able to require&#x2F;incentives retrofits. That&#x27;s a huge marketable population to start buying electric vehicles and normalize them. I suspect that by the time there is significant used electric market there will also be enough market and political demand to figure out the multi-family situation.')
