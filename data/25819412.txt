But I thought we were talking about adding multiple I&#x2F;O ports, since that&#x27;s what the article says and other comment are talking about adding multiple USB A and C ports, MagSave, an SD slot and even an hdmi port. Adding all those ports will increase the size of the MacBooks.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s wrong to want to have more ports (I wouldn&#x27;t buy a notebook with one port). I&#x27;m saying that it&#x27;s strange to call people egotistical for wanting fewer ports while failing to see that adding ports has consequences other people might care about.')
