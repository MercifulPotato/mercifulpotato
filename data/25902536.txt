Communication should tie objectives to actions and penetrate several abstraction levels and be consumable by advisors, board members, non-technical people, technical people. Call it &quot;fractal communication&quot; that still makes sense from any abstration level you read it. This enables everyone on the team to chime in at the abstraction level they&#x27;re comfortable with. You write an email that ties objectives on say, revenues, in a language that speaks to some, and then tie it back to specific activities, an issue in the issue tracker, and a line of code, so that everyone sees how things fit together and are intertwined. Everyone knows what to do and why they&#x27;re doing what they&#x27;re doing. They can come up with ideas or correct assumptions or mistakes.<p>Other relevant replies:<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21598632" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21598632</a> (communication with the team, and subsequent reply: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21614372" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21614372</a>).
