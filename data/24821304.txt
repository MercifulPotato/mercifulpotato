Turns out, it’s an incentive and policy problem! Video visits weren’t reimbursed the same way (I’ve personally had to haggle with my insurer when a video primary care visit wasn’t tagged with a COVID exception and cost me multiples of the usual $25 copay).

Did the government have to pay Walmart to computerize it’s supply chain in the 1970s? No! It had the right incentives. Does square need to pay small merchants to adopt their cash registers and digitize their menus? Not really, they make the clear case that the digital menu drives more sales. Why do you think doctors needed the extra push? Because the market doesn’t pay them to be efficient record keepers, or penalize them for not doing so.<p>That’s just 2 examples, there are dozens more.<p>Virtually nothing in healthcare is a technology problem except for new treatment development. 4 years of working in the sector taught me this. There are places tech can help, (one example is maybe somewhat improved patient management in a managed care context, though that’s a super competitive market) but the big systemic problems are there for regulatory and incentive reasons. I hope I’m wrong, but pretty sure I’m not.')
