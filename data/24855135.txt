Having family in the military and being exposed elsewhere, it&#x27;s interesting to get a closer view of the parts of government we pay for, like missile silos or aircraft carriers, but often put into a black box. I would hope it would make people more civically aware and engaged. I&#x27;ve been curious about contributing to something like 18F or US Digital Service. Do any countries do this?')
