Sometimes, I&#x27;ll do Ctrl + A, select the entire data set, move my cursor to cell A1, then type Ctrl+F to find text, finds nothing. But if I filter the column where I think it might be for what I was looking for then it finds it.<p>- Sometimes the opposite of the first occurs. I&#x27;ll filter for something in a column, finds nothing, but Ctrl+A and then Ctrl+F finds it. Super weird. Again, I&#x27;m talking like 5000 rows and maybe 25 columns worth of data, a spreadsheet a few Megabytes big. Not the biggest dataset.<p>I also make sure I have no extraneous columns like some people tend to make by mistake which makes the searching take longer.<p>- Ever try to undo (ctrl + z), if you have many sheets open, sometimes your ctrl+ z will start going through the undo history of other files (i.e. not the ones that you&#x27;re actually working on or the foreground. The ones in the background or minimized. Guess what? Now you can&#x27;t tell if you altered data on the other sheets because for some reason Excel registers everything as a change to sheet. You want to expand your columns to fit your text. Good, that counts as a change. Filtering your columns? That&#x27;s a change.) etc. etc. Every action is worthy of a: &#x27;Do you want to save your changes&#x27; even if never really added or updated data. So good luck trying to sort through undos that you didn&#x27;t mean to make.<p>That&#x27;s but a few things and don&#x27;t get me started on number and date formatting. And btw, these are bugs I noticed around 2003 btw. Why are they still there?<p>Working on Excel and making sure that it doesn&#x27;t make mistakes is work on top of the actual work that needs to be done.<p>I&#x27;ve become so distrusting of Excel that I&#x27;ve learned Python so I can use Pandas so that I can get the truth about a spreadsheet because I can&#x27;t trust Excel.<p>That&#x27;s incredibly depressing that I have to do that.')
