We do keep the nodes running 24&#x2F;7, so Kubernetes still provides the scheduling to decide which nodes are free or not at any given time. Generally starting a container on a pre-warmed node is still much much faster than booting a VM. Also, some of our servers are bare-metal.<p>EDIT: Also don&#x27;t discount the rest of the Kubernetes ecosystem. It&#x27;s more than just a scheduler. It provides configuration, secrets management, healthchecks, self-healing, service discovery, ACLs... there are absolutely other ways to solve each of these things. But when starting from scratch there&#x27;s a wide field of additional questions to answer, problems to solve.')
