Item(by='cwkoss', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604096673, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947337, text='Space Exploration mod adds a wonderful &quot;new game plus&quot; type experience: launching the rocket is just the first step towards building a galactic empire.  You actually ride the rocket up into orbit and there are many new space-only buildings and sciences.<p>It&#x27;s amazing how powerful the mod system is.  FNEI is a great in-game directory of resources&#x2F;recipes that I&#x27;d recommend with any new mods you&#x27;re trying.  SpaceEx add a whole new &#x27;navigation satellite&#x27; mode that lets your remotely configure buildings and an interface for selecting planets and stars (in addition to the standard new buildings&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;vehicles of most mods).<p>Factorissimo (building that can be entered and contain more land than their footprint) and Recursive blueprints (automated blueprint usage) also add tons of potential depth.')
