Item(by='Miner49er', descendants=None, kids=[25961749, 25962809], score=None, time=1611949935, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25961140, text='&gt; [1] Specifically, they&#x27;re required by the DTCC to put up a deposit on every trade their users make. During periods of low volatility this is fine because they can come up with the money, but when volatility goes up so do the deposit requirements, which can cause them to become insolvent. This is further compounded by the fact that their product invisibly hands out margin, eg. &quot;instant&quot; deposits of $1000, or giving you the money before it settles (2 days later).<p>Assuming they aren&#x27;t allowing any margin to be used on GME (including instant deposits) how could they possibly not come up with the money? Does that mean they are doing other stuff with users money and only fractionally paying for shares? The clearinghouse (normally) just assumes they are good for it if they ever need to come get it?<p>EDIT: Apparently it is a fractional deposit that the clearing house requires. Apparently though, it can&#x27;t be client money. So my next question is, why is that?')
