I think the Songza stuff is pretty good. I also think Play Music&#x27;s &quot;radio&quot; feature is really good. When you start playing from a playlist it uses that a vector input, trying to find songs related to the whole playlist, instead of just related to one song, album, artist, or other scalar inputs.')
