Item(by='arh68', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609880198, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25642635, text='I would agree <i>all models are bad, some models are useful</i> even though it goes unstated.  I feel like the author’s point is that asking for “the right model” is the wrong question.  I don’t mind argument-by-analogy too much, but I think it would help if we knew what the aliens were trying to do with their model.  People criticizing &quot;inaccuracy&quot; seem to just have high standards for their models (perhaps you want to simulate 100B chess games in 10 seconds.. how&#x27;s that coin flip idea sound now?).  Just imagine you&#x27;re dreaming about backgammon: do you know all the rules? no, but you can roughly model what&#x27;s going on.  Your model could be said &quot;worse&quot; than standard rules, but it&#x27;s good enough for a dream sequence.<p>More than once have I seen a nice chess set in a home, set up completely wrong.  They’ll be close!  Their model isn’t <i>too</i> far off from standard, but just so (K &amp; Q reversed, B &amp; N reversed, &amp;c).  I presume the owners were quite content.  Honestly, I don’t even know if most people would notice, so why point it out (is my model even the “preferred” one)?')
