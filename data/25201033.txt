The accounting isn&#x27;t necessarily easy, but it makes more sense to tax where was money was made (which is murky and complicated) than to funnel it all to the HQ; Apple is more than just a spaceship in one city.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say Apple isn&#x27;t doing things to avoid paying taxes, either. My point is that using corporate taxes of a company with global sales to solve local issues doesn&#x27;t make sense.')
