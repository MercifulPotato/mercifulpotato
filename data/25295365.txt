Item(by='mbreese', descendants=None, kids=[25298289, 25295828], score=None, time=1607031155, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25294352, text='I didn&#x27;t really think about it at the time, but Nvidia buying ARM makes even more sense now that Apple has shown what can be done with ARM CPUs. Not necessarily because Nvidia wanted a CPU, but because otherwise, they&#x27;d be stuck providing GPUs for Intel CPU systems. AMD can bundle Radeon GPUs and Apple has the M1 CPU&#x2F;GPU. That means that for a system vendor (Dell), the only cost effective place to use an Nvidia GPU would be in an Intel system. And if those are already more expensive, then that market will be shrinking.<p>However, with Apple showing the viability of ARM for desktop &#x2F; laptop use, this opens a whole new market up for Nvidia&#x2F;ARM. Apple has already shown it is a viable approach hardware wise, so half of the work is done.<p>So, an ARM powered Dell laptop might not be too far off.')
