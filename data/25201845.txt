Item(by='heipei', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606244847, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25201751, text='True, and I don&#x27;t think they expect models that are superior to their own, I&#x27;d look at this as a hiring &#x2F; marketing tool. Plus, even if you had a model that from a pure engineering standpoint was able to match Jane Street&#x27;s approach, the model would not work without the wealth of proprietary (and expensive) data sources that Jane Street is sure to ingest, so you still couldn&#x27;t just go out and do it yourself without some serious upfront investment first to get the same data. That is assuming all data they use is even available commercially, which I doubt as well. There are probably data sources that only become available to you through personal relationships with the right folks at the right places.')
