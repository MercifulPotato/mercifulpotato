I am not saying C</i> or scylla should not be used. I was just pointing out that the basic ideas and the CQL language itself is designed to trick you in in doing a <i>lot</i> of things that turn out to be really wrong on the data model used by these software.<p>It&#x27;s not an implementation thing. Should I consider only that, scylla&#x27;d be really good (provided you have the correct hardware) and much better than C*. Still, the issue (IMHO) is with the theory and the fact that the actual correct applications are much, much narrower than the initial impact lets you believe (especially due to CQL)<p>--edit:\nKudos on scylla btw, but basically I am doubtful how much it&#x27;s possible to overcome that legacy without going really incompatible even on the API')
