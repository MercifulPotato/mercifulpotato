However, I already see problems with this kind of syntax:<p>[&lt;whitespace&gt;a,&lt;whitespace&gt;b]<p>How will this be interpreted&#x2F;parsed? Will there be a whitespace before &quot;b&quot; after parsing? That would mean, that I am not able to separate visually more clearly, by adding a whitespace between list elements, which is widely considered to be a good practice in programming languages. The reason is readability.<p>The next thing is, that on the same line whitespace is added, but what about multiple lines defining a list? Here we do not add the line breaks and indentation to the string. It&#x27;s not consistent in this way.<p>So I personally would never write string like that. I would always make use of quotes in such situations and probably in YAML in general, simply to make it clear, that I do wish to have the leading whitespace in the string, and it is not simply a typo, resulting from removing a former first element from the list.<p>JSON is limitting, but for configuration I think it&#x27;s kind of limitations are often good. With comments in JSON I am still not sure, because sometimes I&#x27;d like to write them there, but would not like to include another dependency, only to be able to parse away the comments from JSON. Then I better write good docs elsewhere.')
