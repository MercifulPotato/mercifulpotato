As long as the Uyghurs claim to represent &quot;Islam&quot;, it&#x27;s somewhat unavoidable for the Hui to be dragged down with them.<p>Nevertheless, it is quite plainly the case that oppression of the Uyghurs targets them for being culturally distinct (and, to a certain extent, seditious), not for being Muslims. It baffles me that Western media are so monomaniacally focused on criticizing this in terms of &quot;oppressing people because of their religion&quot; when (1) that is obviously not what&#x27;s going on, and (2) &quot;oppressing people because of their race&quot;, which <i>is</i> going on, is at least as bad in the eyes of Western media consumers as &quot;oppressing people because of their religion&quot; is.<p>Every time this happens, it signals as loudly as possible that the reporter has <i>absolutely no clue</i> what they&#x27;re purporting to talk about. And it is fascinating that it seems to be so important to so many of them to talk about it anyway.<p>&gt; But then, China has an awful lot of other misleading advertising and false claims (in particular around TCM and efficacy of folk remedies) that the government ignores or promotes. Why only target halal?<p>Well, from the article:<p>&gt;&gt; The Ningxia government has taken measures against the pan-halal tendency and Islamic thought influenced by theologies common in Arab nations, which is referred to as Arabization.<p>&gt;&gt; The Ningxia Ethnic Affairs Commission vowed in May 2017 to properly handle the pan-halal and Arabization tendencies, promoting socialist core values and placing national flags at religious sites, read a statement on the website of the Ningxia government.<p>I feel pretty sure that what they really care about is the Arabization. The two aren&#x27;t totally unrelated; a marketplace that bifurcates <i>everything</i> into &quot;halal haircuts&quot; and &quot;haram haircuts&quot;, &quot;halal art lessons&quot; and &quot;haram art lessons&quot; is providing space for (or, depending on your point of view, expressing) the idea that what&#x27;s most important is to be a Muslim first and Chinese second.')
