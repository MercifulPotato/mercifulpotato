The Schiit devices are really nice and I like them.<p>Sennheiser also differentiates one of their lower models simply by stuffing a piece of foam into the ear cup to make it sound worse and then sells it cheaper than a more expensive model with the same driver. I find this to be a pretty disgraceful way to differentiate.<p>I think these Apple headphones are probably a better overall product at a cheaper price point. They&#x27;ve improved the beats products and the build quality is better than Sennheiser.<p>Audio stuff has a lot of snake oil around it and (ironically) a lot of extreme anti-brand tribleness that I&#x27;d argue is more irrational than what the parent comments suggests about buying Apple stuff. (Hatred for bose for example).<p>I think it&#x27;s more about signaling some sort of in-group status than about the products themselves.<p>All of that Sennheiser stuff is currently in a cabinet, because it&#x27;s a hassle to use and Airpods&#x2F;Beats studio work better day to day.')
