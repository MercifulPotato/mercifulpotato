However, this one does have some really useful historical information in it and is worth a read.<p>My issue with the &quot;this is a problem because of this one thing thinking&quot; is that we then solve for that one thing, thinking.  HEY THIS WILL FIX IT, and then someone else comes and games the system after we&#x27;ve changed it.<p>This is such a complex issue, the article addresses some but not all of the issues.  One is that the quality of your search is dependent on using the right keywords.  Not many google users think about it like that.  We think about search as if we&#x27;re talking to a person, and search isn&#x27;t quite there yet. The article is expecting Google to translate &quot;can eat&quot; to &quot;poisonous&quot;. I swapped the word and boom.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pets.thenest.com&#x2F;blueberries-safe-cats-8730.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pets.thenest.com&#x2F;blueberries-safe-cats-8730.html</a><p>First paragraph, easy to read and understand, I didn&#x27;t go any further down.<p>The problem is that searching by a sentence and extracting the intent of the user when using language is F-ing hard.  Then you want to build something that isn&#x27;t gameable with optimizations you didn&#x27;t intend and when you find them you need to fix them without degrading the quality of your product.<p>I also want to point out that this user wants a diversity of ideas to appear on Google, while there is active pressure to sensor people who do not have the authority to speak on certain topics, or who are quoting these mom and pop blogs.<p>If we compare this to the real world, and take restaurants&#x2F;stores.  There&#x27;s a McDonalds(lowes, walmart, etc) every 10 feet, but if you dive deeper you&#x27;ll find the locally owned restaurant on the corner that is delicious.  Can we use law to fix these issues?  Yeah, we can make McDonalds every 100 miles, every 20 miles, tax them, etc.  What are the side effects of our fixes and will the outcome be less desirable?  I did a fair amount of driving across the country in my younger days, and what I can tell you about McDonalds is it&#x27;s never amazing, but it&#x27;s also never awful.  I&#x27;ve eaten at some awful small town restaurants and I&#x27;ve also had some great ones.<p>On top of that, now I&#x27;ve got a kid who&#x27;s got an allergy, I can tell you exactly what he can have at any fast food chain because they have an allergen menu.  Not all restaurants know that information.')
