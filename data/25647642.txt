But I think if you understand and embrace that, there’s a place for it and it can be quite powerful and easy to use at times. It’s a trade off that makes sense sometimes. I think the problem appears when people treat Go like it doesn’t have any problems. All languages do.<p>As I’ve mentioned recently though, I don’t think I’d ever want to use Go as a forever solution to a complex problem. I’m sure some people could do it and do a great job, but I’m not one of those people. I need the ability to abstract and ensure more safety, or I’ll never feel secure with what I’m building.')
