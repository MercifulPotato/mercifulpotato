Orbital mechanics is very nonintuitive, there is very little drag at that altitude, and the speed doesnâ€™t really have any influence on how precise you can be.<p>With very few perturbations the object-in-motion-stays-in-motion becomes a powerful tool because you can use the fact that nothing changes to get crazy high precision by spreading your measurements over time.')
