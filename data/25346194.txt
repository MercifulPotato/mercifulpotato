Only thing I&#x27;m concerned about is the battery. My airpods are more or less dead now after 2 years and 8 months. They were not crazy expensive, but they worked fine up until the last few months. The Max is almost three times as expensive. If the battery stops working after 3 years I don&#x27;t think it will be worth it for me.')
