Especially governments that would like to disrupt other countries which have cultures that don&#x27;t like to be told what to do by their own government.<p>China, Russia and every other country has been given a wonderful blueprint for absolutely disrupting the US and really entire western order. The fact nobody seems to be talking about the national security implications of this virus and what our rivals or enemies have learned is frightening.<p>Can you imagine how fucked things would get if another virus struck the US right after we deal with Covid?')
