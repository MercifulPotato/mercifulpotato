As someone developing something similar, you would have thought about the problem a lot more than the casual reader and be able to provide insight others might not. I can relate to that.<p>However, it wasn&#x27;t clear to me that you were involved with Typesense. Re-reading it now I spot one reference at the very end. If it was instead tied in with your first reference it would come across more honest and make your observations more appreciated.')
