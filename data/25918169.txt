In 2019, it stood at 1.89%. Thatâ€™s over a 50% drop year over year... In other words, whether a drive was old or new, or big or small, they performed well in our environment in 2020.<p>If every drive type, new and old, big and small, did better this year, maybe they changed something in their environment this year?  Better cooling, different access patterns, etc.<p>If this change doesn&#x27;t have an obvious root cause, I&#x27;d be interested in finding out what it is if I were Backblaze.  It could be something they could optimize around even more.')
