Item(by='Supermancho', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606188971, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25187819, text='&gt; Why does someone always have to be in poverty in your world view?<p>The short answer is, &quot;because there has always been&quot;. The longer answer is about distribution, effort, and capability for populations. There&#x27;s also the issue of individuals who choose not to participate or concern themselves with their own well-being.<p>It&#x27;s almost assured that there is uneven distribution of goods in every economic model leading to a complete breakdown of availability for some.<p>In an egalitarian utopian socialist&#x2F;communist system, there are inadvertent gatekeepers who create an uneven distribution from corruption and opportunity cost. ie Distribution work that is hard is avoided when there&#x27;s plentiful and ongoing distribution work^.<p>Any economic system that is not explicitly egalitarian has gatekeepers by design and you end up with uneven distribution. I don&#x27;t see any way around these issues, even with automation...which has to be maintained by humans and you end up with the same issues.<p>^I think the USPO is an exceptional marvel as an egalitarian service which actually works, albeit by making cost&#x2F;benefit choices about what areas to cover. To whit, this is a compromise that still leaves some without mail service, akin to mail-poverty.')
