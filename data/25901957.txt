The likelihood of death or serious hospitalization for under 50s is much, much lower.  20-something men in the UK are much more likely to commit suicide, or die driving a car than dying from COVID, or having long-COVID (it&#x27;s something like 100x more likely IIRC but I can&#x27;t find a link right now).<p>&gt; Also if your media perception is shrill world then you might want to change your perceptions&#x2F;media channels.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what country you are in, but in the UK, at least, the closest to neutral reporting is the BBC, and only for its news bulletins.  For everything else, Sky News, newspapers, and so on, the whole approach is just unrelentingly negative, and point scoring against the Government and its advisors.')
