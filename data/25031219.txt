Those things (such as returning children - and generally crafting a custom endpoint for specific use-case) are indeed very easy in my language&#x2F;framework of choice (ASP.NET with a little help from LINQ).<p>I also get automatic generation of client-side data classes and strongly typed functions that encapsulate endpoints on the server using a small code generation framework that literally took 2-3 days to write (it&#x27;s really not that complex).')
