I don&#x27;t see what could be broken by copying the snapshot.<p>If you copy the snapshot, you lose all the intermediate commits you&#x27;re rebasing onto, because they&#x27;re not in the snapshot you&#x27;re rebasing.<p>&gt; The snapshot before the rebase is exactly the same as the snapshot after the rebase.<p>Which is exactly what you do not want.<p>&gt; The contents of the predecessor doesn&#x27;t matter, since a snapshot contains the entire state of the tree.<p>Which, again, is exactly what you do not want:<p><pre><code>    a - b - c - d\n              \\ e - f\n</code></pre>\nIf I rebase `d` onto `f`, I want the changes performed by `e` and `f` as well as those performed by `d`. If I just copy over the `d` snapshot to d&#x27;, I get the exact same state I had at `d` with a different history, losing the changes performed in e and f, thus reverting them.<p>That&#x27;s why when you rebase a commit, not only does the commit id change (makes sense, different parent) <i>the tree also changes</i>, which also makes sense because <i>the content changes</i>.')
