Item(by='jdeibele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609989847, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25660078, text='I have a niece who posts photos more to Instagram than to the family group chat (2&#x2F;3 iPhone, 1&#x2F;3 Android).<p>I don&#x27;t have any Facebook apps on my phone, tablet, or computer.   I use Instagram and Facebook with Firefox with them locked to a Facebook container.  For Instagram, I use User&#x2F;Agent Switcher to tell it that I&#x27;m on an iPad using Safari.  It works well except that Facebook won&#x27;t let me set up two-factor authentication and asks me every time to download the app.<p>Every once in a while Facebook asks me to join the Facebook and Instagram accounts and I refuse to do so.   I assume that they&#x27;re combining the data anyway.  But Facebook does let me use a security key as 2FA and I don&#x27;t want to lose that.<p>The major downside is that I can&#x27;t post to Instagram.  But that would bother me more if I were a better photographer or my kids were younger than teenagers.<p>I also use Fluff-Busting Purity (formerly Facebook Purity) and two kinds of ad-blockers (AdGuard DNS on the router, uBlock Origin in the browser).')
