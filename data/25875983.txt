Specifically selling it to a kid is not legal, because then you are specifically helping them commit a crime.<p>This seems reasonable.<p>&gt; Likewise I don&#x27;t blame steel mills for producing steel that is later used in guns wielded by dictators on their own people.<p>So far, a steady train of thought<p>&gt; I sure do blame the people that sell the guns to said dictators with full knowledge of their likely use case though.<p>This is a bit of a jump. Up to this point, you had a gradually growing line of argument, but then jumped straight to selling guns to dictators.<p>There&#x27;s a step right before, and that&#x27;s manufacturing the gun itself â€” is that acceptable in your view? I think most people agree that selling guns to dictators is bad, but whether or not the gun should be manufactured at all, and sold to police and militaries of countries with republican governments is debatable.<p>Palantir does not work with &quot;dictators&quot;. At least according to their IPO S-1 filing, as a matter of policy they only work with US and her allies. Whether you think that NATO states constitute &quot;dictators&quot; is an orthogonal and controversial claim. If you agree that NATO defense agencies and local police departments don&#x27;t constitute &quot;dictators&quot;, then you would agree that what Palantir is doing here, per your analogy, is &quot;making alcohol&quot;, but not &quot;selling it to a kid&quot;.')
