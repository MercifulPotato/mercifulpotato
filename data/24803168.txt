One method is by activating the tensor tympani muscles and tensing the front of my neck from my jaw (while making a frowning type facial expression - aka make yourself look like a cardassian) - that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it. There&#x27;s another way that involves tensing the base of my skull. I can also move my ears, so I wonder if being able to move that muscle plays into this.')
