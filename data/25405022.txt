Item(by='lultimouomo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607845847, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25393505, text='&gt; This is the certificate used to verify the identity of the cloud server. The file contains the “VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority – G5” root certificate. This means the only check performed when establishing a TLS connection to the cloud is if the provided server certificate has been signed by the Symantec&#x2F;VeriSign CA for Extended Validation (EV) certificates (CA pinning). A determined attacker could buy his own EV certificate and use it to impersonate a cloud server.<p>This part I don&#x27;t get. Do they mean the firmware verifies the CA but NOT that the cert is actually for the domain&#x2F;CN they want? If they made such a glaring mistake I would expect the write up to say it explicitly.<p>The way this is written seems to imply that all you need to impersonate a server is to buy a cert from the same CA it uses, which is obviously not the case.')
