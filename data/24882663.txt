If not, the following FREE book can serve as a great starting point for learning how to get your point across in the most clear, complete and concise way. Algorithms you see in elementary algebra (as opposed to, say, abstract algebra) and calculus are just that -- algos[0]. They teach you neither math, nor critical thinking.<p>Book Of Proof by Richard Hammack<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.people.vcu.edu&#x2F;~rhammack&#x2F;BookOfProof&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.people.vcu.edu&#x2F;~rhammack&#x2F;BookOfProof&#x2F;</a><p>[0] Obviously, I am not talking about the theory of algos where you design algos and consider questions of optimality and correctness.')
