Of course, the reasons are unclear to an outsider.<p>Migrations are an unavoidable in any system that is still evolving (i.e. not dead). Old designs turn out to be too limited or too slow for an evolved use case, so you migrate them to a new service or a new data structure.<p>If you try to avoid migrations by building The Perfect Things[tm] upfront, you get lost in overengineering instead.<p>In my own work, I do migrations with some regularity, and they all have a clear goal, it&#x27;s never what you call &#x27;some unclear reason of &quot;best practices&quot;&#x27;.')
