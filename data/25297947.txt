If you believe it to be impossible to work out, it is much better to just resign than to threaten to resign, which will almost always result in firing.<p>If you resign, you have the upper hand, can still get 2 more weeks of pay, possibly a couple of good recommendations for your next job, and then go write your blog posts after that.')
