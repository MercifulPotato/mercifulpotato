But I&#x27;m a software engineer and it&#x27;s an &quot;office worker&quot; union, so needless to say they take on a lot of stuff that&#x27;s totally irrelevant to me. But because I&#x27;m required to be in the union, I get &quot;represented&quot; anyway and &quot;get&quot; to go on strike and take a substantial pay cut to &quot;support my peers&quot;, none of whom I&#x27;ll work with or have similar life situations to mine.<p>To be clear, though, I have no issue if some people think they can improve their bargaining position by being in a union. That should be what a union is, after all. Where I do object to unions is when they come to dominate their field and turn actively hostile to outsiders who don&#x27;t play their game or, as in my case, arrange things so that people who don&#x27;t care to be represented by them have to be regardless in order to work in their area.<p>I am jaded by large&#x2F;exploitative corporations, but my way of dealing with that is to not work for large&#x2F;exploitative corporations.')
