My partner and i created a Solitaire clone for iOS, in a weird trippy mishmash of Windows 95 and Windows 3.11 visuals, including a lot of artistic licence for easter eggs.  Everything is lovingly pixellated, and the end game animation, well, we find it quite satisfying.<p>Featuring all the original card backs you know and love, no ads, no analytics, no nasties, and artisanally extracted bitmaps from the original cards.dll!  It&#x27;s perpetually free of charge to play.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;sol-exe-retro-solitaire&#x2F;id1542164345#?platform=iphone')
