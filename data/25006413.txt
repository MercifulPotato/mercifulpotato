Item(by='danjac', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604656012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25005608, text='The cognates are difficult, true - there are quite a few old Indo-European words if you know where to look (<i>kulta</i> - gold, <i>kuningas</i> - king, <i>ranta</i> from Swedish <i>strand</i>, i.e. shore). That said, once you&#x27;ve built up a core vocabulary, it&#x27;s quite easy to learn derived words. For example, <i>kirja</i>, <i>kirjasto</i>, <i>kirjoittaa</i>, <i>kirje</i> - book, library, write, letter. By comparison, you can see how much different all the equivalent English words are due to its mixed Germanic and French&#x2F;Latin vocabulary, and how much a challenge that makes for non-native learners.')
