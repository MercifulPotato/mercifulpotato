I started out with PC&#x27;s in the early 80&#x27;s.  They were HARD to use (granted, as a pre-teen, I fell in love right away - but I was already a nerd).  They were not intuitive.  They didn&#x27;t do very much. They generally sucked for most people, unless they were using a word processor (and even those were tough for some people)<p>Today, everyone can use one. They are very powerful, do a lot of things, and are comparatively simple to use - I mean, my MOM can use the damn things, which she never could have done in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s. And with very little support for me!')
