I don&#x27;t like this phrasing because it doesn&#x27;t identify what part of &quot;boring&quot; is important:<p>* Is boring tech good because older tech with lots of commits is more likely to have identified bugs?<p>* Is boring tech good because it is easier to find devs with skills in those areas?<p>* Is boring tech good because it has lots of fleshed out examples to follow&#x2F;SO support&#x2F;packages?<p>* Is boring tech good because it is simpler and has less moving parts?<p>Simply saying &quot;Postgres&quot; or &quot;JVM&quot; doesn&#x27;t imply boring either. Both of these have lots of advanced features and complexity. Your interactions need to be boring (simple, avoiding advanced features). Moreover it&#x27;s very powerful to make your application boring. What if your whole app could only read&#x2F;write data in one place? What if your whole app could be single threaded rather than multi-threaded (and still deliver results)? There are good reasons not to do these things, but those cases are rarer than the times we jump to these solutions which can create difficult problems that make our lives harder later')
