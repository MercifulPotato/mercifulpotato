The region has grown around 15-20% in the last 20 years.  From 1960 to 1980 region roughly tripled its population.  There&#x27;s a reason why prop 13 came about in the 70s.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it will always be a tech mecca.  But ignoring a majority of its history with tech just so you can compare it to Detroit seems disingenuous.')
