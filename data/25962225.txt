It’s hard to say how much adoption it’ll get, but with Intel focused on DPC++ and oneAPI now, there will definitely be more numerical software coming out in the next few years that compiles down to and runs on OpenCL.<p>For example, Intel engineers are building a numpy clone on top of DPC++, so unlike regular numpy it’ll take advantage of multiple CPU cores: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IntelPython&#x2F;dpnp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IntelPython&#x2F;dpnp</a>')
