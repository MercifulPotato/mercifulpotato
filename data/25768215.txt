This post is purely descriptive to give people some insight into the history from inside the company; I&#x27;m not commenting on who should have done what (although I was not directly involved, so if someone who was comments, take their word over mine).<p>Broadcom made an error of judgement here, but this incident fostered a deep distrust of open source, at senior levels, that persisted for more than a decade after; perhaps to this day.<p>Firstly at this point Cisco was, at the time,  Broadcom&#x27;s largest customer by a large margin. This caused huge tension in that relationship that was totally unforseen, and was very painful for a while.<p>Secondly, a at a certain point it dawned on Cisco and Broadcom that the GPL lawsuit was not like a normal business dispute , because businessmen after a certain point will settle for money even if they didn&#x27;t get everything they want. Sure a few people will keep going to the detriment of their own business, but most aim to make profit, not expound a principle. Many companies in the position of the FSF would have settled for a cut of the revenue. But the FSF wanted the source code released, and they were prepared to kill the business to get it. So Cisco and Broadcom had to concede. The source code was released, and OpenWRT was born.<p>The fallout, though was that subsequently Broadcom router ICs were designed with hardware accelerators which were separate from the main CPU. They were driven by separate CPUs on the same SoC that did not run linux and whose drivers could not be demanded under the GPL. none of the open source firmwares  can run these devices efficiently unless someone spends weeks reverse engineering them.')
