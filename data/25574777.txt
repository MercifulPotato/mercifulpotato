Perhaps I misunderstood you, as that is obviously absurd. While I do wish there were more healthy options, I can assure you that the mainstream grocery stores (Ralph&#x27;s, Safeway, etc) contain many products with low or no sugar.<p>Empowering people to make better decisions is actually one of the best things we can do. What is your alternative proposal?<p>I read nutrition labels, looking at the sugar content. I eagerly await the requirement to list the amount of added sugar, as it will inform my food purchases.')
