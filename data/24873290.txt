If one pays close attention to these threads every time they appear on HN (or elsewhere, be it social media or formal media), one may notice that the asserted descriptions are always very vague, and always only include the very worst&#x2F;silliest of ideas that exist within the communities - very often, ideas that really don&#x27;t have high consensus agreement in the actual communities themselves. And again, with no with no concern whatsoever for whether the assertions are actually true.<p>Wikipedia defines Qanon as &quot;QAnon[a] (&#x2F;ˌkjuːəˈnɒn&#x2F;) is a far-right conspiracy theory.[b] It alleges that a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles is running a global child sex-trafficking ring and plotting against US President Donald Trump, who is battling against the cabal&quot;<p>The ACTUAL TRUTH is that... there is not a cabal of Satanic pedophiles plotting against Donald Trump.<p>If you want to claim that there&#x27;s isn&#x27;t a firm consensus around Qanon supporters about the exact definitions of this conspiracy theory, I&#x27;m still going to go ahead and say anyone in this vague ballpark is missing a few marbles. Qualifying that Conspiracy Theory != False is not a valid argument to deny that this theory, and many others, are obviously false. Debating the semantics of what a theory is or isn&#x27;t to each subjective viewer is tiring and false and not a real debate.<p>I say missing a few marbles, and that&#x27;s rude, because most conspiracy theorists are genuinely suffering from a degree of paranoia and extreme distrust. They believe that others are lying to them, and affirmation of that belief is appealing. But they&#x27;re still terribly incorrect.<p>This happens on every type of definition, from Feminism to Socialism, to Nazism. If you want to have a nuanced discussion about aspects of QAnon in the context of what it means to you, you need to recognize that there&#x27;s not point in pushing the brand. You need to state specific issues with their own identity.<p>All the logic in your great wall of text is nullified and is more or less amounting to a reverse straw man. Implying that an outrageous claim has merit because a severely watered down version of it might be accurate.')
