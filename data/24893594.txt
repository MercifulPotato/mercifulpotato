And the house next to my parents&#x27; house had to be demolished and rebuilt because it had been constructed with Cobalt-60 contaminated rebar.<p>Decades later, just in our block, there have been many cases of cancer (1 renal carcinoma -- my mom, 1 testicular cancer, 1 melanoma, 3x breast cancer). Sometimes I wonder if that&#x27;s the natural incidence or if it is in fact a cancer cluster caused by remnants of Cobalt-60.<p>I&#x27;m tempted to go back there with a radiation counter of some sort, inside the houses, but I have no idea if a regular geiger counter would suffice (a neighbor who had a radiation counter for construction already checked it out and found nothing when I was a kid, but I&#x27;m not sure if he was using the right equipment or if it was sentitive enough. This was in the 90s, and the counter looked like a car battery with a single needle meter).')
