Item(by='p_l', descendants=None, kids=[25891862, 25891812], score=None, time=1611493281, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25891514, text='A friend recently tried to sell something small to UK, after January 1st 2021.<p>The end result is that the cost of doing business went so far out of scope he decided to simply stop any sales to UK, because UK wanted him to pay register for VAT and pay it. This is much more complicated than it sounds, not only because of the registration requirements.<p>Simply put, just figuring out <i>how the frak do we note the UK VAT on the invoice</i> started to sound more expensive than the sales lost by just ignoring UK. Because there&#x27;s no space in VAT system to put VAT twice, or at least no clear guidance could be achieved. And yes, he would need to put in VAT twice - first the 0% export declaration to Polish tax office, then somehow add the UK vat for UK, then figure out how to declare it so that the UK VAT collected isn&#x27;t taxed locally as income.')
