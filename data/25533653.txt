Also, I&#x27;m not counting it as &quot;opening online&quot; if you need to do any KYC anywhere physical. I&#x27;m talking about opening while abroad which requires showing your passport on a Zoom call. I am also not counting banks that I consider to be not real banks, such as Mercury among others, altho they will be fine for many people. But it&#x27;s not a real bank when you have a 5,000 or 20,000 USD daily spend limits and if sending a wire to China and getting one wire returned gets your account shut down (my experience). Any upstart bank which doesnt have it&#x27;s own banking license but instead used a partner bank is so scared of losing their partnership and so purely focused on growth that they dont want any &quot;difficult&quot; clients.<p>When did you open your last 3 accounts and which banks were they and how did you do the KYC? I would love to be wrong.')
