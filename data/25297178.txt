Back then it might have been amazing, nowadays it&#x27;s boring and every program has it, even my Firefox browser does.<p>A spellchecker is only a limited solution to the task of proofreading. I&#x27;ve never used the grammarly product, but at least from the ads it seems it can catch many things that human proofreaders would catch. There might still be domain-specific things that requires humans.<p>But the grammarly product has way more logic behind it than just using a simple table of words. No idea if it&#x27;s parametric or uses an ML language model, or maybe a combination, but the feature set wouldn&#x27;t be possible with just a table.<p>So instead of a lone employee being tasked to write a spellcheker, you suddenly have an entire industry focused on NLP. That&#x27;s how the growth of the computing industry looks like :).')
