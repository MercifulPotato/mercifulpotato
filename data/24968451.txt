That&#x27;s a very alarmist approach.<p>Hundreds (thousands?) of healthy people gets the flu in the US every year and die from it.  Not because they have a comorbidity, they just have a really bad reaction to the flu.<p>But we don&#x27;t assume that those edge cases are the most typical course of disease.  Yes, you may be one of those really unlucky ones that die from a normally non-fatal disease, but the risk of that is pretty low.')
