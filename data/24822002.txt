Perhaps I instinctively ignored it before because of the name. It looks like a crossbreed between Airtable and Jira, and it makes me wonder how well it&#x27;ll handle dense task lists... Still, thanks for mentioning it, I&#x27;ll take a closer look.<p>RE Jira - I&#x27;ve never seen a GANTT chart &amp; critical path pulled out of it, though I imagine management 2 layers above me had that option. That said, my experience with Jira was somewhat painful, with a rather slow and annoyingly click-heavy UI. Also, IIRC, tasks in Jira can only have one level of subtasks, and I don&#x27;t recall being able to form DAGs from them.<p>I imagine it&#x27;s hard to prevent featuritis in this tool category, when you&#x27;re addressing different hierarchy levels simultaneously. That said, there are many successful companies, like Trello, that thrive on delivering bare-bones, simplified tooling with perfected UX. I just wonder why there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything like that for a featureset that includes tasks forming DAGs, GANTT charts, computing critical path, and relative scheduling (e.g. &quot;task Y takes starts after X and takes 5 work days&quot;).')
