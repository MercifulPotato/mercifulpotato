I don&#x27;t know enough about Rust if that&#x27;s the case. To rephrase:<p>&quot;Rust was an obvious contender but it lacked good support for wlroots. there was a project which attempted to address this but they gave up after 12 months of work and 1000 commits. Rust&#x27;s strong safety guarantees and memory management conflict with wlroots which assumes a longer lifetime of pointers. If you unplug your monitor with wlroots this pointer receives an event that means the output has disappeared and needs to be validated (see here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;way-cooler.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;29&#x2F;rewriting-way-cooler-in-c.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;way-cooler.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;29&#x2F;rewriting-way-cooler-...</a>).*<p>This is strange because Rust positions itself as a system language so I&#x27;d have imagined these scenarios are all over the place and <i>unsafe</i> Rust would be the way most of this is solved?')
