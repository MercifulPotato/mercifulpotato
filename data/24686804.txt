It’s about the destructive force Palantir represents if it can go unchallenged while amassing deep connections to public sources of revenue in municipal police forces and national defense or intelligence agencies, and ultimately branching into corporate security and espionage and facilitate employers spying on employees.<p>Please quit helping the leadership of Palantir. It’s an awful, awful thing for the world - much more morally awful than rank and file corporate misbehavior. Palantir is a difference in kind - enabling &amp; facilitating a vastly more oppressive future and stamping out pathways to achieve privacy and individual liberty in a big data world.<p>Be the person who can proudly tell your friends and family, your children, one day when looking back that you had the courage to quit and you put society’s welfare above your own potential path to luxury.<p>To everyone else: don’t consider ever working for Palantir. Don’t be lured by the pay or fooled by a false depiction of the company mission. It’s not helping people. It’s not a civic duty. It’s not a positive force for the world.')
