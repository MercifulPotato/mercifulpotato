Contract law regularly supersedes first amendment concerns, e.g. even though courts are a part of the government, they are allowed to enforce NDAs.  Even outright restrictions of speech are often allowed; there are broad exemptions. e.g. it&#x27;s OK to regulate noise levels, even if you&#x27;re shouting protected speech - as long as the regulations are content neutral (and likely a host of other tests courts apply - again, IANAL).<p>A  state law regulating such contracts - which is in essence what this <i>might</i> be, as they concern EULAs - especially to the really limited extent that we&#x27;re talking merely about not <i>deleting</i> content for a short period of time, in a content neutral fashion - that doesn&#x27;t shout first amendment issue to me anyhow.  Even if it required (or strongly promoted) keeping content up, I&#x27;m not sure there would be an issue (though there might be).<p>Here, e.g. a quick google finds a link (hopefully a reliable source, but I&#x27;m not vouching for it...) about the kind of things that can survive a first amendment challenge: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mtsu.edu&#x2F;first-amendment&#x2F;article&#x2F;1023&#x2F;time-place-and-manner-restrictions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mtsu.edu&#x2F;first-amendment&#x2F;article&#x2F;1023&#x2F;time-place...</a> - <i>sounds</i> to me like requirements to keep content online temporarily to allow for dispute resolution would be no less impermissible that the converse which is already in the DMCA (effectively albeit indirectly requiring content to be taken down upon the mere accusation of copyright infringement). Also, the part about the takedown requests should give some idea as to technicalities that in effect regulate speech while technically not doing so, and those could be applied here too - DMCA after all does not require compliance with takedown requests, it merely makes it economically non-viable to fail to comply, even if the request is in bad faith.<p>While the first amendment may be spiritually related to laws like this, I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s a serious impediment either way, even if the outcome is a pretty serious chilling effect.  The loopholes are too large, and the first amendment simply too narrowly focused on government impositions to reliably protect from indirect restrictions. To be transparent: I&#x27;m not saying it couldn&#x27;t be a protection, just that I don&#x27;t see it as obvious, and since IANAL, I&#x27;m not comfortable <i>assuming</i> it&#x27;s a relevant factor here, although it certainly could be.')
