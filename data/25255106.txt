I was wearing a mask, and was walking by another older man who was also wearing a mask and standing at the exit. He was hacking and coughing so hard that the mask did nothing. I tried to hold my breath as I got until I got outside, but it was to no avail.  About four days later, I developed flu like symptoms. Sometimes, it doesn&#x27;t matter how smart or &quot;dumb&quot; you are, anyone can get it.<p>We may have an effective vaccine now, but it will be another six to nine months before you can go to your doctor and request the series as a normal person.')
