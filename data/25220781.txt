Whether it is cost efficient depends on yearly mileage and how good a deal you get, but itâ€™s a fact. My diesel E Class with 4 wheel drive burns considerably less fuel than my previous petrol Golf, while having better performance, more mass and greatly increased size. I would buy an electric, but they are just too damn expensive right now.')
