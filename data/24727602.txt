And you need permits and licensing to transport or store an explosive, but not to make (mix) it and use it immediately.  You can&#x27;t mix it at home, put it in your car, then drive to the gun range to use it.  However I would expect the feds to find a way to charge you if they found unmixed tannerite and pipebomb parts in your backpack.. maybe constructive intent?  I would hope so anyway.')
