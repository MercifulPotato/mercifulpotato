Orbit Fab is leading the way on providing the fuel depots, and a number of other companies are developing the robotics required to send servicing satellites in between Orbit Fab depots and the satellites they are filling up. Worst case, if the refueling is still a few years out by the time we need it, we would increase our orbit to extend our satellite lifetime (at the cost of lower spatial resolution).')
