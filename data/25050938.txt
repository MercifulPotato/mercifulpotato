I mean, yes of course its 45MB difference, but does this matter? We are not talking about applications downloaded to a browser (webapp) or to a mobile phone. In a time where I download &gt;50GB+ games on Steam and deploy from CI&#x2F;CD server or docker registries to my servers, is a size of 50MB or 100MB really a showstopper?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I totally love 4k and 64k demos and am always fascinated what could be packed into such small binaries, but in my professional life I think developer productivity, code quality and tooling is way more important than filesize. This is of course different if you are a webdev that ships .js, or an App developer publishing to Appstores.')
