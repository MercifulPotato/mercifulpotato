This in turn leads to any deficiencies or problems in the utopia needing to be papered over, ignored, and so forth because it <i>is</i> compulsory.  This causes yet more distortions and away we go.<p>It&#x27;s like all of those breathless journo articles about insect protein: they sound fine until the word &quot;replace&quot; comes in.  Maybe some folks are jazzed about eating bugs, but I am not, and would prefer not to have my meat replaced by insect protein to keep someone else&#x27;s utopia going, but someone is going to have the bright idea to make the choice for me.')
