This isn&#x27;t that complicated.  If I decide that I don&#x27;t want people wearing red shirts to enter my house, then that&#x27;s stupid, but within my rights and does not meaningfully infringe upon your right to wear whatever color shirt you want.<p>I don&#x27;t see how restrictions on what is allowed to connect to privately run servers can magically cause software to become non-free.  Nor do I see any way in which those restrictions existing (again on computers neither you nor I own) in any way violates the spirit of free software or in any way denies you and I the freedoms that free software is supposed to respect.')
