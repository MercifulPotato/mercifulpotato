I suppose then testing when itâ€™s possible to insert&#x2F;remove a contact card without disruption would give me a good idea of what to expect from a contactless card.<p>Thanks for the info!<p>EDIT: It seems like requesting a decryption, removing&#x2F;inserting a Yubikey while the pinentry screen is up, then entering the PIN does not work. I suppose I&#x27;ve broken the session then. So I&#x27;m guessing to use a ring form-factor card, I&#x27;d have to keep the ring above the reader during the whole operation, which means I&#x27;d have to remove it to place on the reader and can&#x27;t just keep it on&#x2F;tap when needed.<p>Hm. That&#x27;s a bit unfortunate.<p>(Also possible the Yubikey behaves differently as it&#x27;s both reader and card in one... I don&#x27;t have a dedicated reader set up to test with at the moment.)<p>EDIT 2: For anyone who comes across this later: no, a dedicated reader behaves the same way; once the pinentry prompt is open, you can&#x27;t remove the card and reinsert without invalidating that request.')
