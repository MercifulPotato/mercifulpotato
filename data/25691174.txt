Ad-free and supported by donations, the site would serve to connect the world (Facebook’s ostensible mission) without resorting to dark patterns or A&#x2F;B testing for addictive engagement. I think there are plenty of wealthy people out there who would love to support such a site, if it existed.<p>Technology-wise, such a site could be built today, no problem. I have no idea what to do about the network effects that comprise Facebook’s moat, however.')
