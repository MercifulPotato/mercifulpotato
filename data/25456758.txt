It&#x27;s not far off from the frequencies used in the standard FCC Part 101 licensed, 11 GHz FDD band plan for point to point high capacity microwave links.<p>One of the problems would be that detecting such a thing in an omnidirectional way would be problematic and difficult, the horn antenna described above would have the vast majority of its gain when aimed in one particular azimuth and elevation.')
