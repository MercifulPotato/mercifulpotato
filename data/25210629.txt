There were academic deals where you could get it for less, but that&#x27;s not what we are talking about.  And you could get a machine for $3k at least as fast in 1988; the 68030 was past it&#x27;s prime.  If by &#x27;NeXTstation&#x27;, you mean the &#x27;Slab&#x27; pizzabox NeXT, that was $5k list for the mono version, released in 1990, and had a 68040.  You could get a much faster machine for $3k in 1990.')
