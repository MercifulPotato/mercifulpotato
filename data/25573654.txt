As you might expect, you see your body below you: arms, lap, and bent legs. But it’s not &#x27;your&#x27; body, it’s a virtual one created by Mel Slater, a professor of virtual environments at the University of Barcelona, and his lab.<p>As you move, the virtual body you see through the VR headset moves with you. A large mirror faces you and if you wave, your reflection waves back. Blue bouncing balls appear and hit your wrists and ankles. You can feel their impact on your body—but which body? The line has become blurred between the &#x27;you&#x27; that’s wearing a virtual reality headset, and the digital &#x27;you&#x27; interacting with the balls.<p>As it turns out, it doesn’t take long for your consciousness to abandon your physical body and inhabit another one. It’s called a full body ownership illusion, and Slater says he and others are seeing that &#x27;this ownership of a virtual body is pretty strong, and it happens pretty fast.&#x27;&quot;')
