Vocabulary is over 90% identical, though I am sure top 500 words in both spoken dialects have a larger discrepancy. Alphabets are different, but they are almost bijectively mapped (only differ orthographically in digraphs like NJ&#x2F;Nj&#x2F;nj where Cyrillic has only Њ&#x2F;њ), and you may have missed it, but Serbian population actually uses Latin script for &gt;80% of all Serbian writing.<p>The article mentions a push to differentiate languages further, probably most evident in Croatia in early 90s.<p>But three students in Bosnia speaking identical language (grammar&#x2F;vocabulary thougj the script might differ) of 3 different nationalities would officially claim they speak three different languages. If you don&#x27;t see the absurdity in that, that&#x27;s up to you.')
