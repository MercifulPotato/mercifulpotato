That is not possible on an indefinite ongoing basis.<p>But we absolutely need restrictions. I&#x27;m not ready to say right now exactly what those restrictions should be -- they need to be based on science that we haven&#x27;t done enough of, and they probably need to <i>change</i> as we learn more about things <i>and</i> as we <i>observe</i> how different restrictions (as well as different accomodations like improved ventilation) effect spread (which may be different from one society to another).  We have barely yet begun to take seriously the need to seriously figure out <i>what</i> to do, instead of arguing about &quot;lockdown&quot; vs &quot;do nothing&quot;.<p>To my reading, you are still engaged in that odd dichotomous debate, advocating the &quot;do pretty much nothing&quot; approach, absoultely confident (based on what science?) that this is sufficient.')
