I don&#x27;t have the subscription anymore, so now it&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; a very complicated thermostat that probably depends on the company&#x27;s server just to turn my heat on.<p>The one bonus function it does have is a chart of temperature and humidity, so I can for example check how effective heat-limiting measures are vs last year.')
