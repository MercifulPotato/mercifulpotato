And why does the government draw this arbitrary line? Before we strawman me, I&#x27;m not advocating _all_ drugs become legal, but pointing out the absurdity of the legality of it all.<p>Decriminalization brings on a greater opportunity for rehabilitation without entering the legal system (which lots of people never escape from).
