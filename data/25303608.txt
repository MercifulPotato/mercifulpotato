It&#x27;s a massive blind spot that PG fails to address is that it&#x27;s the exact same sense of mission that he sees in start ups that creates the permission structure to exploit people.<p>It&#x27;s not that people set out to exploit people and as a result they become billionares. It&#x27;s that their focus on their goal allows exploitation to happen as a by product. It&#x27;s not that Uber set out to exploit drivers, it&#x27;s just that get their business to scale they had to lure drivers in with big incentives, and then in order to make their business viable they had to then force their costs down to the point where drivers are paid less than the cost of vehicle maintenance.<p>It&#x27;s just a bizarre primary school understanding or morality where there&#x27;s a group of &quot;Good&quot; people and &quot;Bad&quot; people.')
