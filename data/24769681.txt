This lets you experiment with your own custom pools or arenas without having to go all in and make something general-purpose that works for every object in your program.<p>&gt; Over the years, I’ve wasted many hours debugging memory issues. With just a hash table and a set of linked lists, you can track the history of all your allocations. That makes it pretty easy to track down use after free errors, double free errors, and memory leaks. Using guard pages around your allocations, you can detect overflows.<p>No, just use address sanitizer–it&#x27;s meant for this. Odds are your custom allocator might have a few bugs in itself and they will make you life more annoying if you&#x27;re trying to use it for only this.')
