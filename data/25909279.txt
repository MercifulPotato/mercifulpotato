If any of the participating pods die, the entire job halts and needs to be restarted.<p>Sounds like a strange approach for ML jobs - i mean you&#x27;d expect that all those parallel subtasks aren&#x27;t each individually midway interconnected with each other, and that the failed subtask can be easily restarted on its own. With thousands of subtasks running in parallel some are bound to fail for whatever reason. Their choice of MPI over HTTP suggests though that they pay a premium for latency and that suggests the subtasks actively cross-communicating, a typical case for MPI.')
