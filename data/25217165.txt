Why do multi-component systems undergo phase changes, why does it occur at the points at which they do, how could we design simple systems which, in sufficient quantity, exhibit useful properties upon phase shift?  What techniques can be used to predict or derive macro-scale emergent phenomenon from micro-scale complex interactions?  Why, exactly and with the same precision as quantum mechanics achieves, is more different?')
