Some discussions hint at satellite-grade sensors as a factor.[1] But they are also &lt;= 25% of the UAV inventory, much as F-22&#x27;s aren&#x27;t the bulk of our fighter force. So to avoid cherry picking, we could average across the entire airframe category (so all single-or-two seat fixed wing fighters vs all MALE UAVs). I haven&#x27;t crunched those numbers but I think the point would stand in that case: manned costs =&gt; unmanned, considering the large number of $50-100MM jets in service that drag up the average. That said, I would caveat the conclusion by pointing out that use cases and mission sets are significantly different. If we were building UAVs with the same capabilities as an F-35....it would probably cost as much as an F-35 too.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;navy-matters.blogspot.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;uav-triton-costs.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;navy-matters.blogspot.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;uav-triton-costs.h...</a>')
