A constant factor like this can be dealt with.<p>However, an increased rate of spread (R factor) is a change in the parameter of the exponential curve, and cannot be dealt with by any sub-exponential response. The only thing that could possibly work is to change the factor. Rapid vaccination or lockdown. It&#x27;s impossible to vaccinate the population of London in two weeks, which means a full lockdown is the only option now.<p>YC News is mostly a forum for software developers, which means that these notions ought to be familiar to most people here. When talking about software algorithms, we all learned about big-O notation. We all learned that Exponential time algorithms are (nearly) the worst case, and will always be worse for large data sets than a linear-time or quadratic algorithm, irrespective of the constant factor.<p>Essentially the new mutant strain changes the &quot;R&quot; term in Œò(a√óexp(R√óùë°)), whereas increasing the lethality is a change in the &quot;a&quot; term.<p>People are concerned about the lethality getting worse, but they shouldn&#x27;t be. This change in the infection rate is more scary.')
