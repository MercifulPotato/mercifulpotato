If you get a call from a woman telling you she&#x27;s fallen down and is hurt, how likely is it that EMTs are met at the door by a drunk man who claims nothing is wrong<p>This is<p>1. Exceedingly unlikely<p>2. A situation where escalating might be warranted, but the person who knocks on the door isn&#x27;t in imminent danger.<p>3. You wouldn&#x27;t bring a police officer to this call, but as you&#x27;ve so clearly pointed out, there&#x27;s a chance it could turn violent. The logical conclusion here would be that police should respond to <i>all</i> medical emergencies, but they don&#x27;t for reasons that become clear if you look into the history of how separate medical emergency response came to be.')
