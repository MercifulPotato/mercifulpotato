I say this not to argue that one, or both, or neither, has no reason to make that connection. I say this to illustrate that it&#x27;s easy to look at superficial signifiers - especially when saturated in fear - and enter the slippery slope of characterization and narrative-building that only deepens said fear, furthering the cycle.<p>Everyone wants to be able to read the tea-leaves. After World War 2 the world collectively asked itself, &quot;what the hell just happened?&quot; Psychological studies were performed to understand the mechanisms that could lead otherwise-decent people down such a horrifying path. Anecdotes were scrutinized for early warning signs that could have predicted what was to come. And I&#x27;m not saying that any of this was a waste.<p>But the reality is that no two societies, or trajectories, are exactly the same. There never has been and never will be another Hitler aside from Hitler himself. There have been and will be other tyrants, other psychopaths, other societal downfalls, but none of them will be exactly the same as that one was. And we should be very careful about looking at things through that lens, drawing conclusions based on rough impressions. The human mind is very good at squinting until things look right, especially when fear or preconceived notions are involved.<p>Be aware. Pay attention. There are real dangers to our society right now. But keep your head and don&#x27;t succumb to blind pattern-matching. Stay focused on <i>our</i> society, and don&#x27;t lump it in with a perceived archetype.')
