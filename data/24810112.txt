I work for the Census.\nIt is a highly dysfunctional organization. Nothing to do with current administration.<p>The various software the local offices use actively hinders the job of management and enumerators (the people who come to your door). Hundreds of and hundred of millions of dollars and incalculable time is wasted just due to this. Imagine the worst ERP or CRM that you have ever used, this is worse and approximately 250 offices use it across the country, and this inhibits the jobs of nearly half a million people.<p>Talk to any Area manager, Lead Census Field Manager&#x2F;Field manager, Office Operation Supervisor, or Office Clerk. They will tell you how they have to fight the software to get their job done.<p>Truth is the Census could be done with half the people. There is plain incompetence in middle and higher management. Those making decision on software and marketing seem to have no understanding of the job those in local offices do. It is so bad local offices don&#x27;t really have an accurate idea who even is still employed in the field working cases.<p>Why doesn&#x27;t this change? Nobody wants to lose their job. Middle management wants numbers and to hit goals. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the numbers are actually accurate. Often they will not be. Notes about cases (organizations we are trying to count their people&#x2F;or individual housing units) pile up inside systems that nobody has time to read. It is easier to close a case then actually resolve it and accurately count people.<p>Not only is there no incentive to do the job correctly, it will actually get you in trouble if you do things right.<p>Yes this is a random throwaway account on HN. But to verify just ask nearly anyone who works for the Census.  I hope to post more on this later when I have time. Feel free to ask any questions.')
