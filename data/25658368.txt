I believe that more than 3 million people have their DNA in the police database, which is about 5% of the entire population.<p>The article says that China intends to get the DNA of 10% of its male population, which is about 5% of its entire population, so actually about the same as what exists to day in the UK.<p>The difference, and actually interesting aspect, is that, according to the article, China intends to do that &quot;pro-actively&quot; and in a way that would allow them to link its entire make population. Does that mean that they have an algorithm to decide who to collect DNA from to reach that goal or are they doing at at random?')
