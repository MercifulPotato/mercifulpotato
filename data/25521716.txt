The geo-information platform at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;map.geo.admin.ch&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;map.geo.admin.ch&#x2F;</a> has been online for a few years now (for free), and contains an incredible amount of geodata. For example, check out this query with protected areas that might be relevant for wild camping: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2WJwXo6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2WJwXo6</a> (URL shortened because it&#x27;s huge)<p>However, if you wanted to integrate this data into your own application, that was always a paid offering. The Swisstopo people were always quite open about their data, and - from what I heard - wanted to share more of it for free. However, because they&#x27;re a federal agency, they can only do anything if they have a legal basis for that action. And there was no legal basis for &quot;developing maps and applications using tax money and giving that away for free&quot;, they needed to cover their costs. The mindset used to be &quot;don&#x27;t waste taxpayers money&quot; and not &quot;open up data for the benefit of the society&quot;.<p>Now, with OGD strategies being adopted more and more, this has changed and Swisstopo has the legal right to make a deficit with their map offerings.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to finally get access to gorgeous raster tiles and highly accurate elevation data! Thanks Swisstopo :)')
