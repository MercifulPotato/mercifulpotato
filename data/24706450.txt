The problem I ran into was as soon as you have one thing on the page that can&#x27;t survive the reload, you can never reload again. Cue 3k lines of JQuery and regret.<p>I think of it this way, would you stream pre-rendered markup to a native iOS, Android, or Windows app? The thought of it is crazy, who would ever do that.<p>I think most people agree that the web is getting closer to native all the time. I think we&#x27;re reaching the pivot where you&#x27;re better off using React and co for any kind of interactivity. Page reloads are already used in media to portray slow&#x2F;old websites. I don&#x27;t see that getting better')
