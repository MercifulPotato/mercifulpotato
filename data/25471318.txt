It turns out it&#x27;s nothing like that, it&#x27;s more like a new Deus Ex game.<p>I think we&#x27;re living in different worlds or something. This game is exactly like a GTA game, and nothing like Deus Ex.<p>It&#x27;s an open world game (Deus Ex games are strictly linear with open <i>level design</i>, not narrative, something Warren Spector was extremely adamant about). It&#x27;s got the atmosphere of a futuristic GTA Miami Vice rather than the industrial atmosphere of a Deus Ex, and worldbuilding wise there&#x27;s little about the game that touches on heavier issues, whereas politics goes through all Deus Ex games quite heavily.')
