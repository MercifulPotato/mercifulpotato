Sorry, this is a total non sequitur, but I was trawling my comment history and saw your reply to my comment. HN doesn&#x27;t let me respond to a 60 day old comment, so... here I am, I found you somewhere else! You mentioned &quot;infinte pan zoom graph based window manager&quot; as part of your response. Thanks, I think you totally got what I meant.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s essentially an OS scale problem to solve and I&#x27;d be chipping away at it endlessly (and that&#x27;s if I have my way!). But I do believe the AR revolution is coming and it will wash over us like a tsunami and make the recent smartphone revolution look like a fad. I think we don&#x27;t already have this kind of software yet because endless 3D graph-connected space is potentially clunky to explore on tablet&#x2F;display.<p>It&#x27;s already a foregone conclusion to me that this barrier will be obliterated by XR and it will be deeply intuitive and liberating to move beyond 2D interfaces. We actually <i>must</i> move beyond 2D interfaces in order to even reasonably support visual cues of dynamic relations. Only when your structures are represented as nodes in a shared context can you allow users to manipulate relationships between arbitrary things.')
