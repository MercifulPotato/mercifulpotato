In an ideal world, accessibility would come for free - but unfortunately it does not.<p>Yes I would argue that morally projects should do their best to support it - but even at well established companies it takes significant resources to maintain accessibility. Yes in this case it may be as simple as using native Buttons, as the above comment said, &#x27;that&#x27;s as far as I got&#x27;. Just pretending that accessibility isn&#x27;t a significant time an resources doesn&#x27;t make it any less so. If this wasn&#x27;t true then there wouldn&#x27;t be legislation to essentially address this market-failure.')
