I suppose this is also a bit different than just toggling connectivity on the device, since for some time the app and OS both still think the connection is in tact when it&#x27;s already physically gone, so it may even be useful to help expose other issues this way.<p>One of the things that&#x27;s easy to take for granted these days when working on desktop or server software is a mostly stable network connection, but on mobile this goes completely out the window, or down the elevator shaft as the case may be. :)')
