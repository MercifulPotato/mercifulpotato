If anyone has any clue as how to do so, please share.</i><p>If you have been accused of racism that&#x27;s because somebody has an example of you being racist. If you did not have racist intent you can clarify your intent. Simply claiming you&#x27;re not a racist won&#x27;t do because pretty much everyone accused of racism makes that claim (example: central park dog walker, or any other person in the news accused of racism).<p>Edit: I am talking about instances where the facts are not in question. For example, you did not hire Xyz, and you&#x27;re accused of racism.')
