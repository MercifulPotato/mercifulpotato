The prohibited act is really the order, i.e. participation in a conspiracy to commit an act of violence, and the communication is only the evidence of it.<p>Compare mob boss who says &quot;whack that guy&quot; and goes to jail for it vs. news reporter who reports that mob boss ordered a hit, unintentionally informing a hit man who wasn&#x27;t aware of the order. News reporter doesn&#x27;t go to jail for that because their intent was only to communicate information, not enable the act of violence.')
