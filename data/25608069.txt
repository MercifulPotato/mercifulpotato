The market preferring something doesn&#x27;t mean most people dealing with it like it, it means that it makes money for the people with most say in the matter.<p>In this case, I think the sufficient explanation for the phenomenon is that HOAs are good at protecting property values. In my experience, most of the silly &#x2F; annoying rules can be explained by either protecting property value, or by most people being too busy to attend meetings, allowing a small group of bored people to take control.')
