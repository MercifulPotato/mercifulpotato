The developer is super responsive, takes to criticism very well, and engage with you when you have a feature request. Took him less than a month to have PGP encryption support added, from conversation to production.<p>It is relatively new and has not been updated since October, though, so keep that in mind.<p>If you want simple and do not want to self-host at all, then Help Scout[4] is your best bet. Their support leaves a lot to be desired, but their product makes up for it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cerb.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cerb.ai&#x2F;</a><p>[2] I self-host it, personally, but their cloud offering is pretty good.<p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullhelp.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullhelp.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.helpscout.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.helpscout.com&#x2F;</a>')
