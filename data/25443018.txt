No journalist bothered to realize that malaria infested places rarely have electricity to run that machine.<p>Then he wrote a U$ 600 book (Modernist Cuisine) on how to make over-pretensious risottos and steaks using over-expensive equipment and chemistry. No serious cook follows any recipe in that book anymore.<p>Now his next trick to show off is snowflake pictures.<p>Yep, the man surely has both the know-how and the money to put up an irrelevant and pretentious show-off.')
