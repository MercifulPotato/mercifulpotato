I&#x27;d say that the experience has been great, but with some caveats that don&#x27;t really apply to you.<p>A lot of the celebration you&#x27;ll see about remote work is going to come from those who couldn&#x27;t afford space in places like SF &amp; LA who are now <i>thrilled</i> that they can afford a house somewhere cheaper. I am personally included in this category, as houses in ID are much cheaper than CA. It&#x27;s really hard to overstate how much of an impact space has on one&#x27;s quality of life, but that might not be strictly relevant to you since you&#x27;re effectively stuck in place either way.<p>Second, I&#x27;m pretty senior. There is a pretty big difference between starting your career out remote and settling into remote work once you&#x27;re already established. It seems like starting out remote would be a bit tougher early on in your career, but I&#x27;ve only experienced being remote while managing.<p>On the whole, I personally love working remote, and have no intention to stop. This is actually pretty surprising to me, since I had a <i>terrible</i> experience with a prior remote job, as the job was both bad (for reasons unrelated to remote) and I was the only remote worker. Coming to enjoy remote work over the length of the pandemic was a surprise to me.<p>My only piece of advice: don&#x27;t be the only remote person. Try to at least get onto a team that is 100% remote together, so that you won&#x27;t end up being isolated.')
