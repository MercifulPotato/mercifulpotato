I iterated a simulation of 10000 cases, discarding every case where the second random door reveals a car (because this breaks the game; at this point there is nothing to guess anymore) and it gives a probability of winning of only 0.42 if you switch. So it&#x27;s neither 1&#x2F;2 nor 2&#x2F;3. Curious!')
