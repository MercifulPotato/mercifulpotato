You&#x27;re not concerned with MPLS or whatnot when you rent a server.<p>I can tell because I&#x27;m running governmental websites on this kind of servers actually, with over a thousand admins managing thousands of user requests. I&#x27;ve been deploying my code on servers like that for the last 15 years and it was great really, also got fintech&#x2F;legaltech project in production and much more.<p>I guess the project you&#x27;re describing falls more in the 0.1% of projects than 99.9%.')
