Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25417092], score=None, time=1607877697, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25405248, text='&gt; Is that Homo Economicus driving the delivery truck?<p>Is it too far of a leap to expect that someone who knows they&#x27;re doing something where lives are at risk and time is of the essence will rightly estimate that the optimal travel speed is in excess of the ordinary speed at which accountants commute to their office buildings?<p>&gt; You&#x27;d expect a machine that saves a life every 5 seconds to have some kind of investment in redundancy. Either is spread over more machines or the wonder device has spare parts that are kept stocked.<p>You might think that, but in reality, humans are fallible and don&#x27;t always have perfect foresight.<p>Maybe they had a spare on site, but the spare was defective, or was the wrong revision number and incompatible. Maybe the part is a filter, but the problem is that there are a hundred times more pollutants than normal, so they already used all their spare filters and need twenty more ASAP. Maybe the machine is the backup generator for a hospital, which was damaged by the same lightning strike that caused the power outage.<p>&gt; And if not, I&#x27;m sure parliament could pass a law to clear the streets for the day.<p>The scenario is the machine goes offline so the company immediately calls the shop with the part who immediately leaves to deliver it. It&#x27;s a five minute drive at the speed limit, but meaningfully less if you exceed it.<p>The police response time is six minutes, they can&#x27;t help you. Your suggestion is for <i>parliament</i> to <i>enact legislation</i> in that amount of time?')
