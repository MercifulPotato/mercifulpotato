God has helped me be psych med free since 2014 even caffeine, not mormon btw. For me, it was a lack of knowing what was better out there that encouraged me to take them, and finally ended up in a hospital needing all kinds of treatments for adhd&#x2F;bipolar etc. Needing to recover from things that only &#x27;bad people&#x27; did. Eventually with doctor&#x27;s approval was how the medication was removed, after a person came and prophesied for me to stop medications, at a moment the Lord had impressed that it would happen, interesting long story [1].  I had to learn to lead an orderly life and work with doctors while in treatment. It&#x27;s really nice to be free from the illness and the meds, though grateful for the meds (at the end it was only a small amount of haldol vs lots of zyprexa at the beginning) when they were needed, However it can be an encouragement in the Lord Jesus to people.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundcloud.com&#x2F;brianlovejesus&#x2F;testimony-of-jesus-working-me-outwards-of-my-rotten-life" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundcloud.com&#x2F;brianlovejesus&#x2F;testimony-of-jesus-wor...</a>')
