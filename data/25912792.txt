After the first half of the first season they tone down the Joe MacMillan character to be less of a kind of over the top trope anti-hero and more of a real character with depth and things get better. They&#x27;re not <i>bad</i> early on, but you&#x27;d probably notice that and it&#x27;s worth watching anyway.')
