I mean, with the KS money you have to 1) fulfill the backers, 2) create additional inventory to sell. But at a certain point while you&#x27;re selling your inventory you need to start manufacturing another batch and you need money for that. Tl;dr: 3x your production costs, don&#x27;t 2x them.<p>It&#x27;s not a huge issue, but that means you can do a smaller 2nd batch and you risk to run out of stock, which we did.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a good problem to have... it&#x27;s just extra work and we could have optimized better.')
