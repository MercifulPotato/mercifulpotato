A hammer can cave someone&#x27;s head in, better forbid that. People can drown in water, better forbid that too. After all, we wouldn&#x27;t want to be inconsistent.<p>It&#x27;s not like we would ever consider using any kind of judgement and conclude that the benefits outweigh the risks for some things. That&#x27;s just silly.')
