Some of the drivers need that, so they lose work.<p>There&#x27;s nothing about having a staffing company involved that <i>forces</i> drivers <i>not</i> to pick when they work or how often or where. When you&#x27;re a contractor, your contracting company cannot enforce those things, however, when you&#x27;re an employee, you absolutely can have those things -- or not -- at the discretion of your employer subject to the terms of your employment relationship.<p>All having a staffing agency involved does is force a minimum wage, and an employer-employee relationship. They, the staffing company, take on fares from Uber and disperse them across their drivers. They pool the fares to provide a minimum wage and benefits, and then anything else above that gets distributed to the driver who created the specific revenue as &quot;incentive pay&quot; in exactly the way the parent suggested. Or as profit sharing proportional to work performed.<p>There&#x27;s nothing crazy or unprecedented about this.<p>tl;dr: The company contracting you cannot tell you when and how to work, an employer <i>can</i> -- but does not <i>have</i> to.')
