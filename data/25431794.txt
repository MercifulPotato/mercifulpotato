The glasses certainly have the most long term potential, but imagine the phone becoming more about wireless radio and less time in hand.  The watch loses some functionality to become smaller and have longer battery life. Maybe you move heart rate or blood sugar monitoring to a separate device, like a ring, and people can cherry pick which ones they like.<p>Or the phone merges into the watch and goes away entirely, some of it into the band. Apple had a patent on incorporating batteries into the watch band, but they never did anything with that. Pity.')
