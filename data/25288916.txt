Thankfully, that particular issue is fixable by disabling javascript.options.wasm and javascript.options.wasm_trustedprincipals in about:config as a temporary solution.<p>I fully expect these to be fixed, but it&#x27;s clear it&#x27;s gonna be a few weeks&#x2F;months before everything runs right. If I were a non-technical user, I&#x27;d be returning it for an Intel Macbook.')
