HN is well-moderated and has high information density compared to most subreddits, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the information is <i>correct.</i> What you see on HN is that both correct and incorrect comments tend to adopt the same academic affect in their writing. If you&#x27;re not fairly familiar with the subject at hand, it&#x27;s hard to tell who knows what they&#x27;re talking about because it all sounds coherent and reasonable.<p>If you really want a lark, read the typical HN subthread on a topic involving trading, finance or economics. It&#x27;s like watching the YouTube-educated spar with the Wikipedia-educated. Commenters with real world experience are downvoted just as often as they&#x27;re upvoted when they try to earnestly correct mundane misconceptions.<p>Likewise you can&#x27;t have a bug bounty story on HN without someone repeating the farce that web app vulns have some sort of shadowy black market. There is invariably a comment near the top claiming the security researcher could have received so much more money by selling it to criminals. It is amazing that something so wrong gets repeatedly so carelessly and easily.<p>These are a substantial number of people here who think they can confidently talk about anything if they just deconstruct it to first principles and treat it like something else they know about.')
