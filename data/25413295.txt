It is alcohol, and to a lesser extent other drugs.  Lethal accidents are the norm at 3am, not rush hour. And we have to be careful about causation statistics.  A drunk will be speeding, but the accident is the result of the drunkenness rather than speed as there was no rational choice to speed.  Nor was it reckless driving.  Stop letting people get behind the wheel after drinking.  Solve that problem.  All the other sources of accidents are secondary at the moment.<p>And use seatbelts.  I am constantly shocked by how many americans still refuse to do so.  Seatbelt use in back seats was still not manditory when i lived in new england.<p>&quot;Depending on which state a driver is in, not wearing a seat belt in the front seat is either a primary offense or a secondary offense, with the exception of New Hampshire, which does not have a law requiring people over age 18 to wear a seat belt. In the front seat, the driver and each passenger must wear a seat belt, one person per belt. In some states, such as New York, New Hampshire, and Michigan, belts in the rear seats are not mandatory for people over the age of 16.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Seat_belt_legislation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Seat_belt_legislation</a>')
