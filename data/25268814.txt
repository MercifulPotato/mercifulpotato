I have a limited set of experience since I&#x27;ve only worked since 2013. But, I&#x27;ve interviewed <i>every single year</i> for the last 7 years and the interviews keep getting tougher. Every time I decide to venture out - I have to prep more than I did the previous year. This year is obviously an exceptional year but I feel it&#x27;s only going to set the bar for the future. I don&#x27;t see them lowering the bar since enough people are <i>still</i> clearing it.<p>&gt; Do workers in other industries get constant messages via Linkedin and email for job opportunities?<p>This means nothing to me, honestly. Most of the messages I get are spam recruiters. I suspect maybe 5% of recruiters are accountable for 95% of recruiter spam. As me and my peers pretty much all get the same emails.')
