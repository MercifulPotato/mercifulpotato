The OS has become one such product. Windows has been planning this for some time now: where is Windows 11? OSX has catchy release names but has reverted to macOS - no number. You’re right, change is slow, but I don’t think it’s an unreasonable statement. Large organizations will eventually catch up and&#x2F;or roll their own solutions with internal devops teams. HPCs are already so highly specialized I’m not sure what the difference would be, and as virtualization performance continues to improve I think we will see a gradual, but not complete, shift from aggressive compiler optimization for niche architectures and configurations.')
