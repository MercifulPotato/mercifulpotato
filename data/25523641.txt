If you’re drawn to the beauty and nuance of fonts, you start to develop preferences and appreciations for details. If you’re simply utilitarian in your font use (which is perfectly fine, of course), you probably don’t care about much beyond legibility. I find some fonts aesthetically beautiful, and some awful (Comic Sans is in the middle for me, though closer to awful), but I don’t expect others to share my tastes: I like jazz and filling out tax forms, too.')
