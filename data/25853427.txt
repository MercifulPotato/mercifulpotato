(1996)", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='&quot;The Demon Haunted World&quot; (1996) Chapter six has this passage &quot;Occasionally, I get a letter from someone who is in &#x27;contact&#x27; with extraterrestrials. I am invited to &#x27;ask them anything.&#x27; And so over the years I&#x27;ve prepared a little list of questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. So I ask things like, &#x27;Please provide a proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.&#x27; Or the Goldbach Conjecture. And then I have to explain what those are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. So I write the simple equation with the exponents. I never get an answer.<p>So, what question would you ask, mathematical or other, to determine if the aliens are more advanced than humans?<p>Or, what question would be most useful to know the answer to?')
