First he imprisoned hundreds of thousands of muslim Uighurs for &quot;reeducation&quot; and left their unprotected families and wives to be raped by Han men in Xinjiang province and now he attempts to erase the historical record of a near-mythical figure that everyone in the Western  and Eastern worlds knows of. But certainly Xi has read the poem &quot;Ozymandias&quot;?<p>Xi&#x27;s killing, although qualifying as genocide, is paltry compared to that of Genghis Khan, who killed more people on some days than Xi has killed in a lifetime. Perhaps Xi is jealous.')
