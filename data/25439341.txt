I love the story. I love Night City. I love the graphics. I won&#x27;t lie and say I&#x27;m a huge Cyberpunk pen &amp; paper fan; I&#x27;m not. I knew more about Shadowrun than Cyberpunk, and that was from the old SNES game and Shadowrun Returns. However, I&#x27;ve talked with hardcore Cyberpunk pen &amp; paper players, and they say its un-fucking-believable how well CDPR has brought to life the Cyberpunk universe in this game.<p>Yes, there are bugs. I have every confidence though that CDPR will iron all this shit out like they did with The Witcher III. This will be a great game by mid-to-late 2021, in every sense of the word.<p>I genuinely hope in Cyberpunk 2077 II that they&#x27;ll be able to flesh out the game world, because I really love this game and this world.')
