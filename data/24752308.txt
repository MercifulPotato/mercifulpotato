A sports game is also the wrong analogy because sports games have very clearly defined rules, specifically to avoid referees picking winners.<p>Governments are nowhere near that level of rigour or coherency, especially if you look at EU anti-trust. The USA at least requires the government to demonstrate some actual harm to consumers in court. EU anti-trust requires a single bureaucrat to decide that <i>competitors</i> were harmed, and they can then levy any fine they like which goes straight into the EU Commission&#x27;s coffers. It can only be appealed in some sort of court after the fine is paid, and the court is packed with judges who want to see the EU expand (via spending), so that&#x27;s cold comfort.<p>That approach is incoherent: the whole point of capitalist competition is that the better firm in some sense harms the weaker firm by taking away its customers. And giving the referee the power to transfer money from the competitors to their own pockets at will, without needing to convince anyone else at all, is clearly an enormous conflict of interest.<p>Many arguments about anti-trust do implicitly assume the US model, which at least has some tenuous connection to harm to the general public. That isn&#x27;t really true internationally, yet ramped up anti-trust in the USA would absolutely be taken as a green light by other parts of the world to whack US firms with enormous fines for conduct that isn&#x27;t actually bad in any way.')
