Normally, I would say no way, cutting their funding is beyond the pail.<p>On the other, these politicians have been raising millions of dollars in the last few months, very openly, on verifiably false information (that the election was stolen and that they were going to fix it).<p>So I&#x27;m not sure I see it any differently than a processor cutting off funding for any other scam operation out there.<p>Add to that the results were not just taking money from scammed donors, but ended up lending enough credence to the lies to incite a riot.<p>Edit: sorry, I completely misread what the article was saying. Those banks are halting their own PAC donations. I thought they were refusing to process donations for all PACs for those politicians. They are of course free to donate how they please.')
