He&#x27;s lurking there and typing occasionally &quot;Hi&quot; when he feels I might be there. I know that if I answer immediately, I&#x27;ll lose half an hour of my life. So after seeing the message I deliberately wait a few hours, and then answer &quot;hi&quot; and immediately log out.<p>I consider it rude to demand someone&#x27;s attention for an extended period of time without asking for it first. At the beginning of synchronous communication I always ask &quot;Can I take N minutes of your time?&quot; - this allows the interlocutor to evaluate the situation and make an informed decision.<p>At the same time I feel we should develop the culture &quot;it is perfectly fine to be a nice and well-behaved person and not to answer phone calls at all, only returning them when possible&quot;.')
