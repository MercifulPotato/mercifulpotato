Item(by='bavila', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603150802, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24831142, text='&gt; An example is responding back to a message with &quot;Ok.&quot;. I see many over, say, 50 do this much more often, but to many under, say 30, this is taken as very passive aggressive.<p>I can see how some might take a single &quot;Ok.&quot; that way, but it probably really does depend a lot on context and the nature of the relationship. I tend to acknowledge most people&#x27;s comments in a very mater-of-fact manner, but I feel adding a simple &quot;thank you&quot; (as in &quot;Ok, thank you.&quot;) helps to dispel the raw bluntness of a plain &quot;Ok.&quot;<p>&quot;Please&quot;, &quot;sorry&quot;, and &quot;thank you&quot;--these magic words can work wonders.')
