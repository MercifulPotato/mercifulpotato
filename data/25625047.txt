When I&#x27;m using it, I miss the tools I have in Smalltalk and Lisp environments.<p>When I use Smalltalk or Lisp, I don&#x27;t miss pry or the other tools I have when working with Ruby.<p>I do like Ruby, though. I probably like it better than any other language that isn&#x27;t made of s-expressions. (Well, I like ML a lot, too.)

As far as I can tell, though, it&#x27;s dormant.')
