There would be skipping or a loss of sync between audio and video on some heavier clips that didn&#x27;t happen on MPC.<p>But what I primarily remember in making the switch was that VLC could play <i>everything</i> I threw at it, right out of the box, without installing a bunch of sketchy codec packs. And that also allowed me to basically just throw the VLC binary onto my flash-drive, and then be able to open any videos as needed from parents&#x27;&#x2F;friends&#x27;&#x2F;school computer by just plugging in the usb stick. It was definitely a game-changer.')
