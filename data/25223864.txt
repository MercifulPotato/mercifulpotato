I mostly use print statements, simply because a) every environment has them, b) there is much less (none) fiddling involved to set them up, and c) because debugging is rarely needed anyway, assuming you are working on your own &#x2F; your team&#x27;s code (and that you are half good). I think the last time I have used a debugger was on what I think would be a definition of spaghetti code - not proud of it, but I did learn not to do that. :)')
