I mainly use cypress for high level UI testing and I mock my sever.<p>I found the server mock tool (route and route2) brilliant. I find the syntax for browser commands easy (visit, click, get). Using mocha with should and chai is fine.<p>Anyways, apart from some minor problems (you can&#x27;t select a single test to run), I really love cypress. Compared to last time I used selenium, it&#x27;s such a difference. Especially that cypress just seems to be one holistic package that works. Can&#x27;t say the same for selenium.')
