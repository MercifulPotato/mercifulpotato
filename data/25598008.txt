This requires cooperation from all the telcos and would require business changes, process changes and code changes to systems so that you could approve-list what is a mobile network NPA&#x2F;NSX and deny-list what is not.  This just means spoofers would only be spoofing mobile numbers.  Now you have a game of whack-a-mole.  Some of these systems are so old that the people that wrote code for them are long gone.  I am not saying that is universally true of course.  Some switches had fairly modern hardware.  But unlike the internet where everything peers with bgp and information &#x2F; routing information is freely shared, there is a lot more manual work and manual changes and coordination required.  Even if you could update all of them, now you have to maintain yet another real time deny-list and that does not really solve spoofing.')
