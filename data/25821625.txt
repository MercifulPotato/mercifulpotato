I know from experience, and so do you, that far leftists gleefully celebrate any little damage they can inflict on their ideological opponents, including petty things like malicious flagging and mass downvoting to supress differing opinions.<p>I understand you&#x27;re trying to &quot;draw me out in the open&quot; or whatever you guys call it these days, so you can cancel me, too. So no, what is telling is that almost all conservative or libertarian comments on this board are made from throwaways.<p>The original comment was meant as a warning to young conservatives who naively belive honesty and good intentions will save them. The fact that my predictions were accurate should speak for itself.')
