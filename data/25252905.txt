Might just be the circles I run in, though.<p>I personally recommend Python (using NumPy, SciPy, MatPlotLib&#x2F;Seaborn, Pandas, Keras&#x2F;PyTorch, Gensim, etc). There’s a lot more that you’ll need to bolt together yourself, but there are packages for pretty much anything you’ll likely need to do in terms of math&#x2F;science&#x2F;analysis&#x2F;ML.<p>That’s not to say that you shouldn’t advocate for Octave, though! I haven’t used it other than to poke around, but it seems like a great package.')
