The thing that makes me sad is that this is only correct if the EM&#x27;s director agrees with it. The true bullet point of what is expected of an EM: whatever the EM&#x27;s boss expects.<p>I&#x27;m currently writing down a lot of the management lessons and coaching I usually give new directors as they learn their craft.
