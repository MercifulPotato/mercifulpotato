In fact it just demonstrates the music industry&#x27;s rent seeking.<p>They managed to maximize their <i>revenue</i> when they had sole control of distribution. For most musical acts an &quot;album&quot; is one or two singles with a bunch of filler. Anyone wanting to buy those one or two singles <i>had</i> to spend $8-15 on a cassette or CD.<p>When iTunes et al came around making single sales widely available, we get to see how little most people cared for albums. Before iTunes most labels didn&#x27;t even sell singles and when they did they were still several dollars vs the 99Â¢ from iTunes and the like.<p>Allowing consumers to actually buy what they want has been a huge improvement for them.')
