First the &quot;I know &#x2F; am related to &#x2F; am married to group&quot; so you can&#x27;t have a negative opinion about group thing is super cringe. I&#x27;m also pretty sure it&#x27;s one of the logical fallacies. To put into perspective here is a rather extreme example: &quot;My cousins an axe murderer, I&#x27;ll be sure to tell him you think axe murders are bad, that&#x27;ll brighten up his day&quot;. See how me saying I&#x27;m related to an axe murder doesn&#x27;t actually change your opinion on axe murderers at all?<p>Secondly, Bottom of the Totem Pole is actually the revered position[1]. Bit of an amusing cultural knowledge oversight on the OPs side ;-)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Totem_pole#Meaning_and_purpose" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Totem_pole#Meaning_and_purpose</a>')
