Most Starlink sats don&#x27;t have sat-to-sat links yet. So this service so far doesn&#x27;t really fully work as least as far as the concept goes.<p>You can still to sat to ground to sat and that can also be quite useful, but does not work across large bodies of water.<p>Starlink might be the cash cow that can get SpaceX to Mars. And the great thing is, with Starlink the Starship is not really an unnecessarly big rocket anymore. It actually makes a lot of sense to deploy 400+ sats in one shot.<p>If you can deploy 400+ sats in one rocket launch, you only need a total 105 launches to set up the whole 42000 sat constellation. That means only 21 launches per year if you assume a replacement rate of 5 years, something that is well within capability of even current operations. That said, I think depending on technological development speed, going to a refueling of the sats might be an option eventually.<p>This base capability and cashflow will allow SpaceX to continue development on the Starship and help build up the infrastructure needed for other uses of Starship. Mars and Earth Point-to-Point transportation are the real challenging projects SpaceX is attempting.')
