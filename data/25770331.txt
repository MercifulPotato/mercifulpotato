Whereas in US (and also Switzerland, btw, has which US-like model but without most of downsides) it&#x27;s privately run. This causes difference in incentives to doctors. In the latter systems, doctors are incentivized to spend more time on you, spare no expense, get you the best treatment possible, but it is not cheap. In the former, they are incentivized to do the bare minimum')
