Version 3.0 is dated March 3, 2015 that uses the WiredTiger engine which fixes much of the brokenness.<p>I did some workaround work on a MongoDB v2.x app. It did suck and was inconvenient operationally, but it also did scale so had its uses.<p>However the discussion now should be about how it is to be used&#x2F;not today and not back in 2013. So fair to say it did suck or you shouldn&#x27;t have used it, but that doesn&#x27;t have much relevance.')
