I am using my laptop, say doing random hobby projects, with code open, a few browser tabs open, some terminal tabs, maybe with something running. My kid or spouse need my attention. I close my laptop lid so 1. It keeps all my windows open, 2. No one knocks over my laptop because its lid is open on a couch, 3. I can respond to my kid or spouse without having to shut down, wait for the shutdown process (a few seconds is a year when a kid is waiting for you... and in some cases, it could be a real emergency too).<p>Because my laptop where I run Linux on (Lenovo ideapad 320s) fails 100% of the time when I close the lid to put it to sleep, I simply cannot do this. When I say fail, I mean it hard crashes -- to fix it I&#x27;d have to hold the power button for 5 seconds to shut it down fully and reboot.<p>What I ended up doing was configuring it so closing the laptop lid does nothing at all (no sleep, no hibernate, simply turns off screen). This is an OK alternative but anyone who dosn&#x27;t live alone know that when you close your laptop lid, you have no idea when you&#x27;re going back to your laptop next. It could be in the next 5 minutes. Or, it could be the start of a series of events (changing diapers, bathing the kid, tantrums, etc.) that keeps you unavailable for the next 4 hours, and then it&#x27;s bed time and you forget your laptop was still running, and then you go to work the next day, and finally a full 24 hours later you came back to your laptop and you remember that you didn&#x27;t shut it down 24 hours ago, now it drained up all your battery and closed all your apps anyway. (Real world examples that have happened to me)')
