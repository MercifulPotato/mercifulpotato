On a personal level I think those who chime in to cry that it&#x27;s not censorship are myopic fools.<p>It is absolutely censorship. It&#x27;s textbook, dictionary, censorship. Take wikipedia&#x27;s great opening paragraph:<p>&gt;Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information, on the basis that such material is considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or &quot;inconvenient.&quot; Censorship can be conducted by governments, private institutions, and other controlling bodies.<p>In my opinion it&#x27;s especially egreoious, requiring remedy, if the censorious actor has a large amount of control over a medium of communication. In this case google dwarfs perhaps governments.')
