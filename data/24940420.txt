That is, I can use a copy of the software without inhibiting your simultaneous use of it.<p>That depends. You could view the idea in it&#x27;s abstract, intangible form; and then the manifestation of that idea in the real word, as symbols (letters, numbers, drawings, notes,...) which reflect that idea. When you download code, you ultimately make a copy of  manifestation represented as electromagnetic signals encoded as digital symbols.<p>The process of having a novel idea consists of assembling mental constructs together as a thought proces and then expressing that through shared social constructs (language, art, symbols,...). What is protected by IP is your claim to be the first person - the original author - having had the idea. Not the idea itself.<p>The opposite of that is not making that distinction, collapsing the process of making copies of the manifestation of an idea, and having the idea itself into one. This would imply that being the first to have constructed a novel idea is no argument for a claim to intellectual ownership.<p>The real problem with copyright, though, isn&#x27;t making that first claim. It&#x27;s the abstract notion that rights to claim IP can be extended and transferred. Which creates a very different can of worms.')
