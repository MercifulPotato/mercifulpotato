If she was denied (2) but granted (1), I don&#x27;t think that is so unreasonable. If feedback is anonymous, sharing its exact text can give away who gave it (you can often work out who wrote something just from the style of language the author used, especially if these are people you know and work closely with.)<p>If she was given actionable specifics (&quot;add a cite to X&quot;), then knowing who it came from and the exact text of it is irrelevant and I don&#x27;t think she has a right to it. If she was denied actionable specifics, that is grossly unfair to her. I think one difficulty is that her account makes it sound like she was denied that, Dean&#x27;s makes it sound like she wasn&#x27;t, I wasn&#x27;t there so I don&#x27;t know whose account is more accurate.')
