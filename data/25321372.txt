In a very emotional scene, brilliant pinks and purples explode off the screen — colors that not only had been absent from the film before that moment, but seemed altogether outside the spectrum of the story’s palette. Such a moment would not be possible without HDR.<p>I think the author knows that this is a special case of the effect where you limit color palette to some range of colors for a duration of the film and then exceed that range in places—no HDR in particular fundamentally needed to make this possible.<p>True, HDR can give a greater effect in absolute colorimetric terms when full palette is revealed, but the <i>perceived</i> magnitude depends on how restricted the original palette was prior to the reveal, and how masterfully the effect is used in general.')
