Admittedly, that&#x27;s because I am of the 80 percent of people who get decent health coverage via my employer. A significant minority of Canadians agree with me, so it&#x27;s not like this is some radical position.<p>There is a famous story in canada where you could get CT scans for your pet the same day, but non-urgent scans for humans had like an 8 month waiting list.<p>My great grandfather had to wait 6 months for cataract replacement. He considered going to North Dakota to have it done, as it was preventing him from working. So now canada has inadvertently fallen to the same trap as everywhere else: if you&#x27;re wealthy enough you can just go to the us for care. Everyone else has to wait.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to say these sorts of views on reddit, but just get called a troll or a liar. I&#x27;m not trying to argue that public healthcare isnt better in some ways, or even that americans shouldn&#x27;t consider it. It&#x27;s just that these sorts of outlets tend to have a rosey view and give this impression that dissent arrises only from ignorance, and I must be some evil, Mr Burns-esque robber baron.')
