Here, you are talking about creating a fresh start. The only thing reservations do is actually create divide. During Independence, it was compulsory move where caste discrimination was serious. But today, due to industrialisation it holds no meaning. Now, there is only worker class and ruling class. New Generations(majority) are not taught about castes and discrimination around it, the only time they came in contact with such nonsense is during college entrances. I would also point the superior mentality taught in top colleges is also a reason. The way they are indoctrinated in these colleges creates a superior mentality in students and if your classmate scored less than you and got into college, you would also extend that superior mentality to him&#x2F;her as well.')
