Therefore, the owner is responsible for the bird illegally entering Australia in violation of local customs laws, just as a dog owner would be responsible should their dog bite somebody.<p>I&#x27;m all for returning the bird to the owner but from Australia&#x27;s perspective, the owner committed a crime. It&#x27;s ridiculous to suggest that the owner should be compensated for the consequences.<p>The bird should be returned upon payment of a fine and reimbursement for the costs of finding, capturing and transporting the bird back to the US.')
