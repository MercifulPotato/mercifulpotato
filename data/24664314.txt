That has come at the expense of both returns to labor, <i>and</i> returns to all other kinds of capital (stock ownership, etc.). This is obvious. Stock market returns aren&#x27;t what they used to be. Banks are making 4% on mortgages, versus 8% back in the day. The country is awash in 0% financing for cars, refrigerators, etc.<p>There is increasing inequality in how labor income is distributed. CEO salaries have gone up, programmer salaries have gone up, but secretary salaries have stagnated. But that&#x27;s a separate issue than returns to capital ownership going up.')
