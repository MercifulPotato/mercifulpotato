My standard here is simply that I think if a website is literally organizing something which explicitly, literally, supports violent overthrow of the government, then I&#x27;m going to yield to the legal system to enforce whatever laws exist to properly regulate that speech. I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion beyond that since I am not a lawyer. My point is that if the mechanism to enforce those laws includes SSL or CDN interference, I won&#x27;t include such interference on the list of things I&#x27;d be concerned about in my bucket of &quot;corporate interests mediating acceptable global speech.&quot;')
