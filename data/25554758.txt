Many people work in 1:5 manager:dev overhead, often more, due to multiple management layers all applying pressure on the bottom level. Not everyone is mentally a child that still needs to be babysat while an adult. Heck, college, university and all that are exactly there to ensure one <i>is</i> self-sufficient to an extend you don&#x27;t need to manually moderate their every move.<p>It is fairly ironic you&#x27;re devolving into the same behavior you accuse GP of, when a much more intellectual discussion can be held.')
