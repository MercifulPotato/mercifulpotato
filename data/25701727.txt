It’s hard to follow your argument.<p>&gt; In the 60s the Hong Kongese held mass riots against the British in support of reunification.[0] Linguistically and culturally the Hong Kongese they are no different from their fellow Cantonese in the mainland. Most of its residents are only a couple generations removed from the Mainland. This tactic of constantly trying to make some arbitrary strategic region of China seem like it&#x27;s some cultural enclave is as ridiculous as claiming that maybe &quot;San Francisco isn&#x27;t preordained to be American&quot;. If you think there&#x27;s some drastic cultural difference the burden of proof lies on you.<p>“Linguistically and culturally the Hong Kongese they are no different from their fellow Cantonese in the mainland.”<p>Linguistically they are maybe no different from mainland Cantonese, but culturally they certainly are. I’ve never heard someone claim otherwise. They were a British colony for generations after all. That obviously left an imprint.<p>Secondly I’m not sure why you’re bringing Canton in. To say that’s Hong Kong should be part of China because of the Cantonese connection could simply be met with the response that maybe Canton just shouldn’t be a part of China.<p>Really it’s Hong Kongers that should have decided their fate. Not allowing them to vote was an injustice.<p>Btw I find it ironic that you bring up Hong Kong protests in support of unification. Well in the last couple years there have been huge Hong Kong protests against further integration. Can I take this to mean you support them in their protests there as well?')
