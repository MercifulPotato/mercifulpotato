From the article:- “ At the heart of all of these systems would be the fact that the dollar would no longer be the world’s only currency for energy pricing. The euro, yuan, and perhaps a few others, or a neutral reserve currency, could be used in trade agreements to buy oil, gas, and various commodities, which unlocks the prospect for more global trade and reserve holdings in those currencies.”<p>While this makes total sense the fundamental problem with this is a consensus mechanism to control liquidity in a localized crisis. If you have one currency it’s easier for that country to make a decision rather than convince all the other countries.')
