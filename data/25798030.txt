All of these measures are probabilistic.<p>P(infect others) = P(infected) * P(transmission)<p>Simple masks don&#x27;t have much impact on P(infected), but substantially reduce P(transmission) under some circumstances. Valved FFP3 don&#x27;t have much impact on P(transmission) [not zero], but vastly reduce P(infected) in virtually all circumstances. It&#x27;s not clear to me even under this simplistic analysis that it is not superior. And in an enclosed space, the effect of simple masks on P(transmission) is almost wiped out.<p>&gt;If your mask gets moisture-saturated, just replace it.<p>New mask every 2 hours?')
