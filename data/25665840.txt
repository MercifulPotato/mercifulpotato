But I always supported Obama‘s use of the bully pulpit. Even though I agreed with very little of his core politics, I feel it’s the right of the president to use freedom of speech, period.<p>Also, regarding morality. Because I believe in freedom of speech, I support the right of people to write and say immoral things. Even reprehensible things. And if we choose to suppress such speech, we should expect it to go underground and fester and explode painfully at the worst possible time.<p>Much better in my view that these things be examined and rebutted in the public sphere.')
