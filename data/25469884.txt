If you&#x27;re not taking minutes to hours per programming task, you aren&#x27;t really pushing the limits of modern computers. High-performance GPU and&#x2F;or CPU is great.<p>Things like &quot;what&#x27;s the best 32-bit number for my custom random number generator&quot; ?? (Try all 4-billion+ 32-bit numbers and run statistics on them, then sort the results). Except not really, that kind of search takes less than 10 seconds now, lol. But that should give you an idea of the size &#x2F; scale of modern CPU power.<p>Or searching for chess or other AI search tasks. Or deep learning. Or raytracing. Or LTSpice simulations. Or... you get the gist.')
