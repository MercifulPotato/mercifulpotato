For the most part they <i>do</i> improve software, and help coding get more popular. Their work can help those devs go independent in some shape or form (or the least, it helps them get their next job more easily or put them in a stronger negotiating position).<p>The fact that they do a far bit of self-promotion should not be hold against them, in the end we are all working to achieve something in life, and for some, a necessary ingredient is some self-promotion through open-source.')
