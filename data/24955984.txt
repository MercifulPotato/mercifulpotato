It refuses to switch to the ultrawide camera, responds only to certain camera modes, and occasionally hangs and becomes completely unresponsive.</i><p>There is zero doubt in my mind that this is completely deliberate, and doing some deep reverse-engineering would likely yield how it is done (if anyone does decide to investigate it, that is an article I would love to read about.) It&#x27;s like the copy protection schemes in games that appear to be defeated easily, but have more hidden traps later on.<p>The wankers at Apple who implement this sort of thing should be ashamed of themselves. I hope the Chinese cracks this, as they are apt to do for the third-party repair industry, just to show that it can still be done.')
