That&#x27;s a pretty normal expectation, imo. Framing something normal as &quot;perfect&quot; is definitely a fallacy.<p>Would you really be OK with donating to a cause whose major service is their most visible one and for your money to instead go into mostly, completely different things? I&#x27;m not and therefore I won&#x27;t donate to Mozilla. I donated to other projects with clear goals, limited scope and visible results - there are quite a few of those. If the firefox team decided to split from Mozilla or a team decided to build a browser upon a new browser engine (like quantum or whatever that new rust browser engine is), I&#x27;d be glad to donate directly to the project.<p>Mozilla leadership has proven that they are too scatterbrained and insensitive to reality to be trusted with donations. Their priorities aren&#x27;t aligned with the ones stated by the org. I try my best not to give money to people like that.')
