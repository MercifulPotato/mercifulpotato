If you say I &quot;will resign if&quot;, is saying that you will do something in the unspecified future.<p>So if you give your two weeks notice you have formally turned in your resignation.  In your example I would agree that they just changed the timetable.  If you haven&#x27;t given your notice, and they terminate your employment citing an email you sent, you have been fired.<p>By all accounts she didn&#x27;t submit her resignation, she simply said that she would.  Sometimes situations like that result in the person getting cold feet, or the two parties working out a compromise.  Maybe things would&#x27;ve always ended up the same way, but either way Google didn&#x27;t wait for her to actually resign.')
