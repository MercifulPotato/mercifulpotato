The libraries that provide context via wrapping are good but woefully underused.<p>&gt; Error handling in Go is tedious and there&#x27;s no visible indication if you forget to do it or don&#x27;t do it properly so sometimes it goes AWOL<p>This is also true, though I would expect teams to fail on linting so I don&#x27;t share the concern. Is there an equivalent for unchecked exceptions (honest question)?<p>I&#x27;ll take your word on the performance being better for exceptions, but I&#x27;m less convinced that Go&#x27;s performance is a significant sticking point for the language.')
