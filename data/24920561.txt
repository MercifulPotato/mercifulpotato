I did learn c++ in school but never use it professionally. Like you I see a lot of what I like in Ruby in Rust. I have been using it &quot;amateurishly&quot; for the last 3 years. I it has made me think about my Ruby code differently for the better. Could C&#x2F;C++ do the same thing? I am unsure. I hope to one day use Rust as a professional but until then it will be my go to for fun projects and serve as a tool for learning. I expect Rust to extent beyond the statement of &quot;systems language&quot; at some point. I just wrote a search tool based on my browser history using 99% Rust (Actix server, Tantivy search and Yew wasm frontend). Not having to write much javascript for a full stack project was refreshing.')
