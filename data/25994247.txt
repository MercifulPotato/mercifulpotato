One can do all the things, and keep turning up with un-fun games. Games require magic, in a way few other things do.<p>But I also think these big companies have some of the best chance of creating something special and better. They keep reaching for better scaled universes, better scaled worlds, and I think this ambition is really key. Better scaled worlds is what&#x27;s important, is what we need to be up to. Lots of simulated agents, lots of space, lots of players, all in virtual space.<p>EVE Online seems to be really running up into the wall, these days. It feels like there&#x27;s such basic fixes for some of this stuff (allow modules to be set-to-go online while in warp), but the huge grid filled with players, the massive time-dialation.... it&#x27;s a real cluster $@#@#$[1]. Few others have tried to be anywhere near as cool. We all get some little shells, shards, and the bigger total us never happens.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcgamer.com&#x2F;how-eve-online-commandos-pulled-off-a-suicide-mission-to-save-170-elite-pilots&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcgamer.com&#x2F;how-eve-online-commandos-pulled-off-...</a>')
