And I tend to correct those people. That&#x27;s all. Extortion is a legal term and it&#x27;s pretty well defined compared to other crimes. And this is not extortion. I can recommend all commenters who downvoted to go and denounce the offence of extortion and see for themselves what happens. I for one would love to see it to have a good laugh :D')
