Some were fine, other less fine but all of them did the work.<p>I think that these (btw interesing) articles on keyboards are particularly relevant to pepole who constantly type (or hobbyists).<p>I work with a keyboard all day long and also afterward for fun but I type only a fraction of the time. I also look at the keyboard when doing so, so I am slow. But I do not need to be faster (it would be great, though) and my hands are not in the same position. I am not sure a special keyboard would help pepole in my case.')
