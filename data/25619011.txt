No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.&quot;<p>So a) terrorists aren&#x27;t levying war, because they&#x27;re not part of a state, and b) good luck ever fulfilling the 2 witness or confession requirement.')
