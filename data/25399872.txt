Item(by='ancarda', descendants=None, kids=[25400168], score=None, time=1607794043, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25399197, text='&gt;I&#x27;m on a cellular network in the UK<p>&gt;My phone get an IPv6 address only, no IPv4<p>Please tell me which network so I can immediately switch.<p>Three unfortunately still don&#x27;t use IPv6, and I&#x27;d prefer if my phone were IPv6-only than IPv4-only since everything else in my life is IPv6 capable -- all my servers, my home Internet, my email provider, etc...<p>EDIT: So it seems some people have gotten IPv6 addresses from Three last year - e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Mythic_Beasts&#x2F;status&#x2F;1195292901191892992" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Mythic_Beasts&#x2F;status&#x2F;1195292901191892992</a> - so perhaps I just need to wait for Three to enable it for everyone? Not going to wait forever though...')
