Whatever else you can say about the Democrats, they are not in favor of blood-and-soil policies. I did not downvote your post but I find your watering down of the phrase of fascism to be worth taking issue with. As for the troubling power of mega-corporations, it’s rather sad that <i>this</i> is the incident that made you aware of it. So you didn’t see fit to criticize them until now?')
