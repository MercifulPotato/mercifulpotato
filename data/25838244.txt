Especially if FB is tracking the conversation participants before and after the chat.<p>If we chat and then shortly there after you search for some fringe political group, it&#x27;s pretty safe to see that as a strong indication that I&#x27;m involved with that group. Or if my geolocation places me at some political event and we chat during or just after it, you&#x27;re implicated.<p>FB doesn&#x27;t need the contents of messages, they need the metadata plus all the other user tracking.')
