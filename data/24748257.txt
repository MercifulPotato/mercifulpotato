Item(by='BearOso', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602443787, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24745564, text='&gt; On a CRT monitor, the screen is coated in millions of phosphor dots, with one red, green, and blue dot for every individual pixel.<p>Not true. The number of dot triads is usually greater than the number of pixels. The distance between them is specified as the “dot pitch,” which serves as a physical resolution cap. In aperture grilles they’re continuous RGB vertical lines, with the dot pitch being the horizontal distance between them.<p>Framebuffer pixels don’t align exactly with the dots, and that’s one reason why CRTs are so blurry. The other reason is that the DAC analog output doesn’t transition discretely between pixels. As the refresh rate and resolution get higher, the DAC has to spend less time on each pixel, so the output becomes blurred horizontally.')
