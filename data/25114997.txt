If you trust the Eastern European governments to do (or to have done) an honest attempt at integrating gypsies, I think you&#x27;re very naive.<p>As a piece of anecdata that I have, a very close friend that was doing a master&#x27;s degree at the Sociology University in Bucharest mentioned that the literacy in gypsy communities was raised in the early years of the 2000nds due to the &quot;Cornul si Laptele&quot; program. The program that most of the country derided.
