It doesn&#x27;t reduce pollution for oil companies, at all, in any way. Certainly not when you take into account all the oil consumed to build and deliver all the mining hardware that&#x27;s turned over to the tune of 12.31kT per year.<p>Fine say you&#x27;re right. Show me a single study, a single article, a single write-up from a reputable source that shows bitcoin reduces pollution for oil companies.<p>&gt; Its low infrastructure demands...<p>12.3kT of waste per year means a lot of infrastructure <i>relative to what it provides</i> which is basically nothing.<p>&gt; ...and longer than you expect shelf life<p>Shelf life?<p>&gt; ...does utilize power that was being unused or wasted.<p>No. If that power wasn&#x27;t being squandered on a multiplayer excel game, it would be used for productive things. The same power cannot be used twice.<p>&gt; This is the crux of your argument and it is not accurate. You got here because you decided you dont like how that power is now being used after misunderstanding that it wasn&#x27;t being used, and I dont care.<p>It is massively, overwhelmingly less efficient than traditional banking and the generated waste and wasted power is purely incremental. If that entire transaction volume moved to traditional rails, the incremental power required to support it would probably be ~one guy on a stationary bike&#x27;s worth.<p>VisaNet alone can handle 65,000 transactions per second. 7 is 0.01% of that.<p>For perspective, bitcoin would require, if scaled linearly, 123 Megatons of e-waste (triple the entire world today put together). It would require 700,000TWh or 23X the entire world&#x27;s output of electricity. It would also emit 333,000 megatons of CO2. More than 10X the entire world&#x27;s current output. <i>Just to replace VisaNet</i>. Of course it&#x27;s physically incapable since even wasting that quantity of resources, the total transaction count would <i>still be 7</i>.<p>There&#x27;s no world in which you can rationalize away that it&#x27;s drastically, overwhelmingly, mind-blowingly less efficient.')
