If a corporation really wants creativity, they&#x27;ll allow and REWARD asking &quot;pesky questions&quot; that may hurt egos of those with higher rank.<p>Dale Carnegie&#x27;s &quot;How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People&quot; basically confirms this: you have to have a personal relationship to truly influence somebody, logic alone won&#x27;t cut it. I hate that book, but it&#x27;s speaks the ugly truth. Humans are not Vulcans.<p>It&#x27;s there if you want it, most orgs don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m just the messenger.<p>That being said, some contrarians gum up the works with low-quality questions and research. (Sometimes called &quot;trolls&quot;.) There does need to be a systematic way to ask questions and make suggestions with a vetting process, but such requires a skill-set and training, which does require org resources and time.')
