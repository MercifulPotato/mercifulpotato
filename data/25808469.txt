Item(by='awalton', descendants=None, kids=[25808841, 25812748, 25808772], score=None, time=1610861921, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25807757, text='Its oral LD50 was tested to be more than 5000mg&#x2F;kg according to Shepherd Color Company&#x27;s MSDS for Blue 10G513 (as it is known commercially). That&#x27;s well into &quot;non-toxic&quot; as categorized by the EPA. For perspective, that&#x27;s more than ten times less toxic than caffeine.<p>So, probably pretty safe when used appropriately. I wouldn&#x27;t go inhaling it, since any fine powder&#x27;s not great for the lungs, but that shouldn&#x27;t be news to anyone. Just wear your N95 when mixing dry pigments as you always should.')
