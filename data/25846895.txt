We don&#x27;t object all that much when people change prices for their software; we realize that it is just an experiment with what the market will bear.<p>I feel like the source code license is becoming something similar (as long as you own all the code). Apache2 for mass adoption, GPL for less adoption, but some more control, dual licensing for more flexibility, commercial only licensing if you want to maintain total control.<p>It is common for someone to start out pricing something low to see if they can get adoption and then increasing prices as people see more value. Could the same thing happen with licenses: start with Apache2, then change to one of the more restrictive models?')
