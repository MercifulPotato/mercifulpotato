Active sharing is also important in the design, so you can have a <i>shared</i> grocery list or notes or anything else.<p>And with the new embedding, obviously the goal is that you can create content on Supernotes and put it in your blog or wherever else, and if you ever modify the card on SN you don&#x27;t need to edit your blog post because the embed is pulling your content directly from our servers so it propagates everywhere you&#x27;ve shared &#x2F; embedded it automagically!')
