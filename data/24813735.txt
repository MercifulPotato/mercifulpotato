How many instruction bytes should you load per cycle? What happens when your preload of a byte that happens to be in a subsequent page trips a page fault?<p>By comparison, 4byte instructions that are always aligned have none of those problems. Alignment is a significant simplification for the design.<p>(Somewhere I have a napkin plan for fully Huffman coded instructions, but then jumps are a serious problem as they&#x27;re not longer byte aligned!)')
