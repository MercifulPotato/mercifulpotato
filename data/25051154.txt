To the extent that it existed it was something you&#x27;d task one or two persons once in a while, but one or two not-professional-writers can&#x27;t document the production of dozens of devs <i>and</i> do their own dev.<p>Producing documentation is looking down upon, it&#x27;s not factored in any development, it&#x27;s not part of any development process, and it&#x27;s not part of any training. Most people also don&#x27;t enjoy writing documentation, though I couldn&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s because they simply have no training &#x2F; encouragement for it, or genuine primal dislike.')
