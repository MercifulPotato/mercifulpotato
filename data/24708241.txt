Most people will be ok with this (this is pretty much how the world turns to some degree)<p>But if you save 100000 lives, then murder 5 victims. And those 5 victims were just murdered to murder tham, no one being saved was resting on it.<p>Most basically ethical people would consider that indefensible.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re confusing this situation with the former, where lives are treated as fungible to save great numbers.<p>That can be tricky ethically, but at least the greater good is on your side. Here you&#x27;re treating lives as fungible for the sake of it.<p>It&#x27;s not really an admirable thing to lack the ability to see why that&#x27;s wrong, so I implore you to dig a little deeper.<p>This isn&#x27;t sacrificing people to help more people, it&#x27;s helping people then sacrificing some people for fun.<p>If you talk someone down from a ledge do you now go around thinking you get to murder someone and it cancels out?<p>&gt; If it was just marketing and looking cool that would be one thing. But it&#x27;s also quite hard mentally to pay attention when everything is on auto. And it&#x27;s a much nicer driving experience that&#x27;s inherently dangerous no matter what the marketing says. So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to have the convenience without the danger. You&#x27;d have to disable AP<p>This is literally what every comment in this entire thread by me has said. Maybe you finally get it.<p>Car without convenience features saves lives doesn&#x27;t kill.<p>Car with them saves same lives and kills.')
