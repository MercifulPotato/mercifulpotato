Quite the contrary, it’s a good opportunity to expand the person’s selection.<p>Ask them <i>what</i> they love about the author. Not only does that make you a more interested friend, it gives you valuable information when looking for a gift. Ask online (or the sales person at the bookshop) “what do I get for someone who likes author X for reasons Y” and pick what resonates.<p>As (another) bonus, it shows the person you care enough to do your research and not just get what would’ve been on their wish list anyway.')
