Some people run yellows, some people don&#x27;t.<p>But one of them may be more likely, and therefore result in more collisions if you assume it isn&#x27;t.<p>In addition to that, many yellow lights are timed too short. That makes it possible to be far enough from the light that you won&#x27;t make it through the intersection before it turns red, but still close enough that stopping before the intersection would require braking rapidly enough to yield a significant probability of being rear-ended. The problem there is the light timing, but the car can&#x27;t fix that and still has to make a choice.')
