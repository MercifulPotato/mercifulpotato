At least for me, all I&#x27;m saying is, look at everything this guy had to go through! And look what his payout is. It&#x27;s not pissing on the payout, or the guy&#x27;s effort, or saying he&#x27;s a mark. It&#x27;s acknowledging that most businesses don&#x27;t even get that far, so this is the <i>good</i> case. Meanwhile, you can sit down and make the same money in less time, taking what I would wager to be a significantly larger number of naps. And it doesn&#x27;t involve magic, or being a big-cheese VP, or any of this other stuff people say.<p>Now, obviously not everyone is cut out to be an employee, let alone an employee at a big tech co. Nothing wrong with being an entrepreneur, if that fits the cut of your jib better. It&#x27;s just to say, let&#x27;s be honest about the risk&#x2F;reward situation here. It&#x27;s not high-risk, high-reward compared to getting a big tech job. It&#x27;s high risk and middling reward. The job route is much less risk with an equal or greater reward. Why is it so horrible to say this??')
