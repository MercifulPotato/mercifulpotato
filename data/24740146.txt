I do think that a world of small companies populated by intrinsically motivated people who are mostly equals would be much better than what we currently have.<p>However, we have to acknowledge that the way the economic game is set up, this kind of endeavour is disincentivized. Neo-liberal capitalism favours concentration of power, mega-corporations with kill-zones around them and with huge lobbying power. Outside finding highly specialised niches, I think tech companies can find it hard to stay both successful and small.<p>The VC funding model also seems to go against this idea. As far as I understand it (I don&#x27;t work in SV, so my understanding is all second-hand), the approach is to fund lots of companies hoping that a few will make it big and accepting that most would fail. This is in complete contradiction with the idea of small, non-hierarchical enterprises.')
