I understand that these are run by CI on the main architectures, although it didn&#x27;t appear to be a condition of accepting the patch that the test was correct on all arches.  Also I wonder if their CI really runs on PPC601 and IA64, I guess probably not.  (Obviously this minor feature doesn&#x27;t depend on the arch and it&#x27;s hard to see how it could go wrong even on IA64).')
