Regulation of drugs does work. You know your prescription of X is not cut or laced with something because it’s regulated. It’s how you know how strong your alcohol is. It’s how you know what your buying is what it is claimed to be. I trust the pharmacy over the street corner. To reiterate, I’m pro legalization, but I’m also pro regulating.')
