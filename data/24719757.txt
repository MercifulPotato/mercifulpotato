Rt is dependent on how people behave. When behavior changes, Rt can change as well. Each herd immunity level is thus dependent on health measures, which is why &quot;reaching&quot; herd immunity and then loosening up health measures won&#x27;t work.<p>Edit: removed wrong information on R0 that&#x27;s not really essential to my point')
