Item(by='ummonk', descendants=None, kids=[25579800], score=None, time=1609315439, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25576467, text='I recall a few years back doing something like this implementing a binary heap just as a hobby project (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Equationist&#x2F;ctl&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;pqueue.h" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Equationist&#x2F;ctl&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;pqueue.h</a>). I was curious to see how unoptimized it was vis a vis the STL, and ran compiled equivalent test code for both my priority queue and the STL&#x27;s C++ implementation, with just integers. I was kind of shocked to find that my implementation was like 30% faster when both were compiled at -O3 levels. Seeing this backport I guess there isn&#x27;t anything fancy in the STL implementations, so it&#x27;s less surprising that my naive implementation could be just as fast (or happen to be faster).')
