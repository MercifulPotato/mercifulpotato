I was raised Catholic, turned atheist in my teens, and then slowly fell into agnosticism in young adulthood. Now I don&#x27;t consider any of those labels accurate of my beliefs.<p>Have you considered &quot;exploring faith&quot; in a practical&#x2F;historical&#x2F;contextual sense? Such as: why did religion ever become a thing&#x2F;how did it come about? What ever was its purpose? Why are there (and what are the) recurring themes amongst all religions?  Where did the ideas behind Christianity&#x2F;Judaism&#x2F;Islam&#x2F;Hinduism&#x2F;Buddhism&#x2F;etc originate - what do they have to say about X? Are what various religions preach&#x2F;practice today - what they preached&#x2F;practiced thousands of years ago? What about ancient religious texts not mainstay of any particular modern religion? What about language, meaning, human nature, and time? What of these things change and what of these things don&#x27;t change? Where do they fit together? What about historical non-religious philosophical secular ideas? And on, and on...<p>Iâ€™ve done this for myself and found some satisfaction in it, and would think most anyone would too. That said, do I no longer have <i>any</i> qualms? No. Do I now believe in God(s)? That would all depend on what concept you behold to &quot;God(s)&quot;. But  mortality seems less bothersome now...')
