I mean, you have to have all of your ports open, with multiple IP addresses allocated to a single server, and the process has to have efficient routing algorithms to do so. Erlang doesn&#x27;t make this job more efficient than other languages. Erlang has two killer use cases: fault tolerance and horizontal scalability. Computational resource efficiency has never been a goal and it shows.<p>The grandparent comment is nothing more than a cargo cult. &quot;If we use the same language as WhatsApp, we&#x27;ll magically be just as scalable as WhatsApp&quot;. It&#x27;s horrendously naive.')
