This improves reliability.<p>DLL loading is full of security risks.  Static binaries are free of them.<p>DLLs are compiled separately from the binaries that load them.  Compilers cannot optimize code that calls into a DLL.  Compiler optimizers are amazing these days.  Compared to a separately optimized binary + DLL, a completely optimized binary will consume less CPU, use less memory, and cause less heap pressure and fragmentation.<p>DLL&#x27;s original purpose is reducing memory and disk usage.  Since we have different needs now, DLLs are just technical debt.')
