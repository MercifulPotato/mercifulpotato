My (much newer!) HP ProBook has hissing and various random noises when I move the mouse, and I can hear this even with cheap headphones tailored for conferencing. Don&#x27;t know how &quot;accurate&quot; either one is, but no hissing wins for me every time.<p>I think you nail it with <i>most decent motherboards</i>. There are a lot of computers on the market, especially laptops, that are just cheap and try to get away with whatever low quality components and engineering they can. In particular, I&#x27;m thinking about HP &quot;enterprise&quot; models which are just awful. Their target audience doesn&#x27;t really care about audio quality, so why would they? Most people don&#x27;t have a choice when it comes to their work computers, so they may end up stuck with something mediocre. Then again, most people don&#x27;t care, so there&#x27;s probably not much hope to see any improvement on this front...')
