For argument’s sake, say you saw your boss doing something you perceived to be illegal.<p>Imagine, then, that you were told that asking about those things was dangerous, because it would cause everyone to lose faith in who they work for.<p>Now imagine that HR or a PR firm comes, only after trying hard to convince you that you shouldn’t ask any questions at all, and then tells you that they investigated and found nothing wrong.<p>Then imagine that, while some of the explanation given made sense, some of it did not, and maybe led to more questions.<p>Finally, imagine then being told that not only should you no longer question, but that anyone caught talking about it would be removed.<p>Now, we don’t know that something illegal did or did not occur.<p>But be honest... would that scenario convince you that nothing illegal happened, and that you should move on as instructed?')
