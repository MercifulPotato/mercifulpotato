This isn&#x27;t &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;. If the prosecutors thought they could sustain a murder-for-hire charge, I&#x27;m sure they would have prosecuted it. It&#x27;s a more serious crime! So I&#x27;m skeptical.<p>Taking a different tack here - even if he was in fact guilty of attempted murder-for-hire, what&#x27;s a reasonable punishment for that? Is 7 years in prison long enough?')
