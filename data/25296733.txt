Item(by='altarius', descendants=None, kids=[25297225], score=None, time=1607037209, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25295005, text='If I ran the numbers right, only about 15% of the energy consumed in the US is produced in the form of electricity (4,127 billion kWh vs 100.2 quadrillion Btu consumed, 1kWh ~ 3400 Btu).<p>So going 100% renewable or nuclear for electricity production wouldnt&#x27; even make more than 15% difference.<p>I wonder what causes all that additional energy consumption from fossil fuel sources then? I always blindly assumed ~50% of our energy consumption is in the form of electricity. Cars and transportation, heating are obvious but I wouldn&#x27;t expect that to account for such a large share. Does industry use so much fossil fuel for energy?')
