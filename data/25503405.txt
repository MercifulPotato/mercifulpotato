Maybe there isn&#x27;t one and instead we&#x27;re seeing a resurgence of forum silos again that&#x27;s winning back the mainstream.<p>For example, I was pleasantly surprised to see Discourse have so much success and high profile roll outs (like Boing Boing and Blizzard). It turns out that everyone was ready for a modern revitalization of the forum experience, not that forums were doomed.<p>I think I&#x27;d liken it to the explosion of Slack&#x2F;Discord popularity. It would have been a mistake to look at the slow death of IRC and conclude &quot;I guess people don&#x27;t like chatting anymore.&quot;')
