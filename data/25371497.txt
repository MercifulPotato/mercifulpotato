[emphasis mine]<p>There have been so many court cases tossed out (50+ if some accounts are to be believed, but that&#x27;s just hearsay) , one of two things has to be happening:<p>1) The affidavits never made their way into court as evidence, likely because the plaintiff lawyers didn&#x27;t want to put them forward as such, or<p>2) The affidavits were presented in court as evidence and got discounted because they&#x27;re too weak as evidence<p>But the common thread appears to be that these &quot;affidavits&quot; don&#x27;t stand up to any strong scrutiny, and amount to &quot;random person alleges they saw fraud happen&quot;, which then quickly changes to &quot;random person alleges they believe they saw fraud, but couldn&#x27;t state for sure&quot; when under penalty of perjury.')
