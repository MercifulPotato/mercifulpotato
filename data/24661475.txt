I know that whenever I am unemployed my creativity just gets diverted into the nearest interesting endeavour. One of those might have paid off and become a business. Quite likely in fact, if I hadn&#x27;t had to work. I&#x27;ve often considered going on benefits so that I can work on my own ideas unhindered by work life. But I wanted a family more than I wanted time to pursue my other dreams.\nI am very sure there are a great many others who are taking the opportunity to follow their dreams now that they have been forced to stay at home, out of work.')
