Devs said that an average user brings around $2 in a year (including those using adblock, etc). I sent them around $8 and they turned off any ads for my account forever. I could just continue using ad blocking, but they made that “hey you’re using” header that annoyed me on mobile, where it is hard to “pick an element”. Of course their income&#x2F;user ratio is not comparable to youtube’s one, but they meet their ends well, and also have much much lower megabytes&#x2F;user ratio. In infra costs they may be even more profitable per user than youtube (just a blind guess).')
