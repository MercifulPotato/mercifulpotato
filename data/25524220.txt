Things you use for a significant fraction of your life (bed: 1&#x2F;3rd, office-chair: 1&#x2F;4th) are worth investing in.<p>The most brilliant invention I&#x27;ve seen in a long time is the MyPillow.  Like a bed, it&#x27;s something you spend a lot of time with - but there was no brand recognition in the space.  This guy created the best pillow he knew how to make, then advertised the heck out of it with premium positioning.  The company is local, I hope I run into the founder someday.')
