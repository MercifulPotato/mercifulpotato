Item(by='CWuestefeld', descendants=None, kids=[25131615], score=None, time=1605657723, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25129945, text='<i>Why would it be different in other branch?</i><p>Lack of choice; the government has captured the &quot;market&quot;, and &quot;consumers&quot; can&#x27;t choose to go anywhere else. Compare to the service (and especially customer service) offered by your cable&#x2F;internet provider where you have not choice. The cable companies vie for literally <i>worst</i> customer service of all businesses year in and year out.<p>And we know that the government <i>is</i> doing an awful job in regulation of healthcare. I&#x27;ve got kind of a front-row seat to this and see things that most might not, since my wife&#x27;s whole career has been in healthcare finance, and in particular around how Medicare reimburses hospitals for services.<p>She&#x27;s currently working with one client hospital for whom their Medicare cost report still hasn&#x27;t been resolved for some years back even before 2010. How can a business operate efficiently when they don&#x27;t know what their expenses are going to be - not just in the future, but even historically, more than 10 years into the past?<p>Worse, the way the government forces hospitals to report this stuff is extremely specific, and optimized for how Medicare wants to run things - which is why Medicare can claim to spend less on administration: they just force hospitals to do all the administration for them. And hospitals can&#x27;t say &quot;no&quot;, with Medicare (together with Medicaid, which generally rides on Medicare&#x27;s regulatory coattails) comprising a plurality of the market, if not an outright majority. The result of this is that hospitals have a choice of either running two separate accounting systems (one for what Medicare demands, and another to do rational cost accounting), or more likely, to just do the one for Medicare and muddle along as best they can. And that&#x27;s a major reason why hospitals <i>can&#x27;t</i> operate more efficiently.<p>And my wife&#x27;s currently involved in a battle with them over some detailed rules they posted early in the summer. She&#x27;s been working all summer for her client hospitals based on what the government posted on their website. Last week they changed the rules posted (you can even see the &quot;last changed&quot; date). But the change was in a way that contradicts their previous statements, and invalidates much of what she did all summer - and worse, they&#x27;re lying about it, not admitting to what the previous version of the page said. Unfortunately the wayback machine didn&#x27;t track that site, and while she&#x27;s got her own records quoting the page, the gov&#x27;t won&#x27;t acknowledge it.<p>So there&#x27;s a clear explanation for why it can get bad, and tons of evidence that it really is bad.')
