They got a lot of them right, but had trouble with fuel pressure at the end and landed too hard because there wasn&#x27;t enough thrust.<p>As problems go, that&#x27;s a relatively simple one that they ought to be able to address.  The ascent appears to have been successful (though for a few moments it looked like something caught on fire and I&#x27;m not sure if that was planned or expected).  The glide worked.  The rocket was able to navigate to the landing pad.<p>Next time they&#x27;ll be working with a lot more information.  This seems like overall it was a success, even though they&#x27;re down one rocket and three engines.  A failure would have been the rocket blowing up on the pad during launch or other similar mishap from which they wouldn&#x27;t have learned much aside from &quot;make sure that doesn&#x27;t happen again&quot;.')
