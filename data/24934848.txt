But even on the case of obstruction, the central point looms large over all of it: there was no underlying crime established for Trump to cover-up.<p>&gt; All criminal investigations require a determination of a person’s intent, what they are thinking and what their goal is. When the question is whether a President sought to kill an Executive Branch investigation – as Trump clearly wanted to do here – the determinative issue is whether he did so because he genuinely believed the investigation to be an unfair persecution and scam, or whether he did it to corruptly conceal evidence of criminality.<p>&gt; That Mueller could not and did not establish any underlying crimes strongly suggests that Trump acted with the former rather than the latter motive, making it virtually impossible to find that he criminally obstructed the investigation.<p>If you were innocent of a crime would you really just sit back and watch the government waste $35 million investigating you?')
