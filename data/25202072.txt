How many people actually give an answer like &quot;science isn&#x27;t always right&quot; when choosing to ignore recommendations about COVID? Perhaps it&#x27;s the circles I move in, but most people who think COVID recommendations are junk (which doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t follow them) can give far more reasoned and deep explanations for their views than the people they disagree with. Absolutely standard to get an answer like &quot;because I trust the experts&quot; (i.e. &quot;I have no idea&quot;) from people who are the most passionately in favour of masks, lockdowns etc. You don&#x27;t see that in reverse, because people disagreeing with authority by definition can&#x27;t make an appeal to authority.')
