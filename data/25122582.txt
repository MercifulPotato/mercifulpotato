Please keep in mind that all what im about to say required some manual work since it&#x27;s Arch, but should all work &quot;out of the box&quot; in any other distro with a recent kernel.\nSuspend &#x2F; resume works perfectly out of the box, backlight worked after updating (which you should anyways after installing). Wireless worked perfectly out of the box, with NetworkManager. I use KDE Plasma, and it works well, too, without any complaints. All the function-buttons work, including volume, screen switching, sleep, mic mute. Webcam works. Didnt test slack or teams, but discord, atom and vscode (all electron apps) work perfectly fine. \nFirefox &amp; Chromium work perfectly fine.<p>I think in general, if you check the ArchWiki page on Laptops, there is a wonderful (and extensive) list of most common laptops and their issues (if any). Thinkpads seem to work very well, and, worst case, have good drivers made by the community for anything that doesnt work.')
