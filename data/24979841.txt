Highly paid, brilliant people are pitted against each other with massive stakes. It’s very likely that something bizarre happens. And there are still thousands of other things that COULD happen that didn’t, like a candidate getting removed by assassination, car wreck, illness, fatigue, enemy attack on the State, pandemic, on and on, that will have a massive impact on the state of things. The model was misleading, therefore it didn’t take into account Trump teams’ plan and the voters’ action.<p>I really don’t know how to value&#x2F;process information like “Clinton 90% most likely to win,” and “Clinton loses in hotly contested election.” How do you get from A to B. The outcome of that election is heavily into “butterfly effect” territory, Taleb says model should never have been so confident. I would agree. Was it bad input info into the model or just a bad model because it relies on inputs subject to bias? I don’t know but the output information is certainly less valuable than the attention it’s receiving. Seems largely academic, and worthwhile, but not worthy of broad attention outside of the quant circles. (Nate Silver 538 is a popular topic around me, deeply non-quant territory, self included)')
