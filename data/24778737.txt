However, I think calling even the first generation of contemporary VR a gimmick is an exageration.<p>There are some legitimately good experiences to be had in VR right now. Beat Saber is fun as hell, and SUPERHOT VR is great, from personal experience. However, the hardware is still a bit clunky and asks a lot of the user, and developers are still working out what how to design for it. Unfortunately that means a lot of titles are, in fact, pretty damned gimmicky.')
