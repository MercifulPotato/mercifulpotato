I&#x27;d say that the process is a reflection of the environment and the work.<p>My environment is focused on supporting&#x2F;enhancing&#x2F;fixing the commercial ERP system that we use to run our business.  There&#x27;s room for creativity, but at the end of the day it&#x27;s still about supporting a relatively boring HR&#x2F;Financial system.  Technology is not our core business, but we do invest in it in order to better execute on our core business.<p>Some people thrive working on these systems and in this type of environment, but others would be bored to tears.<p>If it does work as a reverse filter like you suggest, I lose out on a really good developer, but the really good developer avoids taking a job that he&#x27;d find soul destroying.  Overall, that&#x27;s probably a win.')
