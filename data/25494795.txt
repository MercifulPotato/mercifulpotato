Item(by='mehrdadn', descendants=None, kids=[25494821], score=None, time=1608557958, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25494758, text='The time and votes don&#x27;t explain this, and &quot;more comments = bad&quot; doesn&#x27;t either. Because [1] has 27 points with 8 comments from 3 hours ago, whereas [2] has 28 points with 7 comments from 1 hour ago, and yet [1] is ranked #8 and [2] is ranked #13. I don&#x27;t see how any of those explain this. AFAIK this story never went above ~#10 either, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s been hanging around forever. It really looks like something&#x2F;someone has been either artificially boosting other stories or artificially penalizing this one to prevent it from going near the top.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25494109" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25494109</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25493495" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25493495</a>')
