People often forget this and I think it confuses the definition.<p>At this point people say &quot;bound by X&quot; when what they really mean is &quot;most of the time is spent doing X&quot;.<p>If you spend 5 seconds doing I&#x2F;O and then afterwards 1 second doing CPU heavy work, you are not I&#x2F;O bound. You can tell this because making the CPU work take 0.5 seconds less time still saves you 0.5 seconds. It&#x27;s not a bound at all.<p>In order for this to be I&#x2F;O bound you would need to do the CPU heavy work <i>during</i> the I&#x2F;O. Once the task is done that way, any optimisation on the CPU heavy work has precisely zero effect on runtime. This is how you know it&#x27;s bound.<p>I think the reason that web programmers have become confused by this particularly is because on a web server there is almost always <i>inter-request concurrency</i>. You run a bunch of workers on the same CPU and now your waiting-for-db time is concurrent with the doing-cpu-work time for a different request.<p>The system as a whole can be considered I&#x2F;O bound here because no mater how much faster you make the CPU, the number of requests per second you can process doesn&#x27;t go up and so it seems like you might as well not care about how fast the cpu-work part is.<p>And that&#x27;s all well and good, but it&#x27;s cold comfort for any <i>individual</i> request that still has to wait the full amount of time for a request to be served. You could absolutely improve the situation for any given request by improving the speed of the CPU or optimising the code it runs.')
