There are easy solutions to quickly expanding ICU beds:<p>1) moving patients who don&#x27;t need to be in ICU back to the regular wards.  Hospitals tend to have a &quot;use it or lose it&quot; view of ICU beds.<p>2) you can turn regulars ward beds into ICU beds fairly quickly.<p>The limiting factor is essentially the doctors&#x2F;nurses&#x2F;staff.  They are able to squeeze more space by forcing doctors&#x2F;nurses&#x2F;staff to work longer hours.  But you can&#x27;t shift radiology doctors&#x2F;nurses to ICU since they aren&#x27;t qualified.<p>We&#x27;ll know things are bad when there is a call for doctors from less hard areas to fly to the infected areas.<p>Long story short, its hard to know as layperson what % is bad, so we should just listen to the experts.')
