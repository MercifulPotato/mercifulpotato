Tesla doesn’t have them on a federal level anymore and they’re able to compete against the larger market.<p>Also, the national security implications for keeping gasoline autos as a primary mode of transport are extremely concerning for many countries. China, for example, will never allow gasoline cars to be part of their long-term future. The discussions some countries have regarding completely banning personal automobiles running on gasoline are serious discussions.<p>So, I’m not sure one can really separate subsidy or penalty&#x2F;tax from the overall value proposition of owning a product, and one can’t necessarily count on those subsidies or restrictions going away.')
