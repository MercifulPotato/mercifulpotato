There&#x27;s a bit of sarcasm in my reply in that, usually, when I see people doing that in regards to this topic, they&#x27;re <i>not</i> referring to the sort ruinous, trust-eviscerating projects I cited, but rather to things like &quot;misinformation&quot; or &quot;divisive rhetoric&quot; which, when properly viewed in context, are more symptoms than causes.')
