It seems to be a concerted effort of various Western media led by the British ones to push the above propaganda to justify their colonization of India. What surprises me the most is when somebody talks about say the US, they don&#x27;t usually talk about things like oppression of African Americans but when it&#x27;s about India you are guaranteed to hear about caste or pollution or any of the assorted Indian stereotypes. As if no other country has any problem. Why not have some nuance when it comes to Indian issues? Combine that with a large Muslim population that wants to go back to the glorious Mughal days. That brings a whole lot of other problems. Two to three generations have already been brainwashed by history textbooks that concerned more with political correctness than truth. Not just political correctness, Indian history books blatantly lie to their readers.  Most of the narratives about Indians are from non-Indians. Look at the Indologists of most western universities. Majority of them are non-Indians. India&#x27;s story is told by people who have not lived in India, don&#x27;t know our languages, have no skin in the game here. I am tired of hearing the false narratives of Hindu (especially brahminical) extremism. This is dangerous especially because brahmins are a microminority who have already been genocided in states like Kashmir. But nobody wants to mention this because it doesn&#x27;t fit the agenda of the newsmakers. And what kind of oppression are you talking about in current scenario? The Sikhs are not oppressed. The 1984 Sikh genocide was committed solely by Indira&#x27;s congress and was not a Hindu vs Sikh issue. The current government will definitely not keep quiet if they demand for Khalistan if that is what you are talking about. If India goes on giving up regions for minorities, there will be no country left anymore. Most issues in India are because of weak leaders and their twisted definition of secularism to favor minorities. Indian leaders never created an environment to unite the people. They just continued the British divide and rule policy. I blame the foreign (especially Abrahamic religions) powers for completely destroying India&#x27;s culture. The destruction has been so complete that nobody knows what the original culture was anymore. Of course, conditions have improved since the state got rid some of it&#x27;s socialist tendencies. But, the rest of the world refuses to get rid of India&#x27;s previous image. The current Indian generation is aspirational, ambitious and has finally opened it&#x27;s eyes to how previous governments manipulated the people. It doesn&#x27;t care what the rest of the world thinks of us anymore. If you still want to stick to what you understood by staying in a limited space for a limited time by interacting with a limited number of people, it is your problem and not Indians&#x27;. But, unlike the yesteryears we now have  access to platforms and will counter anybody who paints us with a broadstroke.')
