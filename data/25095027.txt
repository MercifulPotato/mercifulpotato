Without leverage, we wouldn&#x27;t be able to run the vast majority of our strategies.<p>Basically, leverage is immaterial: what matters is the risk of the strategy. A leveraged strategy could be less risky than an unleveraged  one.<p>Things that you should consider when deciding leverage: beta exposure, correlation to the market, volatility of the strategy, and the risk adjusted return of the strategy.<p>A classic example of this is risk parity: risk parity uses high leverage but is often safer than a classic 60&#x2F;40 portfolio.')
