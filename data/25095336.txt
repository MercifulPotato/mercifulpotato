It was very different back then. The first decade of Mac OS X was brilliant. I felt it was the best consumer OS ever made. It was also a fairly &quot;open&quot; system: Mac UI on top, UNIX underneath.<p>The second decade of Mac OS X (now macOS), has been a disaster IMO. It just keeps getting worse and worse. All of the restrictions we see now were added in the past 8 years or so.<p>In short, I was already fully committed to the Mac before it started to get locked down, but I&#x27;m becoming increasingly uncomfortable with it as time goes on. There&#x27;s not a great alternative, however.')
