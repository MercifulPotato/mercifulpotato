That&#x27;s really impressive and something you have to actually train for.<p>I guess they did train that movement specifically (in armor etc.), because it&#x27;s not something you could just randomly do on a whim even if you are very strong. Definitely not something you would WANT to do on a whim if you can fall down to your death and also have to be in good enough shape after to fight (which makes this particularly crazy).<p>Damn, considering that they were also trained grapplers, those must have  been one hell of sparring partners.')
