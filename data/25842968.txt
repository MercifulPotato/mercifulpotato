When Gallileo claimed the earth spins, people didn&#x27;t look at the facts, thought about it, then came back and congratulated him on his discovery!\nThey accused him of heresy, imprisoned him and would burn him at the stake if he didn&#x27;t &quot;repent&quot;.<p>Only by those generations fading away, paving way for new less-biased and more open minded people, ideas&#x2F;trends&#x2F;facts finally got recognized. (Galileo died in house arrest, and only 300 years later his teachings got accepted).<p>Dying and letting go is crucial.
