Item(by='pmoriarty', descendants=None, kids=[25257225, 25257593, 25257234], score=None, time=1606760898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25256770, text='<i>&quot;what they failed to capture is the dissonant tone of our modern dystopia&quot;</i><p>I just reread <i>Neuromancer</i> and <i>Count Zero</i>, and the main thing I was struck by that Gibson didn&#x27;t predict was today&#x27;s omnipresent surveillance.<p>The people in his novels don&#x27;t voluntarily carry around tracking devices and recoring devices.  What they read and watch isn&#x27;t tracked, and neither are their preferences or the opinions they express.  They tend to have much more privacy than most people do today.<p>In this respect, I find today&#x27;s society closer to <i>1984</i> than to <i>Brave New World</i>.  It&#x27;s <i>1984</i>, complete with <i>Newspeak</i>, <i>doublethink</i> and <i>Two Minutes of Hate</i> for the boogeyman of the day, telescreens that combine televisions with security cameras and microphones what monitor what you do.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that Gibson chose not to incorporate such dystopian themes in his books, and opted for what is in many ways a more optimistic dystopia.')
