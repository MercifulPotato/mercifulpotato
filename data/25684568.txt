They don&#x27;t need those permissions for iMessage as they get the data from other sources, like iCloud, unique advertising ID, IMEI, phone number, etc. I&#x27;m amazed how even HN users eat this PR raw without a second of doubt. Apple is abusing their market position (100%) to further their own advertisement platform.')
