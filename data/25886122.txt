It&#x27;s funny that in America, people seem to have so given up on the idea of the police being honest and competent that all they want is to reduce their power. They don&#x27;t seem to want reform and instead would rather suffer from crime than be investigated by the police.<p>Becoming a suspect shouldn&#x27;t be a scary thing to avoid.
