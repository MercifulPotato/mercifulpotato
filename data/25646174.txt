Quit a little over a year ago with 20mg caffeine pills for about a week or two. Had headaches the entire two weeks. I had a total tolerance to caffeine at this point. I could drink an entire can right before bed and sleep absolutely fine.<p>I think my productivity increased, but really it was just removing the &quot;brain fog&quot; of feeling like I had to ingest more caffeine that boosted my productivity.<p>Things that changed for me:<p>* no more &quot;I forgot to drink caffeine&#x2F;didn&#x27;t have access, now I have withdrawl&quot;.<p>* my hangovers after drinking alcohol are more tolerable or gone.<p>* no more compulsive soda drinking when bored<p>Things that didn&#x27;t change for me:<p>* sleep<p>* energy<p>* overall mood<p>* weight<p>* caffeine still has no (or imperceptible) impact on me when I drink small amounts from tea. Most months I go with 0mg.<p>I think many people ascribe quitting coffee, soda, or caffeine to many of the things that didn&#x27;t impact me, but those same people also note other life changes they did at the same time and I suspect that had a greater impact for them.<p>That said, I replaced my caffine habit with seltzer&#x2F;sparkling water (which helps trick me into thinking it is a soda). I now drink large amounts of seltzer instead.<p>Every time I see a diet coke? Anxiety spikes, I have to strongly resist the urge to drink it. Caffeine addiction was pretty terrible for me.')
