I am type 1 diabetic. NovoRapid (10 x 3ml) costs 73€. My insurance (which is required in Slovakia and costs me about 70€&#x2F;month) covers 64€. That means I pay only 9€. I usually get one package every three months. That means insulin costs me 3€ per month. Average salary in Slovakia is currently 13100€&#x2F;year.')
