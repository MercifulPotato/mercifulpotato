It&#x27;s OK to selectively breed and mass euthanize animals.<p>&gt; look at what most mammals do, and why we think they do it - wait, all humans do that also!<p>Do they? Have we checked? We do some things that are similar to animal behavior, but ours is .. considerably more complicated.<p>I mean, yes obviously we are animals in the sense of being of the same substance and biological processes, and that has theological implications; this is why Darwin pointing that out was so disruptive. However, there&#x27;s a long tradition of using <i>analogies</i> (not actual research) drawn from the animal kingdom to make wrong and harmful conclusions about humans, usually for the purposes of finding a moral justification for inhuman treatment.<p>Something that took me a long time to realize about the Scopes Monkey Trial was that, not only was it theologicallly problematic for humans to have derived from animals, it was even more problematic to the public of the time for white humans to share a common ancestor with black humans, since there was demand to make this illegal.<p>Tennessee 1925: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scopes_Trial" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scopes_Trial</a><p>Seven years later: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_Jim_Crow_law_examples_by_state#Tennessee" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_Jim_Crow_law_examples_...</a> &quot;Classified &quot;Negro&quot; as any person with any Negro blood&quot;.')
