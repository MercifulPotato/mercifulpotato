It sounds quite obvious but in these arguments people often just state what they personally like and leave it at that.<p>Your office can be place where you still have the option to work uninterrupted but also get the benefits of face-to-face interaction, casual exposure to work ideas, better meetings, having all the equipment you need, separating work and personal life. Or it can be a hell where you hate every second and can&#x27;t get anything done. Your commute can be a 15-minute walk or it can be a couple of hours of driving - vastly different experiences.<p>Your home office can mean working on a laptop at a tiny desk in a small bedroom in shared accommodation with loud housemates; or it can be a great setup in a separate room in your own flat&#x2F;house. Again, those are completely different experiences.<p>I suspect that a lot of people talk about how much they like remote because they happened to be on the bad end of the office-quality scale and the good end of the home-quality scale. And when your work circle is made up people who also worked in the same bad office environment, it&#x27;s easy to say something like &quot;no one I know wants to go back to the office&quot;.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve had a great office with a short commute in the past, and my home office situation is quite poor right now. So I&#x27;m looking forward to working from an office in the future.')
