Everyone gets less controlled as they get stressed, but controlling how you express that is hugely important.<p>People are capable of maturing, and being a more cool and stable presence can help. I used to tutor in high school and college, and I experienced a lot of people expressing their frustration with the material through some degree of anger (sometimes directed at me). Over the course of the term (and often this only took a couple weeks), by being a calmer presence and letting them air their frustrations, nearly all of them stopped reacting this way.<p>Stepping away from them was not necessary, and would have delayed this maturation process. Instead, I let their actions reflect back on them by my cooler reaction. Usually they were embarrassed and somewhat ashamed, I&#x27;d say it was cool, I understood, but do better. And over time they would.<p>If they don&#x27;t mature, then it&#x27;s time to step away.')
