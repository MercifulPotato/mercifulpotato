Water purification is done with a UV filter. The infrastructure costs are almost nil.<p>How well would such a thing scale, though, especially in a suburban&#x2F;urban setting? IIRC sceptic systems need a certain amount&#x2F;type of land to drain correctly, so that wouldn&#x27;t work particularly well outside of relatively rural areas. Wells might not work beyond a certain population density due to insufficient groundwater recharge rate. And dirt roads still would require maintenance, especially if you want to support nontrivial traffic levels, not to mention relatively high-speed travel.')
