And &quot;of course&quot; it&#x27;s ok if people don&#x27;t regard him as a super hero.<p>But despite being a lifelong Democrat there is a certain level of concern over purity that makes me uneasy. All my Jewish cousins who were in Europe mysteriously disappeared during WWII. Yet, I own and enjoy a German car whose corporate origins are very intertwined with the  history of that period of time. I think the Apollo program was pretty cool, and that was fundamentally rooted in the exploitation of German expertise from rocket research involving Nazi slave labor during the war.<p>So, if someone is disgusted with these things and personally avoids them, that&#x27;s cool. But if they are on a crusade to purify society from them, I probably don&#x27;t want to be neighbors.')
