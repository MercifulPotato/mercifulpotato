There&#x27;s a very thin line in between and I feel many interviewers will fall on different sides - particularly depending on whether they are in a technical or in a business role.<p>In my eyes, mentioning such numbers usually comes of as resume clich√©. By all means, demonstrate your understanding of the business context or highlight an important problem you solved. But I agree with the quoted part regarding numbers without context being pointless - if they&#x27;re modest then you didn&#x27;t do yourself a favor, and if they&#x27;re impressive then I am skeptical about taking them at face value.')
