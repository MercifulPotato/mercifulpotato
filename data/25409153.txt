The applications that benefit enormously from SIMD outside the GPU (like ML, multimedia codecs, etc) are being migrated to proprietary function blocks interfaces through Swift frameworks, and not hand rolling optimized blocks of code in C and assembly.<p>I would not be surprised if we see similar things added for audio DSP to support their creative software (it was alluded to in some marketing materials, haven&#x27;t read much on it yet).<p>Other applications like language parsing and compiling is likely going to be a second class citizen moving forward, since Apple doesn&#x27;t care about using their machines for general purpose development regardless of how many of us buy them for being solid Unix platforms.')
