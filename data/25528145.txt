Item(by='avaldeso', descendants=None, kids=[25528944], score=None, time=1608823046, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25527927, text='&gt; Vision really disappointed in the penultimate. I think his character was hyped up a lot in Age of Ultron. Became disappointing seeing him go so easily.<p>To be fair most overpowered characters where nerfed in Endgame. eg. Fat Thor, Dr. Strange aside of the battle containing a flood, Captain Marvel arriving last minute and being knocked out immediately, Hulk as Prof. Hulk. The stakes can&#x27;t be that high if all superheroes are at their full performance.')
