That’s not a monopoly, that’s standard practice in the retail business.<p>Thus the presence of competing products or the fact that generics appear against popular options is really not a good argument for nefarious activity.<p>The issue from some of those crying foul is really that there isn’t any brand loyalty towards what are commodity items. Why should someone buy your more expensive HDMI cable when a perfectly good one sells for less? It’s a valid question those crying foul need to answer. The answer here of course is that many&#x2F;most of those doing the selling are middle-men and not actual product manufacturers thus it’s very easy to undercut the person that doesn’t really need to be part of the supply chain.')
