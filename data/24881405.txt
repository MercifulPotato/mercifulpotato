I was responding to the immediate parent, not the OP. The comment I was responding to was whether transcoding is an act covered by copyright, and it is.<p>The OP&#x27;s comment was different. He was using youtube-dl to download videos uploaded by his own clients, which was fine because they&#x27;re the copyright owners. Transcoding doesn&#x27;t generally create a separate copyrighted work because at least for these types of media, the underlying representation of the bits doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Note: <i>this isn&#x27;t fair use.</i> Fair use is a defense to violating copyright, and a copyright owner can&#x27;t violate their own copyright ...but if they licensed one or more copyrights to a third party, they <i>could</i> violate the third party&#x27;s copyrights depending on the terms of that license.')
