Pattern-matching, guards, good compiler messages, casting, etc.<p>You&#x27;ve also got fantastic testing framework, and good conventions like tagged tuples {:ok, x} vs {:error, y}.<p>On top of all of that, you&#x27;ve got the Erlang underpinnings: immutability, crash-fast, app umbrellas, etc.<p>It&#x27;s a very safe language to develop in.  I don&#x27;t miss the strict static typing at all.')
