Going further, it also affects behavior in a way which I can only label as agentic: it&#x27;s correlated with motivation, vigilance, and low levels of anxiety or fear.[0]<p>I choose these words for two reasons. First, the ratio of muscle to fat is important for most any metabolic disorder (this means both diabetes and obesity, which are comorbid). Muscles are actively important in metabolic health as they burn calories through use. And contrariwise, among their other problems, fat cells store and secrete estrogens, which is problematic for those that wish to identify as cis male. Clearly some level of the growth cascades that testosterone produces is useful for metabolic health, if not testosterone itself. Else we get into an obesity spiral and limit the development of our own bodies.<p>Second, high testosterone is often associated with anti-social outcomes like violence. While this is (weakly!) true, this isn&#x27;t the whole truth. For instance, people given testosterone actually produced fairer deals vs non-blinded placebo.[0] So it seems more appropriate to call testosterone a status regulator than an aggression hormone.<p>Let&#x27;s say we avoid the view that <i>no testosterone</i> is good â€“ this would be ad absurdum considering its central role in the body&#x27;s development. Even if you were to disagree as to basal level of testosterone in 1999, there are clear positive outcomes associated with testosterone which we can organize our sense of what is optimal around; it is possible that we have swung too far, and our current levels are not good enough.<p>To deny the positive aspects of testosterone, is to deny its usefulness to metabolic health, to regulating status, and maintaining the spiritedness to engage with life.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;uRg5Q2vAteDem5b5S&#x2F;social-status-and-testosterone" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;uRg5Q2vAteDem5b5S&#x2F;social-sta...</a>')
