The way I use reddit, what it does now actually works better for me (again, apart from how slow it is): I subscribe to a mix of subs with like 50% of image and video posts. Which I can now just see full size without clicking, and quickly scroll through if not interesting. With old.reddit and teddit, I have to look at a tiny thumbnail to decide whether I&#x27;d want to see the full version. Similar for text posts: being able to read the first couple of lines isn&#x27;t that bad.')
