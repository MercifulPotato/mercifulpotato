Like no-cars-no-people-no-life-at-all-dead.</i><p>I view this as a good thing, considering we&#x27;re doing much better with our COVID caseload than many other places are.  I suspect Chicago isn&#x27;t doing quite as well as we are in that regard if you&#x27;ve see a lot of people out and about all the time (looks like your caseload per capita is ~8x ours per a sibling comment?).<p>To be completely fair, though, things have changed a lot since a few months ago.  I go for an evening jog two or three nights a week and see a good number of people out walking, running, driving, and biking, and outdoor dining in many places (North Beach, Hayes Valley, even my little corner of the Dogpatch) has made the city feel more vibrant in some ways than in pre-pandemic times.<p>It&#x27;s raining out now, but I plan to walk up to Potrero this evening for dinner where there&#x27;s a semi-covered outdoor space.<p>Obviously I would not wish this pandemic -- or the associated increase in financial&#x2F;housing insecurity for a lot of people -- on anyone, but in several ways I <i>like</i> how SF has changed because of it.  There&#x27;s not been a lot to be proud of with how SF has handled homelessness and the housing crisis over the past several years, but pandemic response has been pretty great, all things considered.')
