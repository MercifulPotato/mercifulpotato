It&#x27;s rooted at mjw1007&#x27;s comment &quot;When I file a bug report[…]&quot; and, before that, the linked article where antirez deals with the same matter that I&#x27;m discussing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24670700" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24670700</a><p>A later comment—the one that I responded to—<i>tries</i> to convince us to focus on the maintainer and sell the appreciation-as-compensation, maintainers-get-nothing, and, implicitly, the bug-reports-have-negative-value perspective that is pushed in the circles I referenced above.  And that&#x27;s the problem.  As I wrote elsewhere, filing bug reports takes more effort than not filing them.  By myopically portraying the maintainer as if they&#x27;re a protagonist in some Gary Stu fanfic about the world, we end up with a take that fails to consider <i>all</i> the relevant details, and that&#x27;s the attitude that antirez admonishes.  Please revisit both the article and the comment linked above.<p>(I&#x27;m not really interested in responding further to this conversation.)')
