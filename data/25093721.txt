Messages are stored on &quot;homeservers&quot;, which is similar in concept to an email server except it&#x27;s much easier to host your own Matrix homeserver. Only the homeservers which have involved in a chatroom ever see a copy of the message. For private chatrooms, everything is E2E encrypted by default so the homeservers don&#x27;t have access to the plaintext of your messages.')
