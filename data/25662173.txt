A t-bond is basically a bank account with the US Treasury saying that you gave them USD and that you&#x27;re entitled to that USD back, with interest, at some later date.<p>Saying China &quot;dumping&quot; t-bonds is bad for America is like saying that a person &quot;dumping&quot; CDs is bad for a bank.  The seller is the one getting hosed on the deal, because they are forced to sell at a discount (otherwise, it wouldn&#x27;t constitute dumping).  The bank &#x2F; treasury already knows they need to pay back the money at some point.<p>Also, a trillion dollars in t-bonds isn&#x27;t that much.  The Fed has purchased hundreds of billion on several occasions without much fanfare.  A trillion bucks won&#x27;t do much more than trigger some NYTimes articles on the subject.')
