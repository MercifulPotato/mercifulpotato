Item(by='crazygringo', descendants=None, kids=[24899270, 24901935], score=None, time=1603732956, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24897279, text='For most short interactions, the mouse&#x2F;trackpad&#x2F;finger is simply faster.<p>Now for long-form typing, I&#x27;d <i>love</i> to use dictation and sometimes do for taking down short thoughts I e-mail myself from my iPhone.<p>But the problem is not just that it still makes <i>tons</i> of mistakes. (Probably a quarter of my notes-to-self involve errors so big it&#x27;s even impossible for me to later figure out what I even meant by trying to sound it out phonetically.)<p>The problem is that <i>I can&#x27;t correct those mistakes using voice</i>. There&#x27;s no way to say &quot;pause, correct affect to effect&quot; or anything like that.<p>Even more maddeningly, the words keep changing in real time. Sometimes I&#x27;ll utter a sentence it gets right, then it &quot;re-analyzes&quot; it and completely messes half of it up.<p>I just wish there were a kind of dictation where I could say a phrase, pause, see if it&#x27;s right (and it wouldn&#x27;t change after), say the wrong part with a kind of emphasis that lets the system know I&#x27;m issuing a correction, the system would look for the next most probable alternative, repeat as desired. Then I could <i>actually</i> dictate successfully.<p>This UX where the words are always changing back and forth according to updated statistical probabilities, even as long as 15 seconds after I said them, and where there&#x27;s no ability to go back and correct them with voice... it&#x27;s just <i>so so dumb</i>.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t voice recognition anymore. It&#x27;s voice correction.')
