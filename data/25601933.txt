Item(by='wpietri', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609492737, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25599094, text='The new coins aren&#x27;t handed out generally. They are rewards to the &quot;miners&quot;. They&#x27;re relevant only for people going into the mining business. I&#x27;m talking about price speculation.<p>For people speculating, there&#x27;s always a buyer and a seller. If I buy $100 of Bitcoin from person A and then later sell that for $101 to person B, then I have gained a dollar. A dollar that A would have gotten had they held on, or B would have gotten had they bought in earlier. It&#x27;s a zero sum game. Except that everybody involved is paying transaction fees, putting in otherwise-valuable time, and taking risk (e.g., of theft), so in reality it&#x27;s a negative sum game.<p>That&#x27;s very different than actual investing. If I put $100 into a friend&#x27;s company, then they will hopefully use that money to create something more valuable than the total investment. I&#x27;ll come out ahead, but so will my friend and my friend&#x27;s customers. That&#x27;s a positive-sum game.')
