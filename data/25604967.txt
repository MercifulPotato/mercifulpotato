The pandemic will burn out once enough people (let&#x27;s say X% of the population) are immune to the virus, and this is called &quot;herd immunity&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s take the UK as our population. If a vaccine is 60% effective and we administer it to everyone in the UK, then about 60% of the UK&#x27;s population will gain immunity to COVID. Another Y% of the population will have immunity to COVID already, even if the vaccine didn&#x27;t work for them. Then the question is, is Y + 60 &gt; X, thereby achieving herd immunity?<p>You can see that if a vaccine is 95% effective, it&#x27;s more likely to be above the herd immunity threshold of X%. Current estimates for X are about 70%.')
