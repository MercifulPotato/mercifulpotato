Boolean logic is math. Incrementing an integer is math. A pixel coordinate is math.<p>But most programmers don&#x27;t need to use or understand the specialized notation of math - all the weird and beautiful symbols. We use the programming language as notation instead.<p>Some branches like calculus or statistics are not used regularly by the average programmer, but other branches like integer arithmetic or boolean logic is pervasive in any form of programming.')
