That seems so rude to me!<p>I&#x27;ve never actually had this happen to me, but I nonetheless fear it will 100% of the time I start typing something and then delete it. In any IM application that has a typing indicator (especially Slack at work -- I shudder at the thought of typing out a long message in #general), I&#x27;ve taken to drafting messages that require any non-trivial degree of thought to type in a separate box, e.g. a message to myself, and then copy-pasting it into the actual chat.')
