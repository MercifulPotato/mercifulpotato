(Since it’s a dictatorship I mean I guess they don’t really care about having representation of minority groups in positions of power). Does China have schemes to help minorities in China attend college? Are there advocate groups representing Uighu interests in Beijing? Do they have any history or education in Chinese textbooks about the Uighur or other minorities? In the US we did a lot of bad stuff (we all benefit from it now, so every single American born today is as guilty as any other) but at least we actually acknowledge it!<p>How many immigrants of any sort does China allow to fully immigrate into China on a yearly basis? Can a Syrian apply for a visa or move to China as a refugee?<p>Why are some Chinese racist against Africans and why is that overlooked? [1], [2], [3]<p>Does the US have problems? Yep. Even if the US “was the same”, last I checked we have protests and people campaigning to fix our issues.  So even if you wanted to make the outlandish claim that “the U.S. is the same”, you can easily look around and see that at a minimum we highlight problems in our society. Who is running against Xi to stop the genocide of Uighur Muslims?<p>The only thing that makes sense to me here is social media. You (not you specifically) see that first outrage article and then down the scrolling and clicking hole you go until you’re just addicted to being outraged.<p>I put what I call America-denialism on a similar level as I do anti-vaxers, flat earth era, 9&#x2F;11 truthers, or Trump deep-state conspiracy theorists. It’s just another wacky idea that you get from extended periods of time going down social media rabbit holes.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;coronavirus-racism-africans-china&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;coronavirus-racism-africans-chi...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2020&#x2F;apr&#x2F;27&#x2F;china-fails-to-stop-racism-against-africans-over-covid-19" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2020&#x2F;apr&#x2F;27&#x2F;china-fails-to...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foreignpolicy.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;15&#x2F;chinas-racism-is-wrecking-its-success-in-africa&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foreignpolicy.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;15&#x2F;chinas-racism-is-wrecki...</a>')
