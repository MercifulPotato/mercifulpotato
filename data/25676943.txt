I have that TV and everything feels very snappy, it&#x27;s good enough that I have a 2019 Shield TV sitting unused[1]. They feel pretty much the same (despite the Shield&#x27;s Tegra being massively overpowered), even in game streaming performance (Steam Link and NVIDIA GameStream&#x2F;Moonlight).<p>The common sentiment is that the new SOC is [&quot;finally&quot;] great. I wonder if they reused that SOC in the new XR series or picked another one, but either way it looks like they&#x27;re not underpowered anymore. Bloatware was apparently massively reduced last year too, and there&#x27;s a &quot;delete all demo [retail] content&quot; option in settings to reduce it further.<p>[1] I originally bought it because I figured (A) all Smart TVs are underpowered and (B) Smart TVs are not trustworthy, but this model is powerful enough and you can fully opt-out of analytics, even disable the Samba (not SMB) APK entirely.')
