It required a plethora of other tools and services to share, get feedback, or insights on my work.<p>The tool is only as effective as the reach of its creation.  If technology has shown us anything in this generation, it is that reach and collaboration are immensely more valuable than tools themselves.<p>I&#x27;ve watched our company move from Sketch to Figma.  The crappy performance is a relatively small price to pay in exchange for inclusive design.<p>My hope is that eventually Figma will launch platform native apps for MacOS and Windows, because I have zero hope that Sketch is ever going to figure out that they&#x27;ve been driving on the road to irrelevance for the past several years.')
