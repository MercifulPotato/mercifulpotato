The implication is that those who wear a mask outside do so to broadcast their left-leaning world view to others, and those who don&#x27;t wear a mask outside are taking a neutral stance and not broadcasting anything at all. But I think the reality is that non-mask wearers are also wanting to send a signal: something like &quot;I&#x27;m not a sheep. I think for myself. You can&#x27;t tell me what to do&quot;. Is there a name for this kind of signalling?')
