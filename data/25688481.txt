Freedom from speech also means freedom from compelled speech. A government can&#x27;t pass a law to make a Mom and Pop shop sell a certain magazine. And corporations enjoy the same freedoms: I&#x27;m very confident that the government could not pass a law forcing Twitter to overturn bans.

The postal service, for instance, can&#x27;t just refuse service to people they don&#x27;t like. Same with power companies. I&#x27;m not sure how phone providers and ISPs fit into this. But I think it may be useful to have ISPs, payment providers, and maybe also DNS and DDOS protection providers be considered utilities. My basic measuring stick is that putting HMTL and CSS out on the internet should be protected akin to the ability to send letters through the mail.')
