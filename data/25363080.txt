I don&#x27;t want to discourage you from self-hosting OwnTracks, but I would like to clarify one thing about Zood Location. The server doesn&#x27;t store any location data in plaintext. Your location is encrypted <i>before</i> it leaves your phone in such a wat that only the intended recipient can decrypt it (Zood can&#x27;t view it). That encrypted payload is placed in a drop box on the server for the recipient to pick up later. Newer payloads of encrypted location info will then overwrite the old data in the same drop box.<p>A case could be made that hosting an instance of OwnTrack with your location data in the clear on a VPS somebody else controls is less safe than storing it encrypted on someone else&#x27;s server.')
