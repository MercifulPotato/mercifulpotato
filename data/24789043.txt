I would argue instead that social media platforms have been facing the abyss for some time and cannot be saved. New censors beget new methods of exploitation and platforms literally adding new continents of users will only add to the noise. Let’s not fall into the trap of throwing away our guaranteed rights for short term convenience. Instead let’s consider that social media is not a source of truth going forward and adjust accordingly.')
