At least one individual has been arrested for carrying a loaded pistol on Capitol grounds.  It is utterly fanciful to suggest none of the rioters were armed.<p>Have you even forgotten Trump&#x27;s exhortation that the &quot;second amendment people&quot; might &quot;do something&quot; about Hillary Clinton?<p>In order to believe that Trump did not incite violence you must overlook the way he&#x27;s been beating the drum and fanning the flames all along.  Writing out his meandering, discursive speech tries to remove from the picture what we all know he means and intends.')
