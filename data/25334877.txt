Since the birth of computer science we&#x27;ve known that computers are mysterious in the sense that even though their operation is deterministic in a very natural sense, its outcome is not generally knowable; so deterministic but indeterminable. Dowek merely points out that this is not just a problem with computers but also the very point of them. If their operation&#x27;s outcome were easily determinable, we wouldn&#x27;t need it.')
