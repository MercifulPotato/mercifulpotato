Even in very high performance code, I&#x27;ve never seen anyone turn them off for performance. This makes a lot of sense considering that on modern CPUs everything except cache misses is basically free, so a single unlikely branch compare usually just does not matter.<p>The only exception I can think of is accessing lots of indexes in a loop, where getting good performance requires rust programmers to insert awkward asserts or casts to fixed length arrays to get the checks to optimize out[1]. But afaik that&#x27;s mostly because the bound checks impede other loop optimisations like vectorization, not because the checks are slow themselves.<p>[1] (e.g. when you access indexes 1 to n randomly, assert n &lt; length before)')
