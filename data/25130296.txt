Item(by='thro1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605649364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25109172, text='&gt;.. it causes an infinite redirect loop on the slack homepage.<p>- and on every other page. But with <i>accessibility.blockautorefresh=true</i> and without JavaScript the site is still usable and quite nice. There are few things that could work easily but they don&#x27;t - as the &#x27;Resources&#x27; item in the top bar could be a link as the others - but isn&#x27;t. Occasionally, on some pages there are items looking [kind of] like links - but clicking on them didn&#x27;t let me progress further. I can browse through slack app directory, but what I see for every app is only a logo, a name and spinning circle instead of anything else..<p>Actually.. after looking at the code.. there could be some simple stylish way for fixing most of this stuff - with the Stylish extension:<p><pre><code>  @-moz-document url-prefix(&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slack.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;&quot;) {\n    .c-tabs__tab_panel    {    display:block; }\n    .medium_bottom_margin {    display: block !important; visibility: visible !important; }\n    .infinite_spinner     {    display: none; }    \n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe items looking like links which don&#x27;t work, I guess, supposed to be &#x27;buttons&#x27; in &#x27;application&#x27;- what means there is no reference on them to related resources or actions and those are less easy to fix.<p>I don&#x27;t see really why this site pretends to need JavaScript and tries to enforce it - maybe because of some minor accessibility problems which are attempted to be fixed somehow with bigger accessibility problems, maybe it&#x27;s needed on some other stages.<p>It happens that the apps pages have most of the necessary information just in place, ready to display, but postpone it to do some network requests and processing of some kind, probably with workers.\nWith JavaScript disabled and provided fixes they show up instantly. :))\nThat satisfies my use case - be able to evaluate when I could be interested in this platform and to be more in touch with such things, not quite in my focus yet, but which could become important sooner; not being forced much to stuff which I dislike or which break my flow. I mostly can&#x27;t enjoy JavaScript, being stuck on obsolete browser versions because of Firefox&#x27;s regression and other browsers not being even close to its earlier abilities.<p>Finally, life is to short to fix random accessibility whatever problems, paying for it with own karma - couldn&#x27;t we just not unnecessarily force barriers to each others, but gently try to make things easier, as WWW was intended ?')
