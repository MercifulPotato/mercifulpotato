It&#x27;s only a personal judgment whether you follow an order.  Soldiers aren&#x27;t the legal arbiters.  The legal process will determine if it was lawful only after the fact.  Society will also judge after the fact.  Both have means to punish you for picking wrongly.<p>But the safe bet today is to refuse any unconsciousable order because the next administration likely won&#x27;t punish for it.')
