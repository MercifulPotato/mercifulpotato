The actual malicious <i>payload</i> that was installed on the compromised networks was very sophisticated. It was discussed in the HN post when the news first went live, but the payload went to great and pretty ingenious lengths to hide its tracks and prevent detection. I remember a bunch of HN comments along the lines of &quot;Wow, how did the companies ever even find that?!&quot;<p>2. How SolarWinds was originally <i>breached</i> hasn&#x27;t been released, and while the &quot;solarwinds123&quot; password is an unrelated issue, it does point to a pretty shocking lack of security culture at SolarWinds.<p>I&#x27;m going to put my chips down on the original breach being quite simple and mundane, but SolarWinds will go (and has already gone) to great lengths to emphasize the sophistication of the attackers to try to deflect blame.')
