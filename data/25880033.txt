And I switched to something that wasn&#x27;t so bad, and never thought much more about it for a long time.<p>Then after a decade and a half, for various reasons, but particularly to check for celiac, I finally went to an allergist to be tested for common allergies, who said &quot;oh yeah, your medication is an antihistamine, so you&#x27;ll have to stop taking it for a few days in order to be tested&quot;. Which I decided I really can&#x27;t.<p>I feel like nobody says it most of the time, or acts on it, and many don&#x27;t have any idea, but it <i>is</i> widely known at the same time. Which is eerie.')
