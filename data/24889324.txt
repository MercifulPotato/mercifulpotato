I tested this the other day by searching for &#x27;rust&#x27;. On Google the entire first page of results were either about the programming language or some game. DDG had something about iron oxide as the third result.<p>Whenever I use DDG, I just have to remember that DDG does not have my personal profile, and adjust accordingly. Then the results are fine, and even better if I&#x27;m searching outside my normal profile.')
