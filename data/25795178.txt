Draw as it makes writing event-driven code dead simple, with coroutines managed behind the scenes as you write code serially. Drawback as if you pull in the wrong library, one that does something in a blocking fashion (such as with a c module that doesn’t “get” Lua), you can get into some trouble.<p>In terms of syntax it’s basically JavaScript with stupid array indexing, which is enough to turn people off I’m sure.')
