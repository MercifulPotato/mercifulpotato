I expect I&#x27;ll find it useful though, being not really a JS person who does need to write some JS and would rather maintain decent JS than awful.<p>What it seems to lack, which I find a sticking point whenever I consider some greenfield personal project, is the dizzying array of &#x27;tooling stuff&#x27; that JS has, and how it does or doesn&#x27;t fit together, etc. There&#x27;s just all sorts of weird layers and not quite equivalents and can be equivalents but could also be used togethers, half the stuff it&#x27;s not even clear what it is or if it&#x27;s necessary at all.<p>I really hope wasm brings more <i>different</i> options (hard to phrase that to not sound hypocritical!) one day; that we just have some tiny JS shim that everyone uses, and other than that it&#x27;s totally arbitrary which language and ecosystem you use, JS an option, but no more obvious than anything else.')
