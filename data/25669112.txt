For example, in the 2000s, we mostly used PHP and MySQL, today, it&#x27;s very different. So being a specialist with, let&#x27;s say, 10+ years experience, would be quite difficult. I&#x27;m sure even the C++ people can say C++ has changed a lot in 20 years(?) and are doing things radically different today?<p>How could I be a React specialist with 20 years in the industry? Forget the past?')
