It&#x27;s so much easier to clean than a fully-carpeted house, no need to worry about accidentally spilling drinks in the lounge or accidentally tracking dog shit through the hallway. Much easier to fix any damage as well.<p>Best of all, it&#x27;s much less dusty than a carpeted house, since the floor isn&#x27;t covered with a giant magnet for dust and crumbs.')
