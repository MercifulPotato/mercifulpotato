You do not have any reasonable expectation of privacy when you&#x27;re on a street, sidewalk, or yard (whether it&#x27;s your yard or not).<p>[0] Every state is different; this is to say there is no national law prohibiting it (I&#x27;m not sure the federal government has jurisdiction for this kind of thing), and to my knowledge no state has a law explicitly prohibiting having a personally owned camera facing a public area like this.')
