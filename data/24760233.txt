I don&#x27;t care what they say, cell phones haven&#x27;t been around long enough for us to know whether or not there are long term effects.<p>Also I tend to charge my phone during the daytime so at night I just put it in airplane mode to conserve batteries and make sure it can pull itself through the night to be able to sound the alarm in the morning. The charging port on my phone is busted and the cable needs to be jiggled every now and then, so it&#x27;s not feasible to charge it reliably at night. Thanks, USB-C, for your horrible, non-rugged design that can&#x27;t get through 3 years of use.')
