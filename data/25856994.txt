Plenty good for the project at hand. I heard they have an ESP32 version now?<p>For one-off personal projects I&#x27;d probably still reach for a TinyPICO or FeatherS2 though because of the additional features they have, and that they have a Discord server you can ask questions to, but if you&#x27;re deploying a dozen of them in your garden and want to save money then yeah, the Wemos would probably be a good bet. Support and documentation is a little sparse though, in comparison.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dheera&#x2F;shadow-clock" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dheera&#x2F;shadow-clock</a>')
