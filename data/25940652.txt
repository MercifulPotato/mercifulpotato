Legally, I can see that they&#x27;re moving in an uncharted gray area that might eventually require lawyers and a judge to determine whether they did something illegal, or that eventually attracts lawmakers to adapt existing regulation.<p>I&#x27;m firmly on the side of WSB here though, and none of the above should be considered a moral rationale for its pre-emptive censorship. Controversial certainly doesn&#x27;t mean <i>wrong</i>, of which one might have the impression after the last months of social media purges.<p>I&#x27;m not at all surprised that WSB becomes the focus of such a power struggle, and very much hope it becomes another catalyst towards de-centralized, censorship-proof online communities.')
