That doesn’t happen with any other laptop - they’re essentially scrap (or worth next to nothing) within 5 years. After 10 years I might actually expect the value to be static or even increase for its collector value (e.g. clamshell iBook G3s)<p>The total cost of ownership for Apple products is actually lower over three years than any rival products I’m aware of.')
