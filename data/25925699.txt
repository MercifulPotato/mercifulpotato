Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=[25925717], score=None, time=1611736455, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25925059, text='&gt;  In graduate school, in my lab there was a grad student who was kind of an unlikely &quot;professor&#x27;s pet&quot;. He was tall and had surfer&#x27;s long hair with a bit of a hippie aesthetic. Anyways, he was also really completely clueless about how to do science correctly, but also, I guess, really good about playing politics (there was a time when he asked me to put some bacterial plasmid DNA on my mammalian cells. I told him &quot;it doesn&#x27;t work that way&quot;, but I did it anyways and handed over the cells, and he got the observation he was expecting). On his main project he was teamed up with a super sketchy foreign postdoc that I was convinced would say anything to get high profile papers out.<p>God damn, just this paragraph alone made me remember why I ran like hell after my undergrad even during the financial crisis of 2008&#x27;s horrible job market and being up to my eyeballs in debt; I saw the politicking behind what it took just to get a department to give a nod to a tenured professor&#x27;s peer reviewed paper.<p>It was fucking pathetic and I&#x27;ve never been more ashamed of my what would be my <i>profession</i> than that but it set the tone for what to expect and made me realize just how irreparably marred that system is. It was followed by a sense of dread that nothing I could do would ever change that and I turned down the offer to work in said professor&#x27;s lab to carry things on into grad school (MS) and just worked as hard as possible to pay off my debts and pivot my Life entirely. I&#x27;d rather sweep and clean floors helping a small business grow into something real than ever go back to that despicable environment.<p>Academia is definitely a mind-prison, and a trap for so many brilliant minds that may not have ability or wherewithal to try their hand a startup or have the necessary paperwork (citizenship) to take on private sector work, which itself carries a ton of pitfalls.<p>There are some benefits to the University model but I really hope COVID disrupts the monopoly Universities have over this domain for good! Ed-tech really should be much bigger source of funding and development, but FAANG just keeps suckering in people that could otherwise do something actually useful for Society.<p>&gt; What do you think he did? Nothing, of course. He kept on the talks circuit, still talking about how exceptional his discovery was, and to date there have been no retractions. He even won the NIH grad student of the year award.<p>&gt; Oh. What happened to the grad student? He&#x27;s a professor in the genomics department at UW.<p>He is literately the academic &#x27;Big Head&#x27; character from Silicon Valley that every lab&#x2F;department has. I&#x27;d speak of my own experiences further, nothing as bad as yours, but I really don&#x27;t feel like ruining my evening any further.<p>&gt;  I am also from a molecular biology background and saw this often. We call these guys the &quot;Golden Boys&quot;. They are super successful, but completely useless. If you still believe live is fair, wake up sunshine.<p>Same, I should have made the leap to Microbiology in JR year, but I just wanted to GTFO and even abandoned by double major (Biochemistry) work just to speed up the process.')
