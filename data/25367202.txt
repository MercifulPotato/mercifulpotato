A bunch of &lt; $20 drones from Ali express with an explosive tied on would do it. You would not even need elaborate radio-jamming defeating control systems, they just need to fly straight until they hit something then a tilt sensor or timer detonates them. If it’s one thing we learned from myth busters, it’s how much damage the concussion wave from a surprisingly small blast can do to anyone nearby.')
