Even 1000 after, it was still called a kingdom. And then the heir of the line of the Stewards supported Aragorn, perhaps in part because he was the legitimate heir to the kingdom<p>&gt; elites fighting to reclaim more power over the common folk.<p>considering the previous regime had all the trapping of a monarchy, I don&#x27;t think the situation of the common folk would change in the regions directly ruled by Aragorn (and it would change nothing in the regions which are ruled by vassals of Aragorn, which make up most of Gondor, where Aragorn wouldn&#x27;t have much say')
