Item(by='boredumb', descendants=None, kids=[25747546], score=None, time=1610459097, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25745990, text='The double standard being set in the reaction to rioting and the death of people, police officers and federal agents in this country is going to tear a rift in the USA for decades.\nAs federal buildings were under a siege for months, David Dorn was shot, in Oakland a federal agent was shot, with the &quot;ACAB&quot; rhetoric emboldening people there were 7 police officers ambushed and killed across the country, etc.<p>These are all terrible things and should be punished as equally as storming a DC federal building or killing a DC police officer. The issue is going to be the fall out of how last weeks incident was compared to the months of rioting preceding it that just happened to be for a different cause and encouraged by different politically motivated people and parties.<p>There will be no unity when for months major media outlits and influential politicians are helping gaslight half the country that the riots and deaths were totally uncorrelated at best and quoting MLKs &quot;A riot is the language of the unheard&quot; when evidence became too much to simply ignore.<p>People who are cheering on the politicization of deeming half your own countrymen terrorists because disagreements on social or fiscal policies from the actions of a few of them who feel disenfranchised whether it&#x27;s taking a few hours of BLM&#x2F;antifa riots and labeling all left leaning citizens terrorists or taking a stormed capital and applying it to 74.8 million other people who lean right are going destroying this country more than any riot participant could dream of.<p>2020 (if i&#x27;m honest it extends back a lot further than last year) should be taken as a lesson that people can feel completely disenfranchised regardless of if you believe them or if they really are at all, and that disenfranchised people can lash out in terrible ways they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t find themselves capable.<p>If payment processors, twitter, AWS, salesforce, facebook all decided that actions of the 10% of BLM protestors that turned into violent, destructive and deadly riots represented 100% and applied these same actions we would be seeing even more violence, destruction and death but with the weight of a newly renewed sense of victimization and purpose. We are all going to deeply regret the response of all of these actions throughout the next few years without being able to give them the credit they deserve. \n(I&#x27;d wager the aggressive banning of far left and right wing views from twitter, youtube, facebook is responsible for creating places like parler in the first place for instance, when we censor and disenfranchise people we are only going to distill those feelings and they tend to get uglier)')
