There are face masks lying all over the place at bus stops and in supermarket carparks, round my  neighbourhood.<p>I can&#x27;t quite grasp the logic of this. On the one hand; <i>&quot;This virus is so contagious I&#x27;m going to wear a mask when out in public&quot;</i>, on the other; <i>&quot;Now I&#x27;ve finished using this mask [which is potentially now covered in this virus I&#x27;m so frightened of], I&#x27;m just going to throw it on the ground or leave it on the seat on the bus&quot;</i><p>If these people really believe this virus is so deadly and so contagious and believe by wearing masks they are helping to end the pandemic, why are they not disposing of their used masks with more care and consideration, rather than leaving them lying around to [theoretically] infect other people and keep the virus spreading?')
