Pick a platform and come up with some simple game mechanic and backstory that seems like it would be fun. Just don&#x27;t expect to make a lot of money or get only positive support, doing it for fun&#x2F;learning and anything else is bonus is a good mindset.<p>I think the good thing about a mobile game is you can tell your friends (or anyone you meet) to find the game in the store and try it, right then and there.
