I found this able to put words on something I&#x27;ve struggled with. I found it pretty profound in its observation<p>In my reading: This author is acknowledging that they&#x27;re &quot;not nice&quot; in small personal interactions, but is feeling others are &quot;not nice&quot; in large structural interactions with groups and systems. And they&#x27;re lamenting that others commonly praise a &quot;water under the bridge&quot; thinking about small person-to-person things that this author struggles with, whereas the author&#x27;s choice to view <i>larger</i> forces that way is scolded as deserving more anger.<p>Does that interpretation ring with you? (I&#x27;m not saying I agree with that interpretation btw, but it&#x27;s a new thought for me.)')
