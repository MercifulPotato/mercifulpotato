The internet allowed vendors to lock users in to renal agreements as they&#x27;re a much more profitable business models.  Never mind the fact that the rental model doesn&#x27;t guarantee you better software - in value for money terms, you&#x27;d be better off having stuck with traditional upgrades.<p>Remember, this model has been around for yonks.  Go away on holidays and you&#x27;ve turned the power and gas off beforehand and you still have to pay a connection fee even though you&#x27;ve used nothing - and despite the fact that the wires and pipes to you house were fully amortized many decades ago.  Same goes for phone and internet services.<p>Right, it&#x27;s a ripoff, that&#x27;s why I use open software whenever and wherever possible.')
