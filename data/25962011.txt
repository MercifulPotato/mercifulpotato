These may average out over a lifetime, but if we look at restricted intervals, it may seem like newer generations have less wealth even if they end up having similar overall wealth over their lifetime.<p>Leaving out boomer data from ~18-35 makes me a little more suspicious of cherry picking because that data could be similar. It may also show boomers gaining even more wealth, but if it&#x27;s not available we can&#x27;t know.')
