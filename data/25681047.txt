When I have the time, I think solutions up (mostly in my head or on &#x27;paper&#x27;(scratch buffer)) in lisp&#x2F;scheme, haskell&#x2F;idris or apl&#x2F;k. The result, when I consider it elegant, is usually very nice after translating to another language.<p>For Scheme I think my thinking came from working through SICP many years ago while the other languages in the list force you basically to first think about a solution before you start typing.<p>I am not saying, obviously, people cannot think up these things straight in rust, python, c# etc, however, for me personally, it works much better if I first work it out in one of the others; it is way too tempting to grab for my plumbing wrench otherwise.')
