He also tried to create a perpetual motion machine.<p>Bernie Madoff doesn&#x27;t get to print his own currency, you see why that&#x27;s different right? You know who does though? Tether.<p>&gt; Canada has been lending everyone $2000&#x2F;month this whole time.<p>Paying. Lending implies that it has to be returned, it does not.<p>&gt; Again, you don&#x27;t understand what bitcoin is, nor money apparently.<p>Incorrect, I know what money is for and how it works. I don&#x27;t disagree with anything you said about money. What I disagree with is that inflation matters in that context. It does not. I also see Bitcoin as having been spoken for already, and it has. with a worse wealth distribution than a banana republic, which it has.<p>&gt; Yes, the &quot;experts&quot; managing the &quot;economy&quot; right now are doing such a great job.<p>Inflation has been in a tightly controlled 1-2% range in the US since the 1970s. They are. So forgive me for not giving a bunch of un-elected, un-accountable randos with commit privileges and a narcotics trafficker the steering wheel lol.<p>&gt; At some point, sooner rather than later by the looks of it, it will be the only solution.<p>Agree to disagree.<p>&gt; Weird advice from someone convinced we&#x27;ll never have to pay back our debts.<p>Who is &quot;our&quot; and why does one have anything to do with the other?')
