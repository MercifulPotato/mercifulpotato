I don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s the problem T2 is trying to solve by its existence. Being able to use something else to read the data from a drive you pulled out of your computer, after decrypting it with your password, is a feature, not a bug. T2 is a regression, not an improvement in security. You can&#x27;t call it a security product if you keep the master key, which Apple does.')
