Item(by='kodah', descendants=None, kids=[25746026], score=None, time=1610412392, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25737980, text='&gt; There have been a million reasons for years to support decentralized communication platforms, but it only gets a burst of attention when a fascist &#x2F; race-nationalist movement gets de-platformed? I find that more than a little depressing. It says not so flattering things about this community if this is what you folks care about enough to notice what&#x27;s been obvious for so long.<p>This is a pretty reductionist way of looking at a post like this. These events have opened up a lot of interesting points:<p>- The practice of websites &quot;soft deleting&quot; content<p>- Reckless data collection<p>- The ease at which managed infrastructure can be revoked by vendors, without warning<p>- The potential for harm that bad actors can have on a centralized network<p>- The limits of curation &#x2F; moderation<p>- The degrees of separation between companies that manage infrastructure, manage application code, and the people that manage communities and the power dynamics in between<p>- The roles of narratives, misinformation, and how it can be both monopolized, weaponized, and used to radicalize<p>Thinking about these things critically and iteratively does not make anyone a far-right apologist. Decentralization has been discussed on this website off and on for as long as I&#x27;ve been here. It&#x27;s not always relevant, it&#x27;s a problem with lots of caveats, and it will take rediscussion over time to find a solution that works well for everyone.')
