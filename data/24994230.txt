Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=[24994946], score=None, time=1604533290, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24993694, text='I view it as an attempt to explore the question &quot;can a competitive GPU architecture be built as an extension of a mainstream CPU architecture?&quot;. And they tried it and it didn&#x27;t work out, which suggests the answer is &quot;No&quot;. But I don&#x27;t fault them for trying â€“ a willingness to try out different areas of the design space, even test them in the market, is a positive thing. Of course, you can see why a vendor whose major product is a mainstream CPU architecture might have a special interest in exploring that particular design question, but it still was a valid question to explore, even if they didn&#x27;t get the result they were hoping for. We can learn as much from failures as from successes.')
