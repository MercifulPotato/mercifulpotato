But I did end up incorporating some of it into what I do.<p>One big thing I took away was a different way of looking at &quot;someday&quot; tasks - it is OK to record them even if they never happen - it doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re useless.<p>The second one was review, and is probably a bigger deal for me. I never really went over my lists previously, which in retrospect was really stupid. Now I do, keeping things not done pruned and relevant.<p>But more importantly, I review things I did, including saving lists of tasks for things that might happen again. That has made a huge difference, especially as I manage more people. When someone asks &quot;how do I do that?&quot; and I can reply with a checklist, it makes me feel like maybe I&#x27;m not so bad at this gig after all. But really, the lists are for me - it is amazing how much I half-forget of things that don&#x27;t come up much, and having last time&#x27;s list saves me so much time.')
