I really want to retain the sense of human contact of voice &amp; often video, but in a way that we can thread, reply to async, &amp; come back to latter, none of which would be easy &amp; convenient with our current predominantly synchronous systems.<p>signal has a decent voice-message feature. weirdly from what I can tell there&#x27;s no way to preview your message before sending it? blah. also, weird, but I don&#x27;t want to be using signal &amp; other what feel like &quot;personal&quot; communication tech with my coworkers.')
