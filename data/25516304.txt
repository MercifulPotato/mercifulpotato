Improbable events happen a lot more often due to that. The interstellar medium has roughly 1 hydrogen atom per cm^3. You&#x27;re saying maybe 10x as many neutrons. Multiply that by kiloparsecs and millions of years and those neutrons would most definitely interact.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not a physicist, but this seems a way simpler explanation of dark matter than &quot;axion fields&quot; or whatever is currently trending.<p>The reason &quot;axion fields&quot; or whatever is currently trending, is because simpler explanations have been ruled out.<p>You not only have to explain the rotation curves, but also the properties your dark matter candidate need need.<p>How did these neutrons get made? How do you explain your over-abundance of neutrons given that the neutron-proton ratio[1] after the freeze-out[2] is roughly 6 protons for every neutron?<p>Why are the neutrons so cold? Did they start that way, then that&#x27;s odd since everything else was very hot back in the days. If they&#x27;re cooling down, where is that radiation and why haven&#x27;t we observed it?<p>Why aren&#x27;t the neutrons decaying? They can&#x27;t be free, since the free-neutron lifetime is something we&#x27;ve measured[3].<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;217357" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;217357</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.astro.caltech.edu&#x2F;~george&#x2F;ay127&#x2F;kamionkowski-earlyuniverse-notes.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.astro.caltech.edu&#x2F;~george&#x2F;ay127&#x2F;kamionkowski-e...</a> (page 5)<p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-09-mystery-neutron-lifetime.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-09-mystery-neutron-lifetime.html</a>')
