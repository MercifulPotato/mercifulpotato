I still have a facebook account but its not something I use very often except the past week given the situation in the USA.<p>My facebook account is very old, when i was more of an active user I did all the usual posts&#x2F;photos that a lot of liberal urban types contribute.<p>Anyway, after posting some anti-insurrection posts I start noticing all sort of &quot;tacti-cool&quot; gear ads or targeted T-shirt s with some very macho-man hyper masculinity phrases on them.<p>This is very much _not_ me. Now I keep facebook on a tight leash (FB container, privacy settings turned to max) so my guess is that someone out there is spending a lot of money on a huge ad target or somehow facebook thinks anyone who is posting about a US insurrection would like to participate with some neat military cosplay kit.')
