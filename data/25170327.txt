The 1 million times faster mutation rate only occurs for B-cells dividing in these structures and it&#x27;s caused by some kind of chemical signaling (the name has slipped my mind). Importantly, it only effects the mutation rate of the thing that codes for the antibody the B-cell expresses, but it has been observed that in this part the mutation is pretty much random.<p>On average, by the way, there is about 1 point mutation in the part coding for antibodies for every single division in the germinal center. But since the particular mutation is random, I&#x27;m not sure I like describing this as the B-cell editing its own genome. It makes it more mysterious than necessary.<p>I should probably turn this part of my PhD thesis into a set of blog posts once I&#x27;ve defended...&quot;affinity maturation&quot; is a weird and wonderful process.')
