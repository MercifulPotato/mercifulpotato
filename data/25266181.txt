The station code is AOPR [0].<p>After retrieving the mseed data from the web API using curl, and installing obspy from pip, I could plot the events. This is the result: [1]. You can see two &quot;events&quot;. One at Nov 30, 23:12 UTC, and a second, larger one at Dec 1st, 11:52 UTC. Upon closer inspection, the first event is actually multiple smaller ones, not sure if they are related to the collapse at all. The second event is clearly one discrete thing though. The image was uploaded to twitter at 11:56 UTC, so minutes within the collapse being recorded on the seismograph. You can still see the dust in the air.<p>Pretty cool that all this data is out there, in the open, just a curl request away.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fdsn.org&#x2F;networks&#x2F;detail&#x2F;PR&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fdsn.org&#x2F;networks&#x2F;detail&#x2F;PR&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: Note on some of the screenshots I&#x27;ve preprocessed the data with a lowpass filter <i>st.filter(&quot;lowpass&quot;, freq=0.1, corners=2)</i> to make it look nicer, while in others I haven&#x27;t.
