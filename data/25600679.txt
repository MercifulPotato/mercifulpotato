Typically when we&#x27;re talking about creating sounds, we mainly had additive and subtractive synthesis where stacking oscillators were used to shape sounds. FM uses oscillators to manipulate other oscillator&#x27;s waveforms, which opened up a whole lot of new possibilities.<p>The DX7 mainly was an affordable all-rounder that got loaded with a ton of already-good presets and a way of managing presets. Yamaha had already released the GS-1 three years prior, but obviously it didn&#x27;t remain in the books of history quite the same.<p>The Sega Genesis soundchip, YM2612 is also a great showcase on how different FM synthesis can sound compared to comparable competing consoles.<p>If anyone is interested, there&#x27;s a great open source soft synth called Dexed, which is compatible with DX7 soundbanks (and comes bundled with a lot of em). A free, fun way of getting a glimpse into FM synthesis and music production techniques of yore.')
