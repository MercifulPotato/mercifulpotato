I&#x27;ve waited over an hour for delivery food before. Actually, 45 mins to over an hour is typical no matter the service I use, so I&#x27;ve stopped using it. The model is that the food sits out and gets cold because the delivery driver doesn&#x27;t get there in time.<p>Instead, I order takeout. I call the restaurant directly, with their actual number and not some phishing line from a delivery service, and place an order. I immediately leave, and travel the 5-15 mins to the restaurant. By the time I arrive, the food had been finished just moments before, and I travel back home and enjoy my piping hot food. All told the process takes me half the time or less and the food is in perfect condition.')
