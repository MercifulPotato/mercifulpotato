Boundary-setting feels much easier when people are physically switching contexts between home and work.<p>Obviously, people with physical offices still put in work from home, but it feels much easier to time-box activities when there is a clear distinction between hours spent at work and hours spent at home.<p>With full remote, the physical boundaries between work and home disappear. It no longer feels safe to tell someone you&#x27;ll follow up on something when you&#x27;re back in the office tomorrow morning, because now technically you&#x27;re always in your office.<p>I dealt with this problem a lot with high achievers on remote teams (pre-COVID). Certain personality types will always aim to please, never pass up an opportunity to shine, and have trouble saying no to requests. Combine those personality traits with a high-achiever mentality and you have a recipe for disaster.<p>This was especially problematic in new university graduates who had spent the first two decades of their lives getting straight As on arbitrary, time-limited school work.  Drop them into open-ended work environments where the project scope and duration is a moving target and they struggle to pace themselves. Their old techniques of powering through work at 100% effort until it&#x27;s done are no longer sustainable in the face of a never-ending supply of additional work.<p>Managers should, of course, be aware of these situations and work to intervene. However, employees also need to take some share of the responsibility for closing feedback loops with their managers. Some people are so afraid of disappointing anyone or appearing weak that they&#x27;ll deliberately hide any signs that they&#x27;re struggling or overworked. It&#x27;s critically important that both managers and employees work together to keep feedback loops open and honest. As a manager I wish I could read everyone&#x27;s minds and adjust accordingly, but it&#x27;s extremely difficult when employees are actively working to hide these things from their employers. Side note: It&#x27;s so much easier to manager people who were formerly managers themselves because they&#x27;re so much better at communicating these things, having seen both sides of the table.')
