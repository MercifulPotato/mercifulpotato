No need to pair them with bluetooth, no nothing.<p>Since they are modular, they also have been a breeze to upgrade and repair. Need different cables? Better microphone?  Its 20$ to upgrade that part of the headphone. Want to add bluetooth support? Can do that as well.<p>People buying and gifting pair of &gt; 200$ headphones every year as if speakers are some kind of tech that gets outdated.<p>If you really care about audio quality and the environment, just buy a good pair of upgradeable headphones. They&#x27;ll last you your whole life.')
