Perhaps Twitter&#x27;s Bluesky will help develop or fund one or more of these solutions.<p>Curious if anyone has experience with Iris or IPFS-based stuff like Peergos, Anytype, and Peepeth. The only ones on this list that I know you can just &quot;get on&quot; and starting doing stuff are SSB, Aether, Fediverse, and of course XMPP and Matrix. I&#x27;m surprised that Urbit isn&#x27;t covered in here because it definitely has more users than Aether and Solid (which has 0 currently).')
