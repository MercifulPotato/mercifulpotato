I suspect RocketLab will recover and reuse Electron before Blue Origin recovers and reuses New Glenn. RocketLab plans to test recovery (Ballute and then guided parachute until splashdown, not yet helicopter although they have had successful helicopter recovery tests of mockups) on the 17th Electron launch (3 launches from now), which is planned for this year.')
