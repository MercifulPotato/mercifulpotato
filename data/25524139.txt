It saved me last week when business folks sent me four huge excel sheets of data that I&#x27;d need to answer questions about during a meeting.  I exported to CSV, then into SQLite, and immediately had a shareable web page I could query and filter in realtime.  Vastly more useful to me (as an engineer) than Excel, and having the full power of SQL is a delight.<p>Wish list: I wish it were a single executable I could carry around, like fossil, jq, rclone, rg&#x2F;ag, sqlite3, gitea, micro, etc.')
