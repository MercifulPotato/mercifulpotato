Mostly because it&#x27;s a closeby giant and those are interesting.<p>I think most estimates range between 40&#x27;000 and 140&#x27;000 years until core hydrogen is exhausted. It&#x27;s ejecta are unlikely to reach earth or cause harm (either radiation or otherwise). So while it lasts, you can enjoy reading a book under the light of a dying star at night for a few days.<p>Eta Carinae is another candidate but it&#x27;s too far away and unlikely to outshine Venus significantly. It&#x27;s also not due for some due. There is also the possibility it&#x27;ll just collapse into a black hole with no fanfare or extra light emission, it&#x27;ll just be gone one day.<p>Supernovae usually come from very bright stars, those are easily detectable and visible. From what I remember, there aren&#x27;t any candidates even close to us that are about to expire minus Betelgeuse, which isn&#x27;t aiming it&#x27;s poles at us and won&#x27;t do much harm.<p>I would like to add that in the even we could predict that a supernova is about to wipe us out, there isn&#x27;t anything we could do. Any nearby object we could use as shelter, such as Venus, Mars, the Jupiter Moons etc would likely be just as affected if not more (Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic field will likely make a Supernova hit more deadly IMO). It would be over within the span of a few days and nobody will survive. Just lean back and enjoy the show, tbh.')
