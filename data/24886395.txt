That is, rather than having fixed-size pages, with a leaf page table entry for each one, have variable-sized extents that span many pages, with a single entry for the extent.<p>This would reduce the amount of bookkeeping if the OS hands out physical memory in large contiguous tracts, but increase it if it is shuffling around individual pages. I have no idea what OS behaviour here actually is.')
