Anger memes spread the best. It&#x27;s a mixture of a profit-driven business and the competition with other profit-driven businesses which leads them to act this way. The game needs to be redesigned if you want them to play differently.<p>In either case, it&#x27;s more important to be educated to know that the media is divisive, and that the only way to overcome media bias is to increase one&#x27;s bandwidth of information: read all the major news outlets. Don&#x27;t just rely on one news source. Get to know who owns which papers and always keep an eye out for conflicts of interest when reading about certain subjects.')
