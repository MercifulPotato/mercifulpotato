Controversial opinion to consider, if you have the attitude that traffic laws are  only for cars and serve only to inform bicyclists of the expected behavior of cars, riding in the Bay Area becomes much safer and faster. Habitually running red lights is important as it gives you an open road and a red light behind you. Also I always filter to the front(which I think is legal), abuse cross walks(I.e. get off my bike to stop traffic and walk it across a pedestrian crosswalk, also legal I believe). I biked in the Bay Area for years with that strategy and never had a problem, during work hours on week days I could beat cars handily on short trips. Some people will say this gives biking a bad name, but I think bicyclists getting hit by cars is a far bigger problem for the PR of cycling.')
