It&#x27;s so annoying that I&#x27;ve essentially given up Youtube. I don&#x27;t care enough about the videos that I want to Login and whitelist (and have a profile recorded) the site, and this makes the experience bad. Ergo YT is fading from my life. Can&#x27;t say that I miss it all that much after a few days, it has been a habit more so than something I actively enjoy.')
