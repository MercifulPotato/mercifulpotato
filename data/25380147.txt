Another resource, one that Mr. Musk cares more about, is time. He both affords to and is willing to throw material resources at the technology development problem, even at a loss (i.e. the stated &quot;1&#x2F;3 chance of success&quot;), just so he could &quot;move fast and break things&quot; (from time to time, if it comes to that). In this context, even with that prodigious blow at the end, having at least some of the testing goals met can be a genuine success in Musk&#x27;s own eyes, not just a sell for the rest of us. The political actors, on the other hand, had to play the perception image game because that&#x27;s the world they reside in. The politicians&#x27; primary objective in that space program has always been the prestige that comes attached from bearing it to fruits. Sure, in a race they went on in a similar fashion and threw copious amounts of material resources, but for them the cost of technical failures were not so much about loosing material as were about loosing face, hence the propaganda that had to handle&#x2F;mitigate that. Same rocket science development game, different rules for the actors involved.')
