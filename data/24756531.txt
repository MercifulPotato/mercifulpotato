Horses are a hobby for rich people. My comment was kind of a throwaway but I have seen articles that of course there will still be gasoline cars once EVs (and possible AVs) have taken over. But you won&#x27;t commute in one, the same way you don&#x27;t commute by horse anymore. They&#x27;ll be expensive toys that you take out on weekends to enjoy.
