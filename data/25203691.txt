But I think its worth thinking about the likelihood that a &quot;slower&quot; computer running Linux could probably serve the actual user better in terms of &quot;getting stuff done.&quot;  Moreover, I think we&#x27;re pretty close to &quot;beauty&quot; parity here as well.  Apple&#x27;s advantage now is probably <i>mostly</i> the networked devices, i.e. unity between phone and pc messages, etc.')
