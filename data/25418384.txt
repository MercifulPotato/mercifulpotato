Apple requires Sign In with Apple for all applications that have another social sign-in provider, but if you don&#x27;t use Facebook or Google sign-in, you don&#x27;t have to use Apple either (and many companies chose to remove their other SSO options rather than implement Apple&#x27;s since they couldn&#x27;t get user&#x27;s real email addresses). Furthermore, Apple hasn&#x27;t changed the Apple ID sign-in requirements since the launch of the iPhone (you have to sign in to access Apple services, but if you don&#x27;t want to and just use your phone for calling and web browsing, you don&#x27;t have to), whereas Facebook has said you will lose functionality in your original Quest in two years if you do not sign up for Facebook.<p>There is an argument to be made that I should be able to run native apps on my iPad without having to sign up for an Apple ID, but that&#x27;s always been the deal since the device existed, and I knew that when buying it.')
