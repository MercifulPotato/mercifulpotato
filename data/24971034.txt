Generally, most journalists at a <i>real</i> newspaper or media organization would ask for the <i>original</i> video, not a copy from youtube.<p>Even your local evening news will use the <i>original</i> video unless they are specifically discussing the <i>online</i> version of the video, in which case they will either record footage of the screen using one of the hundreds of cameras they have lying around or just share their screen view directly.<p>The only time journalists use youtube-dl for reporting is when it is not possible to get a copy of the original.')
