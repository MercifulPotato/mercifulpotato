I guess it is doable and a necessary transmission, but I am a bit afraid it may be the next thing some countries are sleeping on.<p>As a German, there are serious subsidies for home owners to install one right now. However, I just moved into a new rental apparment and visiteted quite a few places that were all built in 2020. All of them had very nice parking spaces allocaed to the flat, but zero wallboxes for the entire appartment. I also looked into buying a flat and often it would have been difficult, sometimes even impossible to install one on my own behalf wihtout checking with all other buyers (and these kinds of changes often lead to tedious legal fights, afaik). The place I&#x27;m moving to doesn&#x27;t have one either, but the ladlord will install one, once needed. At the moment I still have a car with a diesel engine and no plans to change soon(I go almost everywhere by bike, even have a different one for rainly days and to carry groceries, and do 0-2 longer trips per month and ~1 very long trip for vacation per year, bike + diesel seems to fit that quite well) soon, but the next car will be electric i guess<p>To make things worse: The overall power comsumption should not be too much of a problem, but if almost vehicle was electric and charged where people live, the power infrastructure could be in serious trouble. If improving it in remote areas goes anywhere as well as FTTC&#x2F;FTTH internet, we&#x27;re headed for disaster. There are a lot of interesting ideas, e.g. decentralized batteries within people&#x27;s homes and renewables. But if all the focus is on changing the cars on the road, I have little hope that other transitions will be quick enough')
