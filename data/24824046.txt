They wouldn’t stock both Brain Flakes and Picasso Tiles. Since Brain Flakes would have come to them first and with the right IP, they’d put them on the shelf. There’s some sort of in built filter with physical stores because it’d be awkward to show the exact same product under different brands, it may even reflect poorly on the retailer or store. Whereas on Amazon, brand value completely subsides and I’d assume the main competing factors are price and search rank.')
