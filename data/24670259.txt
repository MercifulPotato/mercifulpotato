Before making the PR, try to find the relevant issue (or create one if it doesn&#x27;t already exist), and get the maintainer to indicate that they want the feature. Once they&#x27;ve written that down, they&#x27;re primed to accept it because they&#x27;d feel worse about not processing the thing they already committed to.')
