Item(by='TheDong', descendants=None, kids=[25785276], score=None, time=1610661145, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783112, text='Right now contracts are enforced by lawyers who can interpret code that is not fully specified.<p>I would guess that hiring a contract developer to create a water-tight contract the computer is capable of understanding would be much more expensive than a lawyer.<p>This is in a similar vein to the fact that it&#x27;s more expensive to have programmers create a perfect NLP app to translate something than it is to just hire a translator. Translating english into other languages is not a solved problem. Whether that other language is french or a smart contract does&#x27;nt seem that material.<p>It does seem like it will be much cheaper to make contracts in bitcoin that don&#x27;t require translating thousand-line-english-documents into a smart contract.<p>However, you can already do that without a lawyer. If me and you sign a paper saying it&#x27;s a contract that &quot;I will pay you $200 for an item delivered on date X&#x2F;Y, and if you&#x27;re late I pay $20 less per day it&#x27;s late&quot;, that&#x27;s already legal and enforceable without a lawyer.<p>Coding that same thing in bitcoin would be harder than writing it on a paper still I think.')
