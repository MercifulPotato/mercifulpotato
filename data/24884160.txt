There are other languages that have this property, notably Fortran. It does allow many speed optimizations, in both parallel and single-thread cases. Yes, this is one of the reasons why Fortran is routinely faster than C on numeric code, and even Haskell sometimes is, too.<p>It is theoretically proven that any algorithm which uses mutable data can be converted to use immutable data with a penalty on memory and time not exceeding <i>O(log n)</i>. In absolute terms, such a penalty can be low, or pretty high (consider working with large bitmaps). There&#x27;s no silver bullet.<p>Functional code is often preferred due to its <i>clarity</i>, both humans and machines have easier time reasoning about it, and even formally proving its properties. Sometimes it is just more important than raw speed, but sometimes allows for more aggressive optimizations (rewriting by the compiler) and higher speed.')
