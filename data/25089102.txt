We still have people praying loudly on the corners for all to see (Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.) We still have people persecuting others for their beliefs, we still have people ready to fight holy wars.<p>It is a very human behavior, and it is easily exploited and in an emergent way exploits itself in whatever way is convenient in any age.<p>It is clear to me that there are very smart people and very stupid people stoking the flames on this human vulnerability that so few people care to notice.')
