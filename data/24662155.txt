You&#x27;re separating intent from effect when that is the exact problem. DO created a program which incentivized spam that puts long-term strain on a community which it derives revenue from long-term, just for short term benefit.<p>If you or anyone else who designed that program doesn&#x27;t understand that and take action until a &#x2F;satirical twitter account&#x2F; has to pop up, that&#x27;s really bad. I don&#x27;t think you should try and make excuses for it. You should try to understand why the incentive broke and caused unintended side effects first before you go criticizing others.')
