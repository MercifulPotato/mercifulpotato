I have personally come across many companies using them for surveys and applications. What is your opinion of forms built using the service? I only ask because I find them unnecessarily long and drawn out, and a chore to fill out compared to just simple web forms.<p>However, the popularity makes me think that I am in the minority, so I would like to hear your thoughts. If you really like Typeform, I would love to hear exactly why because I just don&#x27;t get it myself.')
