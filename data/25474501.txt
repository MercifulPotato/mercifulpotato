Generally, I think k will always beat C, and probably any scripting language you can think of, in that department.<p>The issue of verbosity is so polarising amongst the vocal programmers who comment online that even if k were faster than whatever language (and free, open source, etc.), I would bet many of them still would reject the idea of using it.')
