You can&#x27;t control that fact, not even by blowing up the economy. The best thing you can do if you&#x27;re afraid is to wear a mask and take vitamin-D (or go outside to get some).<p>Unless there is a miraculous breakthrough in vaccines, which seems unlikely in current year, this disease will be with us for the rest of your life. Just like the flu. If it works like other corona viruses, it will burn through the population kill off the people who are susceptible to it, and remain with us forever, just like HCoV-OC43 probably did in 1889 with the &quot;Russian flu&quot; of that day[0]. Nobody worries about that now.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7252012&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7252012&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-05-15&#x2F;coronavirus-of-today-eerily-similar-to-1889-russian-flu-pandemic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-05-15&#x2F;corona...</a>')
