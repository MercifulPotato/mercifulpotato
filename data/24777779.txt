Given that the working class, naturalized immigrants, and people of color traditionally vote liberal, the best way to secure a win is simply make it as hard as possible for them to vote. So they&#x27;ve opposed legislation guaranteeing a day off to vote [1], making it fairly impossible for people living paycheck to paycheck. They&#x27;ve opposed legislation to make it easier to vote by mail in ballot [2] which would make it easier for working class people to vote. They&#x27;ve purged voting rolls so that people with less understanding of the registration process find themselves unable to vote on election day [3], and of course the incessant cries that somehow voter fraud is a big enough issue that it&#x27;s worth disenfranchising thousands with strict voter ID laws. In my home state of texas we had once instance voter fraud in the last 4 years, and it was a woman on parole being lied to by her parole officer about her right to vote.<p>Typical bad faith conservative arguments include that mail in voting leads to voter fraud (it doesn&#x27;t), voting holidays are a power grab by democrats (Mitch mcconnell&#x27;s verbatim words), and that millions of Mexicans citizens &#x2F; non americans are voting in american elections (also no). In texas the republicam governor said vague things about covid and then banned counties from having more than one ballot drop off location. For reference, my county (harris) has one of the largest cities in america (houston) in it, a population of 30 million people, and can take up to an hour and a half to drive from an edge to the center.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;31&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;election-day-holiday-mcconnell.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;31&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;election-day-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;30&#x2F;trump-voting-republicans&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;30&#x2F;trump-vot...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;dec&#x2F;31&#x2F;voter-purges-republicans-2020-elections-trump" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;dec&#x2F;31&#x2F;voter-purges...</a>')
