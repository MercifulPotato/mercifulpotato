This is later merged into the actual release branch where we obviously want to maintain each of the individual commits.<p>Reason for the feature squash: most of the context of the original commit(s) are meaningful only to the original dev who is free to keep that history locally (or share with others). There are time&#x27;s it&#x27;s convenient to structure the commits in a certain way, but this is often most useful at PR review time, and less so after merge.<p>Granted, you may want to be able to re0review code at a later date, and hence keep that structure, but hopefully this is a rare case, and PRs and not often so huge.')
