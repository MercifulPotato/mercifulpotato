Rust probably will not be viable for coding games in production without a new compiler that is at least two orders of magnitude faster.<p>The good news is that it seems eminently doable. The bad news is that there is no apparent effort going into writing one. Undergraduate classes implement a complete standard-conforming Java compiler in a semester. Surely a compiler for a language less than, what, 3x as complicated as Java can be coded by an experienced professional using modern tools in little more time?<p>I don&#x27;t know of anything in the language to make it inherently slow to compile. The macro system complicates the parser, but parsing is very mature technology. Even compiling a new parser to machine code and dynamic-linking it when new macros are encountered would be faster than what is done now.')
