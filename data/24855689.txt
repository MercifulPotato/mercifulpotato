When you&#x27;ve heard &quot;the Linux Kernel is 15M LOC&quot; you might conclude &quot;reading other code is unnatainable&quot;, as quite some commenters do in this thread. It is not: there&#x27;s very neat OSS out there that you can pick apart in a spare hour and go &quot;AHA!&quot;.<p>It might even span across to other niches. &quot;Baking your own bread&quot; is not that hard, if you get to it. But, becausethe entire process (fertilising ground, selecting seeds, growing grain, milling it) is too much for one person, lot&#x27;s of people just give up alltogether and conclude that &quot;today it is impossible to make your own food&quot;. Especially once you learn that bread mostly comes from large, complex industrial complexes today. Yet &quot;just doing it&quot; is very rewarding, as all the home-bakers will tell you.<p>And it spans across time as well: Sure, no-one can make a toaster from 0: mine own ore, distill your own plastics etc (there&#x27;s a brilliant documentary from someone attempting just this, forgot its name). So people conclude that when the toaster stops working, there&#x27;s nothing one can do, and they turn to Ali-express or Amazon and just buy a new one.<p>In short: I think labor alienation is toxic, in that it seeds itself into areas that don&#x27;t need hyper specialisation.')
