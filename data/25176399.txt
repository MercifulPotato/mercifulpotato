Because as we all know, no useful model in physics was ever built up from the ground like that, only introducing complex caveats as required to make sense of empirical data as necessary.<p>[0] the simplest way that one can cut a shape is with a straight line (2D) or flat plane (3D). In this case no new concave shapes can be created unless a concave angle was a part of the initial shape. Ergo, if the starting shape is convex and we cut away parts randomly, then all shapes produced this way will be convex. If the initial shape has concave parts, then <i>on average</i> most shapes derived from it will be convex. This is even more true if we apply this &quot;cutting away&quot; recursively to the shapes that were cut away. This makes the assumption of shapes being (mostly) convex quite reasonable, unless there is a <i>specific reason to expect concavity</i>, like specific crystalline structures perhaps. Also, for the record, I just reasoned this out on the spot, it&#x27;s not exactly difficult.')
