Item(by='crtasm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609075914, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25550881, text='&gt; (OSP) is an open-source, RTMP streamer software front-end for Arut&#x27;s Nginx-RTMP Module. OSP was designed as a self-hosted alternative to services such as Twitch.tv, Ustream.tv, Mixer, and Youtube Live.<p>Is anyone here running this? I was searching for a self hosted streaming+chat to use with friends and it sounds perfect.<p>Alternatively if anyone has recommendations for a simple selfhosted chatbox I could add to an existing nginx+rtmp setup. I&#x27;d prefer not to have to install nodejs or have a full database backend (the couple I found required both).  User accounts and longterm storage of the chat not really necessary.')
