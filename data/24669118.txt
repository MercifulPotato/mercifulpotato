Those of us actually deep in the homebrew community know that these commercial devices always come with features explicitly and only useful for piracy. E.g. the original PSJailbreak claimed to be for homebrew, but then also &quot;happened to&quot; install a syscall patch that added a feature to redirect disc accesses to the HDD. Piracy tools were then just a UI for that.<p>If you want legitimate console hacking software and tools not aimed at piracy, you&#x27;ll find them in the open source space (part of it, as there is of course a subset of that community also just focused on piracy), not in larger commercial ventures, with extremely few exceptions.<p>(This is one reason why I stopped hacking consoles; most of the userbase ends up being pirates and the most lauded and successful developers are those who cater to them and us who wanted to stay away from that instead got verbal abuse; meanwhile others were making money off the whole thing.)')
