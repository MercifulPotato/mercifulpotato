In which case improving the increment itself seems like it would not be a huge win.<p>As far as perf the general argument is that dropping the need for refcounting saves time, and that removal also helps caching due to reduced per-object size.<p>That said I’m not sure if those comparisons are comparing to generational or moving collectors (which are the low latency collectors) because those start needing write barriers.')
