Yes, Microsoft releases new OS versions. I&#x27;m not sure what you think that has to do with backwards compatibility. Have you not heard any of the stories about all the hacks Microsoft has had to implement over the past decades to ensure that third-party applications function correctly? A program made for Win95 will generally work seamlessly on W10. Worst-case scenario, you&#x27;ll need to change compatibility settings or configure exceptions in things like exploit protection. The same can&#x27;t be said for Linux, where the only thing you can count on is the kernel&#x27;s ABI.')
