I think it binds people up into nice social units for societal control. By societal convention, you <i>have</i> to marry, just not by law (probably because you or your family historically chose a partner, and it would look quite obviously compulsory if the government mandated a date and a partner.) The government only nudges you that way with things like joint tax filing options.<p>The laws have gotten less strict, and the social stigma lessened, but the state tries to keep it together as well. You mentioned that a piece of paper won&#x27;t keep them together, but in most US states, &quot;fault&quot; for a marriage breaking up still comes into play in things like deciding how a court will divide assets, etc., and historically, sometimes you couldn&#x27;t even <i>get</i> a divorce without someone getting assigned fault.')
