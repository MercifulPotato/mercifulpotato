Such as systemd services.<p>You&#x27;re likely right though that compatibility between the two projects will continue diverge. My true dream was that vendors wouldn&#x27;t have to build for Snap, Flatpak, Guix, and Nix. They could just use either Guix or Nix and have something usable by either user base. In the end the outputs are just writing stuff to the store.<p>But the fact that the store paths are already different would make it a huge migration for that path to change in the future, and unlikely to ever happen. Still, I can dream.')
