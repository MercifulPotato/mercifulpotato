I have yet to make a purchase anywhere in the state in my entire life and not been charged the full 8.25%.<p>Texas also exempts grocery store food purchases from sales tax, barring a few specific luxury categories, so that&#x27;s something to keep in mind as well if you have a large family. Saving 8% on food could be a decent chunk of change for a lot of families. Restaurant food is still taxed at the normal rate.')
