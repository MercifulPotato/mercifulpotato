Have your own API documentation with examples. Instead of SRFI-69, have an entry for hash tables. Mention at the bottom that you comply with SRFI-69 with a link to the spec, but have your own docs that show how to use those APIs instead. Also make sure you document all the r7rs-small functions and data types too.')
