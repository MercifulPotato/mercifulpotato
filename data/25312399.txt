Even the letter communicating to her the termination of employment made it fairly explicit that she was being terminated <i>on terms different than what Google interpreted her resignation to be</i>, due to the internal mail.<p>It&#x27;s clear that for external PR purposes Google wants to maintain the story that it was merely accepting her resignation, but while clearly worded with the intent that an incomplete reading would support the narrative, the letter to her fairly directly (and unusually for a case where they viewed themselves as accepting a resignation) mad explicit that employment was being terminated, immediately, based on separate grounds from the supposed resignation.<p>On the other hand, I guess making it explicit that she was being fired for public internal complaints about a culture of discrimination is one way (like, the worst way possible, but one way) of making the case that what happened to Damore wasn&#x27;t discrimination against white men, but just what they do to any internal criticism of Google culture.')
