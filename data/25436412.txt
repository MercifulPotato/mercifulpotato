Item(by='temac', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608072683, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25431002, text='Neither does C++, IIRC the compilers invented the notion because tons of operations are forbidden between pointers to different objects, so by tracking the provenance you can e.g. detect conditions leading to UB and trim them, because as usual why would the programmer ever write a bug (from the point of view of strict conformity to the standard)? So if it is not a bug thanks to our perfect programmer that of course knows the standard by heart even better than compiler authors apparently do, that must be that this condition is always false, code path is dead, etc.<p>Hilarity ensues when compiler authors themselves introduce bugs in compliant programs thanks to this line of thought that they often take way to far.<p>So again: of course this is a compiler bug. But it is caused by an attempt to use provenance analysis for aliasing (that could indirectly be allowed, at least in a non-buggy form, because of some arcane C or C++ rules) that was not implemented correctly. Type based aliasing is more simple because the rules lead to it slightly more directly.')
