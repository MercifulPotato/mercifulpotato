I think the reason I sometimes reach for divs over buttons or other semantic elements is because I&#x27;ve been burned by default browser behavior treating them special when I just want a dumb box with a dumb click handler - no default styling that I need to override, no need to call .preventDefault(), no need to worry about the matrix of OS+browser+device that each treats a button slightly differently, etc etc...<p>Some of this fear may be unfounded or now obsolete but years ago it wasn&#x27;t fun fixing bugs clients ran into due to silly issues caused by these kinds of things.')
