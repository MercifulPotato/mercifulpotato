It might be a limit of the method used to connect the PCIe component to the CPU (the SCB bus on the PI IIRC).<p>The device tree file does contain the range of memory to use for the PCI BAR, could it be as simple as increasing that number (the last value of the &#x27;ranges&#x27; item I think) and rebuilding it? Seems unlikely, but might be worth a go. I&#x27;m uncertain how much the device tree file is describing the actual setup of hardware, and how much is used to actually configure the hardware.<p>The larger issue might be the complete lack of I&#x2F;O space. Again this could be added in the device tree file, but who knows if the underlying device even supports it.')
