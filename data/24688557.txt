That&#x27;s one reason why they keep going back to the same failed firms time and time again.<p>Reasons vary but the ones I&#x27;ve seen are generally:<p>1. Complex procurement regulations that take a lot of effort to comply with by contractors.<p>2. Low willingness to pay (both price-wise and time-wise).<p>3. Civil servants are nightmare customers who don&#x27;t know what they want and are under no pressure to figure it out, so there&#x27;s a lot of timewasting involved.<p>4. PR nightmare if&#x2F;when things go wrong even if it&#x27;s not your fault, as government is relatively open compared to other types of customers so easier to find out about problems, and lots of people automatically blame the private sector in preference to blaming government employees due to (misguided) assumptions of moral superiority of the public sector.')
