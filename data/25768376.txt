It&#x27;s called &quot;Camera Upload&quot; now.<p>&gt; Once people star buying storage from google&#x2F;apple there would be no point to buy any of Dropbox offering.<p>I think secure erase, transfers, file requests, &quot;Apps&quot; and OS independence is worthy of the price they ask for. Also on-demand sync on other OSes and other small features increase their value in my eyes a lot.')
