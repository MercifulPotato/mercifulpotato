Most people use Google as a starting point when searching anything, and the Yelp page that is returned is not very helpful to me. At best, it contains menus, pictures, hours, phone number, and reviews. At worst, it has none of those and is effectively an ad for the Yelp app. Either way, Google shows me all of that before I click anything else.<p>Google absolutely tries to keep me on Google, but at least they have a &quot;Website&quot; button that takes me to a different domain that was set up by the restaurant itself.')
