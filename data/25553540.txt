He&#x27;d been at it for a decade when I met him, and had created at least a dozen fictional artists, detailed biographies, and a complete &quot;retrospective&quot; gallery show for each.  This let him copy the styles of the great masters of different periods, yet make something new, of a sort.  He never edited Wikipedia himself, but instead led gallery tours of these retrospectives and was always overjoyed when people would write about them, propagating the fiction.')
