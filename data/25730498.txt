Perhaps not pedantically and explicitly, but implicitly he did. It&#x27;s no different than a mob boss saying &#x27;wouldn&#x27;t it be a shame if X had an accident&#x27;, and then X dies at the hands of some associated people.<p>Did the mob boss explicitly (and perhaps pedantically) call for the person to be killed? No. Did he call for the person to be killed - yes.<p>I&#x27;d point out that Trump has been doing stochastic terrorism for the past 4 years. That he uses a few simple rhetorical tricks, he appears to be a pretty simple man. One that seems to work amazing well is to take multiple contradictory positions. People then try to interpret this. Some go with the interpretation that suits their view (like - he&#x27;s telling us to storm the capital). Others look at it an try to unify it into some whole - as if Trump is articulating some kind of coherent position that you can divine by looking at the contradictory positions.<p>No, there isn&#x27;t some special sophisticated underlying reasoning - it&#x27;s cover.<p>Such nuance is perhaps hard for Snopes to get into. If they answer the question literally then they have to conclude no - because he didn&#x27;t <i>literally</i> say that. He went right up to the edge of explicitly asking for it, and then mumbled a few &#x27;peaceful&#x27; bits at the end.<p>His supporters knew what he meant. He knew what he meant. This was all for his benefit. He knew his followers were talking about doing this (I mean I did).<p>He could not know for sure it would happen. That doesn&#x27;t mean that wasn&#x27;t his intent, and that was not what his actions encouraged.<p>I would also point out, typically (perhaps always) with previous Trump scandals it&#x27;s worse than what it initially seemed. More information comes out - and it gets worse. With Georgia election call - we find out they had tried to make the call 18 times. That there were two calls to persuade to &#x27;find votes&#x27;.<p>I have little doubt over the next few weeks, and years as more comes out Trump will look significantly worse around this than he does right now.')
