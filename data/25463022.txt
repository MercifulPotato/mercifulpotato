It would have been at least 95% who either caught a bus, rode a bike or walked.<p>I was walking to school with my older sister at age four. At age 6 I was doing a fairly long bus ride with her (and we walked down to the bus stop of course). The rest of my school life was mostly riding and walking to school. And this was completely unremarkable. What was remarkable were the kids who were dropped off at school; I viewed it as a somewhat eccentric practice.')
