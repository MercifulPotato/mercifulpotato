The third season went in to production 25 years after the cliffhanger ending. The show was very much still worth watching even before season 3 became reality. A cliffhanger ending is still a kind of resolution and is not inherently bad.<p>There are 2-season shows with no ending or clearly rushed endings that are still worth watching: check out <i>Party Down</i>.<p>Does <i>any</i> kind of sloppy ending make an entire show worthless or is there some cutoff screen-time that makes it acceptable?\nConsider <i>Game of Thrones</i>. Are seasons 1-3 still worth watching even though 4-6 are mediocre and 7-8 are dumpster fires?')
