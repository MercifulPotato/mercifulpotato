I would sit in meetings and be unengaging, I would be feel unmotivated to complete the work I was doing. New features, bug fixing, planning, cloud migration, interviews you name it and I was just feeling dead inside - and let&#x27;s be clear this work was cutting edge stuff. The &#x27;buzz&#x27; had just packed up it&#x27;s bags gone.<p>So I quit work, out the rip I handed my notice in and left. I didn&#x27;t work for 3 months; I sat and played games, went on walks, looked after peoples dogs, painted the house, read and after about a month I started working on my own projects again.<p>All of a sudden I found that &#x27;spark&#x27; which used to get me up in the morning. Like when I first started programming. So I started working on my projects all day &amp; every day - they&#x27;re now on hold and I found myself a new company to work for and have never felt more engaged, excited and happy than ever before<p>Seriously, you may just need some leave everything behind and take some serious time off - sorted me right out')
