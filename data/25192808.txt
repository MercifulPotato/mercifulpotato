If my arm is over a fire, the pain is for a reason (&quot;hey uhhhh you might want to move your arm&quot;) but migraines are senseless and debilitating pain for no conceivable reason. Even things like &quot;oops, I forgot to drink enough water six hours ago&quot; isn&#x27;t particularly useful to me: I&#x27;m well-hydrated <i>now</i> but hve a migraine anyway. Thanks, body.<p>Lukcily for me, daily feverfew cuts back my migraines about 70-80%, and sumatriptan covers another 50% of the migraines I do get. That&#x27;s still not 100% coverage though, and every time I&#x27;m sitting in a pitch black bathroom with cold sweats and vomiting into the toilet I have to ask myself &quot;what is the point of this???&quot;')
