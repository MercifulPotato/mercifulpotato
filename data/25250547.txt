I don&#x27;t have a good sense of how big these Firestorm cores are compared to say Zen3. Or how big the overall chip is and what the size limitations are.<p>Like say you have the Ampere Altra Max with 128 cores ARM processor. Can Apple do that theoretically or is Ampere only able to do that because they make significantly smaller cores, or is it perhaps because they don&#x27;t have an SoC.<p>I am just trying to understand better the tradeoffs between smaller weaker cores vs lager but fewer cores. Like if Apple wants to compete in the top end where e.g. AMD has 64 cores. Will that even be possible for Apple?')
