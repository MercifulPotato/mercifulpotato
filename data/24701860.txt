That just seems like a gratuitous excuse to shoot 30-50 feral hogs.<p>And yet, it sounds like this is literally what the guy did.<p>PJ: Willie told me the reason his wife was scared is these weren’t like, barnyard pigs, they were feral hogs. They’re more like wild boars – some have big sharp tusks, they’re much bigger, with longer legs. They move really fast. And that moment, there was a bunch of them swarming around his 4 and 5 year old. It was scary.<p>WILLIE: I went to my safe. I got my gun. I got my shells. Went right out on the back porch.<p>PJ: And how were the hogs acting? Were they like moving quickly? Were they–<p>WILLIE: Well, yeah. You know, they’re running all through the yard from the back of my yard all the way to the front. And then I pick out, of course, the ones that look the meanest. The one with the tusk. These are two or three hundred pound hogs. I’m not letting them near my family.<p>PJ: Yeah–<p>WILLIE: So, just for lack of a better term, I just start laying them down.')
