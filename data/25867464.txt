Item(by='ggreer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611282021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25867130, text='Current Teslas can charge at up to 250kW using 480V DC at 520 amps. Efficiency is somewhere between 90-95%, so that&#x27;s around 10kW of heat that the car has to dump. The car&#x27;s cooling system runs through the battery pack, allowing it to pump liquid through the battery, then run it through the radiator to get rid of waste heat. IIRC, Tesla plans to increase charging rates in the future by using liquid cooled charging cables. They also have a Megacharger in the works for their semi truck.<p>Charging at 600kW doesn&#x27;t sound easy, but it seems possible with current technology.')
