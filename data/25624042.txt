I spend <i>days</i> customizing my xmonad (I dont speak haskell), but thats nothing in comparison to the time I spend tuning my emacs.<p>On the other hand, i pretty much use the same environment like a decade ago. My same .emacs, my same xmonad.hs. I was looking at my WM and if there is a way to get rid of ghc on my machines (I use gentoo, updating ghc is an expensive task, especially on older machines) but every other WM felt like a downgrade so I went back to xmonad, to my old config.<p>I feel home everytime I open my notebook or booting linux on my desktop.')
