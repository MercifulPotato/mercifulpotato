Item(by='betamaxthetape', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611092620, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837595, text='This has been pointed out before, but the Hippocratic license is not an open source license as defined by the OSI[1]. The author of the licence, Coraline Ada Ehmke, argues that OSI does not define what is and isn&#x27;t open source[2]. My personal view is that re-using a well-established name (brand?) for a purpose not aligning to the brand&#x27;s mission[3] is disingenuous. On a broader level I don&#x27;t think it will be helpful to either side: detracting from true open source licences on one side and detracting from arguments made by Coraline on the other (since every announcement will be subject to comments like this).<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m pleased that the new organisation is called the Organization for Ethical Source. I think that there are plenty of interesting arguments around the Hippocratic licence, and calling it &quot;Ethical Source&quot; would be (IMHO) a much better term, both from describing what it does and avoiding the comparisons to open source licenses &#x2F; criticisms from open source purists.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;OpenSourceOrg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1176229398929977344" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;OpenSourceOrg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1176229398929977344</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;CoralineAda&#x2F;status&#x2F;1175878569169432582" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;CoralineAda&#x2F;status&#x2F;1175878569169432582</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.org&#x2F;osd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.org&#x2F;osd</a>')
