Can you trust people or not? That&#x27;s a fundamental question that decides whether you can have real democracy, or only a sham. Because any kind of democracy where people are only allowed to make &quot;safe&quot; choices, decided on by someone else (e.g. the censors), is a sham. And that&#x27;s true even if the censors themselves are directly or indirectly democratically appointed. Iran is a good example of such system taken to its logical conclusion.')
