I am pointing out that your correction of the GP comment that &quot;the Republican party is making inroads into the working class&quot; should be &quot;to the white working class&quot;. I feel that increases of 80% and 57% are significant enough to count as making inroads. Other data includes Vietnamese support increasing from 32% to 48%, handily beating the 36% Biden support. Approval from 44%~48% of a community may not be the majority, but complacent attitudes such as yours is the way that such percentages continue to increase.')
