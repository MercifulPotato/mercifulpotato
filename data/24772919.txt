On my previous work Macbook, I&#x27;d bind it as &quot;normal filesystem&quot; and that worked great until I suspended my laptop or disconnected the VPN, at which point filesystem semantics are a giant drag on the experience. If implemented as badly as on macOS, it makes your file dialog and command line access hang.<p>At least kioslaves handle disconnects gracefully and are right back in service whenever your network is, without having to remount anything.')
