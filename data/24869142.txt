Moving benefits out of employment is a good idea, but if that happened, the taxes to fund these services would come from employers again.  So Uber would still be more or less leeching off of society by not paying its share of social funds<p>Secondly, the discussion of hours, while potentially having some philosophical merit, isn&#x27;t especially material in the scheme of things. Uber can&#x27;t survive with everyone driving fewer than x hours. A lot of their comp structure tries to incentive people to drive as much as possible, with nonlinear increasing rewards for those who drive the most. Their business is built on network effects. If there&#x27;s fewer drivers, then it costs more, so fewer people ride, so fewer people want to drive, and the more expensive it is the keep the driver population thriving. The idea behind surge pricing is that you create flash incentives to get drivers out there when demand is high. If there&#x27;s a cap on hours, you&#x27;ve now got a competing interest which says there&#x27;s an incentive to NOT work while the market isn&#x27;t surging- because you might cost yourself greater earnings down the line.<p>It&#x27;s a lot easier to get a driver doing 5 hours to do 8 hours instead, than it is to get two drivers to do 4 hours. Labor has switching costs for the drivers.')
