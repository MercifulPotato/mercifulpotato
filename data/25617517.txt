(This is usually a better experience anyway, since the vast majority of them are <i>somehow worse</i> than their web sites, packed with ads&#x2F;notifications&#x2F;spying&#x2F;crap that no one should want anyway.)<p>- Certain web sites I refuse to use at all on mobile.  This gives me a much larger and more useful view anyway, and I can enforce sanity with a lot more plug-ins that way.<p>- As of latest iOS, I shove most apps into the Library so they are not even on my home screen.  That way, they are straightforward to retrieve with a swipe-down search but not <i>as</i> easy as just tapping them open.  I find that I use them slightly less this way.<p>- I turn off many notifications, since app-makers have long abused them anyway (as virtual ads, or designed in some way to suck people back into their apps for no reason; I drew the line when apps started outright <i>lying</i> about things, e.g. red dots implying messages that were not actually there, etc.).<p>- I set it up so that my lock screen will not show most things without an extra step.')
