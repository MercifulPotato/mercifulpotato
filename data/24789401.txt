Coming in behind is places like vimeo. Then <i>super</i> far behind are various smaller video sites (such as ones that use PeerTube).<p>While presenting misinformation <i>is</i> a political act, it is a more &#x27;neutral&#x27; political act. In that, since many people are able to put forward content, that doesn&#x27;t stop ideas from either side. Yes, that doesn&#x27;t mean that truth will automatically come from that mix, but it allows for the potential of truth to be found. When you have a massive company controlling so much of content, it has a large amount of ability to influence the people using the platform.  \nAs well, I think banning misinformation is a legitimate slippery slope. It increases people&#x27;s willingness to have other&#x27;s censored for their incorrect beliefs, which once you have gotten far enough will be the new normal.')
