I can&#x27;t think of one, and I like to think I know things about x86 ISAs, despite all the dark corners that architecture has. Are they, somehow, confusing it with the iAPX 432, as unlikely as that sounds?<p>Anyway, here&#x27;s the claim in context:<p>&gt; (Interestingly, Symbolics at one time was working with Intel to build a development platform based on the 386, which led to the inclusion of an extra instruction in the final 386 architecture to facilitate garbage collection).')
