I didn&#x27;t imply it was for profit, but rather that the content is only useful for getting people to join your group.<p>I can appreciate the effort you&#x27;ve put into the project, but leaving glossing over details makes &quot;DIY&quot; a buzzword instead of a method. The video gives zero information as to how it can be turned into a 1KW turbine and it leaves out so many vital details.<p>I appreciate what you&#x27;ve done, but if you want to make it truly accessible then you have to give <i>all</i> the details. Show the different ways it can be done with parts anyone can get; Not just the windmill part, the entire generator. Show somebody how they can use that electricity. Otherwise, it is just a toy project.<p>I am sorry for being so critical but I hope that you can see that this is constructive. You&#x27;ve clearly put a lot of effort into this, but you&#x27;re selling yourself short by not making it complete, and if you&#x27;re truly into open source, then you&#x27;re selling your project short too.')
