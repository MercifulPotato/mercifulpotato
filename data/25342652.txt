I am a bit confused by the example. It appears that the only difference between &quot;semantic&quot; and &quot;fixed&quot; indentation is that the former allows &quot;hanging indentation&quot; of the arguments, i.e. aligning everything to match the indentation of the first argument when that was not preceded by a newline but placed immediately after the identifier of the function being called. I don&#x27;t understand how that has anything to do with macros as it is claimed in the article, but that is probably due to my lack of Clojure knowledge.<p>I think there is an important - but often ignored - argument against &quot;hanging indentation&quot;, and that is that it makes the indentation of a possibly large number of lines depend on the length of the identifier or expression that the arguments are applied to. This can result in larger than necessary diffs when refactoring, leading to unnecessary conflicts during integration. Furthermore, unless you have tooling that is aware of this indentation style, code modifications may require a lot of manual and tedious re-indentation.')
