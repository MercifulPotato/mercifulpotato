It is best to have them fully separated so they can&#x27;t communicate. They should communicate exclusively via the user.<p>The login process should have some friction and should not be fully automated. Adding a secret domain-specific suffix to the password is very little friction for the user a gives obvious benefits: password manager does not know the password, it can&#x27;t send it to other application (intentionally or by chance), it won&#x27;t login the user by accident.')
