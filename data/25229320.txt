Then gather a lot of data and test the connections.<p>E.g., not from PG, but as people rise in organizations, do they become more conservative, e.g., in PG&#x27;s terminology, more <i>conventional minded</i>?  Pursuing just that one question scientifically was my wife&#x27;s Ph.D. dissertation.<p>Point:  Addressing <i>scientifically</i> all of PG&#x27;s proposed connections would be a lot of work!  And my guess is that many of the connections, including ones seemingly nearly obviously true -- would be very tough to settle scientifically.')
