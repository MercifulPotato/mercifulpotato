Mouse metabolism is very different from human metabolism.. Fasting a mouse for 24 hours will result in a fairly large loss of body mass. Fasting a person for 24 hours will result in a pound or two of weight loss.<p>I&#x27;m not against doing these kinds of studies on mice but the only conclusion you can really get is that we should do longer studies on animals that are closer to humans or on humans themselves.')
