While KDE is very nice, it reflects the spirit of the Linux very well. Extremely customizable, extremely extensible. When everything settles down, it&#x27;s a productivity monster, and I love it.<p>On the other hand, XFCE is much more approachable and usable for a newcomer. It&#x27;s not intimidating. It&#x27;s not infinite. It&#x27;s more resource friendly and straightforward. For a newcomer I recommend GNOME or XFCE. When they&#x27;re seasoned enough, they automatically gravitate towards KDE most of the time.')
