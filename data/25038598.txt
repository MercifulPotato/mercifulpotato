If you&#x27;ve got good body awareness noticing your pulse rate just went up by 10-20 BPM could make you worry all by itself.<p>Which shows that your point about drug titration is spot on. And in a way that&#x27;s in the pro column for stimulants. It&#x27;s <i>really</i> easy to tell when the dose is too high. Both the sympathetic nervous response and the euphoric feelings get obviously counterproductive. On the other hand doctors have learned to be wary of self-reporting there on account of drug abusers wanting that artificial euphoria. Just goes to show that both the physician and the patient have to be honest partners working together to get the best results for well-being.')
