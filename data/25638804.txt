So where does that leave me in light of the second half of your sentence?<p>I know where it leaves me: it leaves me in the place where employers pushed for &quot;at-will&quot; employment in the state legislature, and just like an employer might want me to train my replacement, I&#x27;m going to &quot;not quit until something better is lined up&quot;. I&#x27;ll still do the work that I was hired to do, but I&#x27;m not quitting until it suits my needs, just like an employer won&#x27;t keep me around even one minute longer than suits their needs.<p>Ethics don&#x27;t come into play, these are the rules that have been foisted upon us while no one asked us our opinion on the subject. To argue ethics in this case makes me suspect manipulation at worst, naivety at best.')
