Personally, I tried to learn Common Lisp 15 or so years ago and found it difficult to get the hang of how it works.<p>The Lisp that I eventually got into is Clojure. If you&#x27;re familiar with either Java or JavaScript then that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d advise looking at. The language itself is well designed and elegant and if you understand the platform that it&#x27;s running on (JVM or JavaScript depending on which variant of Clojure you&#x27;re using) then that&#x27;s very helpful. For me, being able to add a dependency on basically any Java library and use it without too much hassle is brilliant but I&#x27;d still love the language even if that wasn&#x27;t the case.')
