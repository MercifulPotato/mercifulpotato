The zero tolerance policy has made it so that bystanders won&#x27;t get involved because they will get into trouble too if they are physically breaking up a fight.<p>A diary won&#x27;t really mean much. It&#x27;s still your words, but now they&#x27;re just written down.<p>Recording could be good. It depends on the state laws as well as school policy. You might not have to inform them in some all party states, because many have exceptions for recording if you believe a crime of violence is likely to occur. The bigger problem is if that exception doesn&#x27;t exist and there are other people around, you need to inform them or get their consent. If they aren&#x27;t around, the bully knows you&#x27;re recording and may take the device from you to destroy the recording.')
