They still focus heavily on things like cursive and rote learning of multiplication tables. There&#x27;s a lot of emphasis on things you can test: memorise the names of the continents, but don&#x27;t waste any time actually explaining what continents are or how they&#x27;re formed.<p>My kids&#x27; teachers&#x27; response to the fact that children don&#x27;t recognise coins any more (because no one carries cash) is not to spend less time teaching about money, but to ask parents to show their kids more coins.')
