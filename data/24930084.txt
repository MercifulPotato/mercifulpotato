The goal of a money launderer is to launder as much as possible<p>2. The goal of a home seller is to sell for as much as possible<p>3. If the asset being purchased is a home, incentives between buyer and seller are aligned and prices are higher than the non-laundering market would support (esp if there&#x27;s another launderer who&#x27;s interested).<p>4. Since the market for home prices is based on comps, a few launderers can raise market prices substantially<p>5. Lather, rinse, repeat<p>The foreigner question was the wrong one to ask, though certainly a large part of the market was driven by foreign investment.  The right question to ask -- and the problem to guard against -- was: &quot;what&#x27;s the impact of laundered money on the market&quot;.<p>BC added the foreign buyer&#x27;s tax of 15% in 2016[1].  But beneficial ownership laws come into effect on November 30 of this year[2].  The former created a slight disincentive for foreigners laundering $$ to buy. But turns out what was really needed to slow the tide of illegal money flowing into housing was more transparency and disclosure rules.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;financialpost.com&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;mortgages-real-estate&#x2F;b-c-to-bring-in-additional-15-per-cent-real-estate-tax-on-foreign-buyers-in-vancouver-in-effort-to-rein-in-high-home-prices" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;financialpost.com&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;mortgages-real-es...</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mondaq.com&#x2F;canada&#x2F;real-estate&#x2F;988830&#x2F;bc-real-estate-beneficial-ownership-disclosure-law-takes-effect-november-30-2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mondaq.com&#x2F;canada&#x2F;real-estate&#x2F;988830&#x2F;bc-real-est...</a>')
