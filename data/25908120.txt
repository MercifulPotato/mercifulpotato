Now people want to keep those prohibitions in place because they function as a way to keep neighborhoods exclusive and generally keep things the way they are. So defending them has become a conservative position.<p>&gt; the alternative is &quot;wants to keep changing things&quot;, which isn&#x27;t a political archetype that exists in reality.<p>Progressive is about progress and &quot;wants to keep changing&quot; is the whole point. From voting rights to civil rights to economic opportunity, being progressive means demanding change. The American republic is 245 years old and still has a long way to go to live up to its ideals.')
