Japan has several licensed non-lawyer professions that do a lot of work that in the US has to be done by lawyers.<p>In addition, a very large number of people in Japan study law as undergraduates, then go into corporate jobs where they are allowed to handle corporate legal matters that would require a lawyer in the US.')
