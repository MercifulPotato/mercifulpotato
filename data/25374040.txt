Look at the FISA and the Carter Page lawsuit. A government informant leaked fake information to the press and the FISA warrant was based on that information. They literally made up information to get a warrant. That&#x27;s literally a baseless allegation and all the documents that have come out in discovery back that up.<p>I think there are two fundamentally different worlds here. Many of the people in this thread, and in big tech, still trust CNN&#x2F;FOX&#x2F;MSNBC&#x2F;NYTimes. But if you look at the past four years, they&#x27;ve constantly given us bad information, or used misleading headlines (most people don&#x27;t read past the headlines), and often the content of the post itself contradicts the headline.<p>That&#x27;s why this YouTube thing is so important. People like Shapiro, Megan Kelly, Tim Pool, Viva Frei, No Agenda .. they actually dig through this stuff and expose how corrurpt the media really is .. and they are insanely corrurpt.<p>We&#x27;ve had months of &quot;mostly peaceful protestors&quot; and I&#x27;ve watched people all around me on the left defend the burning and looting. &quot;It&#x27;s just property.&quot; The media is corrurpt and this shows YouTube&#x2F;Google is just as corrurpt, trying to use their massive influence to control a narrative; making something absolute that should be brought deeply into question.<p>We are not in 1984. We&#x27;ve been in 1984 for decades. It&#x27;s just now the Internet has allowed people to see that for themselves, and Big Tech wants to take that away and tell people what to think again.')
