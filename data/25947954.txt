The central point of travel in your post, particularly, as some sort of universal, valuable goal is an unfamiliar concept to me. Travel, along with what I&#x27;m guess most of what you consider as &quot;intense and high-effort experiences&quot; to do before &quot;your life is over&quot; after getting married and having kids I would probably categorize as the self-destructive and ultimately pointless pleasure seeking I&#x27;m advocating against. My point is the fact that you and most people consider this &quot;desirable&quot; is not good.  If you think you should seek a great deal of pleasure before &quot;ending&quot; your life by becoming a responsible adult, my advice is to get addicted to heroin, as it will offer a far more intense pleasure than travel, or whatever else you mean.')
