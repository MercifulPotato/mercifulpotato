Item(by='berdario', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603791379, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24901686, text='You should learn some history, instead of repeating US propaganda talking points, example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;People%27s_Republic_of_Korea" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;People%27s_Republic_of_Korea</a><p>There was a unified Korea, led by Lyuh Woon-hyung.<p>Americans arrived afterwards, Lieutenant General John Hodge said: &quot;one of our missions was to break down this Communist government&quot;.<p>If the Americans wouldn&#x27;t have come, there wouldn&#x27;t have been any north&#x2F;south division (in fact, Kim Il-sung wouldn&#x27;t probably end up leading a country). And you somehow think that it&#x27;s China who destabilized it?<p>Similarly, it&#x27;s the US that invaded Vietnam from the other side of the world. The only difference is that the country was already divided, after the Anti-French Resistance War. You think of it as &quot;communist aggression&quot;, but the truth is that these were liberation wars from western colonization.<p>Similarly, the US propaganda personally blames Mao for &quot;killing&quot; people due to a famine. The reality is more complex, and unfortunately personal responsibility of state leaders is never recognized during these events. Similarly, Trump is &quot;killing&quot; hundred of thousands of people due to his mishandling of the pandemic, but we both know that he won&#x27;t be held personally responsible.<p>I can get into more details, but you should reconsider what you choose to spread. If you&#x27;re just repeating propaganda talking points, you&#x27;re not going to accomplish anything good for the people in Korea, Vietnam, China or US people themselves. The only people that you&#x27;re doing a favor to  are the fat cats in Washington.')
