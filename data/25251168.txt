I collect mechanical watches and I&#x27;m looking forward to the time when I can buy the child his first watch - no doubt a casio&#x2F;swatch or similar.  No point buying a mechanical watch for a child.<p>Nothing else that I can think about.  I tend to average a new desktop PC every 3-5 years, but apart from random electronic components for making things myself I don&#x27;t tend to buy too much &quot;technical stuff&quot;.')
