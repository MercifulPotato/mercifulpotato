There have been &lt;100 confirmed re-infections.<p>It&#x27;s very early to draw the conclusion that people in general don&#x27;t build up lasting immunity, and there is more than enough data to support that most people do build up immunity of several months at least. If the latter wasn&#x27;t true you&#x27;d see much more re-infections.')
