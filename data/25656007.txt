I was going to object but I think you&#x27;re right. The problems I know with parents forcing kids to do X when they wanted to do Y came from a) pushing X way too far (e.g. forcing a particular university degree), b) refusing to let the kid explore Y when they express interest for it, and c) resenting the kid for choosing Y over X.<p>So as long as one isn&#x27;t forcing a skill exclusively, and isn&#x27;t resentful when the skill doesn&#x27;t stick, I&#x27;d say this is a wise approach.')
