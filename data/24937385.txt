Item(by='jws', descendants=None, kids=[24937610], score=None, time=1604014543, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24917550, text='Just something that needs to be said from time to timeâ€¦<p>If you are interested in accurate analog to digital converters (which you are, since you went to get a 16 converter instead of the 10 bit ones already included), and there is <i>any</i> possibility that your signal will be changing faster or really anywhere near your sample rate (which is at most 860 samples&#x2F;second here, remember to include all that nasty digital switching noise polluting your pristine analog signal) then you <i>really</i> want to put a little RC filter on the way from your pristine analog signal to your A&#x2F;D converter.<p>It&#x27;s only two components, one takes the place of a wire or a crossover on the circuit board if you are working through hole, so it&#x27;s really only one extra component.<p>Design of the RC filter is left to the reader and the thousand web pages which will tell you how. Further reading: &quot;aliasing&quot; in the context of signal processing.<p>Once you&#x27;ve leveled up to preventing aliasing, then you can spend a little bit of time thinking about reducing the impedance of your analog signal circuit, let some current flow so the electrical noise doesn&#x27;t change the voltage so much. But not too much.')
