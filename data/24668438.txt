It doesn&#x27;t seem that strange.<p>You could have a flow like:<p>Reset page receives email address and passes it to some backend functionality. The backend checks whether the email address corresponds to an account on the site. It does, so the backend generates a reset token and emails it to the address on the affected account.<p>All of that is supposed to happen. What&#x27;s <i>also</i> happening is that the reset token is being returned to the reset page, where the person requesting the reset can see it. This is very bad, but it seems likely to have come from some sort of automatic connect-your-frontend-pages-to-backend-services framework solution.')
