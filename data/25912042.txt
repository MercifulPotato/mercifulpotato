Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611630950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25909895, text='&gt; It is less about which specific &quot;meme positions&quot; you enter, but when you enter them and when you exit them.<p>this is a good point. I mostly entered my positions after the symbols had gotten a day or two of buzz on wsb, which is usually too late to realize significant gains. my buddy had more of a yolo strategy: &quot;buy anything sufficiently ridiculous the first time you see it on wsb&quot;. he did a lot better than I did. I do it for fun mostly. I realized early on I don&#x27;t have the stomach to put large amounts of my money into memes, and the amount of time I&#x27;ve spend watching tickers for 2-4% of my portfolio value simply isn&#x27;t worth it on a $&#x2F;hr basis.<p>my main point is just that this was a great year for frugal people with good jobs who invested their savings somewhat conservatively. the (unrealized) gains from my s&amp;p etfs this year exceeded my actual salary by quite a bit. I don&#x27;t feel like a chump for not going all in on short-dated options.')
