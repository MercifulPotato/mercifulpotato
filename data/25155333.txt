I ended up having a lot of trouble with networking, and leaned heavily on my understanding of virtualization to debug those issues:<p>- Connections to Windows VPNs wouldn&#x27;t work well inside the WSL guest<p>- Running browser automation tools like Playwright wouldn&#x27;t allow you access to the browser in Windows<p>- The WSL2 guest can&#x27;t connect to services (tcp, ports, whatever) running on the Windows host<p>- Trying to do something like `ssh -D 1337` from inside the WSL guest is confusing<p>- If you run `ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 remote.com` using powershell, the WSL guest does not have access to port `8080`.<p>While incredible in that it has dynamic VM memory allocation and such, it still felt like running Linux in VirtualBox, SSHing into it and having a lot of automation to handle port forwarding - a workflow I have used in the past and isn&#x27;t very revolutionary.<p>WSL1, while a simpler implementation that is more feature constrained, I felt that it matched my behavioural expectations (an API mapping that isn&#x27;t feature complete) making it more useful. I continue to daily drive it.<p>Windows Terminal also made Windows competitive with other OSes that have quality terminal emulators, such as `iTerm2` or `gnome-terminal` (`hyper` is too memory heavy, though `cmder` is not too bad).<p>It&#x27;s my understanding that MS wants to focus on Hyper-V to make VMs more like containers, but for my simple use-case&#x2F;world view, I would rather the &quot;reverse Wine&quot; world of WSL1 to the &quot;enhanced VM&quot; world of Hyper V.<p>I will continue to use WSL1 daily and hope MS chooses to focus on this style of integration over the WSL2 style. I&#x27;d love to see features like blending `&#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts`, supporting `tmpfs` and containerization (without virtualization).<p>If MS deprecates WSL1, I will probably move back to MacOS or Linux.')
