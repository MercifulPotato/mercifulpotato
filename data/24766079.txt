We know, for example, where the muscles attach, and how strong those attachments are, giving a good proxy for how large the muscle is. It also reveals the angle of attachment, which tells you a lot about its posture, how it moved, and what kind of musculature would be required to support it.<p>That is calibrated against lots of existing species, and some rare fossils give even more evidence of body shape, giving opportunities to calibrate it further.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of delicate inference and opportunities to go wrong, but it&#x27;s not as haphazard as the meme suggests. The reconstructions are based on much finer details of the skeleton, including microscopic ones.')
