People not wearing gas masks makes you less safe.  People leaving their homes at all makes you less safe.  A certain amount of risk is necessary if you&#x27;re going to get out of your bed in the morning.<p>What most people (including me) do is this: we follow the law (in almost all cases) and we use our own subjective judgements to determine how to act besides that.  This gets tricky because even if none of us breaks the law, our subjective judgements often differ.  Some examples:<p>1. The law where I live says I need to wear a mask inside public places&#x2F;stores, which I do happily.<p>2. I wear a mask when I&#x27;m outside and there&#x27;s lots of people around, because according to my subjective judgement, this makes sense (the law does not require this).<p>3. I don&#x27;t wear a mask when I&#x27;m outside and there aren&#x27;t a lot of people around.<p>4. I don&#x27;t wear a mask when I&#x27;m running along a trail.<p>5. I don&#x27;t eat-in at restaurants, even though the law allows maskless, indoor dining.<p>What I find wrong about your comment is that you seem to be holding people accountable for not sharing the same subjective judgements as you.  If I see people dining, maskless, inside a restaurant, I think &quot;well, I wouldn&#x27;t do that, but other people disagree&quot;.  I don&#x27;t categorize them as untrustworthy, bad people.')
