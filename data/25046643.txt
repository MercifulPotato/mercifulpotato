It would be logical to have a transition plan to migrate science projects as old observatories are decommissioned and new ones turned up. Arecibo could go dark tomorrow due to disrepair (antenna assembly fails entirely, and 900 tons of suspended gear is going to do some <i>serious damage</i> upon failure) and the cost to repair and recommission is greater than available funds from UCF and NSF.<p>Edit: dredmorbius mentions in a comment below China has built a better observatory for this type of science [2]. Retask remaining science to other assets, decommission Arecibo.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nsf.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;special_reports&#x2F;astronomy&#x2F;facilities.jsp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nsf.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;special_reports&#x2F;astronomy&#x2F;facilitie...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25046772" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25046772</a>')
