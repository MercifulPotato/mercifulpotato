Though weak, it&#x27;s the strongest specific claim RIAA makes.<p>Hagemeister&#x27;s comment establishes that minimal copying is performed in the testing itself, contrary to RIAA&#x27;s claim.<p>The infringement does not occur in the source code or test suite itself, it occurs inccidental to testing functionality of the software (that is, it is inherently functional, not expressive), the copies made fall within existing limitations to exclusive rights (§112, §117, §512(a) and (b)), and tests (1), (3), and (4) of §107 fair use.<p>RIAA&#x27;s standing on anti-circ §1201 is separate from this question, poorly justified, and likely lacks standing.')
