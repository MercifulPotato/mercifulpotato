This might be biological, but this could also be some kind of mid life crisis. As opposed to someone who knows they could live to 300 years and be complacent. Perhaps the long lived complacent ones were taken as slaves or lost in battles.<p>&gt; &quot;Alternately...is it possible that there are adaptive genetic traits that have not yet evolved, but will evolve in future, or is life on Earth already so old that everything that will exist has likely already evolved?&quot;<p>Evolution seems to be a really ineffective mechanism though. It&#x27;s sort of like how planets &quot;evolve&quot; to support life. Most don&#x27;t. Some planets might need a terraforming lifeform to evolve. Evolution has done its duty, but now it&#x27;s up to us mortals to take the next step and evolve ourselves.<p>You can argue that life saving medical techniques make us more likely to select for cancer and the like, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter as long as we can eliminate it.')
