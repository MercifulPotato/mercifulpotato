Botley Road - there is plenty of space for a two-way cycle path in the photo you show. Just a couple of photos down, you can see the road fits three vehicles abreast: in other words, it would comfortably fit two road lanes and a double cycle lane, if only that had been or was constructed. There are much trickier problems solved in the Netherlands.<p>2. Henley Bridge - Overall, Henley could be ideal for cycling around. OK, one of the main routes into the town crosses a river. Yet, if this was in the Netherlands, they would simply have built a parallel cycle bridge at some point in the last 20 years. Or, if there still wasn&#x27;t one, they&#x27;d build one now.<p>Here you go, Rijswijk swingbrug, opened 2014 (watch the video for relevant commentary):\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oozo.nl&#x2F;video&#x2F;rijswijk&#x2F;84608&#x2F;rijswijk-cycle-bridge" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oozo.nl&#x2F;video&#x2F;rijswijk&#x2F;84608&#x2F;rijswijk-cycle-brid...</a><p>Or Delft&#x27;s Gelatinebrug, scheduled to open in 2023: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.delft.nl&#x2F;wonen&#x2F;bouwen&#x2F;bouwprojecten-de-stad&#x2F;schieoevers&#x2F;gelatinebrug" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.delft.nl&#x2F;wonen&#x2F;bouwen&#x2F;bouwprojecten-de-stad&#x2F;schi...</a><p>There are plenty of other examples.<p>Amsterdam&#x27;s narrow roads have little to no traffic <i>only because of political decisions that cars are not the only form of transport that need to be considered</i>. You can see in archive footage that this wasn&#x27;t always the case.')
