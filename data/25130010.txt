It is used to binary search git commits back to X point in time. You can use it to manually go through previous commands to find what code&#x2F;how long ago a bug was introduced. You can also rig it up with a test command (say a unit test that you copy out of the working tree&#x2F;keep in a separate worktree) and have it automatically sift through the commits and tell you the first point where it starts to fail.')
