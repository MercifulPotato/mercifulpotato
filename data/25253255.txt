Buy ads individually on auction vs. bulk publisher deals) but that kind of approach often comes with it own other costs (Infra to handle scale, transaction costs, lost negotiation leverage). In any real business investment scenario, you usually end up with many many decisions that are somewhat higher risk and they require explainability.')
