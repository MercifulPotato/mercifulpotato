It was one of the most heavily shorted stock. People laughed at Musk&#x27;s $420 stock prediction. Now it&#x27;s trade at many times the 420 level ( factoring in the stock split ) and it&#x27;s about to be added to the S&amp;P. I can&#x27;t think of a company&#x2F;stock that so many people were so wrong about.')
