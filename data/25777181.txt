Working in a product company with disparate generators of data, I’m often building out network connectivity (VPC peering, VPNs, etc.), subnets, ACLs, firewalls and load balancers across our visualization tools, managing job flows, controlling AWS costs, building read replicas for production databases, yadda yadda. There might be a ton of hoops to jump through before I can even start to process data and it’s the type of work that wouldn’t make sense to hand off to my DS counterparts.')
