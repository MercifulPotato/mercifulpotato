It wasn&#x27;t tried in any lower courts because cases between states have original jurisdiction in the Supreme Court.<p>The Supreme Court can reject a case for lack of standing (the plaintiff does not have the right to sue the defendant) or for lack of merit (the lawsuit is obviously frivolous). They can also reject it if they think the lower court ruled correctly, but that doesn&#x27;t apply here.')
