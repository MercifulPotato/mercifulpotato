If they decline to create one then the kernel devs can just declare one (even if nobody implements it).  Failure to implement the API is, of course, equivalent to reporting &quot;no guarantee&quot; for all queries.<p>Then they could at least say &quot;we&#x27;re doing everything we can; next time you buy a storage device look for feature X&quot;.')
