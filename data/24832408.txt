If gravitation mass contributes to the majority of intertial mass it would look like they&#x27;re the same.<p>But let&#x27;s just say they are the same, then gravity and &quot;spacial&quot; inertia are intertwined. Gravity is only special if intertia is also considered special. Inertia seems special because it&#x27;s explainable in terms of motion in space. There might be other kinds of motion in other dimensions that could explain the randomness of quantum space.')
