If there&#x27;s one thing he does well it&#x27;s respecting his users. He knows what &quot;we&#x27;re earning enough to cover our expenses&quot; means. The company is privately owned so no one will be pushing him into anything either.<p>Many popular Telegram channels already have ads in them, posted by their creators. My understanding is that Telegram will be taking control of this by acting as an intermediary, taking a cut and possibly deciding what goes through. Thinking of it, it makes sense, and doesn&#x27;t alter the UX at all for the average user.')
