But they have a commercial need for Linux support: their recent revenue growth has been in datacenter usage of GPUs, and Linux support is necessary for that computing environment. To that end, IMHO NVidia is the entity that needs to align its development practices to support the existing Linux driver community rather than Linux needing to align its process to accommodate NVidia&#x27;s wishes.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that Linux has been right in its treatment of other external entities: the treatment of ZFS, as you note, does seem to be driven more by spite than actual technical reasons. But in the case of NVidia, there is definitely a good deal of fault on NVidia&#x27;s side that needs to be acknowledged.')
