And in an emergency you don&#x27;t have to think about what to roll back to, it&#x27;s by default master.<p>It&#x27;s just a convention, it does not have any real benefits or downsides. You could do the same with another branch named stable, or with tags.<p>&gt; a record of every version that was seen by actual users<p>This is covered by the release branches and also by the CD pipeline.')
