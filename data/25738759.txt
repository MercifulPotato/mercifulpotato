It&#x27;s just their recent prosumer gateway&#x2F;router product line that&#x27;s really struggling. I&#x27;ve had a great experience with the older UAP-HD-PRO. Their newish $100 Wifi 6 U6-Lite AP is tempting but haven&#x27;t tried it.<p>If you just need one AP you can set it up in standalone mode and forget about it. If you want more monitoring and control you&#x27;ll need to have a Ubiquiti controller running to manage things. (can run one in docker, on a rasp pi, or just buy their &quot;Cloud Key&quot; product.)')
