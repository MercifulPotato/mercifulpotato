If Canada replaced their phone system with Facebook tomorrow, that’s the Canadian Parliament’s problem, not Congress’. Mind my central focus on US law is within the context of the comment you originally replied to.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m proposing that they be obligated to uphold special restrictions and be subject to public oversight that, in my opinion, goes hand-in-hand with their monopoly or duopoly-like status in many countries.<p>You are proposing to treat them like they are special because you perceive them to be something they are <i>not</i>. The fact that you and I are having an exchange right here on a relatively obscure non-Twitter and non-Facebook website is proof enough that there are alternatives, and there are many <i>many</i> alternatives. If the entire Internet was somehow destroyed tomorrow and couldn’t be repaired, maybe some wizard did it, our First Amendment rights would continue to prevail, but we would probably be back to exchanging letters in the mail for our communications and meeting new people at the bar, assuming the phone system as it exists today went with the Internet to Hell.<p>At least in that case we wouldn’t be discussing new and exciting forms of cronyism with companies that didn’t exist 20 years ago.')
