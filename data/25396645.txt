However, beyerdynamic also sells 150$ headphones. What I meant was this weird cult following they have and this determination to do something very different from the rest of the industry and what is generally being considered as an upset to the established rules. I am of course talking about the unnatural bright sound profile for studio headphones, where the goal usually is to have them as flat as possible.<p>Also they do seem to care more about nice materials and Style than other brands, which is reflected in their commercials as well.')
