Really?<p>Dont use async-await then. Its just syntactic sugar (minus a few details that make it so ergonomic that you can do things that otherwise would be more work than they are worth). Just use plain futures. Be joyful as there will be no &quot;colored&quot; functions in your editor - only 10x more code (and less readable!).<p>I think there is a place for arguing about async await syntax and whether fibers are the better solution (try implementing them without a large runtime! Rust got rid of theirs.). Clearly, the benefits provided by continuations are worthwhile in avoiding context switches - to argue otherwise is wild. Context switches are very expensive and, in performance critical code, a huge red flag.')
