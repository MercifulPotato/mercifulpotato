The difference between them is that one is more effective than the other. Do you at all recognize how different methods of censorship can be more or less effective than others?<p>Of course some censorship is more effective than others, but the idea that banning a subreddit is morally wrong because it&#x27;s somehow &quot;more effective&quot; (by some metric) than banning a user (which apparently is OK?) makes absolutely no sense to me at all.<p>&gt;For example, would you seriously argue that every single grocery store in the world, banning all people who want to raise their taxes, is the same thing as a random person kicking a friend out of their house?<p>Reddit doesn&#x27;t have a global monopoly on internet forums though.  Websites like the Daily Stormer still exist.  Your analogy is not really applicable to this case.  And even if Daily Stormer didn&#x27;t exist, private individuals have never been legally obliged to signal boost and publish hate speech at any point since the US was founded that I am aware of.  That would, ironically, violate the 1st amendment.')
