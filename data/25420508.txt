If you live somewhere with -25C winters, you either need layers or a set of different jackets, because a heavy down coat rated for -30C will be hot and sweaty if you so much as fast-walk at -5C. I find it more economical to own just a light synthetic jacket and wear extra layers than having an expensive down jacket just for the few weeks at -20C and below.<p>Layers are also a must if you do outdoor winter activities. You want to remove layers when you&#x27;re active so you don&#x27;t get all sweaty, and put them back on when you rest. Because sweat + cold wind is a really nasty combo.<p>Having said that, as far as I can tell most people in the city here don&#x27;t do much winter sports and just own like 3 different coats for different weather.')
