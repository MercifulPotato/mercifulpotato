Its first principle is the notion that an app, a machine, a software program, or an algorithm offers the best solution to any complicated problem.”<p>But you can’t escape science. Whatever <i>is</i> a solution, if it can be reduced to repeatable physical processes and computational substrates, is amenable to engineering and engineering has almost universally made such solutions more scalable, more reliable, safer, more affordable and so on.<p>I think there is a dangerous Luddite narrative underpinning this that ultimately is not self-consistent and likely to do more harm than good.<p>Also anecdotally, as an introvert, I can’t overstate how much happier I feel working from home. I’ll take all the flaws of videoconferencing any day, over the constant fight-vs-flight reflex exhaustion of open plan offices and a constant stream of in-person interaction when I need solitude and privacy to get mental clarity about my work.')
