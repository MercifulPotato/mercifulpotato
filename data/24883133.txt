Though I have seen then struggle thru the active process of dying but that is temporary. My family lives unusually long, usually at least into their late 90&#x27;s most go over 100. This is on both sides of the family. I have watched all of my great grandparents pass (also more recently, 2 of my grandparents), most of which were thru my teenage years to the last one dying when I was 30. The last one was my great grandfather, he was 107 he was diagnosed with a treatable cancer. He told the doctor that the reality is at 107 he has 5 more years maybe if he decided to treat it, that his time was up, that he missed his wife and that he was most assuredly going home to die. He did not view his death as a tragedy but rather the completion of a life story, a story in which most of the characters had move on and thus he was ready to move on.<p>As a note: much like the GP post you replied to, it was around that 30 mark and my great grandfathers passing that I no longer worried about death.')
