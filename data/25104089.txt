Large companies don&#x27;t like that and it rightfully raises all kinds of appsec concerns because @dessant could easily change their Github Action to do something malicious.<p>Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;d guess this entire process went:<p>1. FB appsec: &quot;wtf are you doing referencing this guy&#x27;s Github Action in our codebase? We don&#x27;t own that and if he chooses to change something we get hacked&quot;<p>2. FB employee: &quot;okay fine I&#x27;ll fix it&quot;<p>3. FB employee: creates official version for FB to use, that can&#x27;t be mutated outside of FB oversight')
