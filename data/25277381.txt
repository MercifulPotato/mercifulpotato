It&#x27;s that the alternatives have become less attractive, mostly due to costs and liabilities.<p>Watching TV is cheap. Going out to eat, to bars, etc is increasingly expensive. Hobbies like gardening require land. Hobbies like AutoX and track days generally require consumables, tools&#x2F;accessories, and insurance. Even just regular street insurance and health insurance are a major cost. All while wages have stagnated for decades.<p>Why claim that we are wasting great minds by watching TV? Would people actually be doing productive things otherwise? I would think it would be alternate relaxing things.')
