I didn&#x27;t even know anyone cared about that.<p>I&#x27;ve been using GIMP for many years (since at least 2008) and have heard <i>many</i> valid and not very valid complaints, but never anything about the name being offensive.<p>GIMP has a lot of problems hurting its adoption in professional settings, but the name is hardly one of them. Creating a fork just for that is bike-shedding to the extreme.')
