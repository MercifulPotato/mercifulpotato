Item(by='txmachinery', descendants=None, kids=[25186276], score=None, time=1606132977, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25185012, text='&quot;The media&quot; and &quot;social media&quot; may not be controlled by a single actor, but it&#x27;s common knowledge that large enough chunks of both can be and often are.<p>For example, the conspiracy theory that Russia rigged the 2016 election for Trump is based on this premise.<p>There is also a widely-accepted partisan divide between the encumbent news sources on the left, and Fox and newer so-called &quot;fringe&quot; or &quot;alt&quot; news sources on the right. These in fact aren&#x27;t correctly fringe or alt - at least in the US - as clearly very close to or more than half of the US population for the past decade has indicated they have political beliefs aligned with them.<p>It&#x27;s therefore as disingenuous to attempt to delegitimize &quot;alt right&quot; media by referring to it thusly, just as it may br for right-leaning media to do the same by referring to the left as &quot;fake news&quot;. With this example, both sides are behaving in uniform ways exactly typical of unified, single-actor control, respective to each.<p>If the Russian conspiracy is true, the premise that single-actor control is possible is accepted, as it therefore happened with enough force to alter a major an election. If it isn&#x27;t, then half of the US is legitimately right-leaning, making the labelling of their mainstream news sources as &quot;fringe&quot; or &quot;alt&quot; or &quot;extreme&quot; indeed tantamount to &quot;fake news&quot;.<p>Either way, it&#x27;s mistaken to believe it impossible for the control of single actor to be enacted upon a large enough portion of the media to achieve widespread adoption of their agenda.<p>In effect, your last paragraph directly contradicts your first.')
