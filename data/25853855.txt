First one, took the leap to full time after a year of <i>very long</i> hours. Second one, took the leap after 6 years (!) of less intense work on the side.<p>In the second case I negotiated a 4 day work week. That helped me stay sane, but the one day on &#x2F; six days off cadence made it hard to build momentum.<p>Putting in a little work on the side every day, as other commenters suggest, is probably the way to go. But it’s a different (and to me less rewarding) kind of work that can be done in small increments. Probably not deep work. Choose your business idea and responsibilities accordingly! And be patient.')
