The best thing I can do is sprinkle &quot;const&quot; wherever I can because of my religious belief that immutability should be the default. If I wanted to stay up to date with the latest developments in C++ and the accompanying proper ways of doing things I feel like I&#x27;d have to forget what little I know about the language every time I used it and learn it all over again, just to avoid doing stuff that some blog post now says is &quot;considered harmful&quot;. I might as well try staying up to date with JavaCoffeeTypeScript using the latest AngularReactVue and whatnot.')
