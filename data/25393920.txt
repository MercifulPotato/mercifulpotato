There are other things the government isn&#x27;t allowed to do besides arrest you. They can&#x27;t force you to say something, either. They can&#x27;t prohibit certain opinions from being expressed in government owned or regulated channels.<p>And freedom of speech can be infringed on or limited by other entities than the government.<p>A better description would be &quot;principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or sanction.&quot; This means that if you&#x27;re forced into silence by threat of retaliation from, say, a religious sect or political group in your area, it&#x27;s still infringing on your freedom of speech even if they aren&#x27;t part of the government.')
