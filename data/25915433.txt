What this glosses over is the reason for the sentiment, the question: &quot;why do people want to pay this?&quot;<p>Traditional stories analysts tell would have people pay $150&#x2F;share because they expect $8-$15&#x2F;yr. This story is that people will pay $150&#x2F;share because people want a way to say &#x27;fuck wall street&#x27; and &#x27;fuck analysts&#x27; and have unreasonable expectations of becoming wealthy. The former sentiment is sustainable in a way that the latter story kinda isn&#x27;t.')
