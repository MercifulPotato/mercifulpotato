And as central banks print more and more of it, they mask valid price signals more and more and thereby make the regulation of the economy worse and worse. And then they claim they need to print more money to &quot;fix&quot; the problem.<p>If by &quot;inflation&quot; you mean &quot;prices going up&quot;, if the money supply were fixed, the prices of everything going up would signal an unhealthy economy, not a healthy one. With a fixed money supply, in the short term, whenever the supply&#x2F;demand situation changes (and it is always changing), some prices will go up and some will go down. In the long term, the general price level would be expected to go down as average productivity improves. If the general price level is going up, it means average productivity is getting worse, which, as noted, is a sign of an unhealthy economy.<p>The main purpose of printing money is to allow governments to obfuscate the fact that they are making the economy worse by masking what would otherwise be obvious price signals showing it. Every ordinary person understands that if the prices of everything are going up, that&#x27;s bad. So governments, politically, cannot allow sustained increases in the general price level, unless they are so small as to not be noticeable except over many years. But they can&#x27;t micromanage their way to a healthy economy either, so their only choice is to print money to disguise what is going on.<p><i>&gt; the obvious answer to solving unemployment is a job guarantee funded through &quot;printing&quot; money</i><p>This would be government micromanagement on an even more massive scale and would be a disaster.<p>The obvious answer to solving unemployment is to make it easier for people to start businesses, since that is what creates new jobs. The way to do that is for the government to stop micromanaging the economy and let individual people figure things out.')
