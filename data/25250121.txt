That&#x27;s straight up economic waste.  It&#x27;s like dumping milk to support the market price, even if people are hungry.<p>Detroit isn&#x27;t abandoned.  It just doesn&#x27;t have rich people, and banks were too aggressive in their pricing of foreclosed properties.  Now those properties have all rotted.<p>Economic waste should be severely penalized in the tax code.')
