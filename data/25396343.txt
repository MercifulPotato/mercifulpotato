What has been stable for a long time and remains frustratingly static and unrefined is the field of surgcial instruments. There are a few exceptions but most haven&#x27;t changed in the 20years I have been a surgeon.\nThe regulatory costs of developing new instruments and intertia of manufacturers doesnt help. Once a manufacturer gains a market share they try and keep by not innovating which keeps their deveopment costs down and the consumer volume is comparatively low. I don&#x27;t get the feeling there is any sense of patient altruism.\nI have been using the same 4mm dia endoscope 25cm long since 2007 when the first iphone came out. It is very simple, made of glass fibres with a sony 3chip camera that is 10y old. We get some v slow progression on video output and have just got 4k. \nCompared to consumer tech the advances are ridiculously slow.\nWe need a camera (the iphone camera is small enough) on a steerable stick. How hard an engineering task can that be?.')
