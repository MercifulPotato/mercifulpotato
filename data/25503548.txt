And this is not the problem. The problem is that in any of my two cars that I own, I can change  anything I want my self and this is actually a standard practice today and without approval of third party vendor or service but I can assure you that this will not be the case with Apple Produced Car. We have clearly seen how Tesla thinks about third party repairs. Apple is a control freak monster, and whataboutism is not working for the actual users but only for the big company.<p>Future is electric, but we have to be environmentally conscious: how about a global program for engine replacements?
