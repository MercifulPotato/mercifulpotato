I started with a framework that relies exclusively on the Python Standard Library to build desktop apps. Then, with this framework, I created an SQL editor and a graphical test runner. I decided to bundle them together. The question then arises of knowing how to call a framework delivered with an SQL editor and a graphical test runner ? A framework with batteries included ? Why not a &quot;software suite&quot; ? Too pretentious ? So let&#x27;s add &quot;lightweight&quot; + add more apps to the suite. Done.<p>Next:<p>There is a lot to do. My goal is to add some important features, then automated tests (yes the opposite of TDD) to make people confident to use Pyrustic, then think of some really good serious documentation, then think about the call to collaboration, git-workflow...<p>Thanks for your feedback !')
