They&#x27;re a private company that controls WAY too many assets, with way too much unregulated&#x2F;unchecked power. They want equality for all, but yet they&#x27;re willing to suppress every man&#x27;s voice in order for their own mission, whatever that is. Their agenda ranges from personal freedom and free speech suppression to political campaigning; and far beyond the reach of both of those. When a company gets too big and consolidates too much power for themselves their own absolute power corrupts absolutely.<p>Facebook here has the power to regulate their own version(s) of the markets due to personal fear that their stock will be affected by the every man&#x27;s voice and opinion. They fear being oppressed by the people, so they oppress the people&#x27;s ability to have any control over them. For a publicly traded company this is insane, and it shows how fake everything really is behind the scenes. Only a few out there are truly allowed to trade on good information and swing markets their way.<p>Break up big tech.')
