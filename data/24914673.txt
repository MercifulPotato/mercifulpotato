Minding is activity brains perform, exactly as motion is activity cars perform. To imagine that mind can&#x27;t come out of brain cells being brain cells is woolly mysticism that is pointless even to write: rejecting reason, you reject language and communication, and there is nobody to talk to and nothing meaningful to say.<p>You could equally well say that, being in the car, you can&#x27;t experience the motion. But that is also nonsense: you do.<p>There is nothing profound about noticing yourself noticing. Brain activity is not distinct from other activity, just because it can react to itself. Individual, nanoscopic transistors do it all day long.')
