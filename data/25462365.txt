Age, hour, overtime and minimum wage provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act that protect young workers in other fields don&#x27;t apply. Seventeen states have exempted farm work from most or all their child labor laws: Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming.')
