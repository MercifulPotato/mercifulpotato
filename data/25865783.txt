Item(by='umvi', descendants=None, kids=[25865884], score=None, time=1611269997, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25864811, text='&gt; I worked for a very small hosting company and we had to automatically detect and remove bitcoin miners because they were so common, I can&#x27;t even imagine what AWS deals with.<p>Huh? Why shouldn&#x27;t I be able to mine bitcoins on AWS? What&#x27;s the point of paying to use people&#x27;s computers if I can&#x27;t use them for what I want? I pay AWS because I have money and they have servers and I want to pay them money in exchange for using their servers. So if I put a bitcoin miner on there running 24&#x2F;7, I might rack up a huge bill, but why should Amazon care as long as I have the cash?<p>I&#x27;m opposed to the idea that server usage should be morally vetted by the server owner. If something illegal is happening, by all means take it down, but &quot;what you are doing is legal, but we disagree with it so bye bye&quot; is a bad precedent, IMO.')
