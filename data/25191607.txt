Maybe you can evacuate in 90 seconds, if all of the &quot;passengers&quot; are skinny and athletic, and know what&#x27;s going to happen, and don&#x27;t have any extra stuff to try and grab, and there&#x27;s no fire or smoke, etc.<p>All that makes it a little hard to say what the real effect is. It would probably be a bit slower, but I bet with all of the optimizations for their 90 second test evacuations, the all-bed-plane could still evacuate faster than a plane-full of real passengers.<p>I guess there&#x27;s just nobody ambitions enough around to try something really new.')
