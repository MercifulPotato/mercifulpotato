The W3C gang tries, and they fail, because HTML is stronger and bigger than them. The Web is stronger and bigger than all of them combined.<p>Many have tried to contain it, to own it, to be the main one calling the shots, and HTML laughs in all their collective faces. All thanks to its basic concept of “be strict with yourself, and accepting with others.”<p>Mosaic was the first browser for which “best viewed with” buttons were used. They failed to own the Web. Then came Netscape, “Mosaic killa”, and they managed to kill Mosaic, but they failed to tame HTML, because HTML will not be owned. Netscape was destroyed by Microsoft-IE, who also wanted to tame and own HTML, and they also failed, because HTML is not ownable.<p>Then Firefox came and fucked up IE, and things were good for a while, Mozilla was a decent steward. Then Google came and took ownership of Mozilla, and together with Chrome they also tried to tame HTML. They will fail just like the others. HTML cannot be tamed or owned. The Web was built for freedom.<p>If you want composable, future-proof GUI, open up your notepad.exe and write this:<p>&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;Hello, World!&lt;&#x2F;title&gt;\n&lt;&#x2F;head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nThis is demonstration of proper composable, \nfuture-proof, accessible GUI.\n&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;\n&lt;form action=&quot;&#x2F;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;input type=text size=80 name=comment&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;input type=submit value=Go&gt;\n&lt;&#x2F;form&gt;\n&lt;&#x2F;body&gt;\n&lt;&#x2F;html&gt;\nThis GUI will work as expected and render in 25+ years worth of platform. And it could have been composed by a 10-year-old.')
