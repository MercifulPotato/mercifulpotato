I&#x27;m completely blown away by how audacious and bold the Starship project is. Sending a rocket that massive into space and then attempting to land it back on earth, with the intention of using it to eventually send people to Mars and back. Just thinking about how much force those thrusters must have been exerting to propel the ship and pull off that flip maneuver gives me chills. I can&#x27;t wait to see how fast they&#x27;ll take to build and send up the next one. Props to the people at SpaceX for getting this far!')
