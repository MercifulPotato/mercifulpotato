Most Microsoft products from Ballmer era are trying to do too much. VS Code is the prime example that you can produce a product with few features, people are going to use it and if you don&#x27;t commit the previous mistakes that poison the UX of Word and Windows you are going to succeed.  5 years ago if somebody told me that I am going to be using a Microsoft product more than Vim for programming and text editing I would have not believed.<p>Microsoft has the ability to innovate and produce amazing products it just they carry too much weight from the past and that holds back entire product lines.')
