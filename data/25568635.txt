If you&#x27;re stuck in jobs which use tech you don&#x27;t like, at some point you have to accept that said tech is here to stay and spend just your work time on it. It&#x27;s not a great choice, but jobs are like that more often than not.<p>- If, as you say, containerisation is a bad idea for most companies (I wouldn&#x27;t know - my company uses the &quot;boring&quot; way of deploying our services), you just need to point out how it&#x27;s hindering them.
