I&#x27;ve been driving at what seems like a sensible speed for the conditions and suddenly there is a deer right in front of my car. You cannot see some of the animals until you are right on top of them.<p>The fact is that there is too much traffic, there is insufficient infrastructure (and you probably can&#x27;t add a lot because you will spoil the place) and there are animals freely roaming around. It is recipe of animal deaths in that area.<p>I dunno what the answer is. Paying the police to put up another gatso van isn&#x27;t going to solve it though.')
