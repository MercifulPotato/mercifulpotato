The app is so badly designed. I browse through it, see something I&#x27;d like to watch and then find it&#x27;s actually available through a different service I have to pay to watch. The original content is pretty thin gruel and hard to find. It seems a serious misstep from the company that brought us the iTunes and App stores.')
