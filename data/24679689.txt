Just be sure to never feel pressured to do it at any one time - it&#x27;ll always be there.  When you do, just be sure you feel comfortable, not tense, and are in a good situation, among friends, and so on. &quot;, basically how to avoid bad trips.<p>Only did a handful of times, but every time was totally worth it, mind expanding, and enjoyable.  Definite thanks in no small part to the wisdom from a random stranger.')
