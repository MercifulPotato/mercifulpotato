Canadian taxes are similar, and public programs are good by global standards but not nearly as good as Finland (e.g. free healthcare, no free daycare, University education costs the equivalent of ~5k euros per year in Canada).<p>As a beginning developer I made the equivalent of ~3k euro&#x2F;month in Canada and worked my way up to 5k in 3 years.<p>With a bit of experience and luck one can then move to the US to make ~15k euro&#x2F;month and pay 30% lower tax rate, at the expense of basically all functioning public institutions :)')
