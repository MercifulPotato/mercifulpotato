My poodle is _incredibly_ touchy. Yeah there&#x27;s &#x2F;r&#x2F;petthedamndog but I&#x27;ve never seen a dog ham it up like her. Her first thing do do when we wake up is get up onto the bed, laying on us and staring at us. When she wants to be pet, she&#x27;ll first stare at you, then poke you with her paw till you pet her. If you still refuse, she&#x27;ll growl quietly. Then if you totally cold shoulder her (some people have to work!) she&#x27;ll let out a dramatic sigh and wander off. I&#x27;ve never met any nonhuman animal this driven for touch, though I&#x27;ve had cats and fancy rats and they seem to actively seek out cudding as well.')
