But it was nothing compared to the original 9 inch b&#x2F;w Mac&#x2F;Mac SE relative to other computers at the time. Also, I liked the no-fan &quot;toaster&quot; G4 with its iconic flat screen display very much (a friend of mine prolonged its life with an aftermarket CPU&#x2F;GPU upgrade kit) and remember the unpacking experience of my 15 inch G4 PowerBook, which got me excited like a child getting his first home computer, and generated that special smile on my face.')
