Sometimes I could get away with pulling an all-nighter on my phone.<p>Before I got into technology, it was books. I read for hours every day, and my parents complained that while reading was good, I was doing it in excess.<p>Once these limits relaxed, so did my desire to exceed them. Now I&#x27;ve moved out and live on my own, I find myself wanting to spend far less time on the computer.')
