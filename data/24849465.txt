Rclone or similar means that their client software need not be trusted. It&#x27;s up to whether you tolerate their business practices.<p>Business practices aside, the problem I <i>personally</i> have is: seeing how they are dishonest about their client security, how much can I trust that they’re honest about their durability or server-side security? Encrypting blocks myself ensures confidentiality, but how do I trust that data aren’t being silently lost or corrupted at rest? They hand-wave about how 11-9s durability doesn’t matter[0] in the same way they hand-wave about how zero-knowledge data privacy doesn’t matter, while simultaneously mentioning that they have, in fact, experienced unrecoverable data corruption in the past[1].<p>&gt; why did you not go with Rclone?<p>There’s a long tail of roll-your-own cloud backup tools like this that I didn’t really evaluate: Rclone, BorgBackup, restic, Duplicity, Tarsnap, etc. I just ran out of energy and really wanted to avoid something that required a bespoke setup. These tools might work for me, but they wouldn’t be something I could recommend to a non-technical user, and I’m not sure if any of them have daemons for performing continuous backup, so I’d have to figure out a separate solution for that which might be buggy.<p>In any case, it looks like rclone may have some of the same problems as Duplicacy and restic with using too much memory[2][3].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cloud-storage-durability&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cloud-storage-durability&#x2F;</a><p>[1] “If a cosmic ray has thrown a bit, we ask your computer to retransmit that particular file.
