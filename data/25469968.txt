In my experience, Intel have a significant performance advantage with their AES-NI implementation over AMD. I wonder what Ampere&#x27;s cores can do.<p>AMD in Zen1 had 2x AES-pipelines, allowing 2x 128-bit AES operations per clocktick.<p>Intel caught up later, and eventually also added 2x AES-pipelines of their own. But then AMD added 256-bit AES instructions to Zen3 (which are 128-bit x2 vectorized).<p>AVX512 does have 4x SIMD AES on AVX512 (4x128 bit wide), for 4x parallel AES computations per clock tick. But that&#x27;s not on consumer chips. I guess that&#x27;s the widest AES implementation right now however, but AMD isn&#x27;t that far behind in Zen3.<p>--------<p>If anything, I&#x27;d say AMD actually was beating Intel at the AES-benchmark at Zen1 (In year ~2017 or so), but Intel &#x2F; AMD have been trading blows with each other since then.')
