After that, bleh. At least in that case it sounds like executive meddling was the culprit.<p>On the other hand, The Expanse keeps opening whole new everythings that make what came before <i>tiny</i> but also essential. No second of plot is wasted. They could loosen it up a bit with a bottle episode or two to develop the characters more though. I could go any number of seasons if they could maintain the quality.<p>And then there&#x27;s the new Lost In Space. They&#x27;re going to end it in the next season at exactly the right time. Pacing-wise, it feels like a three-part miniseries. Just enough room to build a world and develop the characters without overstaying its welcome.')
