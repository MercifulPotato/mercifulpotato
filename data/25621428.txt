Item(by='kergonath', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609677558, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25621231, text='Yeah, Matplotlib is capable, but it’s heavy and verbose. It’s fine as an API, but the syntax gets in the way very quickly.<p>My use case is not a scratch pad with one plotting window; it’s dozens of windows with regressions and stuff. Each window is a completely different context; some of them are short lived and some of them are used for weeks. Using as many notebooks is very impractical. For example, seeing where one parameter is going in one calculations is trivial and quicker than starting a notebook and setting it up. Works transparently over ssh, too.<p>I am more or less fluent in Matplotlib, because I work with people who use it and I need to understand whatever the students are doing (and some of them use Python and some use R, which is a whole other discussion). I just dislike it and don’t use it much for my things. Ultimately, gnuplot’s syntax for regression and complex plots is much more concise.<p>I any case I think it’s good intellectual hygiene to use several tools regularly, lest you end up stuck in a way of thinking, so I encourage students to try others. It’s also good to have discussions about these things that don’t end up in holy wars; we need to be curious.')
