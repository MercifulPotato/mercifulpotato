Many viral capsids (and other biological molecules) have underlying symmetry. We frequently take advantage of that symmetry when processing tomograms to increase our effective signal and get better images.<p>This looks to be a very nice teaching tool for when I have to explain to someone about how we can use symmetry to our advantage.')
