That&#x27;s fine, they&#x27;re a business, they have to make money and not lose money.<p>What I don&#x27;t understand about the hardware industry is the extent to which they <i>actively restrict access to information on how their product works</i> unless you&#x27;re buying in volume. Why is it necessary to have layers of NDAs on a product datasheet? Many of the people who might write software to integrate with some hardware are not the people manufacturing high-volume products based on it! (See: Linux driver developers.)')
