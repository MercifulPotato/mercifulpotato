It took me a few tries to get into grad school after working a series of shitty jobs. Now that&#x27;ve finished my PhD (a mixture of computational fluidics and material dynamics), I&#x27;ve been trying to enter the job market in tech (close to family in the bay area) and it&#x27;s just not happening (like almost no interviews).<p>I guess it&#x27;s just managing expectations. Our local police department is hiring so I might give that a shot. It&#x27;s a bit of a blow to the ego but that doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>The one thing I regret was neglecting my relationships (fiancee left me, didn&#x27;t keep up with close friends&#x2F;family, even one that passed away) and hobbies for the sake of work during grad school. That&#x27;s something I won&#x27;t compromise again.')
