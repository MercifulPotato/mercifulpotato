If you can (a) ensure your loan has a &quot;all extra payments to principal, not interest&quot; loan and (b) overpay every single month as much as you can, even shaving 10 years off that time frame will net you a lot back in your pocket to invest and make money on it. Even an extra $100&#x2F;mo if that&#x27;s all you can manage - pay down that principal as fast as you can to reduce the <i>interest</i> owed on that principal.')
