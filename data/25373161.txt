Japanese audiences &quot;reverse importing&quot; discs sold in overseas markets.<p>Western markets may be &quot;a joke&quot; in terms of sales for exported Japanese-market anime, but it&#x27;s also essentially <i>free money</i> for the makers of that anime. ADV, Disney, and others wrote some fairly big checks to license series back in the day.<p>They produce a show for the Japanese market, and if they are lucky they can score some nice checks from overseas distribution for essentially no additional effort on their part.<p><pre><code>    They segment the markets by burning English subtitles into the actual video. \n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m sorry, but this is mistaken. I&#x27;ve been collecting this stuff for decades and was once a reviewer who got quite a few review copies from ADV and others.<p>Perhaps there have been a few specific examples I&#x27;m not aware of but I&#x27;ve never <i>once</i> seen this. Well, except for the VHS era when obviously soft subtitles were not an option.')
