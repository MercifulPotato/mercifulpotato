Item(by='flatdog', descendants=0, kids=None, score=4, time=1609319927, title='Ask HN: How to deal with feelings of being forced out of my research area?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='As the title suggests, I am an academic working in a field of computer science which is adjacent to machine learning and deep learning (Information Retrieval and Databases). Without going into too much detail, I&#x27;m at a top UK University, and have a continuing position (assistant professor).<p>More and more recently, I feel that I&#x27;m being forced out of my field. My papers which focus on very core topics in the aforementioned fields tend to get reviews which indicate that they are not SOTA and&#x2F;or are not of interest to the greater field. One particular work was described as an &quot;applied application paper&quot; even though it was on query planning (a very fundamental topic in the field).<p>Perhaps my work isn&#x27;t interesting, and maybe I am out of touch with the interests of the greater field.<p>However, it seems that most of the focus is currently on how massive language models can help the field, with very little work focusing on traditional aspects.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t find these deep learning techniques interesting, and I don&#x27;t think I should need to follow these areas just because they are hot. That said, it doesn&#x27;t seem like I&#x27;ll be able to continue doing the research I enjoy, as the field is no longer interested in it.<p>I am looking for advice on how to deal with these type of situations: have you ever felt that your interests&#x2F;skills are no longer useful, and how did you move past it?<p>I apologize for the vague question, but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m struggling to come to terms with, and it&#x27;s difficult to describe my feelings on the topic.')
