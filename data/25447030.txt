Gold doesnâ€™t. As Bitcoin becomes more popular, it becomes more expensive to transact as everyone bids up the transaction price. Many people with small balances in their wallet will see their entire wallet balance become illiquid because the fees will  be higher than their entire investment.<p>Eventually we could see institutions and brokerages being the main coin holders because if it costs $1000- $10000 per transaction, it only makes sense to do so in $500k+ transactions. Last time Bitcoin was $19000&#x2F;ea, it cost me $180 to move the coins from one wallet to another.')
