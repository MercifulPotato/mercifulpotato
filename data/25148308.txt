Does it allow you to jump over huge distances not normally designed for the purpose? Is it possible to exchange a little bit of your health and a rocket to fly off in the air in a carefully selected direction?<p>As to graphics, I don&#x27;t remember anybody playing Quake competitively and using stock graphics look and feel. I have been personally using software renderer with a ridiculous mipmap setting that caused all textures to go away except for entities. It caused all enemies and entities like health boxes to stand out and be much more visible &#x2F; targetable from long distances.')
