From memory, Bloomberg’s actual evidence was shaky at best. Does anyone know if they ever actually showed the motherboard they claimed to have to anyone for verification?<p>Apple made an official statement that the claims were, well, bullshit and that no such chips have ever been found.<p>Amazon published a signed statement from its chief security officer saying that the Bloomberg article was “so full of inaccuracies ... that they’re hard to count” and that after their own security team and an external security team had gone into the claims in detail they found them to be untrue.<p>So, I have to ask, does anyone know if Bloomberg actually published the evidence they claimed they would release?')
