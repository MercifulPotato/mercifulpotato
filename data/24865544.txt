We can only do what we can convince people to spend their time doing. The folks who work on the language just aren’t the same people who would implement a new LLVM backend. We would love mature Rust support on as many platforms as possible, but it’s non-trivial.<p>In this case, ARM stepped up themselves to help make this happen. If other vendors want to help us make Rust great on their platform, we’d love to have their support.')
