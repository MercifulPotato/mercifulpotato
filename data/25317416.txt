Many people trying their luck means also many people failing.<p>Pretty sure that a couple of dozen Billionaires do NOT cause homelessness.<p>&quot;Trickle down doesn&#x27;t work.&quot;<p>People living in New York are probably quite well off in general. A bunch of homeless people don&#x27;t contradict the trickle down effect. You yourself mentioned mental illness, addiction, and unforeseen events as major causes of homelessness. Notice how rising rents and high paying jobs are not on the list.<p>&quot;&gt; but also the jobs that make the rich people rich.<p>This is along the lines of saying &quot;stop being poor, just get one of those jobs that the rich people have&quot;.&quot;<p>Not at all, and this is becoming silly. All I said is that there are presumably the jobs that made the rich people rich, which will usually be a lot of jobs, because rich people will usually have sold a lot of things. Building lots of things requires many workers.<p>&quot;I would encourage you just read up on the subject instead of inventing theories that sound good to you.&quot;<p>If you are so well read, then provide some convincing evidence for your claims. None of the three links you provided tell us anything about the cause of homelessness. I noticed in the last one that California has very low youth homelessness, though.<p>Frankly, your &quot;well researched&quot; theories about homeless sound mostly like leftist anti capitalist propaganda to me.')
