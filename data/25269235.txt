For most startups, 99% of the value comes from the long right-tail of that 1% chance of explosive viral growth out of left-field.<p>You&#x27;re right, most companies aren&#x27;t ever going to need that kind of overnight scalability. But most of those startups will wind up failing anyway. At the end of the day, everyone&#x27;s betting that they&#x27;ll be the exception that makes it big. Without that possibility it&#x27;s not worth showing up at the table.<p>And <i>if</i> it does come, you need to be ready to move fast. Like, &quot;we hit the front-page of Reddit and we have 5 minutes to scale up our traffic by 5000%&quot; fast. If you take your time to collect some revenue and circle back, the ship has likely sailed.<p>I&#x27;m not saying thinking this way is sensible for every org. But it&#x27;s definitely sensible for at least some business models. In particular within the hyper-growth SV startup scene. Foregoing scalability because most startups don&#x27;t go viral, would be like an aspiring actor foregoing headshots because most auditions don&#x27;t get callbacks.')
