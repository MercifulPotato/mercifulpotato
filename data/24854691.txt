It would really help to orient yourself when you exit a station.<p>And before some smart-ass says it, it doesn&#x27;t help that Avenues and Streets are perpendicular because that still doesn&#x27;t tell N from S, or E from W. I always end up walking a block in the wrong direction just to orient myself.')
