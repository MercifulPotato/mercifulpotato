You&#x27;re an early employee at a company; by the time you choose to exercise, the company is presumably valued at a significantly greater amount than when you joined?<p>&gt; FB started in 2003 and went public in 2012. You could have joined in 2010 and your equity today would be in the seven figures.<p>Feel free to prove me wrong, but I have my doubts that you would receive anywhere near enough stock as a regular employee that late in the day to make it worth millions of dollars after IPO. Same with Stripe. (Note that appreciation in the value of Facebook stock between 2012 and 2020 doesn&#x27;t matter at all. Anyone could have bought Facebook stock in 2012 and seen those gains).')
