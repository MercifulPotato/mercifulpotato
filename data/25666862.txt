In what universe is the topic of discussion here about what&#x27;s popular?  If you willingly facilitate people with the intent to hurt and kill, the blood is also on your hands for failure to act.  This is about ethical duty.  Facebook is trying not to shirk this ethical duty.  The top-level comment believes they are misapplying and overreaching in their effort to do this.  Both my comment and the one it replies to <i>largely do not touch even this discussion</i>, their shtick is property rights and mine is substantive discourse.  If you think I made a point about censoring unpopular content, you replied to the wrong comment.<p>Secondly, your tone suggests you&#x27;d think I have an inconsistent worldview if I believe moderators should perform any moderation action at all?  You&#x27;ll have to explain how that makes sense to you, because moderators providing escalating warnings to users that post insubstantive and volatile comments is something that&#x27;s been with me for a long time and I&#x27;m rather fond of the practice.')
