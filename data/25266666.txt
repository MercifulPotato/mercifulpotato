The lengthy time to market acted as a positive change agent, working hand in glove with the minute attention to detail refining the product to market fit, building a moat of competency before debuting. Instead of cutting 90 minutes to 60 with a machine that only scraped down the surface, the prototype solved the customers&#x27; problem in a very comprehensive manner.<p>I love seeing these kinds of organic growth business stories as they illustrate grit&#x2F;perseverance, though that kind of business development is terribly out of fashion in the business press these days.')
