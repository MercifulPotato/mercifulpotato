You can fetishize minimalism and clarity to the point that it undermines your goal. But the content here is good. In TODO list form, I suggest anyone writing something think through:<p>1. Who are you writing to?<p>2. Why are you writing to them?<p>3. What do you want them to know?<p>4. What do they already know?<p>5. What style of writing is most effective for this audience and intention?<p>What remains is to use 5 to describe the difference between 4 and 3 in order to accomplish 2. The primary challenge is that 1 is often not a single person and the wider the audience you choose, the fuzzier all of the subsequent answers become. The single best thing you can do to become a stronger writer is to be courageous about selecting a narrow audience.')
