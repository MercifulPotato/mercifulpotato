I sure was. But apparently all your code and your AWS credentials are uploaded to their servers where it is built and deployed.<p>I’ve been having trouble with a deployment using a serverless-component, so I figured I&#x27;d load it up in the node debugger— thought I’d be able to step into the component itself and see what was going on.<p>But to my surprise I couldn’t actually debug it, because the component doesn’t actually exist on my computer…<p>Apparently the serverless cli is sending a request to a server, and the request seems to include everything serverless needs to build and deploy the actual service— which includes my AWS credentials.<p>Does anyone else find this a bit strange and concerning? I could see maybe if they made it clear that this was happening, but I&#x27;ve never seen anything in their docs or architecture that says things are built and deployed remotely.')
