That&#x27;s some major need for energy, which everyone else just blames on &quot;China&quot;.<p>I think they&#x27;re doing pretty well in comparison.<p>While I&#x27;m at it, I need to mention their one child policy basically stopped <i>hundreds of millions</i> people from ever existing. A whole lot of pollution that never happened. Something no other country has done, and I think China should have some recognition for that.')
