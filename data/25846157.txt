I think more emphasis should be put on the insane amounts abstractions underlying the high level language at hand when teaching programming. Explaining that 0-based indexing comes from offests seems like a good start in that direction for a kid learning python.<p>And when beginners won&#x27;t be beginners anymore they&#x27;l have to learn how the underlying abstractions work anyway. \nA programmer that doesn&#x27;t at least superficially understand how operating systems work is not going to be able to write performant or secure software, let alome combine those qualities.')
