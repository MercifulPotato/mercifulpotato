It&#x27;s not that complicated. It&#x27;s easy to &quot;win&quot; when no competition is allowed. You can argue that there&#x27;s CoffeeScript, etc, but every other language is still a second-class citizen in the web ecosystem. WebAssembly may change that once it&#x27;s stable and mature enough, though again, you have the problem that the DOM APIs were designed for JavaScript, which will create an impedance mismatch with other languages.')
