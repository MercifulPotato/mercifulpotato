You can&#x27;t have votes be your basis in how many people took the test ( I didn&#x27;t vote for example) and you can&#x27;t have the amount of 8&#x2F;10 comments be a metric for the sole count of people who scored that much. The numerical game can&#x27;t be played here because the information is too cloudy.<p>That being said, anecdotally a good number of people got 8&#x2F;10, 9&#x2F;10 and 10&#x2F;10 which anecdotally makes it likely to be statistically significant. Hard to say quantitatively but we can make a qualitative prediction here.')
