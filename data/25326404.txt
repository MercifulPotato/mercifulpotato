Then you say you take her side because Dean could have given her &quot;transparency&quot;? Are you aware she was demanding the identities of people who had criticised her work, presumably so she could then go and bully them too?<p>This person is a 100% A+ straightforward case of someone who <i>should</i> be fired and in fact should have been fired long ago. All those attributes are the sort of thing that absolutely qualify someone for dismissal. If you were feeling trollish, you might even say it&#x27;s black and white.')
