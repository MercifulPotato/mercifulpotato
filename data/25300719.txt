Fact: in large animals like humans, with long lifespans and low reproduction rates, evolution takes thousands of years to fixate any change in the population. That&#x27;s about the time <i>human civilization existed</i>. In those few thousand years, we went from primitive tools to germ theory, vaccines, rocketry, etc. (and most of interesting developments happened in the last few hundred years; we&#x27;re riding an exponent here).<p>Evolution for humans just <i>doesn&#x27;t matter</i>, because at this point, we&#x27;re doing meaningful changes to ourselves and our environment at a rate faster than it takes for a human to reach reproductive age. We didn&#x27;t wait for evolution to adapt us to colder climate, fix our eyesight or change melanin levels; we just developed clothes, glasses and sunscreen - which also made these features not influenceable by natural selection pressures. And whatever mutation happens that doesn&#x27;t kill a person, we work around it socially or technologically - which means its impact on reproductive fitness is usually close to zero. Biological evolution is no longer the force driving the shape of our species.<p>There is an evolution of humans happening, but it&#x27;s social and technological, not biological.')
