It would almost certainly cover countries that were unable to effectively subsidise their shutdowns. Having said that, it does intuitively make sense that the economic down turn would place additional stress on those most affected by it.<p>The lockdown, however, was not the source of the economic down turn, but rather the virus roaming about killing people was the cause. An effective lockdown, supported by government subsidies and contact tracing, has been proven to be beneficial to the economy. After the shutdown, consumers can roam about in the comfort of knowing that they have almost zero chance of contracting the virus. Australia and New Zealand are now so confident in their success that they can fill entire stadiums with people as though a vaccine had already arrived.')
