Item(by='tgb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604091627, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946201, text='But what deterministic order do you use? Any order seems problematic to me, once loops are involved. Certainly if you just pick a naive order like &quot;lowest entity ID runs first&quot;, then you end up with a lot of items not moving when they should, since the cell in front of them is still full even though it&#x27;ll empty later this tick.<p>And what would you do if you want the entirely full loop to not jam? It sounds possible, probably even simple, but I haven&#x27;t seen how. A solution to this problem is orthogonal to the points you&#x27;ve raised.')
