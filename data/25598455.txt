I was just saying that it&#x27;s not that far of a wild notion to wait to get a new number. Growing up, my family played the get a new unlisted number game, but it did not work until going without for an extended time. That was for a landline, so I skiped that story for one with a more modern version. There is something to the waiting for a period of time before just getting a new number.<p>The VoIP story was more of a seed planting for anyone else that might be reading and interested. Senior or milenial, doesn&#x27;t really matter to me who it might be that might want to to give it a shot. Plus, seniors tend to have family members that could help them set something like this up. Don&#x27;t write those seniors off so lightly')
