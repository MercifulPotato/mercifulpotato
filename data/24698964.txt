They didn&#x27;t have any use for them, so they sold them. I suppose they could have just sat on them and refused to sell.<p>There are valid criticisms around the environmental cost of building electric vehicles. There are also valid criticisms of the regulatory environment that Tesla operates in. I&#x27;m not convinced, though, that it makes sense to expect Tesla to refuse to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of unneeded credits out of principle.')
