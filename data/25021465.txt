May be harder for some businesses, but they will all do a cost-benefit analysis of raising median wages in SF, paying the tax or moving the SF jobs somewhere else?<p>I think you can&#x27;t pay the executive less... the executives that land in this level of pay are paid based on what they could get at another company (that is not based in SF... there are not really cost-of-living adjustments at this level...), speaking generally and in broad strokes. So you shouldn&#x27;t see any changes to the top end of the equation (which isn&#x27;t want they are going for... they are going for raising the less paid workers&#x27; wages, so they did that right.)')
