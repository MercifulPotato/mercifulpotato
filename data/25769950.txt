A transmeta box seems probably a bit old, but relatively few people have gigabit internet. If you wanted that box to do wifi too, that might be problematic; but I generally use wireless routers configured in access point mode to be access points. In access point mode, as long as the networking hardware and drivers are decent, you get fine performance; you don&#x27;t need great NAT acceleration or properly managed memory for state tables on the wireless devices, since that&#x27;s managed on the router&#x2F;firewall&#x2F;could be a home server too.')
