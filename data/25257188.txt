The definition of inflation that an individual cares about is &quot;the rise in prices of the goods that I want to buy&quot;.  Asset purchases, housing, and food are my biggest expenses.  YMMV.<p>I gave some examples of consumer goods inflating in my post - restaurant meals are up about 40%, housing up about 18%, groceries have also been up about 20% since the pandemic started.  Also have friends that own or work in non-tech businesses (one owns a packaging factory, another sells hot tubs) that say that supply chains are in shambles and all of their producer prices are going up, significantly.  You&#x27;ll see that in consumer prices eventually, but it takes time to work its way through the economy.')
