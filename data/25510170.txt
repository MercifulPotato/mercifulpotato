The low-end to mid-tier ones that we are used to in our devices are subsidised. Just like they cut the price of meat and bread to below cost to get you into the supermarket.<p>So it’s not a linear price scale because it is distorted at the lower end. There is no motivation for our benefactors to subsidise cameras beyond a certain quality so once you go beyond that you are paying full whack and the economics fall apart.<p>This principle applies pretty much right across the smart tech ecosystem.<p>The nice thing is though, that the stuff they are using to subsidise the expensive stuff is dirt cheap so if you’ve a little bit of smarts you can build your own gear for about a 10th of the price, but you will have to sacrifice some of the doo-dahs and bells and whistles but if what you’re going for is something that’s purely functional you will be fine. Use the money saved to buy an expensive streaming cam set up. Do the subsidising yourself.')
