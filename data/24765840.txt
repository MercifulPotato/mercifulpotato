I dont like using the term &quot;genetically modified&quot; because, well, everything is genetically modified, thats how agriculture works. Bioengineering narrows down what&#x27;s being discussed to genetic modifications using synthetic biology tools from the field of bioengineering. Even more specific would be to say they aren&#x27;t transgenic plants. Were getting to the weird point now where you can use synthetic biological tools like crisper to change the DNA sequence of a plant, but because you aren&#x27;t introducing a new genetic sequence, the resulting plant isn&#x27;t considered a &quot;GMO&quot; because the legal definition is more concerned about transgenic sequences than the use of bioengineering tools. These are all just really vague and highly politicized terms.')
