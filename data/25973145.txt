Item(by='Nullabillity', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612041854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25971403, text='&gt; but in reality it&#x27;s easy to verify that archive.is&#x27;s nameservers are returning different IP addresses depending on the network you&#x27;re coming in from.<p>Yes, this is the whole point of (this part of) EDNS. It allows you to direct the traffic to a server close to the end user (geographically or based on peering preferences).<p>&gt; This is clearly broken on their end.<p>There are two broken things here:<p>1. Cloudflare doesn&#x27;t send the source IP with the DNS request<p>2. Archive.is would rather not respond to broken requests at all than make a best-effort with a degraded experience<p>Considering that Cloudflare is pretty much the <i>only</i> public DNS server with this problem, and the only motivation seems to be that it competes with their CDN product, I&#x27;m far more sympathetic to Archive.is than to Cloudflare.<p>&gt; Cloudflare literally can&#x27;t fix this. archive.is is 100% responsible.<p>Only Cloudflare can fix this properly. Archive.is can work around it (at the cost of degraded performance), but I can understand why they would want to stand their ground.')
