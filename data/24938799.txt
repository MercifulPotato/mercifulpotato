(something about telomerase, but I probably shouldn&#x27;t mention that because my memory about that is foggy)<p>If you increased the amount of fasting, I&#x27;d bet good money that people would lose more weight than on a calorie-equivalent diet.  Intermittent fasting, in my experience, is helpful in <i>sticking to</i> a diet that is lower in calories because it allows you to eat satisfying meals.')
