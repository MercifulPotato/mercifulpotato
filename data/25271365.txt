About a month ago, they instituted a new policy:<p>You can&#x27;t say no to overtime if you&#x27;re asked, or you&#x27;ll incur a write-up. Three write-ups and you&#x27;re terminated.<p>And because of Texas labor laws, an hours over 60 are not paid at double time as they are in many other states. Meaning by the time Saturday rolls around, were she in California, she&#x27;d at least be making double time at some point. Instead, they only get double time on a Sunday.<p>She told me last week, she had 82 hours. For a job that pays $16 an hour. Yes, she&#x27;s probably clearing $4000 a month, but she&#x27;s putting in CEO-level hours to do so. The saddest part about all this is that many people are jumping for the chance at these positions because of the insane amount of overtime this company is offering.<p>The United States should be better than this.')
