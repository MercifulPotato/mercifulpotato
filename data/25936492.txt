With WebRTC I can exchange a Offer&#x2F;Answer and then have a bi-directional media session. I appreciate that these lower level APIs help companies that need the flexibility. I worry that the complexity will lock out Open Source and smaller companies. Smaller companies are going to have to figure out things took years to solve with WebRTC. Stuff like<p>* Congestion Control&#x2F;Error Correction trade-offs and Latency<p>* Simulcast<p>* Re-negotation<p>* Rollbacks<p>* Capability Negotation<p>I was always a big fan of ORTC. Give flexibility to the power users, but give an even playing field to small players.<p>&gt; RTP over WebTransport datagrams<p>I don&#x27;t feel strongly about QUIC vs S(RTP). WebTransport doesn&#x27;t force RTP, so it doesn&#x27;t help unless I control everything. Bridging will get a lot harder. Right now it is nice that Reports&#x2F;NACKs&#x2F;etc.. can cross protocols.')
