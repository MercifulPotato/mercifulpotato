Item(by='ChuckMcM', descendants=None, kids=[24913950, 24913418], score=None, time=1603841500, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24913219, text='This is where I believe the author goes astray: <i>&quot;Despite TSMC claiming a 1.8x shrink for N5, Apple only achieves a 1.49x shrink.&quot;</i><p>TSMC does <i>NOT</i> say they have a 1.8x shrink for N5, they say for LOGIC you can get that, but for SRAM and Analog the results are 1.35x and 1.2x. Had they summed that together for a &quot;typical SOC&quot;, which they also discuss (and one presumes that Apple makes typical SOCs) then the &quot;theoretical&quot; shrink is 1.57x for SoCs.<p>The challenge is that whereas at one time the node size was that of a &quot;gate&quot; (which could be 4 transistors), in a marketing race for smaller numbers fabs started emphasizing &quot;feature&quot; size.<p>Because of this change, the &quot;theoretical shrink&quot; is a function of what kinds of circuits you&#x27;re putting down. Pure logic? You get one number, two gates connected together for a flip-flop, you get another number, a voltage regulator, or ADC filter, you get another number.<p>So doing the analysis the author claims to do, can ONLY be done if you know what percentage of the part you are making on the new process is what. I am under the impression that they missed that.')
