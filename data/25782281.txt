I&#x27;ve looked at some of the early-stage logistics and sources of pre-seed funding, but the information is contradictory and not well organized. I was wondering if the community here has any good resources and pointers, e.g. typical approaches to pre-seed funding conversations and valuations, company setup and other funding options, and so on. I have a few exploratory VC conversations lined up, and I think I&#x27;m lacking in resources to make the best decisions at this point. Any help would be appreciated.')
