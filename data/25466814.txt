Background: phd in computational statistics. I’ve used a lot of Python and a bit of Julia.<p>I’ve recently started using JAX and I’m really into it! It’s really fast even on my laptop (cpu) and can run even faster on GPU.\nI’m now using jax even for random scripts as well as I prefer the random number generator to numpy’s one. This is because you pass the random keys explicitly to all random functions so everything is reproducible.<p>I really like programming side the research; especially trying to get algorithms to be fast! So Jax is really great for that')
