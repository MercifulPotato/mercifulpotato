Way less complex than k8s.  We deploy Prometheus out of your list.  We use NGINX, not Traefik.  PG is deployed but not under Nomad, mostly just from laziness.<p>We run a local instance of send.firefox.com, redis, metabase, docker registry, a speedtest tool, a bunch of batch&#x2F;periodic jobs, some internal custom services, all of our web hosting, etc directly out of nomad.<p>Our CI&#x2F;CD runs make which builds the code, generates .nomad files and runs them, so it&#x27;s super easy to re-deploy, rollback, etc.<p>k8s management on your own hardware is a full-time job. There are 2 of us that do all dev and ops for our product and there is 0% chance we could manage a k8s cluster w&#x2F; only 2 of us, but managing a nomad, consul and vault cluster is easy for us.<p>There are nomad templating tools, but we started using nomad back when it was brand new, so we just used sed for our meagre templating needs. Works a treat, and never saw any value to using some specialized tool(for our needs).<p>Totally recommend checking out nomad.')
