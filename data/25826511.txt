Prior to that, we&#x27;d of course hemmed and hawed and <i>verbalized</i> the fuzziness of our estimates... but only the final decided-on not-super-pessimistic number was written down, and decisions were made based on those.  <i>That</i> was a major source of our estimating problems.<p>Everyone wants estimates.  For decent reasons.  But until we&#x27;ve done a similar thing before, they&#x27;re utter fabrication.  We can take a semi-educated guess, but we <i>know</i> they&#x27;re still guesses... so for things we don&#x27;t have concrete answers for, we give small&#x2F;medium&#x2F;large&#x2F;extreme markers for how uncertain we are.<p>It&#x27;s fine to take on a big unknown or two.  You might even get them both done in a half.  But they better be worth it (or you have to decide when to cut your losses), because completing those two <i>could</i> consume <i>all</i> of your resources... and if that happens and you didn&#x27;t commit everyone to it up-front, you won&#x27;t get it done this half.  Making that tradeoff more explicit managed to get us signed up for fewer low-impact-but-highly-uncertain projects that would inevitably balloon out of control but never be cut.')
