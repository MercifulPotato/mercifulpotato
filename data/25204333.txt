It doesn&#x27;t matter if they aren&#x27;t always accurate. Replacing them with a static &quot;processing&quot; message would absolutely increase user confusion and dissatisfaction with loading times.<p>A while ago we put in a lot of engineering effort to build a good progress system for a heavy, multi-step background task to show to our users, and the overwhelming feedback was - &quot;it always gets stuck on a certain percent&quot;, &quot;it is too slow&quot; and &quot;it is unreliable&quot;. After feedback from design we hard-coded it to a steadily increasing bar regardless of actual progress, and the complaints all stopped immediately.')
