ThinkPad, Apple, or some of Dell&#x27;s premium lines won&#x27;t break with life. This translates into:<p>- Mechanical build quality<p>- Choice of auxiliary components (wifi camera+chipset, etc.). If you&#x27;re at a conference, you want to get connected and hook up to a projector reliably.<p>- Battery life<p>- Cooling<p>- Keyboard&#x2F;pointer quality<p>- Size&#x2F;weight<p>And so on. If you fly with a laptop once a week, whether the screws fall out from plane vibrations makes a difference.<p>One bad business trip, and you&#x27;ve covered the price delta of a half-dozen laptops. I&#x27;d never buy an over-speced, under-built laptop like the G5 SE. If my laptop is 15% slower, I care a lot less than if it&#x27;s 15% more reliable.')
