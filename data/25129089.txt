The article only posits that the USPS data may miss some people who moved and didn&#x27;t change their address officially, but it also likely misses people who officially changed their address because they planned to be away for an extended period (6 months or more) but will still return permanently in the future.<p>The plural of anecdote is not data, but for what it&#x27;s worth I personally know of more people in the second bucket than the first. Time will tell, of course.')
