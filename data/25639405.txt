The points made by the OP are exactly the opposite. I believe the language itself is redeemable, but it&#x27;s the implementations of many features that are just so faulty.<p>To take your example, yes it&#x27;s great that it makes UTF-8 as the primary encoding for strings, but then the implementation in the core and in the ecosystem completely fails in enforcing or honoring that.<p>Edit: please see the filename example in the post to see the failure around adhering to UTF-8.')
