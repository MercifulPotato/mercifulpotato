Item(by='01100011', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608001675, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25423859, text='As someone who is kicking himself every day for turning down a job with Roku a while back...<p>I think the impression is that Roku has built a durable brand and will continue to capitalize on it going forward.  Roku has not generated much profit yet, but AFAICT their expenditures are low and they can scale quite well.  They are part device mfg and part advertising company, and we all know the market loves ad companies(Facebook, Google, etc).<p>As a cynical embedded guy who has worked in settop boxes for the last 20 years, I see them as having easily replaceable tech and facing stiff competition from Amazon, Google and Apple(along with unforeseen foreign competitors) in the future.  I specifically avoided them because I thought they were a flash in the pan(well, it was also a brogrammer shop and I wanted to avoid that).<p>I think they&#x27;ve proven themselves to have some staying power, but I think their current valuation, like a lot of the market, is just flat out silly.')
