They also sell on Takeaway.com. But if you order through that - like I initially did - they&#x27;ll give you a small business card that says &quot;Did you know that our prices on Takeaway.com are 15% higher to compensate for the fees that they charge us?&quot; And on the back of the business card is their URL for ordering and their own phone number. I now always order directly from them and the service is insanely better than the best I ever got from Takeaway.com. Their long-term delivery employees will actually remember how to find my house on the 1st try while the Pizza is still hot. I&#x27;ve never ever had a &lt;30 minute delivery from Takeaway.com. But those pizza guys reliably hit 20 minutes if I order directly from them.<p>So yes, the restaurant that I know that does best on online delivery platforms is the one that treats it like an expensive advertisement channel and that funnels customers off the platform as fast as they can.<p>DoorDash&#x27;s biggest risk is that one of their &quot;partners&quot; might become successful enough to leave.')
