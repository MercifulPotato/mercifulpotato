There are some uses where it may or may not be gender neutral (&quot;you are a Spammier man than I&quot; - may refer to a man or a woman, but it is probably used because the author is male; a woman might have written &quot;a Spammier woman than I&quot; instead, while also addressing both men and women).<p>There are also clear cases where &quot;a man&quot; is used to refer to &quot;a human&quot;, such as &quot;wheat growing taller than a man&quot;.<p>Rather more interestingly, if you instead search for &quot;men&quot;, you&#x27;ll see that is used essentially exclusively to mean &quot;adult males&quot;. The only exceptions I found was &quot;and because the greed of a few men is such that they think it is necessary that they own everything&quot; and even there I&#x27;m not sure.')
