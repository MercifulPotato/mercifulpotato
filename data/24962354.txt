I mean, you’re right, I just want to place some limits on how right you are.<p>1. Folks totally run JS and other crazy on small CPUs.<p>2. Other safe languages (rust and swift I think?) also use overflow checks. It’s probably a good thing if those languages get used more on small cpus.<p>3. The C code that normally runs on small cpus is hella vulnerable today and probably for a long time to come. Compiling with sanitizer flags that turn on overflow checks is a valuable (and oft requested) mitigation. So theres a future where most arithmetic is checked on all cpus and with all languages.<p>And yeah, it’s true that the overflow check is well predicted. And yeah, it’s true that what arm and x86 do here isn’t the best thing ever, just better than risc-v.')
