It doesn&#x27;t have the speed other craft do, though it was somewhat underestimated just how many hits it&#x27;d take. All of those redundancies and protections are designed to protect the pilot and save the aircraft. However, an A-10 doesn&#x27;t have to be shot down in order to be considered a &quot;mission loss&quot;, which is what would happen. A damaged aircraft is no longer mission effective, as the pilot is now focusing everything on keeping it airworthy and getting it back to base. So as one of the other posters indicated, while many wern&#x27;t a total lost, many were damaged, and either had to abort or cut short their mission as a result. From a sortie effectiveness perspective, that&#x27;s the same result as a downed plane.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baloogancampaign.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;02&#x2F;10-future-us-close-air-support&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baloogancampaign.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;02&#x2F;10-future-us-close-a...</a>')
