It will either (a.) be complete gibberish to the reader without any context and they may just give up, or worse, (b.) they think they&#x27;ll understand something without the proper context and spew nonsense in regards to that philosopher (this is why there are so many bad readings of Nietzsche).&quot;</i><p>This is why you&#x27;ll want to read those primary sources as part of a class, instead of just trying to go it alone.<p>But even that won&#x27;t save you from &quot;bad readings&quot; of Nietzsche or any other philosopher, as plenty of experts disagree on what he meant.  He, like some other philosophers, just wrote in a way that doesn&#x27;t have one obvious meaning that everyone can agree on.  With experience and study, you can make up your own mind, which will be better than swallowing some other person&#x27;s pre-digested interpretation of him.<p>You might have an easier time understanding a secondary source&#x27;s interpretation of Nietzsche, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that you understand Nietzsche.')
