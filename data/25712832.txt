I can&#x27;t just make something up about someone in a book. There are also laws I can&#x27;t break about inciting violence. Etctera.<p>I don&#x27;t see this as much about the individual&#x27;s right to free speech as about the platform&#x27;s ability to monetise published content, which is what Twitter and Facebook are doing. When you view things through this prism, I think it&#x27;s simpler.<p>Either the platforms conform to the law as a book publisher must, which makes it hard for a real-time _broadcast_ platform to exist, or the platform does not exist at all.<p>This exposes the social media platforms as another instance of the same pattern as Uber or Airbnb, in that they are publishing platforms that simply ignore the law.<p>Before you shoot me down here: I agree that being able to share with your friends is not the same as publishing. It&#x27;s the features that turn the medium from sharing with friends into a broadcast medium that have made the social media companies (reckless) publishers.<p>I&#x27;d like to see an end to the broadcast features, as companies are unlikely to change.')
