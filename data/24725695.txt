APIs are code definitions just as are interfaces, custom types, classes, and so forth.<p>I don’t think APIs should be treated differently than other code only because you need it to be so for your convenience. If APIs should be treated differently they need to be defined separately and licensed differently. Other languages and platforms makes this very clear by externalizing most APIs from the language and then adding support for the API to the language as though it is a foreign technology, because it’s definition and license are separate.')
