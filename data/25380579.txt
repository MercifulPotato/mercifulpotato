App stores would still be able to compete on prices and payment methods.<p>I suppose that all apps would still have to be approved by Apple, though, otherwise an app creator could just hide something that Apple objects to in their app somewhere, causing it to be disallowed from Apple&#x27;s App Store but allowed in third party ones.')
