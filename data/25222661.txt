Item(by='PeterisP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606416999, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25221024, text='There are approaches that would draw a distinction between the parts of your mind that are under your conscious control, and the other parts of your mind (which would likely include gut etc as described in this article but also a big part of &quot;the mind-meat between your ears&quot;) which influence a lot of your behavior and decision making, clearly are part of the &quot;whole you&quot; but are not part of the &quot;conscious-you&quot;.<p>I.e. the thesis of such approaches (or at least some of them) is that if you define &quot;you&quot; narrowly as the things exposed to and controlled by your consciousness, then &quot;that you&quot; does not include a lot of your behavior and there is a bunch &quot;decision-making hardware and software&quot; both in your brain and your gut that is less &quot;you&quot; (for that definition&#x2F;understanding of &quot;you&quot;).<p>I can recommend a pop-sci overview of some of these ideas in a book by R. Kurzban &quot;Why Everyone (Else) Is a Hypocrite: Evolution and the Modular Mind&quot; - there&#x27;s a bunch of speculation, and we don&#x27;t have a consensus on many (most) consciousness-related things, but it raises some interesting ideas that seem reasonable from that perspective.')
