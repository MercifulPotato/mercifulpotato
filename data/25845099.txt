In this mode we have to keep the interpreter IR graphs (blueprints) around for partial evaluation.<p>With the first Futamura projection: Partial evaluator + interpreter + user code.<p>There&#x27;s active work on implementing the second Futamura projection, where you partial evaluate the partial evaluator with respect to the interpreter,\ngenerating a specialized partial evaluator for that interpreter.\nWith the second Futamura projection: (Specialized partial evaluator + interpreter) + user code.<p>This is truly fascinating and beautiful and the fact that it works for Java and not just a toy academic prototype is mind-blowing.')
