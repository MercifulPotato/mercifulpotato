They failed to moderate - but I mean, so has Facebook? So has the comment section of my old blog from 2001?<p>What does Facebook have to do with the current discussion?  Facebook isn&#x27;t hosted on Amazon.<p>&gt;Taken one step further, what is the difference between Parlor and AWS in this case - technically speaking, the calls for violence were on AWS&#x27;s platform after all...<p>I guess I don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re getting at.  It was indeed on AWS&#x27;s platform.  As part of hosting content on AWS you agree to not allow content calling for violence against others.  They failed to moderate their users, so Amazon is moderating them.')
