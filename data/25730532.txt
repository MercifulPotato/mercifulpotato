Item(by='AnIdiotOnTheNet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610380294, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25729722, text='&gt; I would like to see more transparency and sortition applied to government.<p>I agree.<p>&gt;  Itâ€™s probably impossible to do away with the career politicians since they are specialists<p>Again I must emphasize that it is not the <i>career</i> part of this that is the problem. The only alternative that doesn&#x27;t involve career politicians is electing amateur ones who have no experience navigating the political landscape.<p>&gt;  I think we should do more to keep them accountable like selecting a group of people whose task is to both directly observe and petition elected officials.<p>I could envision a system like that that I could support but there&#x27;d be a lot of complications to work out. We should probably have something like that for police too.<p>&gt; Basically solving the problem of politicians being so far removed from the people by bringing a sample of the people to the politician<p>This I just find kinda funny, since that&#x27;s already how it works. You can get a meeting with your senator or congressman directly, though it isn&#x27;t easy. Talking to one of their staff is pretty doable. Letters and phone calls are low-effort, but of course they also count for a lot less. The term &quot;special interest groups&quot; gets bandied about frequently in derogatory fashion, and while it does include corporate lobbyists it also covers hobby clubs, activist groups of various kinds, and trade unions, all of which make their cases to senators and congressmen on behalf of their members (which may include you). And of course your locally elected officials also meet with them about their concerns.')
