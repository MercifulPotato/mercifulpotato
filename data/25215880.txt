He has a lot of numbers to back his claim up.<p>I think we have invested a lot of time and energy in social solutions rather than technical solutions compare to the mid-20th century. The biggest example of this is the worldwide adoption of English as a lingua franca. It&#x27;s not high tech for sure, but it&#x27;s a sea change in human civilization that has had many positive effects for hundreds of millions of people, and that number will only grow.<p>Now does this effort conflict with science and technology? I don&#x27;t know, but it seems like since the 1960s we have focused more of our efforts on global convergence rather than pushing frontiers.')
