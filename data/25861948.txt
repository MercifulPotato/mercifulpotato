Item(by='drtillberg', descendants=None, kids=[25862020], score=None, time=1611252386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25861207, text='&gt;The real satoshi is probably Paul Le Roux, and currently in federal prison.<p>That conjecture makes a huge amount of sense based on circumstantial factors but most importantly, business purpose.  The gentleman you identified was (when BTC was released) running an international unconventional business with money-logistics issues.  As we see now, BTC&#x27;s primary use case is facilitating international financial logistics for criminal transactions-- the use case for BTC always stayed close to home!  Assuming the conjecture is correct BTC performs exactly the real-world role it was designed to perform.<p>As for the paper, let me get this straight-- the group that publishes the software that establishes what BTC <i>is</i> now has taken the position that whoever Satoshi is or was can claim copyright and take down core BTC IP no matter how licensed?!  Yeah, that can&#x27;t be very reassuring to a multi-million dollar industry based on IP collected and distributed by Bitcoin Core, i.e., the entire bitcoin ecosystem.')
