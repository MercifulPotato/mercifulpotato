With the advantage that if you ever get confused about what&#x27;s happening you can break the lens down into what it&#x27;s &quot;really&quot; doing and reason about that, in a way that you just can&#x27;t with language-level mutation.<p>Syntax shortcuts are good when they&#x27;re built on a rigorous foundation. But if you build a shortcut directly into the language, you&#x27;ll never be able to retrofit a reasonable model for how it works.')
