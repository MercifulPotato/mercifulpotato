Who is this guy and why is everyone so mad at him about making his living in ad tech..?<p>Him being in ads doesn&#x27;t change the validity of the points he&#x27;s making. Websites have to make money somehow. If you don&#x27;t pay for a subscription, and don&#x27;t allow the ads to run, why should you still feel entitled to consume their content?<p>To be super clear: I&#x27;m in the ad-blocker camp, but I don&#x27;t think we can really pretend that it&#x27;s somehow justified. Ads annoy the bejesus out of me, I&#x27;m not willing to pay for a million little one-off subscriptions, there&#x27;s this lovely back door that gives me all the content with no ads, so, me being of low moral fiber, goes the adblocking route.')
