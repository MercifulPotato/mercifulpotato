I used to receive phone calls and mails from Nissan Connect enticing me into subscribing for different bundles at roughly 20$ a month. I did not want their entertainment. I was ready to pay for live traffic updates only. That was not an option.\nThough this project will not let me display live traffic updates it enables custom software running on a headunit. I hope other projects will spring into existence.\nI will be making a trip for USB-ethernet dongle. Thank you for posting it here.')
