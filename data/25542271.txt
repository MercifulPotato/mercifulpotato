Does same principles also hold while rendering the movie? The 80&#x2F;20 rule will be harder to maintain because assets can change frequently and unexpectedly during production. But I guess the need for the data to geographically replicated, with fast and easy access, remains (especially during these remote times). During those times, is s3 a still good enough choice or do you want something more robust so your rendering process is not bottlenecked by io.')
