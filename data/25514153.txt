Item(by='csande17', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608695133, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25511322, text='&gt; GDI+ is just way too slow (calculating text bounds is ~10 times slower than in V), and Apple&#x27;s drawing API is not very nice to use, and it&#x27;s also 2-3 times slower at rendering text.<p>Does V&#x27;s text library support the kinds of shaping and nested bidirectional layout needed to render Arabic text? I&#x27;ve heard that&#x27;s a cause of a lot of complexity and slowness in text rendering, so stripping it out would be an easy performance win for people like me who can&#x27;t read Arabic anyway.')
