Yet, I&#x27;m often mocked by my colleagues for that reason.  I tried GLFW but I don&#x27;t see the point of this library whose main raison d&#x27;Ãªtre seems to be &quot;not be freeglut&quot; while having nearly identical features.  Besides, the fact that it works with keycodes and not with letters is a bit annoying.  The X server sends the key symbols but GLFW choses to ignore them, forcing the user to find them according to the current, difficult to find, keyboard configuration.')
