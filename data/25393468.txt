With seroprevalence data suggesting a ratio of actual cases to deaths in the vicinity of 0.25%, and the ratio of confirmed cases to deaths at more like 2%, that suggests that for every confirmed case, there is something like 5-10 actual cases (some of which are asymptomatic or mild, of course).<p>It does cause one to wonder if we should try to concentrate the vaccine doses on the people who haven&#x27;t already had it, so as to save the most lives with the limited supply available.  Sure, it may be possible to catch it twice in a few cases, but the rate of that is far, far less than the rate of catching it if you _haven&#x27;t_ already had it.')
