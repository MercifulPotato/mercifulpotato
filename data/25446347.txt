Item(by='istorical', descendants=None, kids=[25455000], score=None, time=1608143556, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25445997, text='I have to simultaneously agree with you (and even go further and state that the existence of 3-degree-of-freedom devices like Samsung GearVR which was cheap enough to be passed out and demo&#x27;d everywhere) really gave people terrible first experiences, both in terms of giving them low expectations in terms of motion sickness and also resolution.<p>But the reason it&#x27;s really bittersweet is you _don&#x27;t_ have to get motion sick in VR, if you just try experiences that don&#x27;t take control of your in-game&#x2F;in-experience &quot;camera&quot; and move it without any input from your physical head. In other words, as long as the camera in-game only corresponds 1 to 1 to your real life head movements, there is no motion sickness for the vast vast majority of users. I&#x27;ve given tons of demos and beat saber won&#x27;t make new users sick. Superhot won&#x27;t make new users sick. Echo VR, Skyrim VR, anything that doesn&#x27;t map head movement -&gt; camera movement 1:1 has a 75% chance of making a new user sick, whether immediately and badly or after a medium duration experience and mildy.<p>But people who are early adopters and have overcome the hump of nausea and forgotten how it feels continue to expose new users to poorly chosen first experiences with joystick movement or even worse - just straight up camera movement entirely unmapped to user input. That and naive users not realizing they need to limit their first experiences to non-joystick locomotion experiences.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like if everyone who tried alcohol for the first time took 10 shots of vodka and then span in circles for 10 minutes straight instead of sipping an alcopop or a beginner wine or beer.<p>There are also hardware solutions like vibrating motors you place on your wrists (or neck&#x2F;near-the-ear?) that could help as well.<p>And vignetting and tunneling approaches to keep a fixed frame of reference in the users field of view for those that are advanced enough to begin with joystick movement.<p>But anyway, in 2020 the most compelling use-case is still porn. And laughably, many people who may have tried VR porn in 2016 or who only viewed free&#x2F;old&#x2F;poorly-made files have also had that well poisoned for themselves as well, while newer, higher quality VR film (and porn) is incredibly more realistic and immersive than early attempts or that which you could find on pornhub.')
