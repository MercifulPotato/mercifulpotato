They want things to &quot;just work&quot; and to get their tasks done. If that&#x27;s within some restrictive paid app they don&#x27;t care, Apple device owners aren&#x27;t penny pinchers.<p>Seriously,who are the Apple users that are shocked by more and more locking down, less repairability, fewer ports and cross-brand compatibility etc? Anyone who cares about that stuff in my environment is already on Linux on desktop and Android on mobile.<p>Apple has its own universe and its fans like it that way. Software and hardware tightly coupled and designed together, apps highly vetted and filtered in a walled garden, compatibility among Apple devices is ensured, you can do fewer things and are kept between guardrails but are less likely to screw something up or run into bugs and untested territory etc. Seems like there&#x27;s a market for this. The problem is when people have the wrong expectations and don&#x27;t use existing alternatives that are better suited to their preferences.')
