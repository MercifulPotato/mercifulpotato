I think so.<p>Alternatively is it an echo chamber of high status people signalling just how contrarian they are? I suspect that some trend victims do this. However I think Sam Altman is just reflecting his thoughts in an essay to help him explore his own understanding, by getting feedback from others.<p>I believe there is something of real value within the trend: I have seen too many <i>extremely</i> successful people (in business, science and the arts) that have said they relied upon contrarian thinking to help them achieve success. I recognised the belief first in a 1998 book by George Soros, where he vividly wrote of his struggles (internal and external) with his own contrarian thinking.<p>My favourite example however is Jim Keller, in an interview by Lex Friedman, where Jim casually states “Imagine 99% of your thought process is protecting your self conceptions and 98% of that&#x27;s wrong.  Now you&#x27;ve got the math right. How do you think you&#x27;re feeling when you into that one bit that&#x27;s useful and now you&#x27;re open and you have the ability to do something that&#x27;s different?”.<p>When some of the undeniably smartest people in the world start saying the same thing, it is worthwhile listening and learning from them. While avoiding the famous wrong-thinking like Linus Pauling.')
