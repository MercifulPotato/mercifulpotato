Japan, for instance, appears culturally homogenous only until you compare culture across economic classes; only a very shallow definition of diversity would fail to capture this.<p>In fact, that&#x27;s true for many societies. The quirk of america is that we&#x27;ve internalized the diversity of the working class as uniquely american, class be damned, even if that&#x27;s trivially a false characterization of the upper class. American media is not careful about how they use the word, and does not call out substance-less uses of it, so it&#x27;s become an easy target for mocking lack of substance in political and cultural discussions.')
