You could just substitute &quot;No Code&quot; for mongodb (or coffeescript, or AngularJS, or pretty much any of the short-lived tech that we used or watched people use over the last several decades).  Some new hotness catches on and some doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s really too early to tell for No-Code, but proclaiming its arrival is also premature.  Not that the media&#x2F;marketing machine has any problem beating the drums about unproven tech.  But yeah, I feel like I&#x27;ve seen this cycle dozens of times in the last decade of auditing failed software projects that someone is looking to salvage.')
