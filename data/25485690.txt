I update only via web UI when new version becomes available for my instance. Currently running v19 though v20 has been released 2 months ago. That way I believe I avoid some of the bugs when major version is released :).<p>Some negatives aspects that I have encountered, but don&#x27;t see as a big deal -<p>newer Nextcloud versions require newer PHP versions that are not provided by Ubuntu LTS, that means, that I&#x27;m no really benefiting from LTS and I have to upgrade the distribution if I want latest Nextcloud (don&#x27;t want to upgrade PHP separately).<p>and couldn&#x27;t get Talk working reliably, whatever I&#x27;m missing, it feels that documentation could have been better.')
