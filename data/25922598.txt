It&#x27;s hard to say your VR headset bundle has a value added deal of a piece of software that you then give away for free.<p>My very distinct impression from companies that built exclusive VR titles for new headset launches, is that the revenue guarantees involved were big enough for that to be a reason in itself to build a given title. CCP Games built four... Valkyrie was originally exclusive to Oculus Rift and Gunjack was originally exclusive to the Samsung Gear. Gunjack 2 was then exclusive to Daydream. And Sparc started as a PlayStation VR exclusive. Apart from EVE Online, CCP hasn&#x27;t made any successful launched games except for VR titles... likely profitable solely because of those exclusivity deals alone.')
