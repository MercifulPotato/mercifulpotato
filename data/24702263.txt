It is reported that the knock was a person walking into Eddie&#x27;s recording studio. Another story has claimed that the sound was simply the musician knocking on his own guitar.[25] The sound, however, is that of Jackson knocking on a drum case, as he is credited in the album&#x27;s liner notes.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Beat_It#Eddie_Van_Halen&#x27;s_guitar_solo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Beat_It#Eddie_Van_Halen&#x27;s_guit...</a><p>So I suppose if you&#x27;ve actually got a source from Van Halen&#x27;s mouth, that&#x27;s probably more authoritative.<p>I also enjoyed this tidbit:<p>&gt;The engineers were shocked during the recording of Van Halen&#x27;s solo to discover that the sound of his guitar had caused the monitor speaker in the control room to catch fire, causing one to exclaim, &quot;This must be really good!&quot;[26]')
