Item(by='whateveracct', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606675282, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25246764, text='&gt; Just reading the &quot;abstract&quot;, this sounds way more complicated than anyone needs a VCS to be. I also question the &quot;mathematically sound&quot; bit - the &quot;commutative changes&#x2F;diff&quot; thing sounds really far fetched.<p>Care to say anything more quantitative and less feel-y? Because you&#x27;re refuting pretty much the entire premise of pijul (which clearly exists, works, and has been somewhat rigorously designed) with nothing but adjectives. So having a concrete counterpoint would be helpful because pijul is just sitting there with very concrete counterpoints to your entire comment :)')
