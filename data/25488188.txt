It is the first wired protocol that works so stable and don&#x27;t even need extra hardware - just one free IO pin. I have over 200 smart sensors and devices around my house. PJON was a perfect solution for all problems I was facing with wired and wireless communication for DIY smart home solutions. With some luck PJON will be officially supported by MySensors already from next release - beta test are already done. I think this will make PJON more common.')
