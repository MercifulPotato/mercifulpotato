Item(by='GekkePrutser', descendants=None, kids=[24869559], score=None, time=1603386049, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24851869, text='Yes and we in Europe use DD-MM-YYYY not MM-DD-YYYY.<p>Excel is very dumb in how it deals with this. When it thinks dates should be DD-MM and you paste a bunch of dates in MM-DD format it will parse the &#x27;invalid&#x27; combos correctly (like 01-31) but it will leave the others alone. It should just realise &quot;hey this is not the format I expect&quot; and do them <i>all</i> correctly). Because if you don&#x27;t notice you now have a whole bunch of half correct &#x2F; half incorrect data and no way to tell which is which. it doesn&#x27;t even flag the cells with a warning or comment. Or even pop up a warning to the user that something is off.<p>Also, if I paste a whole load of numbers starting with zeros then YES I want them as text, not for them to be changed to 1.374E+22. Great with stuff like serial numbers or IMEIs.<p>Microsoft with all their self-proclaimed AI chops should really apply some of that to Office. All these things have worked this way since the 90s.<p>PS: Part of the issue is also that MS doesn&#x27;t have an intuitive application for databases, and because nobody groks Access everyone uses Excel as a database which it isn&#x27;t. Causing a stinking pile un unmaintainable VLOOKUP crap.')
