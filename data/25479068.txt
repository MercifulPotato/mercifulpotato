It uses unsupported and undocumented APIs of the compiler, it autogenerates code that is in some cases flat <i>wrong</i> (like the infamous enum @ToString), and it does this through a mechanism of the language specifically designed for pure <i>metadata</i> - code that compiles with annotations should not cease compiling without them. And, because of the way it does what it does, IDEs must have explicit Lombok support built into them. It is, effectively, a different language that&#x27;s a superset of Java; at that point, you may as well <i>actually</i> use a superset of Java like Groovy, and then you don&#x27;t have tools prone to breaking.')
