This is not applicable to all of software engineering by any means, but if you want a more technical answer than those the article provides: concurrency.<p>It&#x27;s 2020: computers have multiple cores, and it&#x27;s great to know how to use them, but time and time again I see candidates get tripped up with basic concurrency concepts. Deadlocks in go, event loop blocking in node.js, unsafe memory access in Java or C, they come up all the time in interviews I&#x27;ve done.<p>&quot;Track the median value in a stream of integers&quot;? No problem. Clean code, no errors.<p>&quot;Track the median value of two streams of integers which are coming in concurrently&quot;? Data loss, deadlocks, concurrent modification exceptions... Sad times.<p>I know it&#x27;s a bit more complex than basic algorithms and data structures, but it also is much more important in the &quot;real world&quot;, at least in my opinion. Every language has libraries of data structures already written, but concurrency solutions are often context specific and need handwritten solutions.')
