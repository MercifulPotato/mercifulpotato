Yes the simple &quot;elegant&quot; solution is just 1 instruction slower, and longer only in the end, but the inline version is 1 instruction slower in the loop, which is stated more elegant in the article.<p>EDIT:\nOr you can get the same principle as the Occam&#x27;s razor, which is KISS  keep it simple, stupid, silly and straightforward')
