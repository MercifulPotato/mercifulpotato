When I started they used to say that if you didn&#x27;t get to L5 in 4 years or so, you would start getting scrutiny applied to you. L5 is sort of &quot;team-lead light&quot; and does require inter-team collaboration, project&#x2F;code leadership&#x2F;ownership, etc. I always felt like this process is corrosive towards individual contributors, and doesn&#x27;t recognize long-standing committed but less-ambitious or less-social people.<p>This policy was eventually dropped, thankfully, but among some managers I feel like the attitude has remained.')
