It gets trickier with external dependencies which are &quot;forced&quot; on you too.<p>Do you have a concrete &quot;domain&quot; example that you think will be hard to turn functional (which basically means turn the integration points into minimal functions doing just the integration bits â€” basically, any side-effects are limited to those integration functions)?')
