But they could embrace the opportunity to be even more open and generous of a society than they have been in the recent past. They’re certainly strong enough for it.<p>A few things I would personally love to see:<p>– More transparent and consistent application of laws<p>– Celebrate and protect all Chinese of all diversities, not just the majority who hold the most power<p>– Avoid taking nationalism to an extreme<p>The second and third especially are serious mistakes other nations (<i>e.g.</i> Britain, Japan, America) have made in recent history. It would be a gift to see China avoid the same.')
