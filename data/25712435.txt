How do you even compare movies, books, songs you enjoy? There’s a broad sense of liking or not something in general, but attaching a 4.1 stars to this and 4.3 stars to that seems delusional. And it’s not context-free either: start taking into account the time of day, state of mind, the phase of the moon or what have you, and you might as well throw the whole concept out.')
