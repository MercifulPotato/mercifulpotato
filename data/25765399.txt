My mom uses her laptop at home 99% of the time, if the battery gets low she plugs it in.  She needs a battery that will last 1-2 hours for the 3 times a year she flies.<p>You can find a place to plug in at basically any coffee shop or library you go to.  My mom isn&#x27;t spending 10 hours in a datacenter, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter to her if the battery life is 3 hours or 12.  For the average consumer, battery life has just been another stat on the spec sheet for years now.')
