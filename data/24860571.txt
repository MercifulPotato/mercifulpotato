The formula is (income &#x2F; investment rate &#x2F; percent income saved).  If my investment rate is 4%, I need to save 25 years worth of salary.  Saving 50% of my salary looks like I would need 50 years on the surface.  However, my portfolio generates income from day 1, so it&#x27;s actually a lot faster than it seems.<p>Just for reference, I was living on less than $750&#x2F;month until I got married.  The companies I worked at had plenty of free food.  I didn&#x27;t need a gym membership because the handyman work I did on my investment properties was more than enough.  Until we had kids, my spouse and I were still able to survive on less than $1,000&#x2F;month.  We are based in the south SF Bay Area.  We had 100% income replacement by our mid-30s.')
