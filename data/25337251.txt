I find this example very readable, but expanding it into try&#x2F;catches would make it rather long winded and harder to see the pattern at work as you extend the sequence:<p><pre><code>    get()\n        .then(handleResult)\n        .catch(useFallbackResult)\n        .then(updateState)\n</code></pre>\nI prefer concision and functional expressiveness because it reduces the surface area for writing buggy code. Much like how using map instead writing a for loop can eliminate out of range index bugs, chaining promises brings useful guarantees about how the code I do write can be interpreted.')
