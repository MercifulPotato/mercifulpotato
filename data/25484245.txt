Even rust and c have (relatively thin) runtimes. AssemblyScript  has optional&#x2F;controllable very thin runtime.<p>What their decision means in practice is that you can execute any language if you want but they won’t expose any specific runtimes to thin your binary. They will also actively support workflows based on AssemblyScript.')
