Both sites you mentioned have self-service ad platforms with no minimums.<p>If it works, the cost is tiny ($3-$12 per 1,000 impressions)  - especially since you’re able to target the campaigns. If it doesn’t work, organic content probably wouldn’t have either, and would have taken way more calendar time and wallclock time to test.<p>After you find something that works, then look into ways to decrease the cost.')
