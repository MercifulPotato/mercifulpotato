You can support &quot;right to repair&quot; while simultaneously opposing the current proposed bills. I think people should be able to do whatever they want to their devices once they&#x27;ve purchased them but I don&#x27;t think that Apple should be forced to provide them with the parts, tools, and manuals to do so. That doesn&#x27;t make me anti-RTR.')
