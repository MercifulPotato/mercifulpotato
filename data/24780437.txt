In fusion, you have trememdous pressure outwards from the containment vessel due to the magnetic field &quot;squishing&quot; the plasma to a density that&#x27;s enough to promote fusion and redirect scattering forces back inward.<p>Of course to create that magnetic field, you have to have superconductors very close to this superheated plasma.  So the first thing to relate to this is there may be less cooling required.<p>The second thing is, and this is both a stretch AND possible a huge gain, but perhaps the required pressure for the superconduction can be provided by the inherent pressure of the fusion reactor core.')
