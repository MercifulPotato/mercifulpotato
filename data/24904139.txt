It supports heaps of sites, and youtube is probably less likely to have the sort of content I&#x27;m referring to than twitter, pornhub, liveleak, who knows.<p>* I am in Australia, so for a subpoena (or similar) my friends would need to issue an MLAT request, which would indeed take a very long time. In fact, this often does happen, but in the meantime a formal preservation request (to the service provider) and a local copy (via something like youtube-dl) are important steps.<p>* Many investigations don&#x27;t go to court, for a litany of reasons (that&#x27;s a pun I guess). In such cases, a subpoena isn&#x27;t in context: law enforcement have to investigate what has happened, to figure out if it needs to go to court.<p>* Some investigations are important but do not meet the &#x27;serious crime&#x27; threshold for forcing companies or parties to provide information. If you can imagine being the victim of a minor crime, that someone filmed and put on twitter, I&#x27;m sure you can imagine the local police may want a copy of the video before the tweet gets deleted - but also know that there will never be an international cooperative justice process. It&#x27;s just a local issue.<p>* Publically posted video is very common and often important, and it is not surprising that the police need a tool to download it. There are so many sites and web browser technologies, and the cops are not efficient spending their time coding youtube-dl equivalents.<p>I feel quite strongly about youtube-dl being taken down for copyright infringement by the RIAA, but have tried to answer in an informative way. Sorry if it comes across harsh - no ill will intended :)')
