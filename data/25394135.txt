A developer told me that this code snippet was sufficient to conclude that the ACPI wakeup was broken, so I misinterpreted it to be &quot;the method was not defined&quot; (while totally ignored that any AML code must be executed by the OS). Just RTFMed quickly, hopefully I&#x27;ve reached the correct understanding: &quot;_PRW&quot; is a definition of wakeup capability of this power button, the first argument &quot;0x00&quot; means its event is located at register GPE0, bit 0, and the second argument &quot;0x00&quot; means it&#x27;s capable of waking up the system from ACPI S0 (&quot;power on&quot;), which excluded all low-power states like S3 or S4 - which was probably why I was told that S3 wakeup was broken.')
