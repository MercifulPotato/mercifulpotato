He did that for six months and when he got comfortable with the language, we also bought a Kindle and bombarded him with books and videos. Two and a half years later at 10 yo, he scored 690&#x2F;800 on SAT. He&#x27;s a scientific thinking person, quite intelligent, loves working on math olympiad problems and consumes insane amount of content in English from YouTube. But he doesn&#x27;t have a photographic memory and not interested in learning another language, maybe Gaelic as an unknown-to-us inside joke in his math olympian community.<p>My daughter is 8. She can speak English, German very well along with Turkish as the native language. She&#x27;s working on Chinese now. For German she used Duolingo daily, every second-hand  Lustiges Taschenbuch we can acquire in Turkey, Die Maus on iPad, channels from YouTube (from Peppa Pig in German to Checker Can|Tobi|Julian) etc [1]. When she first actually talked in German for an hour, it was after more than two years from starting learning it, and she managed almost perfectly according the lady she was talking with. She&#x27;s not that much interested in science as my son, totally not into math, more of an athlete&#x2F;jumper&#x2F;dancer with way less attention span. Language learner is one of the identities she describes herself with.<p>For my two children with two different personalities, consistent daily introductory work on Duolingo or similar apps followed with lots of online content worked really well.<p>[1] In terms of quality (but not quantity) of the resources, we found German is much better than English for kids.')
