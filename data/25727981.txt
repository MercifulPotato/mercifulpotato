You can extrapolate consequences pretty far from what is said there, consequences which are well understood by moxie (if nothing else, you can see that time was spent thinking about environmental factors). To me this attitude is baldly toxic because it makes the world worse (in that it reinforces the opinion that centralised is better, which is at the heart of so many problematic digital services).')
