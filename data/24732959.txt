I think there are two totally different reasons it could erode trust in whatever ideas were in wide circulation before the introduction of the new medium:<p>(1) People could get better at critical thinking. This is a kind of enlightenment. Enlightenment usually requires effort, so it&#x27;s not automatic. But some people will seize the opportunity that they didn&#x27;t otherwise have.<p>(2) People are just exposed to more ideas. They don&#x27;t take the (old) default views anymore because now there are more choices readily available to them. This can happen without people getting smarter.
