There&#x27;s &quot;PFOF&quot; which is basically middle-man profit taking.<p>Not really. The middle-man profit taking (aka market making) will exist even without PFOF, it will just move onto the open exchanges. The only difference would be that the market makers would have to offer worse spreads because they can&#x27;t separate &quot;dumb&quot; order flows from &quot;informed&quot; order flows. This is an overall negative for retail traders but a net positive or neutral to hedge funds&#x2F;institutional traders.')
