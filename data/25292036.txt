Huge files - a distributed VCS will not handle versioning them in a space-efficient manner without hacks like LFS.  Plastic SCM says they handle huge files, but you want to investigate this closely.<p>2. Locking files - Game assets will usually be binary and non-mergeable so you need to be able to lock them so that only one person is able to edit at a time. PlasticSCM seems to have this handled according to their website.<p>3. Disk space - Watch the pricing for disk space. 5GB is nowhere near sufficient for a game of reasonable size. Seems reasonable at $20&#x2F;month up to 100GB, but make sure you understand what you&#x27;ll get. They allow for a local server, which might be useful for a company (or if you don&#x27;t mind setting up your own servers).<p>If you&#x27;re a solo or small-team indie, you can probably get by using anything. git, plastic, svn or perforce. perforce even has a cloud hosting solution.<p>There is a reason Perforce is widespread in the gaming industry and it&#x27;s not because we&#x27;re a bunch of mouth-breathing morons stuck in 2005.')
