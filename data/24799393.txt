But my experience with family-like teams is that you end up with managers that act like they were you father&#x2F;mother and you an immature child whose every request is a whim.<p>Pretending that everyone is a friend is not necessarily good either because straightening a friend is much more harder than a colleague, so you end up not taking the right decisions by fear of frustrating and losing your friend.<p>I agree with rimliu for those reasons. Coworker relationships have to be different than family or friends, but that does not mean being inhuman or disrespectful, and it is not incompatible with a good and fun ambiance.')
