In fact I’m not entirely sure why you would at all, but my best guess is in hopes of trading with others. In that case, social media is actually perfect: draw people in with carefully constructed fronts, do dealings in private groups and try to fly as much under the radar as possible.<p>It’s hard to say and probably silly to speculate but I just don’t see the point of using a pornography website for this.')
