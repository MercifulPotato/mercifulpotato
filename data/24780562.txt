We only lived 1 exit down on the interstate, I should have just had a taxi drop me off.<p>But they closed that down a couple of years ago (Thanks Boeing). Now the only route from NY to UK is JFK to LGW, but the flights were still so cheap (and hopefully they don&#x27;t go under) that my wife and I always upgraded to their &quot;premium economy&quot; which was still only $1200 round trip NYC to London, and you get leg room, 2 checked bags, and guaranteed overhead space.')
