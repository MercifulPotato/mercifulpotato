But I suspect for a lot of us , me included, it serves that exact purpose. I post so that strangers on the internet read it and give me likes. I compulsively check my comments section on my account to see how many upvotes my comments have. Every time I see my total Upvote count go up, I get excited and I rush to see who has agreed with me again. If it goes down I immediately get angry and defensive that someone is downvoting what I said. And surely, you participate in the same process, even if you don&#x27;t feel as strongly about it - otherwise, why are you replying to strangers that you are unlikely to ever meet or speak to again?<p>It might not have been designed this way but it&#x27;s exactly what it is. And clearly upvote&#x2F;downvote system didn&#x27;t happen by an accident, it&#x27;s there for a reason.')
