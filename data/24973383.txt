The failure case when the conspiracy is &quot;George W Bush did 9&#x2F;11&quot; is going to involve a whole lot fewer death threats to random private people.<p>Telling stories about powerful people matters a lot less because even if they&#x27;re lies, powerful people will go along with their day. They&#x27;ll be fine. So, sure, entertain stories about powerful and possibly malevolent public figures. It&#x27;s when people with significant power like Jones take to telling stories about <i>random parents of murdered children</i> that they do serious damage.')
