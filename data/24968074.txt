That way, there&#x27;s an offline mailbox you cannot loose in case of a ban or anything like that. Just make sure you set your Outlook to download everything, not just last year or so.<p>My motivation was a bit different, I didn&#x27;t like the idea that someone could make it to my account and see literally all my e-mails sent and received in last 15 years. I mean I do have 2FA setup, but I don&#x27;t trust MS over my offline backup stored on an encrypted device.')
