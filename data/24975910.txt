Often times it’s not actually what you needed at the time, but gets thrown in anyway because it’s harder to design a signing protocol <i>without</i> that property than with it.<p>So in the sense that non-repudiation isn’t a core requirement of DKIM you’d like to have the crypto algorithm which meets just the DKIM requirement and no more — yes, this email definitely came from an authorized server and hasn’t been tampered with, but without inherently proving that the email is not a forgery years later.<p>On the other hand, DKIM having this property is actually extremely useful and nice to have a lot of the time, not the least of which in the Hunter Biden case, or for the purpose of authenticating any particular historical email.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;robertdavidgraham&#x2F;hunter-dkim" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;robertdavidgraham&#x2F;hunter-dkim</a>')
