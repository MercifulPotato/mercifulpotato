It&#x27;s like poker. If you seem confident, people will infer you are so secure because you have lots of resources and can afford not to care. And this becomes self fulfilling and after some time you will really have social capital and allies and can afford to be even more upfront given that protection.<p>I think the key thing is to live and breathe the rhythm of social situations. When are high tides and when the lows. You mentioned humor. That&#x27;s also very much connected to this. It matter when and how you say your upfront things.
