I&#x27;m German, so my grandparents on both sides were involved in WWII. I grew up with the stories of what they had to go through. My grandmother had to flee after the war when she was ten on a 24h notice, being allowed to carry only one suitcase and give up all other possessions. Hunger was rampant, people foraged in the woods for acorns. Bread with mustard was a delicacy.<p>I think we should be grateful that for most Western countries, the last 2-3 generations have seen an incredible, unprecedented period of stability and peace.')
