As to why, I&#x27;m not sure of any direct connection of Greene to Esperanto or other constructed languages, but he was a friend of George Orwell, whose aunt was the girlfriend of Eugene Lanti, an Esperantist who was one of the creators of the standard Esperanto dictionary (PIV). Lanti (whom Orwell didn&#x27;t care for) may also be the reason Orwell had 1984&#x27;s &quot;Newspeak&quot; use terms like &quot;ungood&quot; which model Esperanto usages.')
