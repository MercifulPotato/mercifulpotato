But when it starts being relative value that it’s hard to line up.<p>Let’s say sourcegraph saves a few minutes and it worth it. GitHub saves way more time so it’s relative value is much higher.<p>I think this is a problem with many SaaS products in that it’s more “efficient” to just be software. It also seems like the per user costs are relatively low and the effort is in the code base indexing and whatnot.<p>I think it’s a good idea and think it’s great if users are happy. But I’d rather have an OSS product that I could install as part of the tons of other stuff I use than be on the hook for a monthly charge for every user.<p>I expect that they’ll be bought by GitHub or GitLab and rolled in at some point and will make more sense to me value wise when it’s like $.17 or something of an overall source management cost.')
