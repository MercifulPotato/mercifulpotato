Tests came back positive and the doctors recommended abortion. My parents were horrified, being pro-life. They endured a traumatic next few months and a premature delivery. That was 1989. My sister was fine but it left my parents with enduring resentment of doctors to this day.<p>My abortion &quot;policy&quot; has been that it should be illegal to knowingly put an unborn fetus in jeopardy (unless the mother&#x27;s life is at risk of course) as soon as the pregnancy is known beyond reasonable doubt. I can&#x27;t imagine any other policy that doesn&#x27;t dance with eugenics.<p>I think that the government&#x27;s prerogative should be facilitating adoption for the baby and mitigating the &quot;unavoidable&quot; inequity to the mother biology has put upon her.<p>I understand many disagree with the above, I only ask that you keep an open mind as I also try to do about one of the trickiest moral quandaries in the present age.')
