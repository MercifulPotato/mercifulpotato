They know what it takes to keep it secure. I&#x27;ve got my entire life on a device with sensors, camera, mic and it knows my health. It is fun to DIY a phone and be able to fix it, but Apple has put security down to the processor level (secure enclave) and they have a team of security engineers who&#x27;s budget would dwarf the entire Pine64 team. Pine64 (or such device) sounds amazing to hack on, but I would not put any of my personal information on it. People just don&#x27;t realize how you can make the same argument about a computer, but a phone is a lot more than that. Does your desktop know where you&#x27;re located and how fast you&#x27;re going? Does your laptop know the gait of how you walk? I am a hacker, a linux aficionado and I love open-hardware projects. I love the community and the people. Just that I don&#x27;t want my phone to be such a thing.')
