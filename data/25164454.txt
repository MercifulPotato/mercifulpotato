RISC instructions are typically fixed length. Yes there are exceptions but that is how most instructions are designed.<p>RISC ISA is still designed around Load&#x2F;Store, while e.g. x86 has a variety of address modes.<p>All these differences in the ISAs has some impact on what makes sense to do in the micro-architecture and how well you can do it. Sure you can pipeline ANY CPU, but it will be easier to do so when you deal with mostly fixed width instructions, of quite similar complexity. On x86 there will be much more variety in the complexity each instruction and you will be more prone to get gaps in the pipeline. As far as I understand anyway.')
