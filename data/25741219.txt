At the time of the case, sexual orientation wasn’t protected. Fortunately, it was added as a protected class.<p>But even if it was a protected class at the time of the suite, I think the opinion was that religious rights (another protected class) come into play.<p>For me, this seems to expose that some people aren’t arguing from first principles but kind of change their position based on a pre-conceived notion.<p>So just like people now bringing up that looting isn’t so bad after the capital riot&#x2F;insurrection were against rioting in situations over the summer.<p>It seems odd to me, or at least irrational, that someone could be against rioting for BLM purposes but for rioting for conspiracy theories. Or that someone could be against a baker’s ability to not serve a gay couple, but for a hosting company not serving an asshole megaphone company.<p>So just as people, rightly I think, were arguing that discrimination against sexual orientation should be a protected class and thus illegal; people now are arguing that net neutrality&#x2F;free speech should have regulation, change in rights.<p>It’s not “ironic” in either sense.')
