When you write a Query, what activity are you actually currently involved in? You try to understand the API and want to query it. What&#x27;s the easiest way to understand an API? Read the documentation? Where is the documentation? It&#x27;s the schema, hence GraphiQL&#x2F;Playground. So why would you want to switch back and forth between Documentation and Code when you want to understand an API? On the other hand, if you already use GraphiQL in your workflow, how does this look like? You write a Query in GraphiQL, then copy paste it into your code. Now if you want to add something else you go back to GraphiQL, search for another field and copy paste again. Compare that to WunderGraph: You keep getting back to GrapiQL and extend your Queries. You hit save and the code-generator re-generates the client. You don&#x27;t even have to change the code if you just extended a query. The function call in the frontend simply returns more data. I wrote a feature page about this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wundergraph.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;generated_clients" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wundergraph.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;generated_clients</a> I&#x27;d really appreciate your feedback on it!')
