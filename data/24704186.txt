Yes, technically they are, but it&#x27;s not really useful to conceptualise them this way.<p>It&#x27;s relatively easy to make a model that works essentially the same as the actual integers (most modern programming languages have a built-in or stdlib variant of bignum), while it&#x27;s prohibitively difficult to do the same with real numbers. And yes, computability is in fact the difference here, because as long as you are able to keep up the illusion of infinite memory, the integer version problem is trivial, but the real version stays just as hard.<p>-- edit answering the edit: I&#x27;m not familiar with that application, but if I&#x27;m not mistaken graphical software uses a different model than the one outlined in the OP, based on algebraic approximations. I&#x27;m not saying this stuff doesn&#x27;t exist, obviously. I was talking about the general rationale behind the OP, i.e. using a model like this one <i>instead</i> of floating point computation for generic software.')
