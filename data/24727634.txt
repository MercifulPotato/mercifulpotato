When RandomApp1245 is not on an iPhone, no one cares and it&#x27;s the app that loses business, so they suck it and pay Apple the danegeld. If Netflix is not any iPhones, I suspect there will be plenty of people for whom it will be a deal-breaker.<p>If it is, there will magically be exemptions added. Which is how some of the App store rules read like a complicated boolean algebra of if this, but not that, unless this, but only in case of that.<p>Let&#x27;s not pretend all this is happening out of some fundamental noble meta-principle.')
