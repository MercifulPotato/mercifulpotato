In most cases your hand should not be over the table at all. The main risk that can result in getting too close to the blade is a kickback pulling your hands in to the blade. Don&#x27;t put your hands on that side.  Understanding feed direction is critical to router safety. Don&#x27;t feed work between the bit and the fence, have the bit half in the fence and spinning towards the work. I knew a guy who lost three fingers to a router  because it wasn&#x27;t in a table when it should have been.<p>Much of that is true of a table saw too. Stay back, use a pushstick, or make a jig.  I cringe when I see Adam Savage  using a saw with his fingers by the blade,  there is no need. When I was an apprentice I would get yelled at for that.<p>The real risk with a router used properly is to your ears,  your lungs, your eyes.')
