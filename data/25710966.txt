I didn&#x27;t expand on it because I know my opinion is usually not welcome (eh) here and also there is no way to come out looking good when arguing with people who position themselves as fighting against prejudice even if you care about social issues and it&#x27;s exhausting.<p>As you say, it&#x27;s the most limited interpretation of the problem. It&#x27;s to the level of the master-branch or black-list&#x2F;white-list controversies. I believe sexists are unwelcoming (to say the least), and sexism breeds a toxic work environment. I&#x27;m sure this image has been used by sexists, as has every resource in every field up to this day. I do not believe this image is sexist or unwelcoming nor that changing it will do anything to improve the work environment for women in tech.<p>I think these requests are overall harmful: They&#x27;re a rhetorical mirage that does nothing to help the people they claim to stand for while  disenfranchising normal people in the process by reframing them as bigots. They are part of a broader pattern of ideologically motivated battlegrounds in (SV) tech and serve only to classify people as allies or enemies. You yourself frame it as dichotomy between people who care about injustices and people who care more about preserving an old joke (clearly assholes if they put a joke over the inclusion of their colleagues). I&#x27;d ask you to consider that people who share your beliefs do not have a monopoly on kindness and mercy and the human heart, and to consider furthermore, given the polarization of the American political discourse, whether this is the right way to build a welcoming environment.<p>I say all this from personal experience, as a minority who&#x27;s unlucky enough to have the most privileged people on earth fight for him (but not really) one well-meaning frivolity at a time. I say unlucky because in the process every space for us online has been hijacked and paradoxically I have less of a voice than before and meanwhile everything is still pretty shit to be honest.')
