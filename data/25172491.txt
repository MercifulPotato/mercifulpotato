I originally was thinking ChromeOS switched entirely to Wayland, but looking around I&#x27;m having a hard time confirming. I believe this is true: ChromeOS has an &quot;Aura&quot; shell which leverages the Chrome infrastructure. Chrome has it&#x27;s own &quot;Ozone&quot; api for rendering. A lot of Collabora work &amp; other has gone into the Ozone&#x27;s Wayland backend.<p>In the future, the Lacros[2] project intends to run Chrome the browser inside their Chrome-based Exo&#x2F;Exosphere display server, which is impemented in Aura. Kind of weird situation. Still not sure what Aura or Exo directly uses, whether it keeps a Mus or other special Ozone backend, or whether it too will run on Wayland, but the browser inside ChromeOS is going to be running on Wayland &quot;soon&quot;.<p>One can also run Android apps under Spruv[3], which targets Wayland.<p>Best most important technology development happening on the planet. Join those pushing for a better &quot;brighter&quot; future.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genivi.org&#x2F;about-genivi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genivi.org&#x2F;about-genivi</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.chromium.org&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;master:docs&#x2F;lacros.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.chromium.org&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;master:d...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.collabora.com&#x2F;spurv" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.collabora.com&#x2F;spurv</a>')
