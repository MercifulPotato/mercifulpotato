A reasonable viewer would not actually think OAN is paid Russian propaganda, instead, he or she would follow the facts of the Daily Beast article; that OAN and Sputnik share a reporter and both pay this reporter to write articles. Anything beyond this is Maddow’s opinion or her exaggeration of the facts,” the judge decided.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtontimes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;may&#x2F;23&#x2F;judge-tosses-defamation-suit-filed-against-msnbcs-&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtontimes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;may&#x2F;23&#x2F;judge-tosse...</a>')
