You don’t need to have a specific class of computer  compute the programs running on it. CS even has the idea of an Oracle machine: <i>The problem does not have to be computable; the oracle is not assumed to be a Turing machine or computer program.</i> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Oracle_machine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Oracle_machine</a><p>It’s a very critical idea in CS.  There is no specific BB(1, 2, ... n) that’s suddenly impossible to discover, however  writing a program that runs on touring machines that can find arbitrary BB(n)’s isn’t solvable.  Another way of saying it is it takes increasing complexity to solve BB(n) as n grows, a given program can only be of finite complexity.')
