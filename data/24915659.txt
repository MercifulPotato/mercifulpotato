I read some book authored by a woman from such a country and one of the details that stood out was a remark she made about how every woman who gets out of those countries remarks on how wonderful it is be able to just go outside without a veil and feel the sun on your skin.<p>Plus, as others have noted, some of those countries have very young populations and darker skin tones of local inhabitants impacts vitamin D production as well.<p>There are really going to be a lot of factors involved.')
