That&#x27;s still a startlingly large delta.<p>&gt; Forgive me if I don&#x27;t care about the per-capita number of refugees in Canada.<p>Well then why are you replying to me?<p>&gt; You are the one who is mistaken.<p>I&#x27;m wrong about lots of things, and my goal is always to get it right, and I&#x27;ve edited my responses for clarity, with a statement of why. However, the fact remains, 25X more refugees per capita and 5X more immigrants per capita is a lot.<p>Thank you for your help in figuring out where the delta was! I didn&#x27;t mean to come off smug though, I saw other folks had varying definitions of what an &quot;immigrant&quot; was.')
