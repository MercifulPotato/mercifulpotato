Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602254352, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24730145, text='1) sounds like an argument looked for after the fact. Masks were recommended initially especially <i>because</i> they stop you from touching your face and would train you not to do so.<p>2) doesn&#x27;t make sense to me: because masks aren&#x27;t perfect and some people refusing to wear masks makes them less efficient they&#x27;d advise to not wear masks at all?<p>3) is a political stance, not a scientific one.<p>Would people have reacted differently to masks if they weren&#x27;t intentionally mislead on so many levels about Covid-19 in general (the WHO losing a lot of credibility) and the efficacy of masks? When you have people who are skeptical of the government, and the government lies to them and gets caught, won&#x27;t that make them even more skeptical of whatever the government says next?<p>I don&#x27;t think there ever was a scientific consensus that masks aren&#x27;t effective against airborne diseases. There was a political decision, and that can change any time, but it has nothing to do with data collection or the scientific method.')
