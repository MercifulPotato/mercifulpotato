For one, even if it had no overhead, it&#x27;d completely ruin any optimizations that the devs needed for the game to run in the real world. But likely iO will add a huge overhead, degrading performance by at least a quadratic factor or more. iO also doesn&#x27;t consider things like syscalls or hardware instructions, which might break the security model anyway.<p>Video&#x2F;music DRM wouldn&#x27;t (couldn&#x27;t?) change from what it is now: the plaintext bits have to be surfaced to the user at some level (so that it can be displayed&#x2F;played), so they can simply be ripped at that point.')
