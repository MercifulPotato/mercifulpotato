I have a 2013 HP Envy 17 that&#x27;s also survived because of the ability to replace (keyboard, battery 2x, SSD). Its chassis has unfortunately started collapsing, but I want to fix it and donate it to a relative.<p>I hope these newer Macs that have everything soldered together, at least last 4-5 years. I&#x27;m going to try get a Mac as my next work device, maybe 2 years from now, so my wife can use my current one in future.')
