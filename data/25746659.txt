No fun. I feel for them. We had to return our security badges and exchange them for new ones without AIG identifiable info on them so that we wouldnâ€™t get harassed on the subway. And were told to keep quiet about who we worked for.<p>99% of the people at AIG had nothing to do with the business that contributed to the financial crisis. In fact, the business unit most responsible was in Connecticut (we were in the Financial District in Manhattan). So it was pretty frustrating to be a worker bee making a middle income salary and having no insight to or ability to influence the issues causing the financial crisis, and yet having strangers wanting to yell at or physically harm you.')
