Item(by='jjav', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603172716, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24831755, text='&gt; Is email SPAM really a serious problem today?<p>Spam in email is basically not a problem anymore, in my experience.<p>~15 years I would get literally thousands of spam emails per day in my spam folder. But this was the days when email servers were configured to accept anything no matter how malformed. And many people had misconfigured smtp clients, thus attempting to enforce constraints would drop a lot of legitimate mail. So spam was a huge problem.<p>Today it&#x27;s very different. I no longer see any smtp clients from legitimate senders with any protocol misconfiguration. So for years now I enforce every detail at the smtp connection level (with postfix), before the email is accepted.<p>I still see failed attempts in the postfix logs but they get blocked right there. Actual spam getting through to the spam filter is down to a few a week.<p>Then checking DKIM drops all of these in the spam folder.<p>Spam that gets through these steps to my actual inbox is now so rare that it&#x27;s always a surprise. Less than ten a year, tops.<p>So from my perspective (running my own email infrastructure for a handful of domains, personal and business, friends and family) email spam is no longer a concern.')
