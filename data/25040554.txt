They have a &quot;How to contribute&quot; section in their documentation and a &quot;contributing.md&quot; file in there.<p>Practically search any project &quot;X contribute&quot; or &quot;how to contribute to X&quot; and it&#x27;ll be the first thing that pops up in the results. Many specify that you can contribute in different ways, and address the issue of documentation.<p>However, timing may matter. You&#x27;re a bit &quot;lucky&quot; since November is right after October, and open source maintainers have had a rough month of &quot;Hacktoberfest&quot; in which a lot of scum of the earth surfaced. I mean by that your valuable contribution was appreciated and the maintainer wasn&#x27;t biased against it after last month.')
