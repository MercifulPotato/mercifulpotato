Their pills take 5-10 minutes to dissolve. That&#x27;s all good for the party trick they are advertising, but if you&#x27;re rushing to get to work or get your kids to school you don&#x27;t have the time nor patience to wait that long.<p>My product takes only 30 seconds - 10x faster than the competition. It is the only convenient miracle berry product. It may not form a habit with everyone, but I do have customers who use it daily for their dieting. It helps them to satisfy their sweet tooth, enjoy foods they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t, or get a fussy child to eat fruits, veggies, dairy, fish, etc.<p>To say this is a powdered version of mBerry is a bit of a simplification because miracle fruit is highly unstable so it took me about a year to formulate something that would retain its flavor and texture longer than a few days.')
