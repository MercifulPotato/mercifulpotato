Item(by='ucha', descendants=None, kids=[25944645], score=None, time=1611848012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941431, text='Robinhood sells their order flow to Citadel.<p>Citadel is financing Melvin Capital&#x27;s GME short. The financing terms are private but whether they just lent them funds to cover the margin calls or actually hold their short positions until the storm passes for a fee, it is absolutely in their interest to prevent GME from continuing to skyrocket. Drawing a collusion between Citadel and RH isn&#x27;t that far-fetched but I obviously have no insider knowledge of this.<p>Most brokerages sell their order flow and Citadel trades 25% of the equities market in the US, from memory. Schwab, which also sells order flow to Citadel, requires 200% margin to go long GME which makes no sense since at most, you can lose 100% of your bet.<p>This is not what free markets are supposed to be like.')
