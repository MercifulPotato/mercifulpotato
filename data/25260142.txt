E.g. if 10% tested positive, that&#x27;d be unambiguously worrying &#x2F; news-worthy.<p>The other shows the <i>maximum awareness</i> of a problem.  If it&#x27;s big, you have no idea if awareness is low (many neutrals) or if incidence is low (many negatives).  <i>Everyone</i> in SF could have COVID, and that 99.798% number could still be factually correct.  Or it could be that only those .202% got it.  There&#x27;s no way to know from that number alone.')
