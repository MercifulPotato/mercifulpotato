The benefit of this is you can go directly to any route for your web app then just stub the data you need immediately and test against that. The benefit of this approach if you can easily test negative scenarios and how your application behaves. Negative scenarios like failing response (500 error) or having a 200 response with missing data fields. This is useful when testing something like pagination because you can make the &quot;3rd page&quot; fail when you trigger that API call by forcing it to give you a 500 error (or something else). The downside of this approach is that you are no longer using real services that your app relies on, but you gain some confidence on testing multiple scenarios in an easy format rather than setting up proper chaos engineering scenarios&#x2F;experiments.<p>Other testing libraries do allow you to intercept requests as well (I know playwright does this), but one of the selling points of cypress is that you have access to the same browser APIs that you have use when doing web development.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.cypress.io&#x2F;guides&#x2F;guides&#x2F;network-requests.html#Testing-Strategies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.cypress.io&#x2F;guides&#x2F;guides&#x2F;network-requests.html#...</a>')
