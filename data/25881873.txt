Transactions get stored&#x2F;batched on the payment terminal until the connection is available again.<p>EV chargers often still require internet, however, as payment is via app or their own RFID card&#x2F;dongle. Putting credit card readers directly on the chargers is a relatively recent (and not yet universal) improvement.<p>Another reason for internet is so that chargers can report their availability status. In-car navigation or charging apps can direct you to locations with available chargers, avoiding ones that are fully occupied or out of service.')
