I guess I&#x27;d like to suggest that you <i>require</i> users to indicate it, again thinking about a name like Jan that could easily start with three drastically different consonants depending on what language it&#x27;s in!<p>&gt; try saying as close as possible Grzegorz without hearing it first...<p>I know there&#x27;s something about &lt;rz&gt; in Polish that I don&#x27;t expect, but I also don&#x27;t know what it is!<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s a great example of how this could be useful. My intuition from English is like [ɡɝ&#x27;zɛɡɔɹz] which, now that I&#x27;ve listened to a Polish recording, is really really really far off. Even &quot;Maciej&quot; would have given me trouble before I&#x27;d heard people talking about Maciej Ceglowski.')
