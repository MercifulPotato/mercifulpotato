In general this will degrade performance, but it is useful in special situations, such as when applications do their own caching. File I&#x2F;O is done directly to&#x2F;from user-space buffers. The O_DIRECT flag on its own makes an effort to transfer data synchronously, but does not give the guarantees of the O_SYNC flag that data and necessary metadata are transferred. To guarantee synchronous I&#x2F;O, O_SYNC must be used in addition to O_DIRECT. See NOTES below for further discussion.')
