What? Did I <i>choose</i> to bleed, then? I mean, obviously it seems to me that it should fall on Airbnb itself to pay in cases like these. Perhaps the owner of the house should have demanded funds from Airbnb in exceptional cases like these. The outrage here is that the owner of the Airbnb - and you, apparently - seem to think that it&#x27;s somehow a burden that I myself have to bear, as if I chose to get punched in the face.<p>Oh and by the way I did pay a standard multi-hundred-dollar cleaning fee. Apparently that wasn&#x27;t enough, though.<p>If I got in a car crash in an Uber, because another car backed into me, do you think they would have fined me if my head hit the headrest in front of me and I got a bloody nose? To suggest as much would be outrageous. In fact, I <i>have</i> gotten into a car crash in Uber, and even <i>Uber</i>, one of the scummiest companies out there, knew to do the right thing. They immediately comped the ride and gave me another one for free. (OK, one could argue they could do even more...)<p>If I went to a hotel that was located in a shady area and walked outside and got punched in the face and bled on the floor when I came back in, do you think their first reaction would have been to charge me to clean it up?')
