It&#x27;s more clunky than Lightroom, but its features are on par with or better than Lightroom, far as quality and choice.<p>You&#x27;ll probably have to spend some time playing with it to find your &quot;look&quot;, but once you do, Lightroom can&#x27;t come close.<p>That said, it&#x27;s missing a great organization&#x2F;sorting workflow and painted adjustments, so if you rely on the latter or expect the former in your RAW processor, it might not be for you. A fantastic (commercial) alternative is CaptureOne. It&#x27;s the Rolls Royce far as I&#x27;m concerned. Strongly recommend you stay away from Darktable, because it&#x27;s close enough to Lightroom (but not as good) that you&#x27;ll get frustrated.<p>Hope this helps!')
