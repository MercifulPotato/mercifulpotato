You&#x27;re right that only carrier compatible planes can use this strategy, but having some planes usable after the initial sortie is better than none. Carriers and STOVL planes are more expensive after all, there&#x27;s a cost benefit trade-off to be made here. But carrier survivability compared to airstrips does give them uses beyond just bullying countries overseas, at least until we get rid of the need for recoverable air assets entirely.')
