Just search for &quot;Google closed my account&quot;, &quot;Facebook closed my account&quot;, &quot;Google suspended our business advertising and email&quot;, &quot;Facebook suspended our advertising account&quot;, &quot;Amazon suspended my business account&quot;, etc.<p>These companies have been pulling the plug on people and businesses for years.  When they do, there is no recourse whatsoever.  It&#x27;s the closest anyone will get to having to face a totalitarian regime from within a democracy.<p>The tech community should have revolted against this kind of treatment of individuals and businesses years ago.  These companies have ruined people and destroyed businesses.  Heck, they even drove people --kids-- to suicide!<p>Now, with Parler, Trump, the threat to Australia, this thing in the UK and more they are likely scaring the hell out of people around the world and across a wide spectrum of ideologies and circumstances.<p>What comes next might be easy to predict:  The heavy hand of government will likely descend on them around the world.  And likely so.  As the saying goes, you reap what you sow.  What&#x27;s worse, they will likely be responsible for the creation of onerous regulations that might very well damage other internet companies and make it that much more difficult to do business.<p>In the end, it might all be for the better.  No company should have the power to destroy individuals, businesses, political organizations and even force governments with the click of a button.<p>That&#x27;s the world we live in today.  Many think Parler was the first violation of trust.  It was not.  Thousands have been silenced and erased all over the world before them.')
