I’d bet the overall percentage of server side software running on K8s is in the single digits, thought that’s a pure wild ass guess. Hours ago I just finished debugging an outage where requests to one K8s service, through K8s ingress, slowed down 10x after an insignificant deploy, and then we cycled the pods (without changing the code) and it sped up again. No idea why - K8s is complex, and many ppl choose not to take on that complexity. TONNES of people like being able to deploy a single executable to their servers, it’s part of Go’s popularity, part of the popularity of fat jars in Java land (and those still need a JVM!), etc.<p>As for CLIs, the Deno executable overhead is about 47 MBs. Not nothing, but also ... that’s like a few extra seconds of download time for the tool, and insignificant disk space when people have hundreds of GBs on their laptops. If I’m writing some sort of command line tool, the tool being 50 MBs bigger probably does nothing to hurt adoption. But it having zero external dependencies WILL help adoption, vs. npx and screwing around with proper node versions and whatnot.')
