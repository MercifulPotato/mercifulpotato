This person may just hate the USPS and have no intention of subverting an election, but regardless of their intentions, their actions undermining the USPS during the exact couple months when people were realizing they were going to have to vote by mail have made many people understandably suspicious of the USPS.<p>These people want to not have to go to a crowded polling place during a pandemic, but also are worried that a ballot sent through the mail may not arrive on time. So they are seeking to ensure their vote is counted as well as possible by dropping their ballot off in person.<p>Regarding the security arguments you propose: The list of official boxes is generally on the local board of elections’ official website. Also, many boards of elections notify the voter upon receipt of their ballot, so if you drop off your ballot but never receive notification, you can call them and find out what’s up. The boxes are locked, many are near places like schools or banks that have CCTV.<p>And the kicker: If anyone catches you tampering with the very obviously marked box, you risk jail time. To really swing an election, you’ll need multiple people who are willing to risk jail time in return for possibly but not certainly swinging an election in their preferred direction.')
