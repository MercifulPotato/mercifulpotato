(OK, to be fair, it&#x27;s still in the process of dying).<p>As Docker don&#x27;t solve isolation you need to run Docker in VMs anyway, so actually people start to think how to get rid of this unnecessary overhead. The foreseeable future are microVMs (the hype is just heating, projects show up &quot;everywhere&quot;). And in the long run unikernels could become the &quot;packaging format&quot; for those microVMs (but they have to mature first as ease of use, und performance &#x2F; stability are not there right now).')
