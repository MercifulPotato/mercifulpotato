This is my second one, the first one I exchanged for screen bleeding also. I have the last usable Mac Book Pro (2013) custom order with i7&#x2F;750ssd&#x2F;16gb ram and will change the battery myself soon (Apple refuses to fix laptops from 2013).<p>The last Apple product that I have bought is Mac Mini 2018 - unlike other Apple products, Mac Mini is easy to open and installing the ram was a surprisingly light experience. I expect next generation of Apple products to be totally glued, without option to repair at all. I have no problems with this, because I will not buy any Apple product in the future, but Apple creates trends and other manufacturers copy quick.<p>I don&#x27;t see change for good in this direction unless legislative measures arise and insist repairability to be mandatory.')
