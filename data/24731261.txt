Misunderstood source of complexity.<p>I think one of the draws to these kinds of applications is that designers are trying to close the gap between themselves and developers.<p>I&#x27;m interested in this problem, but I&#x27;m taking a different approach, because I totally agree with you. The source of complexity is not the inherent complexity of coding itself - it&#x27;s just the complexity of the problem.<p>So I&#x27;m currently trying to build a coding language for UI designers. The idea is that it would merely a textual interface to express design specifications, unlike other languages which are geared towards implementation. And it would use the same verbiage and mental models that designers are familiar with.')
