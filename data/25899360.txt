When a person reaches legal drinking age they get a drinking card allowing them to drink and buy alcohol. Not use their driver&#x27;s license.<p>Do something illegal that involves alcohol, lose your drinking license for x years to forever. Get caught selling&#x2F;serving alcohol to someone without a card, that&#x27;s a &#x27;crime&#x27; now.<p>Additionally, since you are not removing their driver&#x27;s license as punishment, they can still do things like go to work, take care of kids&#x2F;family and so on. they just can&#x27;t drink legally. Obviously lots of issues and ideas, but that is the basic idea.')
