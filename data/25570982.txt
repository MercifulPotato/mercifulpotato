I can hear frequency sweeps and tones perfectly well, but all my life I&#x27;ve been unable to pick out words in conversation if there&#x27;s even moderate background noise. &quot;What?&quot; is likely my most commonly uttered phrase.<p>This leads to people constantly telling me to get my &quot;hearing checked&quot;, when it&#x27;s not the ability to hear tones that&#x27;s the problem.<p>Rather irritating explaining this to people.')
