I was among a couple folks who were in my age group in the camp.<p>It was a great experience working with folks of all ages in the camp.   I think mixing different ages, backgrounds, experience is valuable.<p>While finishing the camp I was working with another person who was my age and he got a call back from a recruiter after a phone interview.  He put them on speaker and the recruiter proceeded to note that they didn&#x27;t think he would be a &#x27;culture fit&#x27;.<p>He was braver than I and asked what that meant.<p>&quot;They think you&#x27;re too old for the group, everyone is young here.&quot;<p>We were a bit shocked and just to be sure he heard her right he asked again:<p>&quot;You&#x27;re too old.&quot;<p>For some folks it doesn&#x27;t even seem to occur to them that such discrimination is wrong.<p>I was a bit floored by the experience.  Growing up I remember overhearing some teachers quietly chat to each other and realizing that they could be just as petty as any kids could be.   From then on I really never thought much in terms of age.   For whatever reason when I go to meetups younger devs don&#x27;t seem to notice &#x2F; are a bit surprised when they find out how old I am.<p>When I think back on my career(s) I realize how just one opportunity here or there can make a huge difference and having a place that is obviously closed to me based on age make it known was pretty shocking.<p>Nothing ever came of that event.  While trying to just get your foot in the door he didn&#x27;t want to do anything about it and I could hardly blame him.<p>Both of us were eventually hired elsewhere, and are doing well.')
