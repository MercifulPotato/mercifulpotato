Kind of a larf but spin up a basic Node server on some port, use a fake domain via C:\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts and point the GP setting to that domain+port and it&#x27;ll blackhole the network requests (you do need the local server running because if the request fails, it will be sent to Microsoft).<p>Overall I agree it&#x27;s silly we even need to do this.')
