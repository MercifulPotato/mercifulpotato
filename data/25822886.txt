When I learned that I would be getting it, I went through the same euphoric excitement the author is describing. Then it slowly dawns on you that this is simply a bandaid. Something to stop the massive amounts of deaths. It&#x27;s not going to miraculously end everything and make the world go back to normal. There is no &quot;escape&quot;. You&#x27;re not going to be hopping on flights, vacationing, and going to bars again any time soon.<p>This is a real mistaken mindset that I think people are going to have to come to terms with. The vaccine is not a silver bullet. It doesn&#x27;t just make the virus magically bounce off of you like a force field. You will still get infected if you are exposed, and can very well still transmit it. The vaccine simply keeps you from developing severe disease.<p>We (the human race) have a long, slow, painful slog ahead of us to return to anything even resembling what things were like in Fall 2019. The virus is going to become endemic. Overall population vaccine uptake will most likely look like Flu vaccine rates (&lt;50%). And that means life will never be quite the same.')
