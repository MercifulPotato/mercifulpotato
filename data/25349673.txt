It can be technical things like upgrading to a new version of PHP, of a framework, or a library. It can be anything related to technical debt. It can be some proof-of-concept. In one of such sprints, I&#x27;ve introduced cypress and made a couple of tests to demo it.<p>The tickets for this sprint come from anyone. Usually, when working on a ticket you sometimes get a brilliant idea. Write a new ticket with that idea and add it to the tech sprint proposal. Before the tech sprint, the whole team participates in sprint planning. We go over tickets, review them, and decide whether they should be done. Usually, we assign tickets to ourselves. We also estimate how many story points they will be. Ideally, it should take less than 1 week to finish. A maximum of the whole sprint of 2 weeks is allowed. Otherwise, it is divided or multiple people work on it.')
