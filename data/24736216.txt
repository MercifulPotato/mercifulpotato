The language itself didn&#x27;t change that much from Borland&#x2F;Turbo Pascal 6.0&#x2F;7.0 to Delphi iirc.<p>Also, there was a source code leak about a decade ago of Turbo Pascal 6.0 that showed the compiler was still 100% x86 assembly. Just found it via Yandex - it was pretty hard to find with Google. (I only looked at the directory listings of the source code filenames just now, at some sourceforge-like site.)')
