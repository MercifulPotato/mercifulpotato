From what I hear, there is still usually a lag when content patches stop for a given expansion, but most of the real complaints I hear about the game are from people who were on their way out of love for it anyway, whether they realized it or not. I&#x27;ve admittedly been tempted a number of times to play around with it, but I know it&#x27;s akin to just having a beer after becoming an alcoholic and then quitting. Not a great idea.')
