Credit card numbers are the best-known mechanism for this. Ecommerce uses the pull model almost exclusively, because it lets the retailer confirm the payment and start the next step (fulfilment of goods) immediately.<p>The push model is where you provide me with your details, and I send money to you. This is seldom used for ecommerce because it requires reconciliation, for you to observe that you have received the money (which may take a greater period of time, depending on the systems involved—a lot of the world still operates on nightly clearing) and correlate payments with orders. This is used for much more casual things like people sending money to one another, or for larger amounts of commerce where transaction fees are much lower this way and maybe you don’t actually need the payment to be confirmed today.<p>For the pull model, your payment provider needs to know how to take money from the account details I provide. Sometimes this doesn’t work out, e.g. if someone has an American Express card but the merchant only accepts Visa and Mastercard.<p>For the push model, each sender needs to be able to target money to the account details the recipient provides. For example, I may be able to send to an Australian bank account by BSB and account number, but if you give me an American bank account, I won’t be able to pay to it directly but will have to figure out some kind of international transfer, potentially involving routing it through a third party.<p>The payto: URI scheme is the push model. For payto:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;… to make sense, each person’s bank would need to know how to send money to the nominated Stripe account. But that’s not how Stripe works; Stripe payments operate by the pull model.')
