It has a lot of really great, well, explained, fun exercises like computing a gravitational slingshot, computing the spread of an epidemic, then N-body problem, and others.  The exercises are solved programmatically, not with math equations.<p>America&#x27;s Unwritten Constitution\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;unwritten-constitution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;unwritten-constitution</a>\nAmerica&#x27;s Written Constitution\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;written-constitution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;written-constitution</a><p>If you&#x27;re American, you&#x27;ll likely find both of these courses extremely interesting.  What they (probably) taught you in grade&#x2F;high school was very overly simplified, or just wrong.  This is geared toward people who have no background in law.  I don&#x27;t remember there being amazing exercises to do, but there were a lot of mind blowing facts I learned about things the constitution does and doesn&#x27;t cover.')
