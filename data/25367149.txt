On the one hand I would like Google&#x2F;FB to remove antivax content on all of their platforms as it&#x27;s immediately dangerous to people and unanimously debunked by scientists. On the other hand I know once the big tech gets comfortable with the idea of censorship they gradually start expanding their editorial reach and start censoring things left and right with double standards as I believe applies in this case. You can find a ton of videos on YouTube claiming Russians made Trump president, one could argue this is equal to claiming voter fraud got Biden elected. I happen to think both are completely false conspiracy theories. There&#x27;s so much fabricated information on internet and YouTube that the idea of censorship based on truthfulness seems crazy to me. Google, FB, and other big tech should come up with clear red lines for what&#x27;s acceptable and apply it consistently across the board. Immediately dangerous information and unanimously debunked could be a good red line.')
