However, the “wholly selfish” economic argument for “diverse” workplaces is management consultant bullshit which is not supported by the evidence. Here’s an excerpt from the first article that comes up in those Google Scholar search results:<p>&gt; The result of [social] categorization processes may be that work groups function more smoothly when they are homogeneous than when they are more diverse … This analysis is corroborated by findings of, for instance, higher group cohesion (e.g., O&#x27;Reilly et al. 1989), lower turnover (e.g., Wagner et al. 1984), and higher performance (e.g., Murnighan &amp; Conlon 1991) in more homogeneous groups …<p>&gt; In contrast to the social categorization (and similarity&#x2F;attraction) perspective, the information&#x2F;decision-making perspective emphasizes the positive effects of work group diversity. The starting point for this perspective is the notion that diverse groups are likely to possess a broader range of task-relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities, and members with different opinions and perspectives … Corroborating this analysis, some studies find an association of diversity with higher performance and innovation (e.g., Bantel &amp; Jackson 1989).<p>&gt; In their simplest form (a main effect of diversity), neither analysis is supported. Evidence for the positive effects as well as for the negative effects of diversity is highly inconsistent (Bowers et al. 2000, Webber &amp; Donahue 2001, Williams &amp; O&#x27;Reilly 1998) and raises the question of whether, and how, the perspectives on the positive and the negative effects of diversity can be reconciled and integrated.<p>The case for workplace diversity needs to be argued on social justice principles, because there isn’t enough evidence for the economic efficiency argument.')
