The reason is that industrial facilities siphon off the treated water, and by the time homes and hotels get any, it&#x27;s untreated.<p>To give you an idea how bad it is, tourists generally don&#x27;t drink tap water, but they still get ill from the washed dishes, or not closing their mouth in the shower.<p>(Bali can always find money for road construction (they built two impressive underpasses in the last 6 years), but never enough for a power generation plant, so has continual brownouts.)')
