Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608272656, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25463819, text='&gt; Not only is China growing in power and influence, as you point out, it has been investing in American media and other industries. They&#x27;re famous for playing their strategic game over a long span of time (the long game).<p>The CCP has actual slave labour camps using the Uyghur people, they have illegally annexed Hong Kong and have been jailing and killing people in broad day light. Several CCP members and Carrie Lam have been barred from International finance that prevents them from funneling their funds to save havens (read: NOT CHINA) and no longer have bank accounts. And you think they&#x27;re gaining influence over this? Australia is being chastised for asking the wrong questions over COVID, and the countless lies and coverups. Several countries, the US included, have put legislation to take in the outpouring of refugees who are not being jailed for trying to flee, and you think this is gaining them influence in the World?<p>No, the issue here is that Supply Chains are so deeply embedded in China due to the hollowing out the US economy  and its manufacturing so they are the mercy of the CCP&#x27;s desertion of whether to maintain them, so heads of state who are beholden to their Corporate masters (who created this outsourcing craze) will instead simply try to divert your attention in order for you to just look away. The divisiveness to me serves no other purpose, and they don&#x27;t need tick-tock to show them that, simply looking at how working class people are getting screwed over by local&#x2F;state&#x2F;federal government in the US is enough to enrage any sane person. We&#x27;re just seeing the delayed aftermath of it.<p>But be under no illusion: the World HATES the CCP and its horrible Crimes Against Humanity, but this breach is still nothing compared to something like Stuxnet.<p>The only thing that one can see is the imperative for the World to de-couple from the China, which is easier said then done, and Xi and the CCP know its coming and have made it clear that they are going to start focusing on becoming more insular economy focusing on local demand.')
