Consequently, it&#x27;s easy to mess up a Windows system by running a random malicious installer.<p>Microsoft also offers an app store, and even a way to restrict Windows to only running software from that app store (S mode), but they take the somewhat-standard 30%. One nice thing they do that I think Apple should adopt is taking a smaller cut if you visited the store through a web link (meaning Microsoft didn&#x27;t provide the &quot;discovery&quot; and thus shouldn&#x27;t be compensated for it).')
