This works really well and is very inexpensive. Both my GFs business files and my personal&#x2F;work files all are backed up Dropbox style for less then $10 a month including web and mobile access.<p>I found NextCloud a little buggy compared to OwnCloud but it has more features and unfortunately I&#x27;m stuck with it for the time being and can&#x27;t easily switch back to NextCloud. The sync works fine though.')
