If so, why? As of this writing, it has far more points than any higher story on the front page (this is at 168 points, whereas the next-highest one is at 121 points [1]), and some of those were posted hours earlier than this one. (e.g. [2] is at 45 points and posted 5 hours ago, whereas this story is at 168 points posted 3 hours ago.)<p>I&#x27;m asking because I&#x27;m pretty darn upset by this news and I care that people actually see it. So this apparent (artificial?) deranking is very much bothering me. What is the basis for it?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25492406" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25492406</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25485541" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25485541</a>')
