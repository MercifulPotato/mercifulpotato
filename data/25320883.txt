Item(by='ethn', descendants=None, kids=[25321050], score=None, time=1607226921, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25320619, text='&gt; We can only examine what knowledge is after we&#x27;ve come to know something<p>This is an unhelpful nebulous statement, at its worst a circular definition and victim to the MÃ¼nchhausen trilemma.<p>&gt; untenable because to know what can be known presumes knowing what is to be known first<p>Not at all, I suggest to read Critique of Pure Reason. It is never about what is to be known, but really how one can know and in what way is one able to know. I meant &quot;what is possible to know&quot; in a metaphysical sense rather than a specific object of the apperception.<p>I&#x27;ll also note that epistemology was well established by Western philosophy long before Descartes.')
