Physics is not the same as math; you don&#x27;t prove things in physics. You propose models and test them against data. The models being proposed have not been tested against data, so it&#x27;s way premature to say they resolve anything. They are interesting proposals which hopefully we&#x27;ll someday be able to test.')
