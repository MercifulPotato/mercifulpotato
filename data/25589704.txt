Photons hit particles, get absorbed, and re-emitted, which causes an effective slowdown at a larger scale. A gas is just vacuum with particles floating around in it. When photons travel between those particles, they are traveling at c. The effective slowdown is determined by the lattice&#x2F;gas, and we denote this slowdown with the refractive index...<p>&gt; 7. “Light is both a particle and a wave.” Well, actually, it’s neither. Light, as everything else, is described by a wave-function in quantum mechanics. A wave-function is a mathematical object, that can both be sharply focused and look pretty much like a particle.<p>This is a great example of how quantum mechanical analogies don&#x27;t work if over-analyzed. A great professor of mine once told me that you can&#x27;t look too far into classical analogies for quantum mechanics -- you will end up coming to the wrong conclusion. At the end of the day, understand the math.<p>As someone else in the comments said, most of these are pedantic gotcha&#x27;s. I thought the one about water being blue was the only one that actually surprised me as something people thought was true.')
