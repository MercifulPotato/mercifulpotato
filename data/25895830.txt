Perhaps not quite the same, but in late 90s, I first saw &#x27;high end&#x27; cars with GPS&#x2F;maps built in to dash.  not even a few years later, you could buy much fancier ones, that would update, and were faster, and had more features.  The 1998 &#x27;luxury&#x27; in-built GPS felt way out of date by 2002 (UI, responsiveness&#x2F;speed, display, etc).  The rest of the car didn&#x27;t feel as dated, just the &quot;high tech&quot; bits.')
