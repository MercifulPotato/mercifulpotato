Item(by='octorian', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610606072, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25772161, text='&gt; Their software now detects the issue before it occurs and adds a notification alerting the driver.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen this notification on my 2015 Model S, whose MCU (the center console display referred to here) has become increasingly unreliable over the past year. Its gotten so bad that there&#x27;s almost a 50&#x2F;50 chance of needing to reboot it every time I drive.  (its actually even worse than that now, as the car now gets stuck installing a firmware update every night and needs a reboot to get that bit working again)<p>I honestly can&#x27;t tell if the issue is eMMC partial failure, corruption, or simply a lack of proper regression testing on Tesla&#x27;s part.  (After all, if all new cars use the new MCU2 then they probably don&#x27;t care about my MCU1 car unless they have to.)<p>That being said, I personally care a bit more about long term reliability and responsiveness than being annoying and making them pay. So the moment I qualified for an upgrade to their newer MCU, I just went ahead and scheduled that. Sure, it actually costs me money, but in exchange I get a faster UI, better software support, and hopefully fewer issues. (I plan to keep the car for a while still, and MCU quirks are really my <i>only</i> complaint.)')
