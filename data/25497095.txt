Alternatively, had he died, someone should have requested for an independent forensic examination in such a country.<p>- The discovery of novichok poisoning shouldn&#x27;t have triggered any sanctions from the Western countries, specifically there shouldn&#x27;t have been any consequences for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. I don&#x27;t think anyone would argue that sanctions against Russia are somehow in Putin&#x27;s interest.<p>This is the level of sophistication in planning and execution that nobody, let alone Russians, is likely capable of.')
