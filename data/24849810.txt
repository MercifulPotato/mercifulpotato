Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=[24852571], score=None, time=1603299930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24846887, text='&gt; <i>I&#x27;ve heard that learning Vim can make this much more effective.</i><p>This doesn’t surprise me; Talon is a lot like Vim.<p>They’re both modal: Talon’s command mode roughly matches Vim’s normal mode, and its dictation mode roughly matches Vim’s insert mode.<p>Talon’s ordinals apply to Vim operations (normal mode) as well: operations can be preceded by a number which normally says how many times to do it. Talon’s “go left ninth” would be 9h or 9← in Vim. (h goes left one character.) “One zero third” is more cumbersome because in Vim it entails switching between modes (Talon and Vim modes don’t match precisely), but starting in normal mode, a1&lt;Esc&gt;3a0&lt;Esc&gt; works to append 1000 where the cursor is. (a to enter insert mode after the current position, 1 to type a 1, Escape to return to normal mode, 3 to say “do the next thing three times”, the next thing being appending a zero.)<p>Both Talon and Vim value this sort of consistency in being able to build bigger things from smaller pieces.<p>So I imagine Talon would work quite nicely with Vim, once you get talon to shift out of the way in some cases and let Vim handle those things. (It’s similar with browser extensions that let you interact with the browser Vim-style: when the page in consideration has extensive key bindings, especially Vim-like things like j&#x2F;k for down&#x2F;up, the extension actually gets in the way.) I expect you’d find that having used one made learning the other a good deal easier, since they’re working in just the same ways.')
