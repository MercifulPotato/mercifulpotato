It&#x27;s also not the size of the whole transistor it&#x27;s the size&#x2F;thickness of the N, P and Insulator layers that will limiting factor in FET style transistors.<p>The oxide&#x2F;insulator thickness on modern process is pretty insane. For instance for the intel 14nm++ the silicon nitride and silicon oxide layers seem to 4 to 5nm thick.<p>-Edit-\nFor instance here is 2 fins for from the intel 14nm++. The grains&#x2F;spheres you see this image are the atoms. Some parts of the a modern transistors are even smaller than process number may let you know.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;hgeSOVV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;hgeSOVV</a>')
