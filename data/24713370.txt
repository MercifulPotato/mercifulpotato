I remember when I was test-driving Model S, the driving experience was very different from an ICE car, because <i>as soon as</i> you took your foot off the pedal, it started braking quite noticeably. To get an equivalent experience to an ICE car, you had to keep the pedal pressed ever so slightly (or change the settings).<p>Maybe regenerative braking is also when the brake lights turn on.')
