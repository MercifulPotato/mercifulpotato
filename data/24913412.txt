Last time I checked, it assumed for some reason that C&#x2F;C++ interface headers shared a common root folder with libraries, and if that root folder is not the immediate parent folder then it ends up including all files within that tree branch in its scope.<p>I also recall that the process of including system libraries that don&#x27;t support Bazel is needlessly convoluted, and involved adding libraries and interface headers in separate targets just to be able to control visibility. This design oversight was specially disheartening because it made it quite clear that the use case of supporting external packages benefitted from zero attention.')
