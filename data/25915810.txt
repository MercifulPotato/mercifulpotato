Values have stagnated in other places like many suburbs.<p>I think the main issue with housing prices is some people can’t afford to live where they want to live. And there’s some legitimacy there as people don’t want a long commute for various good reasons. But it boils down to people not being able to finance the lifestyle they want. Hence gentrification where those with limited means move into areas currently populated by people with even less means. And of course that has its own opponents who also generally oppose new development oddly enough.<p>Maybe remote work will loosen the demand to live in a handful of expensive cities?')
