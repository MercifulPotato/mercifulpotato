I tried it a few times, it basically only worked on one or two out of ten. The other eight or so asked for a Zip code to be entered, and regardless of what I entered - my real German zip code, a US zip code from the vicinity of the pump, all zeroes - the pump refused it. I could use my credit cards to fill up by going to the shop, handing it to the clerk asking her&#x2F;him to authorize a certain pump, which they would usually do as long as they were allowed to keep the card in their possession until I filled up. Then after filling I would have to retrieve my credit card, which would then be billed with the exact amount I bought.<p>All in all a very inconvenient process, and I had to explain it to some clerks because they weren&#x27;t used to it due to the locals all being able to just pay at the pump if they wanted to use a credit card. I quickly switched to just getting a stash of $10 and $20 bills from an ATM, estimating whether I could fit $20 or $30  worth of gas into the vehicle and pre-paying that amount, leaving a bit of space in the tank for the convenience of not having to walk into the store a second time.')
