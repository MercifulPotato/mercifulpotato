Item(by='zmix', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602708901, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764496, text='&gt; - Compatibility with international character sets (UTF-8) for data exchange\n&gt;\n&gt; - Support for modern peripherals like LCD monitors, printers, wi-fi cards, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Access to external filesystems (Ext4, NTFS, remote storage, etc.)<p>This is all supported with the current version of the OS (AmigaOS 4), however, due to no market share, only select devices are supported (the situation is like Linux (was), but much more extreme: printers (non-postscript) and WiFi cards, especially).<p>It is other things, where the system did not age well: no memory protection and no multi user support.<p>However, I do not want to place the Amiga as a viable solution for today&#x27;s use. I just wanted to address the comment, I replied to, which was a bit too &#x27;absolute&#x27; in tone for my taste. I did not find the criticism to be justified. Currently there is a hardware scene, that builds FPGA systems, that are fully compatible and meant to be run as stand alone, or as add-in systems and which can cope with most modern tasks, albeit CPU and GPU power is a limit, of course.')
