And yet, here you are, an individual (not a megacorp that needs to show quarterly growth) who effectively did something similar.<p>Anyway, after all this, I finally got a 2 page PDF with a small bulleted list with just the number of founders who vouched for every channel. The channel was just mentioned in a few words, so it wasn&#x27;t always clear what the channel meant.<p>The PDF was so small I first thought you were only distributing the table of contents as a teaser.')
