At all? Ever?<p>Or are we conjecturing what would happen if this was even slightly viable?<p>We&#x27;ve only very recently managed to experimentally demonstrate that unimaginably huge cataclismic events can make this happen, but, has anyone ever built some device that can make a crease of <i>any</i> significance at all in reality, and do so at will?')
