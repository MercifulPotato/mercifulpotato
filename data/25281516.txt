Some are medicinal, some are addictive, some are illegal, etc. They all effect people in varying negative and positive ways. The word &quot;drugs&quot; typically has a negative connotation since people tend to use the term &quot;drugs&quot; to refer to &quot;illegal drugs&quot;. You don&#x27;t really hear people calling &quot;medicinal drugs&quot; just &quot;drugs&quot;; well at least in everyday conversation.<p>Legal drugs are usually pushed by huge corporations with big budgets. They have heavy marketing and a lot of advertising that manipulates public opinion. All of this advertising of course portrays the &quot;drug&quot; in a positive way. You don&#x27;t ever hear the word &quot;drug&quot; used in alcohol or pharmaceutical commercials.<p>Also, whenever a study comes out saying anything good about alcohol the media picks it up since that&#x27;s what people like to hear. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever seen the news feature a study on the negative effects of alcohol. Another reason the media may focus on positive stories is that big alcohol is such a huge customer.<p>Any advertisement mentioning illegal drugs portrays them in a negative way since they are put out by groups that are against the drug since you can&#x27;t promote a product that&#x27;s illegal. So in conclusion, it&#x27;s because alcohol is legal and the loads of advertising that give people such a positive view of alcohol.')
