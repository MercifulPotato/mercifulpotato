If you want. I know I&#x27;ve done that before. (I would add that I regretted it because, in part, it complicated community discussions later)<p>In a lot of ways, I think that once you feel like you _have_ to do this or that, especially the professional stuff, your personal values (i.e. &quot;but I don&#x27;t wanna... This is supposed to be fun, that&#x27;s what I want more of in my life&quot;) will start pushing back on you and you&#x27;ll have an internal conflict on your hands.<p>However:<p>- I think it&#x27;s a better idea to identify specific people with whom you can really have fun and let go. &quot;General public&quot; has never been a good return on heavily-subjective communication investments. But with a little calibration? Figuring out who else is going to make this fun and enjoyable? That&#x27;s where the fun can really pick up. I have fond memories of traveling to different spots in the world, and meeting close FOSS project friends.<p>- There are tons of different degrees of professional standards. You can be humorous, you can give funny examples. Or you can just try to meet a reasonably objective &quot;not a terrible communicator&quot; standard.<p>- It&#x27;s also about what you&#x27;re _not_ perceived as: Rude, out for money, vindictive.<p>- Unfortunately the word &quot;professional&quot; really echoes our social values as a group. But that&#x27;s just the lay of the land right now. Some of the best communication training Joe Average will ever receive is only available in a &quot;professional&quot; setting. The word and system suck in a lot of ways, but there&#x27;s some good stuff in there if you can set aside the parts that annoy you.<p>Anyway, don&#x27;t do this professional stuff, it will make your life more tedious and boring, etc. ;-) But those little points of leverage have helped me and that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m coming from.')
