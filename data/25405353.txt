So you know my difficulty in finding new ones, maybe! Ides of March I haven&#x27;t seen, that looks great! And I actually agree with your ranking perfectly. I only feel bad that nightcrawler and prisoners are side by side, when there&#x27;s a pretty wide gulf between them in terms of how memorable they are.<p>I assume you&#x27;ve seen Place Beyond the Pines since it has Ryan Gosling, and Requiem for a Dream I think everyone&#x27;s seen, and idk if you&#x27;d like Irr√©versible; I didn&#x27;t because its story doesn&#x27;t quite keep up with its violence, but it is quite a jarring film.<p>Frankly, excluding movies that are only exhibitions of violence and don&#x27;t have a story to match, there are precious few movies in this vein! Precious few films have the power to truly shock the audience, at least in this way. OH! Cloverfield Lane is pretty solid. Very tense.<p>Note that I&#x27;m only mentioning movies that are striking for their tension or sudden spikes of violence, since that was the original topic. Just remembered Fatal Attraction, too!<p>Ooh, and Ex Machina in its own way.')
