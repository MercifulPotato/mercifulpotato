Absolutely, it will do that, but it is not scalable that it would support the needed revenue to be the next Google (or even DDG for that matter).<p>Committing to privacy and user-center features eliminates a lot of scalable monetization strategies, and I am completely OK with that.  I started and continue to work on Runnaroo because I love trying to solve the problem of building a better alternative search engine option.<p>Also, thank you for the kind words!')
