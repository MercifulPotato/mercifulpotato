Since it is so difficult to sue a vendor to stop selling your product in China, someone will just copy your design and start selling it for less than you can. Even if you get the item taken off Amazon, they will continue selling wherever else they can unless you invest a ton of money in a legal team to aggressively stop them from importing product to North America.')
