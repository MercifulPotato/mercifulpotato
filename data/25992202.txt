Oregon is saying they are going to stop using police resources to punish people for self-destructive behavior. Most drug users are struggling to begin with. Adding prison time for something which is not hurting others is cruel.<p>&gt; The next obvious step is to legalize all drugs, and let these lobbies profit off the back of addicts and their families and their ruined lives.<p>As opposed to ruining people&#x27;s lives for a behavior which isn&#x27;t inherently harmful to others.')
