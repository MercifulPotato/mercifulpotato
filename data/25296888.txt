This is called data-base, not data-bag. Databases are specialized engines to deal with, you guessed it, data. And they are extremely efficient at it. Not to mention - majority of the job backends do, is dealing with data. This is good for prototyping. Unfortunately more often than not — prototypes lands on production with updated connection string and debug=False.&quot;</i><p>Or, as I like frame the issue, there&#x27;s a difference between a datastore and a database. Datastores&#x2F;persistence engines store your data in manner that you can get it back later. Think of a key-value store for example. A database, however, assists you with the management of your data, including helping to ensure correctness of the data, tracking changes, among other things. For most systems lot of work is already managed in-database whether you like it or not.')
