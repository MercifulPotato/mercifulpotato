As an example, take HVAC and radio functionality -- in older cars with buttons and knobs, after a short amount of time, people can operate these functions without looking. The same is not true for touchscreens. That&#x27;s not to say that there is no place for them in cars, but the consensus it&#x27;s better to use a combination of touch screen (for things you don&#x27;t often adjust while driving) and physical controls (for things you do). But it&#x27;s generally cheaper to slap a big ol&#x27; touchscreen in cars that does everything, and change configurations in software, rather than investing in custom interior designs for each model of car. And it&#x27;s not just Tesla doing this, even companies who hang their hat on safety like Subarus are stuffing more and more functionality into touchscreens[0].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motortrend.com&#x2F;cars&#x2F;subaru&#x2F;outback&#x2F;2020&#x2F;2020-subaru-outback-interior-review&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motortrend.com&#x2F;cars&#x2F;subaru&#x2F;outback&#x2F;2020&#x2F;2020-sub...</a>')
