Scott, <i>Seeing Like a State</i>), means that yes, they effectively operate in a competitive and selective landscaape in which if they don&#x27;t develop such capabilities, or countermeasures against them, their adversaries will.  This will happen through the most monopolistic communications structures available, whhich is my point.')
