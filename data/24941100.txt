This is the same defense or reasoning as the HRC emails in 2016.\nDoes it matter if HRC emails were a DNC insider or a foreign agent hacking? \nDoes it matter Hunter emails, msgs and videos were from an abandoned laptop, a chinese blackmail operation, or another source?<p>Isn&#x27;t the real question: are the emails authentic? Or have they been manipulated?  What do the emails and private messages tell us?  What can other sources corroborate? I think this is Glenn&#x27;s point.  There are sources coming forward saying the emails and meetings that involve them are authentic.<p>The Biden campaign has never disputed the authenticity of the contents of the HDD (because that is a trap. they know that the trump campaign has evidence, and they are smart to not get caught in a lie. then the lie about the laptop becomes the story)')
