It also was recorded, often in aural memory but also in text, which I would say is the critical feature that differentiates modern science from more traditional scientific practices which we tend to dismiss as not science but which meet the criteria in strict methodological terms.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be capable of convincing you or anyone who has built their idea of science on the rejection of mythology, however it&#x27;s worth considering that religious believers made the same assumption about previous  cultural realities: theirs was the only right reality.')
