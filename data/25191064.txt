I&#x27;m not going to weigh in much on that because I wasn&#x27;t there and don&#x27;t have an in-depth understand over everything that happened, but it does seem like there might&#x27;ve been a better way to handle that.<p>That said, the parent comment made it sound like it was unreasonable to take RMS&#x27;s comments as meaning he was pro-pedophilia. And while I <i>think</i> I understand what he was trying to say, I can completely understand how reasonable people could interpret his words in a very bad way. That&#x27;s the part I was really replying to, not how his dismissal was handled.')
