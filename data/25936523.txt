And if you really traced back to the origin, I highly doubt you&#x27;re going to find some Joe Nobody -- you&#x27;re going to find some very well financed, planned player.<p>GameStop is a doomed enterprise in an obsolete space (selling physical copies of games), so it was incredible seeing WSB spin fantastical tales of the marvelous future ahead for it.<p>Everyone else gets some intense FOMO that leads them to piss away their own money (you can&#x27;t just buy options because options on hyper-volatile stocks price that in), and then a lot of people get burned. Everyone is running around talking about how everyone made millions from WSB tips or something, it&#x27;s farce.<p>As is always the case, a tiny number of people benefit, and a <i>huge</i> number of people financed their return.<p>The whole story seems super dumb. And the SEC is likely paying very close attention.<p>Loads of people throughout this discussion have absolutely no clue what they&#x27;re talking about. What a low information crowd this is.')
