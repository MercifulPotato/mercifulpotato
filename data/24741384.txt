This unit, the OMON, was specifically established to serve as Lukashenko&#x27;s beatstick against the opposition. Now, the overwhelmingly peaceful protest movement in Belarus has turned towards intimidation (no actual violence has been reported, afaik) against these people specifically, as a way of fighting back.<p>And then you see people on HN referring to this as &quot;doxxing&quot;, as if this was some kind of pithy Twitter fight. I understand that Twitter fights are what people around here can more easily relate to their own life experience than what is currently going on in Belarus, but for Christ&#x27;s sake, let&#x27;s try and put things in perspective here.')
