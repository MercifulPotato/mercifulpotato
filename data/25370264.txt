That’s the reason they get special tax rates in the first place, because when inflation is high a significant part of capital gains are illusionary and you don’t want effective rates to reach over 100% in real use.<p>So don’t tax profits if reinvested. Task them as income if returned to shareholders (or used as excess compensation).')
