I think the evidence is that the average person is better off with a lot more strength training, which will incidentally train you on some aerobics, and if you feel like occasionally folding some aerobics in, hey, go for it. They&#x27;re not <i>bad</i> or anything. But they ought to be considered a specialist training, like working out legs specifically for biking, not a default that everybody do. Strength training <i>is</i> a default everybody should work on. Strength training isn&#x27;t so you can lift 300 pounds when you help your friend move... it because it makes <i>everything</i> work better. You sleep better. Your back hurts less. You fall less. You build a better base for aging.')
