In one year, I will be 70 but I hope to still be contributing to my company.<p>I worry about the state of the world, especially US&#x2F;UK&#x2F;etc. for 2021. I expect the COVID-19 situation to improve but the division of society into those who are doing great economically and those who are suffering will increase.<p>Before I went back to work I volunteered at my local food bank and met many people who were in poor economic shape, often because of one bad medical event that sucked up all their resources, etc. Politically I am a member of the Libertarian Party, and as is my right, my wife and I choose to spend much of our resources on charities and what we consider just social causes.<p>My hope for 2021 is that more people in the world raise their consciousness and start caring for other people and turn their backs on shallow materialism.')
