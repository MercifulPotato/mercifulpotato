All the examples are about making &quot;meh&quot; design better - but many of us back-end developers would be over the moon if we were able to make &quot;meh&quot; design in the first place.<p>It&#x27;s also really only helpful for designing &#x27;webform&#x27;-style applications (where the main purpose is structuring a lot of information). There are no general principles of design that that would be applicable to something like an interactive mobile application.<p>I&#x27;m not bagging the book, I still think it&#x27;s quite good for what it is and I did find it modestly useful (which is why I didn&#x27;t request a refund).<p>But rightly or wrongly, I thought it would be a good introduction to the fundamentals of visual design, which it mostly isn&#x27;t.')
