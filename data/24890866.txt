It&#x27;s often about not supporting the bare minimum that would make it a good environment, based on &quot;know better&quot; from people who have no relevant experience.<p>The IBus case is classic example - There was high-handed declaration that having one single global IME state is &quot;easier&quot; for users. The problem is when you regularly have to use languages that are incompatible in writing systems and input methods. Whether its one of the CJK or switching between one of the cyrillic variants and latin, life is much easier when you can have separate input state between let&#x27;s say an Instant Messenger and your IDE.<p>For me, I recall the &quot;canary in the coal mine&quot; was when they refused (despite earlier promises and roadmaps) to re-implement certain things related to printing, again in a way that probably didn&#x27;t bother the developers.<p>A similar case involves all the very deep integration with systemd, where they essentially declared that there&#x27;s one Operating System under the Sun and its name is Fedora.<p>And it might feel more polished than Windows 10 on surface, yes. But then it&#x27;s much less capable and the resources in Windows go towards things like not breaking people&#x27;s software and behaviours.')
