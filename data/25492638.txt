The isolation and sequencing process for this type of material amplifies what is found in the sample by many orders of magnitude using techniques like PCR, so presence alone doesnt mean much - it certainly doesnt mean there were live, pathogenic bacteria in the sample (there are other, better tests for clinically relevant pathogens). I spent quite a few years doing metagenomic research, and let me tell you, bacteria and bacterial genetic material is <i>everywhere</i>.<p>Most of the rest of the article I couldnt comment on, though I found it a little funny they list Humulus lupulus as a &quot;suspected toxic component&quot; - thats hops, the same hops used to make beer (also used in cosmetics and other products). Matricaria chamomilla is also listed as a suspected toxin. Its chamomile, the flower used to make the relatively common tea.')
