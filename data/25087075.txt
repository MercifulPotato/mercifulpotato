I wrote all of my lisp code in vim and used slime for debugging it.  I knew zero elisp and zero emacs shortcuts; I used the menu interface for all but a few commands.<p>The first (and only for about 3 years) elisp I wrote was a command to open up the current file in vim, and reload it when vim exited.  This let me browse &amp; debug source with emacs while editing with vim.<p>SLIME offered so many features that this was an actually useful workflow, and I didn&#x27;t switch to using emacs for editing as well until much later, when evil-mode came out.<p>side-note:<p>I had tried other vi-like modes prior to evil-mode coming out (e.g. viper), but they fell in an uncanny valley for me; just familiar enough that I would regularly muscle-memory some sequence that didn&#x27;t work in viper.')
