My grand unified profoundly unserious theory is that we&#x27;re always going to complain about accidental complexity because we will keep discovering new reams of it by extending what we&#x27;re trying to do out into the unknown parts.<p>If we continued to play in just the known parts of the problem space, we&#x27;d see it melt away further and further into Brooks&#x27; model of the world. Instead, we built distributed systems, we work in absolutely giant teams, we deploy to the strange heterogeneous runtime we call the web,  etc etc, and all of that generates new complexities to abstract away before we get back to just the essential stuff.')
