Although, of course, it wasn&#x27;t possible to read through all of the source code and make sure that <i>it</i> wasn&#x27;t doing anything malicious, this felt safer to me.  I eventually had to give up, though, because troubleshooting a failed install from source is damned near impossible, and <i>all</i> the documentation you can find on anything assumes that you&#x27;re using package managers to install everything.')
