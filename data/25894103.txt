I had some health issues like sleep apnea and digestive problems converge before I knew about them, so even though I was working out heavily 5 times per week, I was fat and unhealthy and had lost my resilience.<p>My work put us on call at night 1 week out of 3 to monitor an ailing server and my productivity fell precipitously almost immediately. That was the last straw, so even though I thought I had the discipline to handle it, my body thought otherwise and I started crashing (falling asleep at my desk, having so much brain fog that I struggled with basic chores, etc). I miss that job often, but the writing was on the wall at least a year before that when I noticed that nobody listened to my expertise, they just wanted output. That&#x27;s the surest route to burnout that I know of so far.<p>I did have a lot of concussions in elementary school, but all I remember is the nausea and laying in bed for days. Severe burnout&#x2F;depression feels similar in that one loses their executive function. To me, burnout felt like what I imagine having a stroke might feel like. My problem-solving faculties shut down, so it was like my mental muscle memory of everything I had learned was no longer there so I was consciously aware of every single step I had to perform (which left me frequently overwhelmed). It also felt like maybe the left and right sides of my brain weren&#x27;t talking. When I thought about doing any task at all, no matter how minor, I felt low grade pain over my entire body like the feeling you get as you walk slowly into a cold body of water. Where there used to be excitement at the anticipation of doing things I enjoyed, there was now only a void of apprehension and dread. Everything felt like work, even recreation.<p>I had to start from the beginning and relearn how to write todo lists, journal about what I wanted out of life, address all of the physical issues I could, etc etc etc. The self-help stuff is all true. The only part they are missing is that IMHO as much as 80% of our mood is derived from physical sources. The science of vegetarianism isn&#x27;t quite there yet. So for example, I was eating more beans (legumes) and nightshades each day than most people probably eat all week. The anti-nutrients had lowered my absorption of iron, zinc and I&#x27;m pretty sure iodine, not to mention that I wasn&#x27;t taking enough of the basics like B vitamins. Each time I reintroduced traditional foods like bacon, I received outsized returns because of things like tryptophan turning into serotonin. Nutrition is huge.<p>Anyway, when it&#x27;s all said and done, the best treatment for me was to slow down and emphasize things like how priceless consciousness is (dignity), and deemphasize artificial human constructs like worth&#x2F;productivity (materialism). Also I learned that habits take about 2 weeks to form, so it was helpful to list 1 or 2 things I was struggling with, then perform them manually and dispassionately until the habit stuck. Negative self-talk is huge too. I adopted a continuous mindfulness as a set of rules so that whenever my inner monologue is critical, I note it and file it away without engaging. Over time, the positive thoughts grew as my inner child learned that positive reinforcement works.<p>I&#x27;ll stop there since I could talk about this literally forever, but I highly recommend talking to someone and seeing a doctor or nutritionist and trying some integrative and holistic approaches. Don&#x27;t lose years like I did.')
