Item(by='peter_l_downs', descendants=1, kids=[25051605], score=4, time=1605031705, title='Ask HN: What do you use to write/share/search/organize engineering docs?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Our team has tried Google Docs, Notion, Dropbox Paper, Coda, and now we&#x27;re looking at Slab. All I want is a single place for people to write things down where we can all find those things afterwards. They all have inadequacies. Here is the feature list I want:<p>- Searching across all docs in the project works quickly and accurately, and shows the matched phrases&#x2F;parts so you can determine if it&#x27;s actually relevant<p>- Easy tree structure organization of all docs, without arbitrary distinction between top level and sub-level pages<p>- Editing interface that lets you write collaboratively and looks decent. Should work like a regular text document.<p>From my testing, here&#x27;s where they each fall short:<p>Google docs: best at editing&#x2F;writing. No tree-structure organization without using Drive. Search is ok.<p>Notion: best at organizing. Editor is laggy and absolute garbage. Can&#x27;t select half of two paragraphs, you&#x27;ll end up block selecting. Organization is still weird, some subpages are visible in the side bar some aren&#x27;t.<p>Coda: best at editing&#x2F;writing, but not perfect. Searching is ok. Tree-structure is inadequate, weird division between pages and subpages.<p>Paper: best at editing&#x2F;writing. Search is bad. Organization is bad without using the rest of Dropbox.<p>Slab: haven&#x27;t evaluated yet.<p>I am this close to throwing my computer out the window, or burning all of my goodwill points and picking a solution at random and forcing us to use that. Please help.')
