Pretty much as I would expect you to do it in REST.<p>(mentioned it in another post, I created a no-code tool that did this, for random data and entities created by the user per tenant&#x2F;app, so I know the issues with GQL, but I can assure you, doing the same with REST was 10 times harder (api started as REST and moved to GQL after 6 months)')
