I used to use it every day a decade or so ago.<p>I was thinking the other day how excited I got about Windows Phone 7 because of how they centralised chats and social feeds from multiple services under a single contact tile. Back then I could see a future where we wouldn&#x27;t need to log onto Facebook to update our status, or sign into Skype to make a call, but we would instead have a single app which would aggregate all of our communication services into a single UI.<p>I don&#x27;t know what happened to that vision. I seem to use so many different communication apps these days. On my desktop I normally have WhatsApp, Signal, MS Teams, Skype, Slack and Apple Mail open at all times and I also keep my phone near me for SMS and calls. Thankfully I don&#x27;t use social media anymore, but if I did I guess I would also have at least one or two tabs open for Facebook and Twitter.<p>It seems in recent years platforms have been increasingly restrictive about what you can and can&#x27;t do with their APIs and chat services such as Slack have ended their support for IRC and XMPP altogether. I understand the move from a business perspective, but it sucks as an end user of these services.<p>In a lot of ways it seems we&#x27;ve gone backwards from the days of XMPP and Pidgin.')
