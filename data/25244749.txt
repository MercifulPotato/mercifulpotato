This causes one to move the goal posts further and further in order to save one&#x27;s ego.</i><p>Not sure why, but it made me think of <i>windup</i> in feedback control[0]. In controllers it usually involves overshooting the target, but you can imagine physical limits preventing you from closing to your target in the first place[1]. Stress levels about tasks seem to work similarly - they seem to integrate your distance from &quot;done&quot;. So if you&#x27;re not making progress, you can get so wound up that stress response dominates all your thinking about the task, which can prevent you from reaching it and&#x2F;or force you to abort it entirely.<p>The analogy isn&#x27;t in any way perfect, but going with it, I wish you could apply the same mitigation strategies to your stress levels that are applied to PID controllers to prevent windup.<p>--<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Integral_windup" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Integral_windup</a> - Basically, the Integral part of a PID controller tracks the integral of the error. If you stray too far from target and for too long, that integral of error will grow so large as to dominate the output of the controller. It&#x27;s usually a problem in terms of overshooting - a wound up controller will shoot you past your target and keep pushing you away, until the error integral &quot;unwinds&quot; and the Proportional and Derivative parts of the controller will regain their influence.<p>[1] - Perhaps the windup grows faster than the controlled device can act; e.g. a valve cannot be more than 100% open, no matter how strongly the controller is asking.')
