In Hungary we&#x27;re weirdly proud of how elaborate our swearing is.<p>And it&#x27;s way way more offensive than anything usually used in English. In English it&#x27;s just mostly isolated words, fuck, fucking, shit, cunt etc.<p>In English, if you hit your toe against the kitchen cabinet, how would people react if you said: &quot;oh, may that rotten stinky whore God fuck his dirty dick into the sky!&quot; And you come up with it on the fly, this is just an example. Obviously people don&#x27;t talk like this all the time anywhere, but I don&#x27;t think this level of offensiveness is usual in English.')
