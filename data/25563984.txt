I think that was originally the model for Tinypass, which merged with Piano Media.  Not sure if they still offer that model or not, but it&#x27;s the most recent I can think of.<p>The reality is that for all but the largest news sites, this model won&#x27;t really work.  Say you&#x27;re in a medium-small city.  Even in your best case scenario of like 50% of the population reading your site, you&#x27;d still only likely get such a small sum per-article (10-20k pageviews, maybe?) that you&#x27;d still have to supplement revenue with advertising and other revenue streams.  And now you&#x27;re back where you started!<p>I love the idea, but I just struggle to see it happen at scale.')
