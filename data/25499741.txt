Why are you not curious what the differentiator of all the car companies out there is? Why don&#x27;t we just have one car company?<p>(Hint: There is so much demand, so many different tastes, budgets and features and regulation, that a single company will never serve all of them. Tesla is a niche product and I for one would never buy one)<p>The iPhone was special in the regard that there simply was NO competition. We are not talking EV vs combustion (which was Tesla&#x27;s main step, and even still, everyone knew EVs would work and how they work, but nobody was ready to fully commit to them yet). We are talking horses vs. cars. Apple managed to establish themselves in a market that most companies didn&#x27;t even think exist...<p>So no comparison here. All Tesla has done is make EVs more approachable and &quot;cool&quot; for the masses. However they have literally ZERO differentiator compared to established car companies. They are going to tank so hard stock wise in the next 10 years that investors will wonder what hit them.')
