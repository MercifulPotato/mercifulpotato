I enjoyed Rashomon a lot more. However, Rashomon was clearly inspired by it. To really understand the appeal and significance of CK, you have to compare it to movies before it. The reason CK doesn&#x27;t amaze many people anymore is because everyone now uses these cinematographic techniques! In similar vein, the first Half Life game was groundbreaking and pioneered new ways of story telling. But if you don&#x27;t remember earlier games, you may be scratching your head.<p>Every now and then a programming language comes out that is a gamechanger. Such a language won&#x27;t get out of fashion unless new programming languages start building upon it. I can&#x27;t say if Rust is one of them.<p>I don&#x27;t have a long career in programming, and I know only a few languages, but I&#x27;d say Python is one of the languages that managed to set the bar for others. It&#x27;s still going strong, but it&#x27;s no longer turning heads with its usability and clear syntax.')
