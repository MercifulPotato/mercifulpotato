One reason is that you&#x27;re not supposed to heavily use the gears that are the most opposed because it causes additional chain wear.   Another is that some of the gears calculate to the same gear&#x2F;inch.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.mtbr.com&#x2F;drivetrain-shifters-derailleurs-cranks&#x2F;how-many-gears-does-3x9-have-766680.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.mtbr.com&#x2F;drivetrain-shifters-derailleurs-cran...</a> has a nice summary, including a picture from Sheldon Brown&#x27;s website.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sheldonbrown.com&#x2F;home.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sheldonbrown.com&#x2F;home.html</a><p>Basically, there are 21 or 15 usable gears depending on how you want to calculate things.   Then add to the equation that this is an electric bike and a single ring with 9 cassette gears seems reasonable.')
