Key issues are 1) can they make an acceptable margin on a good $800 laptop and 2) can they genuinely significantly grow market share rather than lowering average selling price - i.e. can they maintain distinction between $800 and $1000 products. Given what we&#x27;ve seen them do on iPhone and iPad I bet then answer is yes to both of these.<p>Bear in mind too that after a generation or two they can put the last gen M chips in cheaper products.')
