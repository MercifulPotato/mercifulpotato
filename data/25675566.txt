At worst it was debunked by the community.<p>Now, at the opposite, in my opinion, every article and opinion can be posted on HN. And the real value here are the comments and discussion around these links so that there can be a collective critical thinking r√©flexion about them.<p>Whoever can post anything, and sometimes I&#x27;m wondering if the article is true, if there are hidden fact or something that was deformed. And then, the comments let people all give their own opinion and often share interesting relating links and information.<p>From all of that, it give you a better base to have plentyfull of elements to make your own opinion on a topic!')
