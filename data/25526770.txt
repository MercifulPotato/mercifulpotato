To help where I can, I decided to create a free resume builder out of Resoume.<p>This is also a pilot project for me. I heard once that a free product could be a great way to generate new traffic. So I thought this might be a great way to find out. Two birds with one stone.<p>What do you think? Is this a workable way to give something of value? Will users bother testing Resoume? I appreciate your feedback.<p>Best wishes, Gobie')
