These have value in that you can correlate panel behaviors with a company&#x27;s revenue or identify trends in the market.<p>But, for data like ovulation schedules or events like pregnancy, it seems that it&#x27;s a lot of work (and based on the FTC ethically questionable) to see one-off events or target specific consumers a small set of products.<p>I must be looking at the available opportunities with some kind of blind spot, because I don&#x27;t get why companies would <i>pay</i> for this sort of data.')
