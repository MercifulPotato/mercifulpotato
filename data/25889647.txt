The t-bills get used and exchanged like money anyway. They do let the US have some control over the interest rates used in the rest of the economy, so it&#x27;s not a useless quirk, but it&#x27;s important to understand that US debt is nothing at all like personal debt, and it&#x27;s probably defective to use the same word.')
