My ISP gives me ~950Mbit&#x2F;s, and it&#x27;s not unusual for my house to be using 70% of that with all the video streaming going on, especially in 2020. A couple of customers like me, your bandwidth rates are gonna start hurting really bad.<p>The child comment is questioning hlieberman&#x27;s usage of over 600 Mbps, not your charts. I guess you could throttle users with some kind of QoS? Personally, I don&#x27;t think data caps would help here. Thoughts?')
