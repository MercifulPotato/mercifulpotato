It would be a nightmare to manage any application without it.<p>- react has grown fat and does more stuff. Also it has a lot of foot guns with hooks.<p>- the create react app situation is absurd from this narrow point of view but when looked at from a project&#x27;s perspective any team is going to choose it. The amount of features it offers out of the box would be insane to setup on our own.<p>- react has the biggest community right now and that will give a huge boost. Any good OSS library is not just about code and but also the community&#x2F;ecosystem.')
