Item(by='jamiequint', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602287711, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24732899, text='Google gets paid for clicks but most (or at least many) people bid on conversions, for those people it doesn&#x27;t matter if google delivers 100 clicks at $2 per click, or 4 clicks at $50 per click as long as they get the same number of conversions, so to this extent the CPC doesn&#x27;t matter. Similarly, I could care less if 50% of the clicks are fraudulent. As a buyer what I&#x27;m judging at the end of the day is if I got the value I wanted for the price I paid. Clicks don&#x27;t map to value very well, conversion actions do.<p>Plus, it&#x27;s not like if there was no click fraud that the auction becomes magically transparent, it&#x27;s still as opaque as it was before, so really this is the only rational way to purchase ads (off of some basis other than &quot;did the # of clicks meet my expectations?&quot;)')
