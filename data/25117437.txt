If you read the thread I linked to, it&#x27;s overwhelmingly positive (&quot;exceedingly encouraging&quot;) and in no way can be characterized as &quot;anti-vax&quot; or fearmongeriing. It makes a specific point about the length of efficacy being unknown with mRNA vaccines, which are a new approach. I think this is worth acknowledging. It&#x27;s certainly not a reason not to take the vaccine, nor does the thread imply that it is. In the worst case, the vaccine should still have a tremendous positive impact.')
