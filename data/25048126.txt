Item(by='fivre', descendants=None, kids=[25048412, 25049584], score=None, time=1605027623, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25047510, text='&gt; technical writing is almost always understaffed\n&gt; it&#x27;s really hard to show a causal link between the docs we create and developer success<p>Amen to that. IMO good documentation is incredibly valuable, but not in a way that aligns with business priorities. At my current job, we hear, repeatedly, that our documentation is poor, and that we need to improve it. Execs echo this sentiment, but the status quo doesn&#x27;t budge.<p>Internally, we have about a 10:1 engineer:tech writer ratio (in a small-ish org--I assume the gap is even wider in larger orgs), and the writers are all generalists, covering every product from top to bottom. In practice, this means that engineers are asked to draft the bulk of documentation, and the writers scramble to at least copy-edit it.<p>Engineer-drafted documentation often isn&#x27;t great, unfortunately, for several key reasons:<p>- Writing software is very different from using software. Engineers often don&#x27;t use their own products, and writing about something you don&#x27;t actually do is hard.<p>- It&#x27;s very easy to omit details that are important for novices when you are an expert. Engineers usually have a great deal of knowledge about their own software in their brain already, because they wrote it, and cannot magically forget everything they know when asked to write documentation for someone who doesn&#x27;t have that knowledge already.<p>- Writing effective, clear prose is hard, especially when writing about complex technical subjects for an audience with varying skill levels. Engineers don&#x27;t spend the bulk of their time writing prose, and it&#x27;s often not their strongest skill.<p>Personally, I have a mix of both skillsets because of a weird career path, but while I actually like writing documentation and am arguably better at it than writing software, there&#x27;s no good reason to pursue that path: I can easily get double the salary in an engineering position as I can in a writing position, despite being a rather mediocre engineer. So I do software engineering :shrug:')
