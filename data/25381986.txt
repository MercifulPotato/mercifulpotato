A cul-de-sac is not optimized for cost, efficiency, or anything measurable by numbers. The value is in community building - kids playing in a safe area away from a trafficked road, neighborhood BBQs, a place to learn to ride a bike, etc.<p>Many suburbs don&#x27;t have access to a park or even parking lot right outside their door, but  a cul-de-sac provides a very convenient and safe space<p>To counter those thinking car traffic still exists since its a road - it does not. Neighbors in a cul-de-sac see kids playing in it all the time and when turning off the main road slow down to a crawl or stop.<p>EDIT: My comment kind of misses the point of the article - that cul-de-sacs should maybe be taxed higher since they&#x27;re inefficient from a cost perspective. Most of the article reads very negatively against them though, and the bias of strongtowns bolsters that point for me.')
