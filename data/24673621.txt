I particularly hate status indicators that are orange&#x2F;green, rather than red&#x2F;green, because I just cannot tell them apart at all, where as at least the red gets a bit darker so that I can tell that &quot;dim is off&quot;, for example.  Nintendo seem to be pretty bad for this, at least with the Wii, because the LED is forever this weird yellow that looks like what I&#x27;d call yellow, but actually isn&#x27;t, and I had to actually switch to the input on the TV just to check if it was switched off or if I&#x27;d managed to catch the button while dusting under the TV.')
