I actually turn off all of the cyclomatic complexity rules or set very high limits because I find those to be really annoying. So I mainly use RuboCop as a code formatter, plus some minor linting and style rules that aren&#x27;t too obtrusive. I actually disagree with the parent article, and I&#x27;ve grown to really appreciate guard clauses. I find them much easier to read now.<p>VS Code will still highlight those cyclomatic complexity errors in the editor, so at least you will be able to fix them (or turn them off) without needing to wait for a CI build to finish.')
