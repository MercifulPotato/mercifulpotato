The attack targets phones in their manufactured state with the OS and vendor firmware installed. In other words it&#x27;s not an attack that depends on end user software (Apps) being installed, or on user behaviour, or even on features of the mobile network.<p>By supply chain, when they say mail orders and other shipments, they just mean between the vendor and the customer. In this case the use of &quot;supply chain&quot; could be miss-understood, this is a post-factory attack which would be carried out in transit, probably at a US border.<p>We have seen that done before to shipments of devices such as computers and network gear that have been intercepted and hacked before delivery to a suspect, or a target organisation or country.<p>I don&#x27;t think this can be reasonably construed as evidence for Apple conniving with the CIA. In fact I still don&#x27;t think that would make any sense from a CIA perspective. The factories aren&#x27;t even in the US. Apple employees aren&#x27;t background checked or sworn agents, they&#x27;re a potential security risk. Why involve them if you don&#x27;t need to?')
