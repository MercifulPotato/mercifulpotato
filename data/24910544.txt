If you refuse to remove content and it turns out to be legal, then you as a service provider can&#x27;t be held liable. You only get in trouble if you ignore a valid notice and there is infringement.<p>Neither is relevant here, though, as it wasn&#x27;t a DMCA notice but a claim of anti-circumvention.')
