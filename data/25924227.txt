He had never chopped wood before, and to this day he never has chopped wood. Ads convinced him he wanted it.<p>The same is true of all the ads from those companies, selling beautiful, sturdy compasses or hunting knives that never get dull.<p>Guns can be beautiful, well-made objects. They can make someone feed safe and prepared. I don&#x27;t see any reason an ad couldn&#x27;t convince someone that they want&#x2F;need one, especially if they&#x27;re seeing dozens of ads a day.')
