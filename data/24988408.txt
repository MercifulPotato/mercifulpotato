I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s one of the best office appliance I bought and I think it can comfortably last my lifetime.<p>I print some pages about 5 times&#x2F;year max. The toner that comes with it is nearly running out, but still able to print some greyish image if I want quick physical form of some files. ZERO maintenance.<p>and it&#x27;s not even the expensive model, it&#x27;s the base model, almost the  cheapest. Such quality, really.<p>On another story, I also used to own Brother&#x27;s multifunction scanner-inkjet printer. It was a nightmare.')
