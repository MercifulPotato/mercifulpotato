I work with information systems, how information flows among humans globally, and on creativity and creating things, and I suppose I haven’t seen a lot of behaviors in humanity that explain how this has been working. What is happening here? Every few thousand years some small group of people in a new random spot on earth somehow magically decides to do that hand thing with red ochre on a rock face? By what mechanism? There doesn’t seem to be a lot of evidence that we are innately drawn to hand symbols in red ochre, aside from these examples separated by diameter of the earth and tens of thousands of years.<p>Given the time scale and given our current visibility into humanity, human information, and human creativity, I feel like whatever would cause that to happen should be something that’s still observable in the modern world.')
