She&#x27;s at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundflora.tokyo&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundflora.tokyo&#x2F;</a> and she also makes some really awesome music.<p>I was going to say I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll see CUDA any time soon on M1 machines but... apparently Nvidia <i>does</i> have a beta AArch64 driver these days. TIL.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath on that working well given that it&#x27;s, well, the Nvidia blob... but it might (once we get Thunderbolt working, with an eGPU). I avoid Nvidia GPUs these days, so if an eGPU demo does happen, it&#x27;ll more likely be an RX 5700XT running the open source amdgpu drivers, which I do happen to have lying around :-)')
