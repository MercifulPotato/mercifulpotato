If history has teach anything is that &quot;tearing ourselves apart&quot; damages everybody in society. If your company promotes xenophobia, if your company promotes behaviors of users that damage society, I will stop paying for your services and look for an alternative.<p>To denounce fair criticism as &quot;Cancel culture&quot; misses the point. I do not need to pay for your private company service if I disagree with your views.<p>The moral think to do, the right thing to do, is to not fund the people that seeking to increase economic profits are tearing our society apart.<p>&gt; diversity of opinions<p>What make your country great is the diversity of cultures and  people. And that is what many are attacking, believing that only &quot;one culture&quot;, &quot;one religion&quot; should be allowed in the USA. My money should not go to fund that ideology, you may have your opinion, but I do not have to pay to spread it.')
