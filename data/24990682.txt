I can also see raising one you didnt make as a thing. I dont see making such a commitment with a platonic other as much of a thing.<p>A cynical way to see the woman in the article is that she went and had a good time with the wrong guy - whom she was attracted to - and now is literally looking for a &quot;nice guy&quot; to help raise <i>her</i> kid.
