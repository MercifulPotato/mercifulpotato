I can&#x27;t agree with you more about smothering the planet in mostly-unnecessary stuff.  I&#x27;m truly fed up with the fact that almost every appliance or bit of gear we buy is designed with a short limited life and not meant to be serviced.  No wonder the world is awash with e-waste and similar broken&#x2F;junked stuff.  Once, just about every bit of electronics I bought or owned I could fix, now I can&#x27;t even open up gear without smashing my way inside because it&#x27;s glued up or snapped shut with  one-use-only one-way snap-lock catches, etc. It&#x27;s a damn disgrace.<p>Two weeks ago the USB socket on my Netgear modem became intermittent and I literally had to smash my way through the plastic case to get inside to gain access to the circuit board.  Unfortunately, in doing so I damaged something else which (I think) has rendered it useless (I&#x27;ll know for sure when I get a chance to take a microscope to the PWA).  The fact remains that I haven&#x27;t been able change a 20 cent socket and to save time I&#x27;ve had to buy a new device!<p>It seems to me that green and ecological movements should do more in this area to stop the millions of tons of e-wasteâ€”and getting behind Right to Repair movements is a good place to start.')
