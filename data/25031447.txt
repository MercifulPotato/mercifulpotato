The observed discontinuities in the contested states could be explained simply by the sequence in which these states processed their mail-in ballots (i.e. ballots mailed from cities were processed later), but the fact that so many of them changed in the middle of the night on election night, while not evidence of anything by itself, is what I referred to as being “a little fishy”.<p>As a counterexample, Kansas appears to have hit a batch from a metro area shortly before midnight on election night, too.')
