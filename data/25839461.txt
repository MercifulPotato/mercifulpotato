I really only wanted 3 axes and considered the older one you linked to (which isn&#x27;t marked &#x27;retired&#x27;, but is &quot;out of stock&quot;).  The first thing I&#x27;d mention is that the older board doesn&#x27;t support the new style of drivers (old = TI DRV8825, new = Trinamic SPI).  SPI drivers are much nicer for a number of reasons, in particular you can change the motor current via software, and with the trinamics there&#x27;s support for stallguard.<p>In my case I&#x27;m not building a CNC, but controlling the axes of a microscope (X, Y, Z) plus the intensity of the illuminator and likely several other things, so the 6-pack (which I also use on my CNC) had what I wanted.<p>Oh, you can also use either onboard or external motor drivers with the 6-pack- external motor drivers are good for NEMA23 and other large motors.')
