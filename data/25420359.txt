Employers tell us literally every day they want students who truly understand the development and release cycle, and work on teams. We created a mentor&#x2F;mentee program where every student has a chance to do that, and the result of that program so clearly creates better outcomes that employers ask specifically for students who have done that. Some students love it. Some students see it as one more thing distracting them from writing more code,<p>The complaints i have seen around mentors  in this thread and those linked are <i>not</i> that they don&#x27;t see the user of a mentor&#x2F;mentee program, but conversely that their mentor was not qualified or good at it. That&#x27;s very different, they like the mentor&#x2F;mentee program in theory, they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s well executed.<p>Anyway, with 2000 students enrolled, it&#x27;s possible that  some groups&#x2F;courses&#x2F;teams&#x2F;classes&#x2F;whatever you call them are worse than others. We may only hear from those in the worst. But then the question is, how do you find out about these &quot;failing&quot; teams quickly, and how do you correct them, so those students still get the quality you aspire for. It&#x27;s kind of too late after they&#x27;ve had months of a bad experience, they won&#x27;t get those months back, of their lives, or of your program.  What systems are in place to do that; what systems might be possible?<p>Because the other disturbing thing in linked threads is students who tried to contact you to say the teachers&#x2F;lessons&#x2F;other devices weren&#x27;t up to your standards, and could not get an ear.')
