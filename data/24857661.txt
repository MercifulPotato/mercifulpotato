Then I got sepsis after the operation and was in the high-dependency unit (US equivalent is ICU I think?) for a bit. That was fun. I was there for a few days, but remember about 2 hours of it. My family visited apparently, I had no idea, but I was talking to them, so I&#x27;m told.<p>I couldn&#x27;t walk for weeks, other than staggering around (which they encourage you to do otherwise the scar tissue will heal too tight). The wound took about 3 months to properly close up, I had a nice deep hole in my abdomen for much of that, you get used to the gory stuff.<p>I&#x27;m generally better now though. Crohn&#x27;s still dictates much of my daily life though, but you learn to live with it.')
