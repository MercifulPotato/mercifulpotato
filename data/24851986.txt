There&#x27;s an entire ecosystem built around the fact that while Python itself is slow, it can very easily interface with native code (Numpy, Scipy, OpenCV) with very little overhead.<p>So sure, you can make Python much faster, if you&#x27;re willing to piss off the very Python users who care the most about performance in the first place (the data science &#x2F; ML people and anyone else using native extensions).')
