But the 2020 numbers amount to a jump of about 15%, and could go higher once all the deaths from this month are counted.</i><p>One thing the article doesn&#x27;t say is the size of the usual &#x27;expected&#x27; increase, but if I recall correctly it&#x27;s about 2%. So a 15% jump would be large.<p>The big question is why is the US so much more badly affected than other places. Sweden, which famously did very little, is on track to see a small increase of perhaps 2%-3% this year over 2018, or just a few thousand deaths, almost not noticeable on the scale of a country.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;525353&#x2F;sweden-number-of-deaths&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;525353&#x2F;sweden-number-of-...</a><p>NB: 2019 in Sweden was the least deadly year for a decade which is one reason comparisons of Sweden vs Norway etc are misleading: the question is not &quot;why did Sweden have higher deaths than Norway in 2020&quot; because it would have done anyway, simply due to catching up from 2019. The question is &quot;why is 2020 going to be a normal year in so many countries but not the USA&quot;?')
