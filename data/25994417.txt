When I was younger, I remembered the grey haired hackers that were a little abrasive, knew their stuff and didn&#x27;t take crap from their employer...and that&#x27;s starting to resonate with me.<p>And I&#x27;m really not sure I have a forum of people I can talk to about it. It&#x27;s not something you want to volunteer at work, and it&#x27;s not something someone who isn&#x27;t in IT might fully understand.<p>There&#x27;s a little anxiety in that I&#x27;ve still got a decade or so before retirement and am afraid of being left behind....but when you learn your 7th SIEM, they all kinda look the same after awhile, and most of the administration is getting sewn up behind the scenes in the cloud.<p>OR should I just suck it up?')
