Position of elevator (the little thumb you traditionally drag up or down) shows where I&#x27;m at relative to the beginning and end of the content.<p>2. Size of elevator in relation to the scrollbar tells me what percentage of the content is viewable (except when the size of the elevator becomes so small it makes it unusable).<p>3. Up and down buttons allow a simple way to bring the next or previous item into view.<p>A lot of the hate of scrollbars comes from the web, where browser scrollbars could not be styled and didn&#x27;t necessarily use the operating system&#x27;s style.
