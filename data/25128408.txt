Local state is sticky, it collects garbage, and it becomes stale very quickly.<p>Doing something complex in git with a local repository is usually not the thing you want. What you want is to fix some garbage state you added to a local. Hence, turning it off and turning it back on, instead of pushing garbage state into the central flow.')
