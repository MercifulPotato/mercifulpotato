It’s important to demand transparent free speech policies across the board for everyone. Like other big tech companies, Apple also censors content that doesn’t align with their progressive biases. They’ve banned numerous conservative apps from their App Store, and have threatened to ban others (example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thegatewaypundit.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;tech-tyranny-apple-threatens-to-kick-social-media-company-parler-off-app-store-if-they-dont-ban-offensive-conservative-content&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thegatewaypundit.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;tech-tyranny-apple-...</a>). They’ve also engaged in the cultural wars more directly by doing things like replacing the gun emoji with the squirt gun emoji (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.emojipedia.org&#x2F;apple-and-the-gun-emoji&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.emojipedia.org&#x2F;apple-and-the-gun-emoji&#x2F;</a>). At this rate I will be unsurprised when Apple decides to start blocking certain websites across their devices for wrongspeak.')
