Luckily it was acute enough at times that it was hard for me to believe it was all mental. But that still didn’t stop the sheer force of multiple doctors claiming psychosomatic origins, even flipping my own parents partially in believing that. By the end of it all, I was just about convinced it was mental. I did have a ton of anxiety, it was impossible to figure out the causality.<p>Ultimately, a genetic test revealed it was a rare autoimmune disorder that causes a wide variety of hard to pin down inflammation-related pain.<p>I had already come up with a ton of coping mechanisms, and was halfway to accepting it was “just me” or “anxiety”. I’m so glad I finally found what it was, because it would have been devastating to have convinced myself all that was my fault without even any clear genesis.<p>Not to say yours isn’t. But it makes me wonder: we have no idea the complexity and incidence of smaller phenotypical irregularities that lead to any number of “minor pains” that get ultimately interpreted as “anxiety disorders”. You may even be anxious - who wouldn’t, with an unresolved medical issue spanning years - but you may also have some imbalances driving it that are hard to pin down.')
