Obviously these are my words and likely further explanation could be redefined in other terms based on ones understanding however I have done this several times before with extreme security and efficiency in mind at every decision made, AUTOMATION because PEOPLE ARE THE PROBLEM. My background is payments, finance and banking which I need not elaborate the security that has been in this arena alone for quite some time but anyone nowadays, even a 7 year old, can use any search engine and find a recent breach referencing lost financial information and EVERYONE reading this has likely been issued multiple new credit cards or worse. There are several people and companies working towards unikernels and the like but my jam, and always has been, is to apply the new way of thinking to a business, a serial puzzle master if you will.<p>In short you are correct in using ONLY GO for absolutely EVERYTHING to reduce technical debt, ZERO TRUST architecture, automated everything and much much more. Might sound like hogwash to some but once more, if my past is an indication of my future as I love a challenge.<p>It is what you cannot see that matters most.')
