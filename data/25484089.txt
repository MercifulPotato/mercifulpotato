I wasn&#x27;t talking about it being unfair to those who paid off their debt already&#x2F;got &quot;killed by the trolley&quot;, but those who didn&#x27;t go to college because it was too expensive, or lived at home, went to community college for two years, and then transferred to a state school so that they didn&#x27;t have to take on debt. Now their tax dollars would go to help pay off the debts of everyone who went to expensive private colleges, many of whom come from much wealthier families.<p>Rather than forgiveness, we should make the debt dischargeable via bankruptcy. It should&#x27;ve never been made non-dischargeable (though it did help reduce interest rates, and enable more people to get them, that also upped the amount schools could charge, and made it so loan officers didn&#x27;t have to consider the creditworthiness of the applicant, and their plan for repayment). It should be something that passes a need bar before essentially foisting the cost on society, and bankruptcy is a mechanism for doing exactly that.<p>Use the money toward making public universities free, and expand the public university system, as well as trade schools. Thatâ€™s really how you save all those future people tied to those tracks.')
