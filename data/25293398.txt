Watching a movie at home simply isn&#x27;t an equivalent replacement and it has nothing to do with the size of the screen.  Going to the theater is a social experience.  You simply can&#x27;t replicate the experience of seeing Captain American catch Thor&#x27;s hammer in a sold out crowd on opening weekend.  Also going to a theater is a purpose driven choice in a way watching a movie at home is not.  It allows you to focus all your attention on a movie that simply can&#x27;t easily be replicated at home.')
