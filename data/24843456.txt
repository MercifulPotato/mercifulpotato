Additionally, if I open something between different apps, there is no integrated way to annotate at a layer above documents.<p>- What do you envision as a proper interface for digital exploration? \n- Will it allow for digesting multiple sources at once?\n- What will annotation, tagging and relations between documents look like?<p>There are references to &quot;structured content&quot; and the organic &quot;building up [of] knowledge&quot; in the Beam-ifesto.  The most ready structure that I have been working with is a network of nodes, each representing a unit of digital data (a document), which can be found by file URL or by http URL. To relate these nodes, one could form &quot;node structures&quot; that abstract multiple nodes into a structure of some form (list, table, group, hierarchal links, etc). This offers abstraction and composability between digital concepts.  While this may be private, I&#x27;m curious how you are picturing the &quot;database&quot; aspect of your product.<p>- Are you drawing at all from what we know about neural storage in your development of a &quot;digital database&quot;?\n- How are you enumerating the possible relational structures for multiple objects?')
