Especially in the low-power segment, which AMD and nvidia have really ignored lately.<p>If you want a &lt;=75 watt GPU, which happens to be the limit for the PCIe slot without an external power connector, you have very limited options. For nVidia, the 1650 is the only modern part that will fit the bill. For AMD, you have to reach back to the RX 500 series, but good luck finding one. They&#x27;re extremely uncommon even among the lower-end 500 series, as many of them require an external connector anyways.<p>AMD do have lower-powered &quot;workstation&quot; offerings, but they&#x27;re so expensive that it&#x27;s hard to imagine putting one in a workstation voluntarily. They&#x27;re also extremely poor performers, to the extent that you might not really see much of a benefit over a Vega iGPU.<p>The Xe Max is only 25W TDP, which is very attractive if you&#x27;re hoping to build a passively cooled Linux machine with a low-wattage power supply.')
