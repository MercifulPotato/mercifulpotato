I’d posit it’s entirely driven by viewing money as a measure, it’s your score in the game of life. At least for lots of other people I’ve met, hustling more equates to wanting to feel superior to people around you, to demand that respect because you have a high score.<p>I’d also posit the OP intuitively understands this and is why they’re looking to “fix” it, why they think this is a problem because it feels like it should be one. And I personally agree, there’s no added meaning to life if you’re only looking to be better than those around you. One day I imagine you’ll realize there’s no winning or losing, there’s just life. It goes on.<p>I think mindfulness can address a lot of the concerns here.')
