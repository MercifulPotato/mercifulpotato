The density of that abstraction is definitely uncorrelated to the amount of whitespace.  Thus, scrolling is only going to be an issue for the first couple of reads.<p>Second, say your patented steganography mechanism manages to fit 3x the amount of &quot;code&quot; in the same terminal size (and I am being generous). Is this going to increase &quot;code reuse&quot; by any significant amount?')
