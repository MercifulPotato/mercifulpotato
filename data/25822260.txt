Regular social media platforms like Facebook have a single point of failure. If their servers go down, your content goes down with it.<p>Recently had a discussion broken into nonsensical fragments because one of the participants was banned.<p>&gt; Reason 2: It can&#x27;t be censored. Even if everything someone says is controversial nonsense, it is still in his good right to express his thoughts.<p>Only the admins have rights on their servers, as it should be. And if you run an instance which doesn&#x27;t publicly state that it blocks right-wing servers, you&#x27;ll be blocked by some of the big players, a move which is another step that the wider Fediverse is taking towards silencing a lot of speech. Granted, I don&#x27;t want to hear most &#x2F;any of it, but the author has conveniently omitted mention of this emergent behaviour.<p>&gt; Reason 4: It respects your privacy<p>Admins can read everything you post on their instance, including DMs.<p>&gt;Reason 5: It&#x27;s all about the community<p>Until you say the wrong thing in the earshot of the wrong user and find yourself banned, with no idea why and silence when you try to follow the procedure to regain access. I&#x27;ve never tiptoed around a service like I do the Fediverse.<p>I like the Fediverse. It&#x27;s full of interesting people and discussions, art and humour and folk exchanging ideas but it&#x27;s the utopia demonstrated by the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode &quot;Justice&quot;. One wrong move and there may be no discussion about what you may have done wrong, no questions as to what your speech meant, the justice is simply executed. At least there&#x27;s always another instance, until user reputation is added.')
