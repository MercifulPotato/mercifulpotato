I remember reading a Wall Street Journal article entitled &quot;The Radium Water Worked Fine Until His Jaw Came Off&quot; [1].  I can&#x27;t find a WSJ reprint, but there are online copies available by searching the headline or a CNN article mentions it. [2]<p>Apparently Mr. Byers the maker and an avid drinker of the cola had to be buried in a lead-lined coffin. According to The New York Times [3], Mr. Byers&#x27; death triggered action from the FDA and brought an end to radioactive patent medicines.<p>From the CNN article:<p><i>Evans was an expert at measuring and mathematically modeling the human body&#x27;s uptake and excretion of radioactivity. Based on Byers&#x27; self-reported RadiThor consumption, Evans&#x27; model had predicted that Byers&#x27; body would contain about 100,000 becquerel of radioactivity. (&quot;Becquerel&quot; is an international unit of radioactivity.) What he found was that Byers&#x27; skeletal remains actually had a total of 225,000 becquerel, suggesting that either Evans&#x27; model of radiation uptake was underestimating radium&#x27;s affinity for bone, or alternatively, that Byers had actually understated his personal RadiThor consumption by a factor of at least two. It was not possible to determine which alternative accounted for the discrepancy.</i><p>For the sake of comparison, some water from the Fukushima disaster reads 200,000 becquerel, although different isotopes are involved and exposure limits vary by isotope, Mr. Byers was well beyond a reasonable limit by any measure.
