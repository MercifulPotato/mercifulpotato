I couldn&#x27;t stand up straight for months. Laying in the MRI machine long enough to get a good image was excruciating. Just getting comfortable each night to sleep was an exercise in frustration. Narcotic painkillers didn&#x27;t really help me, but a pain that never goes away helped me understand how people do get addicted to pills.<p>Finally, I had one of those injections directly on my spine and it was like magic. I walked into the appointment and couldn&#x27;t stand up straight and walked out like I had never been hurt. For weeks, I would wake up each morning and dread getting out of bed because I wondered would this be the morning the pain came back.<p>It&#x27;s been years now, and knock on wood, I hope to never have a problem again. I was always a weight lifter, but stopped powerlifting (maxing things like DLs), and stopped playing basketball. I still exercise a lot, but my entire focus now  is on longevity. Strength is still a key component, but so is flexibility and learning proper movement.')
