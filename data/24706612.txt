The reality is that we live in the era of &#x27;big government&#x27;. Until we have figured out a solution to make government smaller without causing poverty to skyrocket, then we have to assume that the government is going to be running the show; as such, it needs to ensure the well-being of all its stakeholders (citizens) and it needs to treat all of its citizens equally.<p>The government should have full permission to break up companies that it sees as too big. It should also have the power to shut down corporations at will (in the same way that corporations can shut down internal projects that don&#x27;t align with shareholder incentives).<p>The government needs to rise up and take ownership of the economy. We live in crony-capitalism and in this system, it&#x27;s better to put power in the hands of the government where the cronyism is more evenly distributed and is subjected to the necessary checks and balances.')
