Just userspace emulation. So, why can&#x27;t RISC-V be a sandbox? It&#x27;s just loading a normal ELF into a virtual memory.<p>The first point is news to me, but I suppose you can build anything you want in an open ISA too. It looks like each object is like a shared object with an import and export table that connects things together, so the host would have to have a &quot;modern&quot; variant of a dynamic loader. It sounds like it would be painful to support that without an established way of doing it, that is standardized. So, guess I agree.')
