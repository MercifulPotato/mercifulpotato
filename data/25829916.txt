Sure, they haven&#x27;t beaten the S&amp;P500 straight up, but their volatility and max drawdown has been so good that you could have used leverage with them and gotten a portfolio that easily beats the S&amp;P500 with as good or better volatility.<p>The problem for me going forward is that these returns for the last 40 years have been do to falling interest rates.  Can the rates keep falling?  A little bit more. Will they go negative like some other countries? Maybe? But at some point I have to wonder if this strategy is still viable.')
