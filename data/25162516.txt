Though admittedly it&#x27;s hard to find if that is the case in some of the historical examples.<p>&gt; shows a profound lack of respect for the realities of working in one of the harshest and most unforgiving environments on the planet<p>Why? If you commit human beings to an environment you either allow the conditions that will keep them sane, or you call the whole thing off. As soon as you decide the difficulty is surmountable, you lose this excuse, because <i>not</i> doing it is also an option.<p>Would you build a station without a toilet or food? Then why not extra space? Skipping both will save money&#x2F;effort, yet &quot;there&#x27;s more to living than just surviving&quot; - both are requirements.
