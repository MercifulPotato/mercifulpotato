It&#x27;s okay to not be interested in what&#x27;s premiering on Netflix, but maybe a &quot;let and let live&quot; approach to people being interested in things you don&#x27;t care about would yield better outcomes.<p>Put a different way: You&#x27;re essentially self-alienating yourself from a lot of people. Relationships are more readily formed and maintained when you don&#x27;t knock people for their harmless interests. I don&#x27;t care much about sports but I understand other people do and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, and sometimes you find that socializing over a game can actually be enjoyable if you&#x27;re not negatively predisposed.')
