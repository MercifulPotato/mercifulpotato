Same superstition that chooses filenames without spaces and prevents putting &quot;.&quot; in your path.<p>Thing is - I think maybe decoupling the user interface from the scripting language <i>should</i> be more of a thing.  People don&#x27;t have as much trouble switching out their terminal emulator (a way of taking up the slack).<p>Maybe the way to a better UI while maintaining compatibility would be to choose a good &quot;user interface&quot; shell and maybe exporting SHELL=&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash so scripts run?')
