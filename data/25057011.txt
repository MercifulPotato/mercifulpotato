The mitochondria look far too small to me. For the ER which is similarly small it is quite clear that it&#x27;s only showing a tiny subsection. In other parts the scale looks pretty good. And it does manage to convey how busy cells are a bit better than many visualizations.<p>For the audience here it might be worth emphasizing that these are pretty close zooms on cells, you can see individual proteins here. If you imagine an image of a cell, each visualization shown here is maybe a single pixel of that full image of a cell (I&#x27;m probably off by an order of magnitude here or two).')
