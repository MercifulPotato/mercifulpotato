It absolutely fails to make a point.<p>It&#x27;s not like up-scaling stuff with neural networks is going to introduce a random mobile phone into the medium being upscaled or introduce any other glaring misrepresentations. The upscaling is purely for improving quality.<p>Accuracy of the colors is rather secondary. And if anything, historians should just help out if they can.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time watching upscaled&amp;colorized videos on YT, and I&#x27;m just mesmerized.
