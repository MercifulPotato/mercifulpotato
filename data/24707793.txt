The experts in floating point arithmetic, each having years of real-world experience, came together and hashed-out a standard embodying their collective experience. Yes, it&#x27;s complicated. Yes, you need to learn it. No, you&#x27;re highly unlikely to come up with anything better. Moreover, even if you <i>did</i> come up with something better it WILL have bugs, there WILL be edge cases that catch everyone by surprise. So instead of using a standard having 35 years worth of collective experience, whose edge cases are well-known, whose implementation is literally etched in silicon, and thousands upon thousands of libraries utilizing it - we&#x27;d rather start over and re-invent. That way we can spend the next 35 years uncovering a whole new and unknown set of issues. Sigh.')
