But after several months, we finally got them on the phone, and they said &quot;we&#x27;ll refund.  it may take X days&quot;.  X+30 days later we had no movement, called again. and they said there was no record, and then offered to refund - but only a partial amount (they weren&#x27;t seeing extra fee charges on their end).  Too much back and forth, but over 8 months after booking, and close to 4 months of calls and waiting, we got refunded, without having to file a chargeback.')
