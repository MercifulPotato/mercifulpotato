It’s relevant because as soon as it’s clear the emperor has no clothes you <i>wont</i> be able to redeem it at any exchanges because it’s garbage.<p>&gt; Sounds like a great way to make a lot of money. Tether is currently trading 1:1 with USD (yes, even at exchanges that offer real USD). It should be easy to short-sell a bunch of tether, and buy it back when in collapses. And unlike short-selling stocks, your downside should be relatively low as tethers can&#x27;t realistically go above their current price.<p>All crypto exchanges are rigged casinos. The only way to win is not to play.<p>Tether absolutely swings up and down depending on how many people are fleeing into or out of cryptos at any given moment. We’ve seen like +5-7% and -20%. That’s enough to blow away any leveraged position.<p>Finally, of course, you neglect counterparty risk. I have to put up collateral on this short which any of these exchanges could simply run for the hills with, as they do, <i>regularly</i>. Seriously, who lets you short Tether except for Bitfinex - and what will they pay you out in, more Tether? They don’t have a bank account. That’s why they invented Tether.')
