The algebraic properties of complex numbers make it a very natural way to express quantum mechanics.<p>I believe 3Blue1Brown has some good videos on the topic - you really need to learn about complex numbers separately to really see the magic of them (It&#x27;s largely visual, so it&#x27;s hard to transmit via text)<p>Edit: The book &quot;Visual Complex Analysis&quot; is very good if you resonate with its approach - I personally simply cannot click with almost any geometry, so it wasn&#x27;t really for me although I appreciate that it&#x27;s really very nice.')
