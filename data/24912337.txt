You&#x27;ve confirmed it. Statement supported not by fact but by inner voice. My morale stems from Christianity, I believe Enlightenment got it right — discovery of nature is discovery of God. I&#x27;ve been to church, I&#x27;ve seen priest who shared joy. I&#x27;ve seen other priests, I would rather not see them.<p>X.Org developer described what&#x27;s wrong with the project [1]. Not one of the Wayland critiques addressed his points. They have no facts, they just want it to fail. Those who work hard and share for free get anger in return. Sway &#x2F; wlroots maintainer (ddevault) got off the edge from this misinformation and I do not agree with him but I am not maintainer either. Where is love and God in this story?<p>&gt; That’s not even considering any personal goals, which I have vanishingly little time for. I get zero exercise, and though my diet is mostly reasonable the majority of it is delivery unless I get the odd 2 hours to visit the grocery store. That is, unless I want to spend those 2 hours with my friends, which means it’s back to delivery. My dating life is almost nonexistent. I want to spend more time studying Japanese, but it’s either that or keeping up with my leisure reading. Lofty goals of also studying Chinese or Arabic are but dust in the wind. I’m addicted to caffeine, again.<p>&gt; Less healthy ways have included walking to the corner store to buy unhealthy comfort foods, consuming alcohol or weed too much or too often, getting in stupid internet arguments, being mean to my friends and colleagues, and googling myself to read negative comments.

Because of such work I have Linux and I am grateful for it, but no mob wants to finish them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GWQh_DmDLKQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GWQh_DmDLKQ</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24896917" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24896917</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drewdevault.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;21&#x2F;Stress-and-happiness.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drewdevault.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;21&#x2F;Stress-and-happiness.html</a>')
