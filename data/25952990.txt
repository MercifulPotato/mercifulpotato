After building Chrome Extensions for recruiters and marketers, we got a glimpse of the power of browser extensions. However, we also got a taste of how hard extensions are to create. This led us down a path of exploring whether companies were interested in building custom internal extensions.<p>We studied hundreds of custom internal extensions that companies are using today. We&#x27;ve seen companies extend legacy internal tools to increase development speed, create context-aware tools that surface info employees need wherever they are. We&#x27;ve even seen extensions add missing features to purchased software. After synthesizing into a few modes, we set out to build an easier way to create internal extensions.<p>Come say hi! We are excited to meet you and hopefully help you build some extensions too!<p>Kevin, Will, James')
