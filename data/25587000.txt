It became pretty popular, but I felt uncomfortable about monetizing it bc my interest in drug regulation really is mostly intellectual&#x2F;libertarian and as a parent I didn&#x27;t really want to take money from the marijuana industry. I eventually shut the blog down prior to legalization of marijuana. (I had thought the blog would help me build my practice as an appellate attorney, but that part did not pan out.) I think if I had had different values I could have made a tremendous amount of money, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.')
