Then I tried adding a friend, and it only let me add them by email, not by phone number, so that fully disqualifies the app as a phone messenger application.<p>What good is a phone messenger app if I can&#x27;t send someone a message on their phone number?<p>Signal just works, I use it as my day to day sms app, and it shows me who of my friends also have signal so I text them on messenger if they do, and WhatsApp if they don&#x27;t.<p>So the real reason is Matrix just isn&#x27;t even trying to compete with signal or WhatsApp, it&#x27;s competing with MSN Messenger, which everyone stopped using over 15 years ago.')
