The example I was given by a friend who is well versed in martial arts:<p>&gt; You are threatened by someone for your wallet. First and foremost, place your wallet on the ground, and run like hell when they bend over to pick it up. If they step over the wallet, incapacitate <i>then</i> run like hell.<p>The &quot;step over the wallet&quot; moment is when the decision is made that if you don&#x27;t do something, you&#x27;re probably going to be killed.<p>&gt; if you&#x27;re cornered and there&#x27;s an unbalanced distribution of force, you&#x27;re kind of screwed regardless of what you do.<p>This is where martial arts and self defense come it in. No matter how big the other person is, it&#x27;s really hard to catch up to someone running away with a broken knee.')
