Being succinct is important because filler buries your talking points and bores readers into quitting.</i><p>I find it harder to understand as well. I do get it but I see that a lot of my fellow non-native speakers will struggle with this kind of writing. Second sentence is way more complex then the whole original paragraph. &quot;Succint&quot;, &quot;filler&quot;, &quot;buries&quot;, &quot;bores into quitting&quot; - whoah. Give me a breath, please! Is this an articatle on how to write good looking text, or easy to understand text? At first glance I though it was supposed to ilustrate the exact opposite of what it tries to ilustrate.<p>The whole first page is composed of only bullet points and it requires a lot of focus and effort to go through. I had no urge to click to the next page after that introduction. Is it grandiose (had to google that), or do they treat me like an idiot? Bizarre.<p>It&#x27;s like reading a list of quotes from famous people. If you would read it aloud after 3 or 4 of these I&#x27;m done. Next ones could be a dinner recipe - I might not notice.<p>When I write to much and too fast (like now I am, sorry!) I like to remind myself how authors write on sites for beginners in a particular language [0][1]. It&#x27;s clean and doesn&#x27;t treat me like an idiot.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nachrichtenleicht.de&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nachrichtenleicht.de&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sr.de&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sr.de&#x2F;</a>')
