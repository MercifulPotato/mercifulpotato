This chat here might have (imaginary?) value to its participants but its absolute value is in application, if we are not going to do anything with it and the result is similar enough to not having the communication then we might as well [say] dance around the camp fire?<p>You could stretch the definition in the other direction too: if you crush an ant with your finger or put a spoon of honey next to their city you&#x27;ve communicated something. If you crush enough of them and they attack you we got ourselves an exchange in a language both parties understand.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t attribute to much value to any definition that desires to define communication as an impossibility. Sure it could be done but such sour mind is best avoided.')
