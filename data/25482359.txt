Yes, the main stream media does have certain biases that may swing what they choose to report on, and how they choose to report it.<p>But fundamentally the main stream media still <i>cares</i> about fact and truth. When confronted with evidence the story was falsified, the NYTimes convened an investigation, issued a retraction, returned the Peabody, and reassigned the reporter. You may argue &quot;too little, too late&quot;, but they addressed their mistake.<p>Compare that with much of the &quot;alternative&quot; media, that when presented with clear evidence of fraud or lies, usually just doubles down and screams those lies on repeat.')
