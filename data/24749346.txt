And by &#x27;antagonizing&#x27; I mean almost everyone - Iran has no friends, other than other toxic regimes such as North Korea, Venezuela etc. wherein said partnership depends only on their mutual hostility to basically everyone around them.<p>US actions are reasonable and proportionate here. The Quds can use &#x27;.ir&#x27; all they want.')
