You care more about managing larger codebase, having easy access to whole lot of frameworks and libraries, good development tools and easy development &#x2F; deployment process.<p>Developers who have experience with Java are inevitably people who have mostly had experience with those kinds of projects of which I would say most are corporate backend systems or Android applications. It really is difficult to find any other projects.<p>On the other C is inflicted pain of having much harder development environment for the size of the project. You only use low level language like C when you have a specific need. Maybe you need to develop Set Top Box software, or video codec, or some device controller, or high performance quant library, that kind of stuff.<p>So it isn&#x27;t really fault of Java developers to not know the stuff. It is natural result of Java being suited to a different type of projects than C is.')
