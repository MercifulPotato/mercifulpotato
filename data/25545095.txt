Because if so, it seems like you&#x27;re wrong there. They allow browsers on the app store, which can access the whole (unmoderated) web, so it can&#x27;t be about moderation. Seems like they just don&#x27;t want anyone to create an &quot;app store&quot; within their App Store. Either that, or they&#x27;re trying to keep competition at bay while they develop Apple Arcade. Maybe there&#x27;s a better explanation that I&#x27;m missing.')
