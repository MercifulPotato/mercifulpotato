Both technical, deeper hardware integration and finer control, and non-technical, a very large market &amp; various financing offerings (for exclusives in particular)<p>Apple offers nothing here by contrast. Metal is a fine API on its own merits, but it&#x27;s not offering the game developer anything but more work at the end of the day. And the market size is a joke for MacOS &amp; games that would compete with consoles.<p>&gt; But it&#x27;s already starting at the hardware, embedded Intel GPUs don&#x27;t cut it for gaming.<p>Macbooks have had above average GPUs for a long, long time. It hasn&#x27;t helped with MacOS gaming so far, why would you expect it to now?')
