When they ask, I tell them it&#x27;s because I do not like where &quot;modern&quot; browsers (and software in general, but that&#x27;s another can of worms...) are going. IE11 is the latest browser to have things like user stylesheets and per-zone security configuration by default. It&#x27;s a small rebellion, but nonetheless an act of opposition to the increasing corporate monopolisation and bloat of the web.')
