If anything, I think many one-man SaaS will benefit from using k8s.  That&#x27;s the superpower of k8s, one person can go from 1node to 1000nodes if they need that scaling with minimal effort.  Cobbling together shell scripts and tools for one or two servers is just as much work as using k8s, so long as you don&#x27;t run your own and use a managed service.   Best of luck, I think your list is pretty reasonable.')
