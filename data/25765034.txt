If you can&#x27;t speak out about the government&#x27;s use of its monopoly, then abuses multiply as history shows.<p>I think most people support private forms of censorship. You wouldn&#x27;t want me coming in your house and screaming at you, right? You wouldn&#x27;t want a white supremacist coming in to where you were work and screaming hateful things at your coworkers right? You wouldn&#x27;t want to go into a bar where obnoxious people are starting fights with everyone right? By the same token, there are literally hundreds of thousands of social media sites and if some of them don&#x27;t want abhorrent behavior on their platform, that should just be their decision.')
