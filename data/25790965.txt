Humans aren&#x27;t necessarily able to know purely from the experience itself if something is healthier than something else for them, we&#x27;re more wired to detect if something is problematic or not and also prone to a whole lot of suggestion. While the tasting test seems to show that the immediate experience isn&#x27;t conclusively discernible, it doesn&#x27;t tell us anything about long-term health effects (understandably so, they&#x27;re not egg-researchers dedicating decade-long funding to figure that one out!).')
