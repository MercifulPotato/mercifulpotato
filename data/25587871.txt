I&#x27;ll see what we can do.<p>But keep in mind that the showcase page isn&#x27;t there to sell the games. It is there to show that professional games have been released using Defold. And to show to that you can be productive and release games when you use Defold. Screenshots or illustrations does not matter in this case. Neither says anything about the quality of the engine. And we opted for illustrations as that works better on a showcase page.')
