They can&#x27;t cross the distance to observe us, even robots take so long to arrive that their star dies before it gets here (not to mention our star was still forming when they sent the probe out...)<p>They cannot observe us directly, light just doesn&#x27;t have that resolution at the distance.  They can&#x27;t observe our radio waves because our radio waves are only 100 light years out, not to mention the signal strength fades with distance.')
