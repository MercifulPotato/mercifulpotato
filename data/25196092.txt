I&#x27;d expect this to win big for algorithms that are bound by communication overhead where scaling beyond a certain number of GPUs is not giving any additional benefit. fixed grid weather simulations come to mind. since such systems, including power and cooling, are in the millions also, there might be a market for this.')
