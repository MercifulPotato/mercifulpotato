If an application asks for scopes=[profile] then the OAuth provider has two choices -- categorically deny it, or ask you to authorize it.  They all ask you to authorize it, and you can say no, and then the app doesn&#x27;t work because the developers decided that you can&#x27;t use their app unless you give them your profile information.<p>The app could easily ask you to check a checkbox next to each scope, and then write separate code for each combination of checkboxes.  They decided not to do that because it&#x27;s probably not worth your business if you don&#x27;t want to give them full access.  (Honestly, I click a lot of things on HN that ask for way too many scopes, and then I close the window and forget what it was.  But the calculation was done -- they don&#x27;t need me as a user or customer.  I can live with that.)<p>I guess what people want is an IDP that will give applications fake data when you deny a scope.  But no application developer wants to deal with that complexity, so they&#x27;d never integrate a provider that does that.  (They probably moved away from email+password because of all the fake emails that people provide.)<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s mandatory for iOS apps to use Apple&#x27;s sign-in which auto-generates a fake email address for you.  So I suppose some progress is being made.  (I have an iPhone but I&#x27;ve never seen this supposedly mandatory OAuth provider.  I only know about it from reading HN.  So maybe it doesn&#x27;t actually exist?  I have no idea really.)')
