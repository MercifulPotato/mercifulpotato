Item(by='vacheron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607458562, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25339042, text='&gt; They weren&#x27;t willing to give the city a chance and instead always wanted to change it to be more bland or more like somewhere else.<p>I&#x27;ve found this statement to be the complete opposite for myself and many SFBA migrants. I came to the SFBA without too many expectations, but found the city to be an extremely boring place. If you&#x27;re young and single, the night life is depressing. Hiking and outdoorsy activities are good, but many other cities do it better. SF is the only place where anything actually happens, and the surrounding Bay Area just seems completely devoid of life.<p>This isn&#x27;t even to mention the homelessness problems within the city. I haven&#x27;t seen the situation improve at all over the past 5+ years despite effectively paying half of my gross income to taxes. If you complain about it, people will just tell you to &quot;donate money then bub&quot; as if the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars we pay to the state every year isn&#x27;t expected to make a difference.<p>I gave SF a chance. Been everywhere worth going, done most major hikes, even expanded my interests and hobbies. I&#x27;ve lived in over 6 US cities now (and a few Canadian and European cities) and SF is both the least interesting and the least comfortable to live in.')
