Interestingly enough, our identity tracking mechanisms actually make it easier to delete users and purge _all_ of their data in the same way it makes unifying all their data for analysis easier in the first place.<p>When a GDPR request comes in through our API, we search for the matching user in our database. If we find a matching user, we&#x27;ll look in our Identity system (&#x27;s union-find data structure) to find all the other user_ids which were associated with that canonical identity. Then we&#x27;ll go through and delete all the data for every constituent user. This is essentially a reverse look up (find the set of user_ids for a canonical user_id&#x2F;identity) and is easy to execute.')
