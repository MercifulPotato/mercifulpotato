It&#x27;s written entirely in Go, and so was its predecessor and everything I&#x27;ve done since 2012. Go is a phenomenal language and I&#x27;m not really sure where I&#x27;d be without it, my company basically wouldn&#x27;t exist, I wouldn&#x27;t be solving the problems I am. Its a phenomenal language and I owe a great deal of gratitude to the Go team for that.<p>The future is bright for Go, it is for sure the language that defines Cloud development for backend services and APIs. It has spawned an ecosystem of docker, kubernetes and beyond and countless companies have come to rely on it for their software. It is amazing achievement to see something go from nothing to this. It is unclear whether it would have had the same success had it not been for being within Google, but that&#x27;s just part of it.')
