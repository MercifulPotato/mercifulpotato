I totally get the desire for a language with maximum precision and lack of ambiguity, but no one has ever been able to do that successfully.<p>I think it&#x27;s reasonable to wonder if its even possible.<p>One thing that feeds into it, and is due to the poor way we teach language, is that people think that dictionaries prescribe how we should use language.  But that&#x27;s not what dictionaries are.<p>Dictionaries are descriptive, recording how people are using language.<p>This is a very important distinction.<p>Instead of trying to remove the possibility of ambiguity from language, we should instead focus on gaining the skills to reduce ambiguity through discourse, which we are extremely bad at.')
