This came about because of a much deeper problem and what you are doing is a great example of why we are here. This is about the censorship and the arrogance that has lead us to where we are today. I and many others have been censored for having arbitrary opinions that donâ€™t fit the narrative of the majority (mob). Instead of having civil (adult) conversions, it has become more popular to take out the ban hammer or label the speaker when, in reality, the label does not apply.<p>You can continue to water down important historical labels and assert what others believe without talking to them, but things are going to get much worse when we continue down this path.')
