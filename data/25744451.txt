There are a lot of deaths each year, and the law is <i>not</i> in favour of the cyclist either.  In fact, it gets worse:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-45154708" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-45154708</a><p>Stay away from the cities, and it&#x27;s generally safer, but at the same time you&#x27;ll find cars doing 60 mph on single carriageway roads (the national speed limit), which can also be marked as a national cycle route.  If you cycle somewhere where cars don&#x27;t normally encounter cyclists, it can be &quot;fun&quot; as the motorists don&#x27;t know how to behave.<p>The trouble with the UK is that even so-called cycle paths are shared with footpaths, so pedestrians are all over the place, and cycle paths that are getting built as &#x27;joint&#x27; footpaths, mean as a cyclist you also stop at every road junction.  Compare that to Europe, where the cycle path is an additional lane next to the road&#x2F;main carriageway and is usually physically separated in some way for safety.  In the UK this has the unfortunate effect of making a large percentage of cyclist just us the road (which they are legally entitled to do), because the cycle path next to the road &quot;stops&quot; every 100 yards because there&#x27;s a road joining the main carriageway that you have to cross.')
