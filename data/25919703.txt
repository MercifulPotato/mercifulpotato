The storage layer is storing both Backblaze Personal Backup files and B2 files. It&#x27;s COMPLETELY interleaved, every other file might be one or the other.  Same storage.  And we are reporting the failure rates of drives in that storage layer.<p>We THINK (but don&#x27;t know for certain) that the access patterns are relatively similar.  For example, many of the 3rd party integrations that store files in B2 are backup programs and those will definitely have similar access patterns.  However, B2 is used in some profoundly different applications, like the origin store for a Cloudflare fronted website.  So that implies more &quot;reads&quot; than the average backup, and that could be changing the profile over time as that part of our business grows.')
