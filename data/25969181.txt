Item(by='brmgb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612015724, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25963707, text='&gt; Section 5.1 of the PDF seems to imply that the &quot;Initial Europe Doses&quot; are to be manufactured within Europe [0] &quot;following EU marketing authorization&quot;.<p>You are completely misreading it. That&#x27;s not at all what section 5.1 implies. Section 5.1 says AstraZeneca should make its best effort to manufacture in the EU after market approval. That&#x27;s in opposition to improving and relying on foreign production something expressly permitted by the contract. That has no bearing on where the dose should come now.<p>&gt; Section 5.4 which you quote from<p>That&#x27;s the section about where the dose can come and point that all AstraZeneca production capacity are part of agreement.<p>But the real sinker for AstraZeneca is section 13.1.e.<p>&quot;[AstraZeneca   represents,   warrants   and   covenants   to   the \nCommission and the Participating Member States that: ] it is not under any obligation, contractual or otherwise, to any Person or third \nparty in respect of the Initial Europe Doses or that conflicts with or is inconsistent \nin any material respect with the terms of this Agreement or that would impede the \ncomplete fulfillment \nof its obligations under this Agreement;&quot;<p>At this point, it is clear that AstraZeneca is trying to weasle out of its contractual obligation (unsurprisingly they are a pharma company after all). Short of an agreement being found and considering the EU doesn&#x27;t have the time for a protractor trial, I think mandatory licensing or nationalisation of the production facilities are in order. But then again, this commission seems extremely weak so who knows.')
