Item(by='eru', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607075038, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25288288, text='&gt; As a single counterpoint, we&#x27;ve been taxing cigarettes a ton for several decades. Smoking rates have gone down, but only extremely slowly. It took decades. So if you consider partially solving an issue after several decades &quot;efficient&quot;, then yeah, taxes are efficient.<p>Economists usually take into account that people also get utility out of eg using plastic straws or smoking cigarettes.  They are by and large not a very judgy lot.<p>Taxes just make it so that the private cost-benefit decision can take into account (ie &#x27;internalize&#x27;) the costs to the public.<p>Your examples of screws is great to illustrate this!  We don&#x27;t ban the discarding of screws, and it would be somewhat silly to do so.<p>&gt; For the last point, I&#x27;d definitely want to see examples where taxes are more efficient than bans. Everything I&#x27;ve seen and read (and I like to read a lot), points the other way around.<p>What are you reading?  I am talking about efficiency in the same sense as it&#x27;s used in economics.  And taxes being more efficient than bans is pretty much Econ 101.  But I can dig up some links, if you want to.')
