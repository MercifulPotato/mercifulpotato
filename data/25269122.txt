So the non-malicious competitors on the network will produce more blocks meanwhile because they&#x27;re not splitting their computation power, and thus your fake blocks will get invalidated because they&#x27;re on the shorter chain.<p>With PoS on the other hand you can create as many fake blocks as you want and spam them to the network. The only security is the hope that the random network topology arbitrarily results in the double-spending blocks arriving at the targets under attack <i>after</i> the other blocks arrive.<p>But if you run thousands of nodes on the cloud and thus have better network connectivity than the victims you can make your double-spend blocks arrive first at the victims.<p>So:<p>- PoW: Relies on physical limits, you need to have physical hardware and physical energy to conduct an attack.<p>- PoS: Relies on the network connectivity of the attacker being hopefully worse than the connectivity of the non-malicious network. Who can guarantee that? Nobody.')
