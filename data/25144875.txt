Same thing with governments, at every level of scale. Telecoms? Utility providers? Medium-sized businesses who are not in tech? Specialist software that runs in a basement rack and that eventually gets moved to a datacenter and compliance requirements begin demanding all the bells and whistles I just mentioned.<p>Without a doubt there&#x27;s a lot of gross compute power that lives on the VMs you just mentioned. But all their financial processing is probably about a fraction of what some AS&#x2F;400 or mainframe doing a nightly batch job, with software running from decades ago and licensing costs going into 7 figures a year.<p>What you&#x27;re asking for just doesn&#x27;t exist. You can do what you&#x27;re mentioning across, maybe, a single product line and a half-dozen teams. But even that company needs to use CRMs, ERPs, and custom stuff for which you cannot possibly define platform requirements on your own, limited, terms.<p>A customer that I used to admin their Unix servers on had software on IBM mainframes, IBM AS&#x2F;400s, Solaris, AIX, two SCO Unix machines running some proprietary hardware control plane, a few thousand Windows machines, etc. You want a &quot;real&quot; ERP product? It&#x27;s gonna run on Oracle or DB2, forget about Postgres. That app you made 15 years ago running on MySQL with the ISAM storage engine? Forget about ever upgrading that. Need to interact with banks? Holy smokes have I got bad news for you. You need software to interact with medical records that requires special legal compliance across multiple jurisdictions? Well, no one cares what that runs on as long as it keeps the millions rolling in.')
