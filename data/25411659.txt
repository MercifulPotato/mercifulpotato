Item(by='IMTDb', descendants=None, kids=[25412272], score=None, time=1607902951, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25409089, text='&gt; There&#x27;s no excuse for bad testing demographics<p>There never is a &quot;bad testing demographic&quot;. The testing demographic can only be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; in relation to the population the vaccine is going to be certified for.<p>&gt; If only whites are tested then we&#x27;d only find out in the wild if it works on non-whites or has adverse effects on non-whites, which is obviously hideous.<p>That&#x27;s absolutely correct, if a vaccine is tested on a specific demographic, it should only be certified for that demographic, and only be given to other people <i>after</i> additional tests. In this context, if the FDA notices that there are not enough non-white people in the testing group, the FDA should not certify the vaccine for non-white people. White people can already start being vaccinated, and additional tests need to be performed on non-white groups. The role of the FDA is precisely to notice these stuff, react accordingly, and keep phrama companies in check.<p>It&#x27;s already what we are doing for people suffering for immunodeficiency. We develop a vaccine explicitly without including them in the trials - because it&#x27;s harder to make a vaccine considering them. We certify the vaccine for the non immunodeficient people - as fast as possible. Then we will start looking for a vaccine for immunodeficient people at a later stage. First by testing the already developed vaccine - or by looking in another way if that does no work.<p>What Pfizer exec decided to do, is put speed above all. And they were absolutely right to do so. They published they trial sampling details and it&#x27;s up to the FDA to certify the vaccine for the part of the population the FDA think the sample was good enough for. And require additional tests for the others.')
