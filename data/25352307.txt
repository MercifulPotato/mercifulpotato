Item(by='Ologn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607466440, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25350466, text='I like Clean Code and Code Complete.<p>Clean Code has a narrative and is opinionated.  It explains the experiences that formed those opinions.  It is a better read.<p>Code Complete is dry, academic, and comprehensive for its scope.  It references many studies and is well documented. It has opinions too of a sort.  It is a better reference.<p>Thinking of function length - Clean Code says short functions are good.  Code Complete references studies that say it is not long functions that are bad, it is functions using too many objects&#x2F;variables that are bad.  This of course has an indirect effect on function length.  So I keep this in mind, and both books are helpful.<p>I read a bunch of Uncle Bob&#x27;s books and usually don&#x27;t mind him being opinionated, although I did think the opinions in Clean Coder got to be too much. Although not all of it. Recently I have been mulling the idea from that book that there should be zero regressions.  I think there is something to that, if you start to accept there can be 2-3 regressions per sprint, then why not 5-7?  Why not 10?  I agree with him that acceptance of regressions is a problem.')
