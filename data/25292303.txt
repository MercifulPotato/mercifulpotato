Though no I&#x27;m not surprised.<p>Here is the list of 548 vendors I quickly scrapped from their Data Privacy consent popup (might have missed a few): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justpaste.it&#x2F;3lna1<p>Just open reuters.com, wait for the Consent pop-up, click the tiny &quot;Show vendors&quot; at the bottom and enjoy the list.\nNote: my IP is in the EU, maybe you don&#x27;t get the pop-up if you visit from outside the GDPR zone?<p>A nice and a clear reminder of how things got out of hand with the internet IMHO.')
