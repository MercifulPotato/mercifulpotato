I wonder if hedge funds that short enormous amounts of stock include this scenario in their risk calculations. I expect that yes, they are well aware that if the price of a stocks runs away too much, these mechanisms will force brokerages to disallow buying, so that they can buy back the stock at lower prices.<p>However, there is one thing I still don’t understand from the article. Why were hedge funds allowed to still buy the stock? If this liquidity problem really happened as described, shouldn’t the trading be halted completely? I suspect the answer is that they don’t use a brokerage to buy and sell stocks. They probably have some kind of direct access to stock exchanges so they are not bound by the limitations set by brokers.')
