I started writing about the books I read, each year, since 2018. For this year, here are few, in no particular order that I feel happy and fulfilled reading them. I will be digging deeper and doing a retrospective, and write a blog post by early 2021.<p>- Cant&#x27;t hurt me by David Goggins.<p>- Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport.<p>- Ego is the Enemy by Ryan Holiday. (Re-read)<p>- Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World by Jack Weatherford. A very un-assuming book that taught me lot about leadership.<p>- How to influence and win friends (re-read 3rd or 4th time).<p>- Humble Inquiry by Edgar Schein.<p>- I am Malala (daughter like it and so I read it)<p>- Leonardo Da Vinci by Walter Issacson. (I&#x27;m taking this real slow, still reading after 6+ months.)<p>- Range (the one mentioned by Bill Gates)<p>- The Almanack of Naval Ravikant.<p>- The Future is Asian by Parag Khanna.<p>- Turn the Ship Around.<p>- Under Pressure by Lisa Damour (I have a daughter, turning teenager in another year.)<p>- Venture Deals (still valid in today&#x27;s fund raising scenes)<p>- Why we Sleep by Matthew Walker. Still reading but learning a lot already.')
