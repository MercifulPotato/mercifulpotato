This suit isn&#x27;t about Facebook hiring H1-B&#x27;s over American workers. It is about Facebook not properly advertising the jobs of H1-B&#x27;s they have already hired to American workers. It is pretty obvious that you&#x27;d rather keep a worker that has already worked for you for many years over hiring a new guy who would need to get up to speed etc, even if they cost the same.')
