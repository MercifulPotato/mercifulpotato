That&#x27;s the cheapest kind of Visa there is, with your employer sponsoring you. Then you are eligible to apply for permanent residency, which takes ~£2,400. Then you can apply to citizenship, which takes another ~£1,500. There are also costs of language proficiency test, and then &#x27;life in UK&#x27; test where you have to know the height of the London Eye in feet, etc.<p>You will need a lawyer to explain something at some point, or help you put documentation together, so £30K is more realistic. Amongst the things you have to prove is that you have a &#x27;genuine relationship&#x27; with your spouse, and you demonstrate that by providing your What&#x27;s App chat history, and pictures.<p>My path was moving from Russia -&gt; EU -&gt; Britain, I had to apply to entrepreneur visa, and the application I sent by post was ~400 pages of forms, bank statement, letters, etc and weighed over a kilo.<p>It was also a massive headache, so a scheme like this would be very valuable. However, these are not the kind of decisions people make on a whim, so running it for 90 days doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.')
