But even if we admit the logical leap from an organization to the humans which collectively direct that organization, we must still contend with the fact that <i>unqualified</i> praise will be associated with the entire sequence of actions that led to it, rather than (perhaps) a single action that was only undertaken after making lots of unpraiseworthy actions.<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that, when it comes to journalism, courage and integrity are table stakes.
