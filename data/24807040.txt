Removing protections for sites hosting content will have a deleterious effect on the entire Internet.<p>As I said and you conveniently ignore, user generated content would have to be scrubbed from the Internet <i>except</i> from the big players like Facebook that can afford an army of moderators. So first order problem is big sites like Facebook would be the only venues of user generated content.<p>It also creates a slippery slope for ISPs&#x2F;hosting companies. It could easily be interpreted that an ISP or hosting company is hosting user generated content, they literally are, so they&#x27;re liable for that content. They would <i>not</i> carry any content that might make them liable for anything so they&#x27;ll either shut down or moderate their services such individuals have no means to post their own content. ISPs already restrict or block hosting content, they would only get more draconian if they faved legal liability for someone hosting a site.<p>You can&#x27;t suggest a course of action that would consolidate power in big sites like Facebook and then opine about people posting content outside of those sites. There would no longer be an &quot;outside&quot; of Facebook because no small player could ever afford the moderation or insurance against liability.<p>You might dislike Facebook or YouTube and they might be filled with dreck. They might need their own types of regulation but dooming all user generated content because Facebook&#x27;s management are assholes is <i>not</i> a fix.<p>Instead of getting offended when people point out your myopia maybe take a step back and apply some critical thought to your suggestions.')
