To provide a counterpoint: Gnome for me is worlds better than Windows and slightly better than OS X. It definitely takes a little getting used to if, like me, you literally grew up with Windows, but I vastly prefer Gnome nowadays. Not to mention, you have choices besides Gnome -- although if you dig Windows mostly they&#x27;ll just be either wildly different than what you want, or a clear imitation.<p>Truthfully, if you need HDR or specific AMD&#x2F;nVidia features, you&#x27;re right you&#x27;re probably gonna have a rough time. (Bluetooth has worked just fine for me, though.)<p>It&#x27;s definitely not all roses over in Desktop Linux land. I miss having real third-party app support -- sometimes you just need After Effects or actual Word&#x2F;Excel -- and MacOS&#x27; consistency in keystrokes (Cmd+, as the &quot;preferences&quot; hotkey in every app is just <i>so good</i>) but for 90% of what I do it fits me really well.')
