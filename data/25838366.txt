Or create software without bowing to a cartel. Or that Google has destroyed the free and open web with its URL-destroying, AMP-chugging browser.<p>If we don&#x27;t protect our speech and our technology, we&#x27;ll have nothing left to protect us when the monsters come.<p>Imagine if freedom of speech was taken away and leveraged against you. Imagine not being able to speak out against religion or members of the ruling class. Or finding yourself on the other side of the tyranny of the majority.<p>What happens when the next great issue is, say, <i>transhumanism</i> or <i>human cloning</i> and you have no right to talk about it?<p>I&#x27;m a liberal. I voted for Biden, Warnock, and Ossoff.<p>Why are there so many fascists in my party?')
