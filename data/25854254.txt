And it advocates (among other things) &quot;amplifying factual voices&quot;, which for a browser platform can mean only one thing - abandoning neutrality and privileging certain type of content - one that the gatekeepers agree with and thus call &quot;factual&quot; - while excluding other types of content, that they disagree with and thus call &quot;misleading&quot;. To remove all doubt, they bring Facebook - which exercises clear viewpoint-driven editorial control over the content, even if unconsistently, haphazardly and ineffectually - as an example of what they&#x27;re looking for. For a browser platform, advocating such approach means they plan to install themselves as the gatekeepers of the Internet, choosing what information you are and aren&#x27;t allowed to see. While once currently can route easily around Facebook censorship, once browsers join the game, it won&#x27;t be so easy. And of course, for anybody who values unrestricted access to information as much as privacy, it is the reason to avoid using platforms that advocate such principles.')
