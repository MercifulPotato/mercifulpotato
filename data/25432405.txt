It&#x27;s very unclear at the moment what the right proportion of saturated&#x2F;unsaturated&#x2F;polyunsaturated fats is and the nutrition science on this subject is horrible (partly because the palm oil, soy oil, etc. producers are keenly interested in getting their products billed as healthy). In the US most fast food is made with poly-unsaturated oils (e.g. canola&#x2F;corn&#x2F;soy oil) and those foods seem quite unhealthy.')
