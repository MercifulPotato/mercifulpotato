If it benefits you to say you are disabled and you have a qualifying disability, medically supported, then say yes, say you are disabled. If it does <i>not</i> benefit you to say you&#x27;re disabled and the disability is not entirely obvious to others who you don&#x27;t interact with on a regular basis, then say no. Some might not like it, but if the disability is of the sort that there&#x27;s some sort of contention on whether to say yes or no, then the line isn&#x27;t particularly firm.')
