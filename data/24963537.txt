Item(by='Gene_Parmesan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604274051, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24962290, text='If we are defining whether someone is a writer or not by the amount of published content they create, then very very few people are actually writers. If you have to have the <i>published</i> output of a Stephen King to be considered a &quot;true writer&quot; then I imagine there would only be a handful around the world. That&#x27;s surely what your argument is implying, right? That it&#x27;s whether someone is publishing a lot that defines &quot;writer-ness&quot;?<p>Basically my point is, just because someone is not adding titles to their bibliography every year or so doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not doing the act of writing every day. In fact, there are many references online to the importance Martin places on writing every day. And in fact, he <i>has</i> published things since his last ASOIAF book.<p>To try to say &quot;This man is not a writer because he hasn&#x27;t released the books I want to read&quot; feels kind of silly to me.')
