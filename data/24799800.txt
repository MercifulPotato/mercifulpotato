While they say they won’t “remove” old.reddit.com they’re doing their damnedest to make it annoying&#x2F;useless.<p>Using the normal reddit website now as a guest though is all but completely useless. When you click the comment section you don’t see any comments, just the story and then a list of “recommended” other links and a banner to sign in over a small link to continue to read the comments. On expanding that, you only see the top level comment and clicking to expand it tells you to sign in and you can’t continue.<p>I guess they’re going the Instagram route and moving towards app-only.')
