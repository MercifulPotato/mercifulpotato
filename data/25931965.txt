If they are mis-valued, that serves no one.<p>Hard disagree here. Sometimes mis-valuing firms serves a LOT of people. There are many firms who could create value if only they had more capital to work with. As an example, it&#x27;s very possible that a company hard hit by COVID could recover if they got fresh capital and used it to explore new business models that are quarantine-friendly. I&#x27;m all for kicking out non-believers from being involved in their equities in any way.<p>You can&#x27;t short sell most early stage startups. If you don&#x27;t believe in them you just don&#x27;t invest in them. It&#x27;s that simple.<p>As for companies who do bad things, like laundering money or misusing funds, we don&#x27;t need to short their stock, we need to take them to court and get them punished.<p>You know which firms are <i>really</i> mis-valued? Hedge funds. They sit in armchairs in high rises on Wall Street and do nothing for me.')
