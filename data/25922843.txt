Personally I don&#x27;t <i>mind</i> plain ads which are simply a commpany advertising their product&#x2F;service on a billboard etc, what I find unbelievable in the digital era, is the extent of the intrusion now on finding out everything about people to market to them better (which I&#x27;m not even sure if having more data on someone has been proven to produce better results). Its really the data broking side of it - if that went away I&#x27;d have no issues.')
