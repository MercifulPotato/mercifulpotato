The first one is obviously ok, but the latter was what people had issues with, and I don&#x27;t see how it is different here.<p>As for what legal obligations your friends have to keep your information private, I don&#x27;t think they do. However, Facebook does have the obligation to not share info of users who didn&#x27;t explicitly consent to it with third party apps, according to this order from FTC issued in 2019[0]. And third party apps that share not only your FB info, but that of your friends (who do not use those third-party apps), definitely fall under this.<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;cases&#x2F;c4365facebookmodifyingorder.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;cases&#x2F;c4365facebo...</a>')
