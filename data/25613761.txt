That&#x27;s exactly their modus operandi.<p>What&#x27;s even worse is they have managed to abstract most of the support away in this cycle. You can&#x27;t get enterprise support now because they gutted that entirely. You can&#x27;t get them to do anything on github because they keep moving all the projects around and erasing them all or auto closing the tickets and no one on first line support knows anything now other than how to reset a Microsoft account password.')
