Chances are if it was a stray the owners would post flyers then they could return it whilst informing them of it&#x27;s miscreant behavior. If it was truly feral, a week in a cage would be enough to keep it away for quite a while and if it returned just rinse and repeat, it will get the message soon enough.<p>Finaly, my cat is an inside cat so I wont ever have this problem. I know it&#x27;s hard and almost impossible to turn an outside cat into an inside one, but there is no issues if you raise them as inside cats in the beginning.')
