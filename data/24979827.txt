Something like that would get 5+ extra points added to it by a basic spamassassin setup. With a common setup that is postfix + opendkim as a mail filter on the incoming, that should also get caught.<p>I guess the point I was trying to make is that DKIM was really intended to be deployed on the service-provider side, and smtpd mail filtering side, rather than on the client.')
