Just run a binary&#x27; or &#x27;Whats old is new again, java etc&#x27; - I am sure you&#x27;ve heard of a browser technology that is  used server side, javascript, ever hear of nodejs?<p>The rise of javascript and its server side runtime is due to the immense pressure that language had to evolve to make the web what it is today.<p>Web-assembly is the next step and evolution of this runtime. I can only imagine the sheer number of man hours poured in to javascript to offer the functionality it has today while balancing with security and sandboxing. Nodejs is a different story; Take a look at Deno and its origin.<p>Web-assembly is sandbox-able run anywhere, ubiquitous runtime which isn&#x27;t owned specifically by a corporate overlord, and is also which has&#x2F;or is set to have the evolutionary pressure javascript has. \nThis is huge!
