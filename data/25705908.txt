That lasted for only a few months in 2019 before they realized that they were selling the cars under cost...  So, I&#x27;d take this with a huge grain of salt.<p>BTW, Nissan and GM are effectively selling the Bolt and LEAF today for around $27,000, although it&#x27;s not clear if they make any money by doing so.')
