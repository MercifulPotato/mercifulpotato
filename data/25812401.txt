Unfortunately, the extension didn&#x27;t work too well (it had issues with `clangd`) at the time. So, just to compare I installed vscode and was amazed at how polished it was.<p>Still, I had it in my mind that I wanted to have and fast alternative to vscode so I kept trying to work with Neovim. That is &#x27;till I noticed how much I dislike using vim. You see it has that learning curve that if you&#x27;ve stopped using it for awhile it&#x27;s a struggle to do basic things. So I used a configuration that made it act more like normal editors. So problem solved? Unfortunately, most extensions are made for a normal vim settup not my easy mode settup. Plus, I started missing having simple things like scrollbars and tabs I could click on and move with the mouse. (I remember the graphical front end for Neovim not meeting these needs at the time.)<p>So ultimately, I just moved on and stayed with vscode. I would still like an alternative (kedit&#x2F;k-develop looks promising). However, I&#x27;m sort of addicted to the plugins.')
