I am Albanian, and we drink coffee all the time, even in the evening. Even in coastal towns in the south (which is next to greece and south italy).  We also use lots of butter&#x2F;cheese and produce&#x2F;use lots of Olive Oil as well.  Growing up as kids, bread and olive oil, was a common breakfast&#x2F;snack.<p>We just don&#x27;t have any rules on can&#x27;t have coffee after a meal.<p>The main reason some places would stop serving coffee after 7pm is because they switch into &#x27;bars&#x27;, and they&#x27;d rather sell alcoholic drinks to make more profit.  Many coffee only houses stay open past 10pm, especially in the summer.<p>It seems this &#x27;don&#x27;t drink cappuccinos after a certain hour&#x27; is mostly a cultural thing.')
