Everything is wrong about its design and ruggedness for consumer use.<p>Consumer electronics needs to live upto higher standards than even military. One should be able to plug their phone into an external battery, shove the entire mess in their pocket, and go skiing. That&#x27;s what consumer electronics should live upto. The cable housing should be supported snugly and firmly by the housing of the device, like one would do on a BNC connector, but on a smaller scale. The PCB shouldn&#x27;t be taking all the torquing forces, as is currently the case.')
