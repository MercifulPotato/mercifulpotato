The second one is probably better handled by a library that implements a declared state machine or state chart. In Javascript that would be e.g. xstate (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xstate.js.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xstate.js.org&#x2F;</a>).<p>I found that simply thinking about the states and writing them down as a state machine is already very helpful in avoiding certain kinds of issues that arise when you just do this on the fly.')
