From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make any sense to jump straight to &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; in a Marxist tradition. That&#x27;s a state reached with communism, a proposed end state to a socialist transition of undetermined length - and no actual prescription for how, exactly, any of that would happen.<p>That would more aptly describe some (non-Marxist) anarcho-communist movements, who believe you can jump straight to a communist way of being without a transition.<p>&gt; Why would this be a bad thing? Who would want to change this aspect of central planning?<p>If you are actually punished for making production work better you will become alienated from your job and actually want to do a worse job in order to improve your own personal conditions. People care more about their families, their friends, their local well-being than a far-off bureaucrat&#x27;s.<p>&gt; So did they fail to solve these problems because they were prevented from doing so because of dogma?<p>Not really, they were heavily focused on foreign policy and a growing domestic intelligentsia that was increasingly bourgeois, believing Western propaganda about how much better life was elsewhere and lacking real experience with rampant homelessness, hunger, and the state of poorer countries. That group was actively vying for power and eventually won as the public grew weary of defensive wars and focusing industry on defense and also began to buy that propaganda. That led to serious internal struggles and, eventually, what amounted to a bourgeois coup that dissolved the USSR at the barrel of a tank.<p>All in all, the problems I described were not dealbreakers. Western bourgeois democracies have plenty of &quot;bullshit jobs&quot;, yet we don&#x27;t refer to that as a problem that&#x27;s failing to be solved due to dogma - it&#x27;s failing to get solved because there are dominant systemic forces responsible for it being that way in the first place and they are so fundamental to our typical understanding of how the economy should work that we don&#x27;t even talk about them, instead distracted by fights between center-right bourgeois politics and far-right bourgeois politics.')
