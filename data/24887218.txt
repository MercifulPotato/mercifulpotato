A lot is, because many of the people who did the early groundwork on statistical techniques that are used today in extracting conclusions from IQ data were hell-bent on categorising &quot;races&quot; according to their intellectual ability, with the white race usually either at the pinnacle, or close, of the hierarchy and with the &quot;negro&quot; &quot;race&quot; at the very bottom. People like Karl Pearson (of the Pearson correlation coefficient), Francis Galton (who coined the term &quot;eugenics&quot;), Ronald Fisher (head of eugenics at University College London in his time), and others.<p>But all that and a lot more is discussed in Stephen J. Gould&#x27;s The Mismeasurement of Man, a text to read before reading random posts with graphs on the internets.')
