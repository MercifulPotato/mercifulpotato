Agreed that runtime dependency conflicts are unavoidable for most programming languages. Your example of sqlite database format conflicts is also a good one.<p>I definitely won&#x27;t claim that nix has solved <i>runtime</i> dependency conflicts, but it does decisively solve build-time conflicts.<p>Similar to containers like you describe, but reproducible and don&#x27;t require storing and shipping opaque binary images around. Reproducibility is really the killer feature, IMO. I inherited a bunch of containers that don&#x27;t build anymore because the build instructions weren&#x27;t reproducible. Having an old container image that still runs is just tech debt if yiu can&#x27;t edit the build instructions and genrrate a new one.')
