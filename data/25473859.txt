Most of them don&#x27;t work, not without creating worse problems down the line. Specially, if it&#x27;s something as simple as creating some proteins that the body can already produce (which is what happens when mRNA vaccine is given). If the solution was as simple, evolution would have found ways to do that.<p>Currently, some deadly diseases do have some treatments that work... but that comes at HUGE expense i.e. a LOT of energy has to be spent for little gain. It is only possible because there is huge inequality among people and the rich class can afford to spend enormous energy and manpower to treat those diseases. If and when the world becomes more equal, this will no longer be possible (you&#x27;d think that &quot;robot slaves&quot; working off of &quot;free energy&quot; would solve that... I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to happen but that&#x27;s a different discussion).<p>&gt;<i>Also, COVID-19 has not been &quot;around for millions of years.&quot;</i><p>We can&#x27;t know that. It could very well be that COVID-19 had infected mammals before and we naturally god rid of it in a few generations. When infections come about, &quot;weaker&quot; individuals die and those with stronger immunity survive and reproduce and the species of COVID-19 might have died out. Some coronaviruses continue to live with us because they don&#x27;t cause major problems... but there must have been many more which caused major problems and we had had to deal with them differently... and one of them could have been very similar to COVID-19.<p>But yeah, it could also be that this is the first time we&#x27;re encountering it. So, let&#x27;s go with that. My argument doesn&#x27;t change.<p>&gt;<i>immunity against one coronavirus doesn&#x27;t grant immunity against all other coronaviruses</i><p>True. However, in millions of years, our immune system has encountered many species and strains of coroviruses, and trained on that data and come up with a much more generalized and long term solution. I&#x27;d rather trust that than some random know it all people who think that have a better solution with very limited knowledge of what is going on.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;m not against testing new solutions. It&#x27;s the scale that bothers me.')
