Love this version I think this would work great for making and fixing bugs. I think automated tests and chores as a category would actually be great to add to this.<p>For our open source project (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;papercups-io&#x2F;papercups" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;papercups-io&#x2F;papercups</a>). We participated in hacktoberfest recently and one problem we ran into is people submitting low quality PRs. Which ends up taking up way more time to review than to merge.<p>I would love to be able to filter by users who have merged multiple issues or some sort of quality bar for our bounties. Obviously since you are just starting out your users won&#x27;t have too many issues merged. You might be able to work around this by finding the number of Github issues an author have merged previously to any projects that is greater than x number of stars. This way you might be able to bootstrap some credibility of the authors. Then a open source maintainer can gate on only allowing some reputable contributors.<p>One inspiration I would recommend is taking a look at how 99designs has different tiers of designers you can have a bounty for your design. If you could build 99design for open project that would be amazing. Best of Luck!')
