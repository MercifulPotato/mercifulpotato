Write durability does not matter, SSD manufacturers reduce rewrite count with every new generation in the name of the cheaper prices and users are happy to accept that downgrade (see Samsung 980 Pro vs Samsung 970 Pro for a recent occasion). Speed matters to some extent. Many users don&#x27;t observe performance improvements in their typical tasks when upgrading from SATA SSD to M.2 PCI-E SSD, so they definitely wouldn&#x27;t notice speed improvement upgrading from M.2 to Optane. And yet Optane&#x27;s cost is not cheap.<p>I just don&#x27;t see place for Optane in any user devices. It&#x27;s either servers, but it&#x27;s not obvious choice there or tiny market for benchmark users. May be someone like Apple with its vertical integration could exploit it extreme speed to achieve something awesome, but I doubt it, they don&#x27;t like to depend on a single supplier.')
