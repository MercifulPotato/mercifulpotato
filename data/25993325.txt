I probably should have picked a different option, as this was collected just after sunset, which gives a nice uniform lighting but also leads to more noise and some of those artifacts you mention.<p>The resolution improvement has nothing to do with software (although there are super-resolution methods to improve it). It has to do with both flying very low as well as building a larger telescope than normal. While the satellites will still be much smaller than the traditional approach to capturing 10cm resolution, they will be larger than the new space smallsat movement we&#x27;ve been seeing the last few years.')
