I think there may be reasonable concerns about Parler&#x27;s willingness or ability to police illegal speech online, but the stated reason for deplatforming is a farce.<p>They reference things like the capitol riot, but if I recall correctly the actual storming of the capitol was planned (to the extent that it was a planned affair) one <i>FaceBook</i>.  There&#x27;s lots of things shared on FaceBook and Twitter that are bad (and even illegal) but they don&#x27;t get the boot from their service providers - and Twitter is an Amazon customer as well!<p>And the fact that Twitter is a big Amazon customer should not be ignored. It could be that Amazon&#x27;s motivation was primarily political, but protecting the interests of one of their largest customers should not be ignored.<p>But regardless, the real key here is that Amazon blatantly violated their contract.  No company bets their business on a hosting service that does not provide protection against spontaneous cancellation of service.<p>Even if Amazon wins the lawsuit, the message to all to all of their customers will be &quot;we can turn you off at any time and for any reason&quot;.  Expect to see a lot of migrations to other providers if that happens.')
