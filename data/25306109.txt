Item(by='ethical-ai', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607107768, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25304858, text='I&#x27;m not sure why everyone refer to the process as &quot;retracting&quot; rather than &quot;withdrawing&quot;, given the paper was not accepted yet. It sounds for me pretty reasonable to withdraw the paper which has flaws to fix and resubmit it, rather than rush into fixes before conference deadline (given that those fixes should probably be reviewed too). I didn&#x27;t see any claims that the requirement was to never publish this paper.\nIt also seems to be reasonable that the papers published by company are internally reviewed, like the papers by lab members are reviewed by PI before submission.<p>I see different claims from Google researchers, but it seems that at least for some internal review is used to access quality of the work [1,2]. It might potentially harm the freedom of the researcher, but once again, unless I missed something, there is no evidence that Google asked her to withdraw the paper and never resubmit.<p>As I already wrote in different comment, I can not think of a single reason to ask for reviewers identities unless she wanted to confront them personally.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;julianibarz&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334623651719643141" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;julianibarz&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334623651719643141</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;vivnat&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334710506045669376" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;vivnat&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334710506045669376</a>')
