But in more common examples, when I would go to a store and already knew more about their product lines than the salespeople, the local price difference was a turnoff. I&#x27;m happy to pay a reasonable uplift if a vendor can educate, guide or support me as a customer. But when few of them can, I literally have no reason to patronize them.<p>As fast shipping became an option, there was less and less reason to go to a showroom other than to independently look at a product person. In 2020, I don&#x27;t even care about that, because return policies are liberal.<p>My favorite case example is CircuitCity [1]: &quot;In 2003, Circuit City converted to a single hourly pay structure in all stores, eliminating commissioned sales. Many previously commissioned sales associates were offered new positions as hourly &quot;product specialists&quot;, while 3,900 salespeople were laid off, saving the company about $130 million per year. Many company insiders later revealed that they thought this was the most influential company decision that would ultimately lead to its demise.&quot;<p>Lowering costs by eliminating qualified and experiences salespeople, attempting to become an expertise-less local storefront competing on price with businesses that have lower costs was a suicide move, and endemic of executives attempting to run companies based _purely_ on a bottom line, without actually understanding the market they are in. &quot;Excel Excutives&quot; in my words.<p>On the other hand, I have begun doing more business with BestBuy this year. Not because they have changed their level of in store expertise, but because when I need something, they can compete with Amazon in some cases on a combination of price and convenience. I can find if their store has something, the quantity, and have it in hand with no more than drive time. In the work-from-mode many of us are in, this can be a big deal. Plus, I can get appliances from them with installation, and office furniture from their delivery services that is a bit of a gamble from Amazon, who so far is not as convenient for &quot;big box&quot; shipping.<p>I hope BB continues what they are doing, because they seem to have figured out some of the variables to _adapt._ IMO innovation is not the problem, adaptation is. No business can survive if they don&#x27;t adapt to fickle consumers where a significant portion of them will always use the resources available to them while simultaneously seeking to save money.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Circuit_City#2000s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Circuit_City#2000s</a>')
