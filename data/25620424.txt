The way ordinary through-hole film resistors are made is to deposit a carbon or metal film on the substrate, then trim it in a spiral pattern to set the resistance. To make a zero-ohm resistor, then, all they do is... not trim the film. Skipping a step is very easy for them to do!<p>2. The components must have identical body shapes to ordinary through-hole resistors, or the automated placement equipment can&#x27;t handle them. It is possible to use wire jumpers as well, but that&#x27;s a different machine. (Which absolutely exists and is used, it&#x27;s just only found in assembly shops big enough to buy them.)')
