Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607999059, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25424969, text='&gt; Do you honestly think that forcefully stealing money from someone at the threat of imprisonment if they don&#x27;t pay is really going to fly?<p>Yeah its called taxation.<p>&gt; You do realize that every civilization that has ever existed has both enslaved others and been enslaved in the past, right?<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that this is true. do you have any documentation?<p>&gt; Where do your reparations end? Are you going to forcefully take money from me because African Americans were enslaved generations ago, but then forcefully have money taken from them for the other Africans and other races they themselves enslaved in Africa before that? Where does it end?<p>Claims are against the legal institutions that still exist. People aren&#x27;t held responsible for the sins of their ancestors, rather the same institutions that benefitted still exist and can be sued for damages. There&#x27;s a pending claim against them.<p>&gt; Do you think putting a gun to my head and taking money from me really makes sense when my ancestors emigrated here only a couple generations ago?<p>You didn&#x27;t know that we collect taxes here when you immigrated?<p>&gt; Of course my language is extreme, but that&#x27;s what taxes and similar payments are. It&#x27;s backed by the force of the government and if I don&#x27;t pay, eventually someone with a gun will come to put me in prison, and if I refuse, that gun will be pointed at me.<p>If you&#x27;re opposed to taxation, arguing against reparations is probably the worst possible way to make your point. Slavery and taxation are quite similar (some would say the difference matters but those people are pro-tax).')
