Which absolutely isn&#x27;t what Jeremy is saying in this post, in fact he says just the opposite.<p>CoCs help prevent and deal with incidents of racism, sexism, homophobia, threats of violence, etc. Those aren&#x27;t things I, and presumably you, don&#x27;t want at conferences.<p>This was an example of CoC being poorly implemented in several ways; that does not mean that CoCs are inherently bad, anymore than corruption in some country&#x27;s election should be taken to mean that democracy is bad.<p>There will never be a perfect CoC or CoC process, but there are definitely better and worse ones, and better and worse usages. Personally I&#x27;d rather go, or have colleagues go, to conferences which have one; if this conference didn&#x27;t have a CoC then the critiques Jeremy offered couldn&#x27;t have been as specific and pointed.<p>I&#x27;ve seen events and organizations ruled entirely by the organizer&#x27;s arbitrary fiat and trust me, some of those have been horrible, much worse than they might have been had they had an organized standardized Code of Conduct.')
