I&#x27;m not American, so if I can offer ab outise perspective it&#x27;s this:<p>Trumps base was&#x2F;is made up of majority poor white rural Americans, with a coalition of racists and extremists bolted on. What&#x27;s crucial in that is the majority are just poor white townspeople.<p>They lost their jobs because overseas laborers are willing to do the same work for less; because consumers don&#x27;t care if the latest iPhone is made in Cali or in some Chinese interment camp. Same thing for coal and oil jobs. The world changed and these are the people who lost their livelihoods for it. I&#x27;ve been watching American politics my whole life, and Trump was the first politician I saw to truly acknowledge that there is a large portion of the population that are suffering economically for things out of their control and told them it <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> their fault.')
