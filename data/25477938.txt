We&#x27;ve got loads of litter near most roads around my town, and I just don&#x27;t get it.  bottles, cans, boxes, bags, etc.  I saw a guy pull off the side of the road and dump a bag of garbage - like... opened the bag and dumped it out, then drove off.  He was 200 feet from a convenience store that had garbage cans <i>and</i> an open dumpster.  He explicitly chose to avoid that, pull off on the dirt, and dump trash.<p>I was going to approach him and my wife said &quot;no way, he&#x27;s probably got a gun&quot;.  And she was probably right.  Somehow my objecting to him open dumping trash in public (8:45 am) would be some form of liberal aggression and he&#x27;d have been within his rights to shoot me.')
