Item(by='jfim', descendants=None, kids=[25411243], score=None, time=1607896171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25409970, text='&gt; that&#x27;s exactly what the EITC does<p>The EITC is for individuals that have low incomes, AFAIK. Can you elaborate on how the EITC would increase the amount of US manufacturing?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also the de facto result when a company takes a tax loss (e.g. from deducting more expenses than it had in revenue, common for startups) and can then sell the tax loss to another company to offset its tax burden.<p>Can the tax loss be sold separate from the legal entity itself?<p>&gt; As opposed to Tesla&#x27;s plant at Niagara Falls, or the various privately-owned rail networks in the world, or SpaceX?<p>Are you saying that without the TCJA, none of these would have been built?<p>&gt; But that&#x27;s actually more expensive, and less productive, than just making it more cost effective to manufacture things domestically than somewhere else<p>Making it &quot;more cost effective&quot; through tax cuts helps existing businesses, not starting new ones.<p>If a business needs $10 million in capital to buy the machinery necessary to make widget X, and has to compete with an existing factory that produces equivalent widgets and has paid off their existing machinery, how can they compete? The existing business already has relationships with suppliers, customers, and distributors, and if the new entrant looks like it will be trouble, they can just cut their profit margin such that the new entrant will be struggling to cover the extra expenses associated with building all of those relationships while paying off the loans to acquire the machinery.<p>Heck, both of those businesses could reduce their profit margins to zero, with both having an effective tax rate of zero, and only the established one would be able to effectively compete due to lower costs.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s the problem. It doesn&#x27;t matter how willing one side is to negotiate if Democrats are too busy fabricating lies about Russia collusion to come to the table.<p>Or one could say that the Republicans are unwilling to play ball as well (eg. over COVID-19 related stimulus). The fact is, whether one party is at fault over the other, Americans and US businesses are paying the cost of the lack of bipartisan initiatives to improve the state of US manufacturing.')
