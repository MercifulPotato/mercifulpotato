For now they are only viable alternative in browser space.<p>Yeah it collects data(only after asking for appropriate permission) which too is anonymous(i might be wrong here). But they are not collecting it to make profit out of it like google. Its only to make firefox better.<p>And people suggesting to use forks of firefox keep in mind if there is no firefox there are no forks. I am not qualified to comment on Mozilla&#x27;s way of handling their funds. But it is what it is for now.<p>But atleast if you use firefox daily show some love!')
