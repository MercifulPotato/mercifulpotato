My experiences getting some certifications... gosh - 10 years ago now - I did it, but half the hiring folks I talked to didn&#x27;t care at all.  Given the time&#x2F;price, I don&#x27;t think it was a bad cost&#x2F;benefit ratio.  I needed it for a specific job, but outside that specific job it didn&#x27;t help me much.  With that said, I already had... 12 years of experience and had a moderate-sized network of experienced colleagues already.  I think certs can help less-experienced folks get a foot in the door, but again, only at places that place any value on certs in the first place...')
