Do you think that they just casually go out on the water once a week? Also, from my brief experiences surfing, I seem to recall it being one of the most physically taxing sports I&#x27;ve ever done, in terms of total body usage.<p>Valid points about needing to distinguish between professional athletes who were vegan at their peak versus after their peak, and diving into the details about how precisely how &quot;vegan&quot; each of the people I quoted actually are.<p>&gt; Thanks for the reply and much respect to you for making ethical decisions a central part of your lifestyle.<p>Thank you for the respect, the feeling is mutual')
