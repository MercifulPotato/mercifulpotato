Is it tied to my email? If I click a link to join a server and set a username, how do I link that with my existing account? If I set my username&#x2F;profile picture on one server, does it change across all the servers I&#x27;ve joined?<p>As a college student that&#x27;s constantly told to join Discord servers for every class&#x2F;club&#x2F;friend group, it&#x27;s so annoying for this not to work intuitively, and the Discord documentation isn&#x27;t too helpful either. I think I must have joined about 6 different servers across 3 different email addresses by now just because of how obtuse it is.')
