People I pass wear a mask. Jeez, people -wear a mask<p>I&#x27;m all for wearing masks and I do it.<p>But not when road biking where I very rarely (1 in 20 rides) come within 20 feet of a human being, other than people driving by me at 55 mph.<p>I also don&#x27;t wear a mask when running, for the same reason.<p>Maybe if you&#x27;re running &#x2F; biking on the sidewalks of NYC, then sure, wear a mask! But on an empty country road outside of major cities?')
