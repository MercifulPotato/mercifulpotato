Item(by='cmroanirgo', descendants=None, kids=[25329983, 25329480, 25329897], score=None, time=1607316287, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25327066, text='I can&#x27;t help but notice how this code, as well as in the article, there&#x27;s no checks for a) a NULL list or b) that the item is in fact part of the list. A simple fix is:<p><pre><code>  while (!!walk &amp;&amp; walk != entry) {\n     prev = walk;\n     walk = walk-&gt;next;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>  while (!!indirect &amp;&amp; !!(*indirect) &amp;&amp; (*indirect) != entry)\n          indirect = &amp;(*indirect)-&gt;next;\n\n</code></pre>\n...because without those checks it&#x27;s pretty easy to see where you&#x27;ll crash... but by putting in those checks, perhaps the second method might actually be less &#x27;elegant&#x27;.<p>Edit: did I miss something? Re-checking this, the second method will still crash if&#x2F;when next is NULL (because you can&#x27;t get the address of NULL), which means the &#x27;elegant&#x27; seems to be a quagmire of lurking faults.')
