Went with a 10-year-old Camry that KBB&#x27;d around $5k, had it inspected before I purchased it, and everything seemed fine. 6 months in, I ran into an issue that required the entire electrical system to be replaced which pretty much totaled the car. I wound up getting about 15% of what I paid for the car back out of it after 6 months of ownership.<p>Bottom line is that the old car napkin math works as long as the vehicle doesn&#x27;t run into serious issues, because the moment it does, it really doesn&#x27;t make much sense unless you&#x27;re willing and able to do serious work on your own car.')
