Who&#x27;s going to pay for all that<p>For a new development, the developers pay for it, either by actually installing the infrastructure themselves or by paying &quot;connection fees&quot; to the utilities to establish the service. For a truly &quot;greenfield&quot; development they also build the roads, which may stay private or be turned over to public ownership.<p>Ongoing, the gas&#x2F;water&#x2F;electric customers pay for maintenance as part of the cost of the service.<p>Where I live, the only utility persistently moaning about cost of maintenance and infrastructure is the water&#x2F;sewer service, which is run by the city. Gas and electric are private utilities and they seem to just deal with it.')
