Most companies choose cloud vendors and stick with them over many years. I&#x27;d love any survey that showed some massive migration between vendors on a regular basis, but it does not exist.<p>- the monolith: granted, serverless is really best when building something from scratch. Trying to &quot;migrate&quot; to serverless is just a bad idea. Trying to &quot;upgrade&quot; portions is okay, but do it well using the autonomous bubble pattern, making sure you have a solid translation layer<p>I believe serverless is our best modern architecture, but I also understand that not every company is ready to do the work and&#x2F;or pay the price of the change in development processes. I&#x27;d agree that it&#x27;s stalled, but moreso out of fear and ignorance than anything else.')
