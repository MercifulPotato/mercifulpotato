Item(by='ISL', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605358532, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25090877, text='For those not familiar, the interchangeability of 8-32 screws where 10-32 screws should go makes this sort of error very easy to do. They go in right and can feel right as they come tight. The only real clue can be a rattly feel in the hole.<p>Often, switching like-for-like is a great way to work -- it can often be more reliable than documentation itself.<p>The best way around this problem would seem to be installing the window from the inside (relying on the airframe instead of the fasteners), but I bet there was a defensible reason for that choice, too.<p>A moral of the story could be that if documentation and reality don&#x27;t match on a safety-critical part, one must simply stop operations until the question is resolved.')
