There are just so many quirks and oddities; many times I feel like error messages might as well be written in another language, and the syntax becomes ugly fast. Personally I haven&#x27;t had much luck getting into LuaLateX or XeLaTeX, but I&#x27;d be interested in hearing if anyone has found those to be worthy alternatives. Having looked into LuaLaTeX a bit, it seems there are a lot of odd quirks there as well.')
