I&#x27;ll make some changes for a while, then add them to git, and review the changes `git diff --color-words --cached` before I commit. Both MATH&amp;PHYS and LA books are about to get a point-release (lots of typo fixes and improvements to certain explanations based on two years of reader feedback).<p>Even more useful is when collaborating with others, e.g., to see what changes the editor made. When I send diffs to her, I usually run `latexdiff` (takes &gt;1h to generate on 500 pages), but when I check her changes I just use git.<p>Last but not least, I&#x27;ve been working on a French translation of the book and now I use the diffs to keep the two versions &quot;in sync,&quot; meaning any improvements made to one edition are also made in the other.
