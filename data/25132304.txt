Item(by='nly', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605664581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25112177, text='&gt;  Should the bank allow people to put up a fake front for the ATM recording the customers card and PIN?<p>This is a false dichotomy. The hardware attestation for SafetyNet is orthogonal to being able to use hardware attestation for e.g. session&#x2F;user keys, or even chain-of-trust down to the fingerprint sensor level.<p>Keys can be kept secure using secure enclaves even if the OS is rooted.<p>Blocking rooted phones with SafetyNet is just spite.<p>Not to mention, an ATM is property of the bank and is shared-use. The user is not the owner. The phone belongs to the user.')
