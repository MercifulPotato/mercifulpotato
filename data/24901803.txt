Höffner believes it was the chronically weak book market that caused England, the colonial power, to fritter away its head start within the span of a century, while the underdeveloped agrarian state of Germany caught up rapidly, becoming an equally developed industrial nation by 1900.</i><p><i>Even more startling is the factor Höffner believes caused this development -- in his view, it was none other than copyright law, which was established early in Great Britain, in 1710, that crippled the world of knowledge in the United Kingdom.</i><p><i>Germany, on the other hand, didn&#x27;t bother with the concept of copyright for a long time. Prussia, then by far Germany&#x27;s biggest state, introduced a copyright law in 1837, but Germany&#x27;s continued division into small states meant that it was hardly possible to enforce the law throughout the empire.</i><p><i>The emergence of Germany as a major technical and industrial power by the end of the 19th century was quite remarkable, considering it was a not only agrarian, but not even a single state. German in 1800 was a collection of independent principalities and states, corresponding roughly to the present-day states of unified Germany plus Austria, and parts of Switzerland, France, and Poland.</i><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spiegel.de&#x2F;international&#x2F;zeitgeist&#x2F;no-copyright-law-the-real-reason-for-germany-s-industrial-expansion-a-710976.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spiegel.de&#x2F;international&#x2F;zeitgeist&#x2F;no-copyright-l...</a>')
