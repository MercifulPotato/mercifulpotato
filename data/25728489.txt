Item(by='sideeffffect', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610371136, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25708258, text='&gt; Algorithms are not simply math, in the same way mechanical engineering is not simply math.<p>Algorithms are _literally_ mathematical objects. C.f. Church-Turing thesis.<p>&gt; And if it were simply math, then there would be no way to work around those patents, which plenty of open source codecs have done in various directions.<p>Show me an H.264 codec that works around the patents in the MPEG LA pool. Also software patents are orthogonal to the question of &quot;open source&quot; (which is about copyright). That there is very often no way to work around the patents in an otherwise independent implementation is precisely the problem with Software patents.<p>&gt; Unfortunately, most open source codecs are not as good at compression, mostly since the patented ones have a massively bigger pool of engineering behind them from dozens of companies banding together their work to develop best of breed solutions.<p>Show me the numbers. Because the numbers I know (for example the chart in the blogpost itself) show that x265 is the best codec (or encoder, if it&#x27;s not a decoder too) for H.265, it self being &quot;open source&quot;, better than proprietary alternatives.<p>&gt; And eventually the patents expire, and the world gets these codecs free to use.<p>Even after patents expire, copyright expires in 90 years.')
