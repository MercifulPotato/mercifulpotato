It&#x27;d obviously be out of scope.<p>It reminds me of the &quot;but users might be running malicious WebExtensions!&quot; argument (one of many!) I keep seeing in the Signal community for not implementing a proper web client (along with &quot;but the PKI might be compromised and the JavaScript might be backdoored!&quot;). They might be running a compromised OS too! Hell, their phone might have an entire ARM-based listening device inside the case. Security is always relative, and if someone reading &quot;Use Signal, it&#x27;s secure&quot; doesn&#x27;t understand that then they have bigger problems.')
