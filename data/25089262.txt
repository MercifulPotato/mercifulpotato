Item(by='Fogest', descendants=None, kids=[25091133], score=None, time=1605314701, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25089190, text='Because they act like they support local businesses but then take a 30% cut out of their profit despite not doing anything remotely close to justifying that price.<p>This forces local small places to have to raise their costs whereas the big chains cut deals with these platforms and don&#x27;t have to raise their prices as their cut is much smaller.<p>So now if I want to buy local I am paying more for the food than I would if I went into the place. But that doesn&#x27;t even then account for me having to also pay a delivery fee and a service fee. Oh and if my order is under $12? They&#x27;ll slap a &quot;small order fee&quot; on. If I am already paying a fee to use the service on every single order, then why is the restaurant still getting screwed out of 30%? I just paid the company a fee for the service. That service fee and that cut from the restaurant is not going to the person doing the delivery work. I&#x27;m already paying for that in the delivery fee and tip.')
