Item(by='quietbritishjim', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607512458, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25357365, text='The problem with &quot;Eat Just&quot; is that &quot;just&quot; is at the end <i>but isn&#x27;t a noun</i>. Consider &quot;Eat Just makes artificial chicken&quot;. Just is an adjective or adverb, it more naturally associates with the word following it, and an initial parse of that sentence is likely to be more like &quot;eat&quot; is an entity that just (only) makes artificial chicken.<p>Compare with, say, &quot;International Business Machines makes a big blue computer&quot;. This doesn&#x27;t quite make sense (semantically) if you read it literally rather than understanding the start to be the name of a company; it sounds like some <i>machines</i> own the computer. But even then, it parses (syntactically) into the correct parts of speach so it&#x27;s easier to extract the real meaning without conscious effort.<p>Company names that end in a verb, like Just Eat, are also a little odd. But verbs have less of a habit of tightly binding to the word following them, so it&#x27;s not quite as confusing as if the final word is an adjective or adverb.')
