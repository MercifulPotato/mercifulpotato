That&#x27;s in every keynote. This is a rhetorical question, the real mystery is why does an average consumer want to see unreal things to convince them its cooler&#x2F;better? You&#x27;d think seeing actual die shots would be more convincing to average consumer, but they love marketing that&#x27;s untruthful, fake and exaggerated. Not the fault of the marketing department. This is what consumers want and this is what sells. Sad to think how shiny things sell and the whole luxury industry in general.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;v&#x2F;mac&#x2F;m1&#x2F;a&#x2F;images&#x2F;overview&#x2F;chip_cpu__dg71gt6zecya_large_2x.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;v&#x2F;mac&#x2F;m1&#x2F;a&#x2F;images&#x2F;overview&#x2F;chip_cpu__d...</a>')
