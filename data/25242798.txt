When I started working with computers in my first job in 96, I discovered QBasic. Then by just following a sample program on how to play music notes, I was able to make the PC play a custom song. What an exciting discovery! \nToo bad the program could only play beeps and didn&#x27;t support polyphony. Then I think this was my first &quot;hack&quot; into programming: I created a version of the Christmas Carol &quot;Joy to the World&quot; that sounded like 4-part harmony by simply making the duration of each note comprising a chord to the be very very short, and then between notes (chords) I added a rest (silence) so I could distinguish each separate note from the melody. It sounded like arpeggios. Fun experience, but too time consuming.')
