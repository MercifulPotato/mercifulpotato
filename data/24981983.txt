I&#x27;d be perfectly happy to use C# or F# the language, but I still find .NET lagging behind the JVM&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Go ecosystems.  Two large OSS projects I&#x27;m using for work are Scylla and Apache Beam, both of which don&#x27;t have native support for .NET, and I&#x27;m sure we can find plenty of others.')
