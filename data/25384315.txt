Item(by='bjornedstrom', descendants=None, kids=[25384699], score=None, time=1607683539, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25384265, text='I&#x27;ve lived in the inner city parts of Stockholm most of the time (Östermalm&#x2F;Norrmalm, Södermalm, Kungsholmen).<p>I would definitely not wear 500-600 USD headphones in any of those areas.<p>But I think crime in Stockholm is a bit off topic. However I don&#x27;t think the inherent risk of being robbed - wherever you are in the world - is off topic for the discussion.<p>People rob kids of Airpods all the time, because it&#x27;s a status item. These new Airpods will be a status item too. This will increase the risk of robbery - be it in Europe or the US or elsewhere.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are larger cities in the world where the likelihood of getting robbed is low (Tokyo?), but that&#x27;d be the exception rather than the norm.')
