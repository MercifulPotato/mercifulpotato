There are many others in this thread who are criticizing US companies for operating in China when they are already based in a country that allows its own form of forced labor, sponsors coups abroad, starts wars, etc. Knowing this, you’d think people might understand why US companies look the other way when they profit off of forced Chinese labor.<p>This may seem like whataboutism but I am not trying to justify China’s behavior here—it is truly horrendous. I just think the general conversation on Hacker News around the ethics of US companies operating in China lacks this nuance.
