But yeah, fuck &#x27;em for &quot;virtue signaling&quot; while they sip their lattes and go to yoga, right? It&#x27;s better to see the lie and do what they don&#x27;t want you to do. &#x2F;s<p>I get it, plastic can&#x27;t be recycled profitably and we should be using way less. But one of the reasons its so terrible to recycle is because of how poorly it&#x27;s sorted.')
