You specified that the matter had urgency! Good job!<p>No, not at all. You requested a description of the topic. Urgency, whether explicit or implicit, is always there when someone requests a synchronous conversation.<p>Edit: as a reminder,<p>&gt; If it&#x27;s urgent then you should probably take a few seconds to explain why.<p>Sorry you misinterpreted. Urgency is not &quot;Why,&quot; and my example mentioned urgency explicitly without &quot;taking the time to explain why.&quot;<p>Gaslighting someone in a discussion makes me less inclined to communicate. Wish you the best.')
