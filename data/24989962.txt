Item(by='Saturdays', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604504371, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24988530, text='Thanks for sharing this. I take goodread reviews very lightly, especially for new books which I figure are either done by folks who get early access, book bloggers, etc.. (which I assume comes with their own bias at the pleasure of early access) and now throwing in &#x27;bots&#x27; into the mix..gross!<p>I did enjoy &#x27;The Humans&#x27; and &#x27;How to stop time&#x27; but would never mark either of them as 5 star books, mainly because I would count books like &#x27;Madam Bovary&#x27; or &#x27;Rebecca&#x27;or &#x27;Crime and Punishment&#x27; as a 5-star book. Nonetheless the praise for Midnight Library irked me before I even took a look at it. Folks are so keen on jumping to 5-stars without a critical approach to it.<p>Rather than a single 1-5 star system, a questionnaire with 1-5 stars for aspects of a book could be a better way to rate.<p>From 1-5 how would you rate:\n1. the plot\n2. enjoyability\n3. character development\n4. etc...<p>and then average out the scores across each aspect to get the user&#x27;s score on the book.<p>Obviously there is incentive for goodreads to push for 5-star reviews all around, for the most part, because who wants to buy a 1-3.5 star book from Amazon? Also a larger scale or more options to choose from with rating would lead to lower conversion of rating submissions.<p>I won&#x27;t claim to be perfect about rating books either, but its appalling when a book like &#x27;The Midnight Library&#x27; (4.3 as of this time) has a higher rating than &#x27;Crime and Punishment&#x27; (4.2).')
