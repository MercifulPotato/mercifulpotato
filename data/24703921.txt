Social cohesion is absolutely an issue. We feel it when we have no community organizations, don&#x27;t know our neighbours, and have nothing gluing us to where we live. The famous Putnam study on social capital is a fine piece of evidence here.<p>I believe we can surmount Putnam&#x27;s identified problems, but only if we have a rate of influx that is sustainable. That means each newcomer has a chance to get proper language training, recertification, and actually integrate into a local community, which I&#x27;ll somewhat arbitrarily define as having made some real friends out of the group of local or fully-assimilated people. This is the core requirement of being able to fully participate in social life.<p>&gt; The wealth and income inequality in Canada is much lower than in the US.<p>Some of us would like it to stay that way, and we understand that bringing in a whole bunch of people to undercut the price of labour while eroding our hard-fought social capital is not the way to do that.')
