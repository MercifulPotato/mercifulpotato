When I said about converting those close to me, I mean in the sense that I get them to install and use Matrix for communicating with <i>me</i>. If they want to use&#x2F;prefer close platforms to talk with other people, I am not stopping them&#x2F;thinking less of them for it.<p>&gt; They’ll still have other important (to them) unrelated concerns with more weight.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s obvious. If they had prioritized openness and privacy over other bells and whistles they would been using already something like Matrix or XMPP. What I am saying since my very first comment is that I <i>acknowledge</i> that, but I also say that <i>I</i> prefer to use open tools and that I am willing to help them as much as possible to setup an account for them, install the apps and give basic guidance so that <i>we</i> can talk.<p>I am not asking them to drop other applications nor refusing to understand the reasons they have to prefer to use closed platforms. At no point I am challenging their preferences. I am just stating <i>mine</i> and supporting them for the hassle that I know that I am causing.<p>&gt; To catch them, open IMs should have their whistles on top of regular bells, not instead.<p>It&#x27;s not an exclusive thing. I don&#x27;t have to change them all of their existing tools in order to get them to talk with me. I <i>hope</i> that one day the open applications will be so much easier to more people will actively look to make the switch, but <i>I</i> am willing to invest time and effort to keep as much as I can from my communications on open platforms and that has already been enough to get a good number of close people to become continued users.')
