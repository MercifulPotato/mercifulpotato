Are they someone who had bad luck or someone who actively destroyed everything around themselves?  If you help them will you  waste your energy and in the end hurt them or will it actual assist?  Will they be angry with you or even attack because it would be so easy for you to help a lot but you don&#x27;t?<p>Self judgement over not immediately helping, self limitations in our faces (many of us are closer to homelessness than stability), guilt over not donating more, sadness over our judgments of the homeless, fear over becoming homeless, discomfort with smells or ideas of correlated behaviors, pity, incomplete information... the list of sincere challenges goes on and on.<p>I&#x27;ve got a sister who I love but deeply deserved to be homeless after hurting and spreading ruin on everyone around herself for decades.  Anything you did to help she would use to hurt herself and others more.  Most down and out people are not her.  For those who had a bad circumstance, a leg up has additive economic benefit and benefits us all.  Most safety net services are about being ready to support those who are ready to do exactly what you suggest.  Many of the rest are there to help them survive to getting to that place.<p>Your final statement seems so zero sum.  Our society exists because we find ways to make each other&#x27;s efforts more productive and effective than they otherwise would be.  We&#x27;re all better off if being better off is scaled.  There are defectors but also controls in place.')
