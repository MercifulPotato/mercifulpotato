I have it configured _not_ to start with windows because I don&#x27;t want it running in the background. Whenever I need to open it, I launch it, copy the password to the clipboard and paste it into whatever program, and click the X or hit alt-f4 to close it. Unfortunately, it does not close. It minimizes itself to the system tray, and gives me a helpful notification to let me know that my attempt to close it has failed. In order to close it, I must right click the tray icon, at which point the icon moves to hide itself in the hidden tray icons due to a bug in either LastPass or more likely in Windows itself. So now I have to click the overflow menu on the tray and right-click the icon again to close it. Finally LastPass is closed.<p>Now, due to another bug in Windows, the overflow menu has remained open and must be manually closed. The third bug here is when I alt-tab out of LastPass, it doesn&#x27;t take me back to the most recent application; instead it dumps me on the desktop or some other program at random (why is the desktop even there in the alt-tab menu?)')
