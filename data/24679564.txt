As in at first it doesn&#x27;t even register as English, more like thinking <i>what was that?</i>. Then, delayed I suddenly understand. Of course it depends on the situation (environment, other sounds, other speakers, and so on, too) and the accent&#x2F;dialect of the speaker. In other cases no problem at all, like instant switching without any hassle&#x2F;thinking about it.<p>It depends&#x2F;varies in strange ways :)')
