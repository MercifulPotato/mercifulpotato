It should simply be an optional (and opt-in) add-on that&#x27;s included in the box like a &quot;free&quot; code for a year of service if you want - and I think they do that already for Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. If it&#x27;s worth it, people will renew. Word of mouth and regular non-spammy advertising should do the rest.')
