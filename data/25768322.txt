I can&#x27;t see why anyone would reasonably consider trying such a thing.<p>Containers make a lot of sense when you&#x27;re the one developing the software, and you have a lot of micro-services to support, none of which really scale to EC2 levels of utilization.<p>But EC2s seem better suited to running pre-installed software that can, and will, fully utilize an entire VM.  Such as a database.<p>My intuition on this subject is, docker is the latest, trendy hammer and so everything becomes a nail &#x2F; container.  Maybe people aren&#x27;t familiar with the tooling around EC2 image creation and deployment.')
