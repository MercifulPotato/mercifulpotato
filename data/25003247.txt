But your liberal strawman is as expected as it is tedious.<p>No, the &quot;both-sides are equal&quot; thing isn&#x27;t going to work. On the one hand, you have a quote by Hillary Clinton which is proving kind of correct in hindsight, on the other, literal armed mobs of Trump supporters threatening to stop the counting of votes by force, lawsuits, attempts to &quot;override&quot; the vote, and hoaxes perpetrated by Trump&#x27;s own family.<p>These things are not equal.')
