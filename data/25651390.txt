It takes a perfectly good system (Kubernetes Manifests) which allows you to exactly specify the exact versions of all the containers you want on your cluster, and it wraps it in an inscrutable &quot;helm install&quot; invocation which can potentially pull containers from anywhere at deploy time.<p>I&#x27;ve used helm template which generates manifests but unfortunately this isn&#x27;t really the common use case, and it doesn&#x27;t give you that much compared to your favorite text templating language.')
