No country has seriously threatened the American heartland since 1812.<p>Bringing up foreign interference (in elections, Covid-denial and elsewhere) upsets certain factions, but the fact is that Facebook, Twitter, various commenting platforms and YouTube have allowed the enemies of the United States a direct route into the heartland of the US. Coupled with free speech absolutism and low touch regulation, it makes a tempting vector to disrupt a previously impregnable foe.<p>If I were a strategist for a rival power, it would be almost criminally negligent to not exploit this conduit into the American heartland, and spread disinformation and generally sow chaos.<p>It looks like the geek gods have finally realized this and are pushing back. It wouldnâ€™t surprise me if US companies started severely curtailing anonymous&#x2F;unverified speech for foreign accounts at least.')
