Item(by='devenblake', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606847961, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25266952, text='&gt; Linux has systemd, not my favorite thing out there, Windows is privacy nightmare. That left me with 2 major options: Linuxes without systemd (Gentoo, in my case) or BSDs.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t like systemd (I don&#x27;t but I live with it because I never have to interact with it anyway), this is such a weird way to phrase it. Imagine saying &quot;Linux has `apt`, not my favorite thing out there. That left me with two major options: Linuxes without apt (Arch, in my case) or BSDs.&quot; Just... change the program. Apparently Arch can switch over to sysvinit just by installing two packages from the AUR (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;SysVinit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;SysVinit</a>), Devuan exists, et cetera.<p>Of course, the author was sold on BSD before making this argument - and fair enough, at least it&#x27;s a free system. But in my opinion it&#x27;s ridiculous to discount a family of systems because of one common program.')
