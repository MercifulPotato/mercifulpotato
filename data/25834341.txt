While not Amazon-sized, Elastic is itself a rather large company. Am I supposed to be upset that you&#x27;re having difficulty getting even larger because of Amazon? Considering you&#x27;re the experts on this product, shouldn&#x27;t you be confident in your ability to differentiate from someone offering it as an afterthought? If anything, Amazon&#x27;s poor support of their Elastic offering amounts to lead gen for a properly run solution. Finally, feel free to change your license now that your original license is no longer conducive to your growth aspirations, but whining that &quot;not OK&quot; Amazon forced you to do it just comes across as sour grapes.')
