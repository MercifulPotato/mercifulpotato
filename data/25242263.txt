Debugging a decent-sized build system made with Make is just an exercise in suffering.<p>I am… honestly… no longer interested in understanding the entire software stack. I understand my time on this earth is limited and want to spend it doing other things. With Bazel, I am spending less time fucking around with build systems and more time doing the stuff I care about.<p>&gt; Tenths of MB of stuff is complexity. Tenths of build time or run time dependencies is complexity. A compiled tool when a script would have been sufficient is also complexity.<p>As someone who still writes C, I can understand the joy that people feel when you make some cool program and it’s measured in KB, not MB. However, what you’re describing strikes me as fetishistic.')
