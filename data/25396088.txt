This is literally a very untested vaccine. There are literally no longitudinal studies. You should be weary of this vaccine. I am not an unintelligent person. I have a bachelors and masters and I am very weary of something that has been spread through its trials this quickly.<p>The people who you hear say &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be guinea pig&quot; ... they&#x27;re not wrong. This vaccine could be perfectly safe .. or we could see a lot of edge cases when you start injection a million people at a time with it. On top of all of that, you can be sure hospital will be sure to force front line workers to take it first.<p>Please, let&#x27;s be honest about this. Why are we suddenly trusting drug companies after disasters like viox. I&#x27;m not against vaccines in general. I&#x27;ve had all my MMRs, took my Typhoid, Meningitis, Hep B for certain overseas trips. But those took time to go through trials and were vetted for safety in a way this simply hasn&#x27;t had the time to.<p>People are going to be weary and that&#x27;s not wrong. That&#x27;s not &quot;anti-science.&quot; This is legitimately going to be an experiment which, if they get wrong, can potentially harm a lot of people. You only need to look back to the 70s and the Swine Flu vaccine disaster.')
