Texas has no say in how Pennsylvania votes. There&#x27;s other things that are ridiculous about that case, like wanting throw out unrelated Texan votes.<p>No it&#x27;s not though. Texas is asking the Supreme Court to answer the question of whether the constitution allows the governor to make up election rules or whether it&#x27;s just the state legislature. The Supreme Court has ruled that how other states conduct their elections affects other states. By precedent, they should have answered it.<p>Moreover, similar challenges to PA law by PA voters, PA candidates, and Trump himself were dismissed also for standing. Perhaps you can argue Texas has no standing to tell PA what to do. But shouldn&#x27;t a PA voter have standing to question whether his governor can make up rules? How come absolutely no one has standing?<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure you can argue they&#x27;re bad actors when the clear and obvious reasoning for those measures across the country are to limit the spread of a deadly pandemic.<p>But they violated a court order. Sure, it&#x27;s to stop a pandemic. But a judge ordered that order to be violated. Court orders supersede gubernatorial edicts.<p>&gt; The governor&#x27;s in charge of enforcement<p>I&#x27;m sorry... that&#x27;s not good enough for an election. Can a governor allow votes to be made up even though it&#x27;s against the law, because the governor is &#x27;in charge of enforcement&#x27;. Can Trump use the national guard to stop the Biden electors from meeting because he&#x27;s &#x27;in charge of enforcement&#x27;.<p>At some point, the government needs to be held responsible for lack of enforcement of basic civil rights -- election integrity is a governmental duty. You can&#x27;t just choose not to enforce it.')
