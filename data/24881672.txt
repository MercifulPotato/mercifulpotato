After commenting on K5’s death notice here, I bought taxiwars.org to repost my diaries thanks to the upvotes and a positive comment about my k5 writings [1]. I added a few posts in the years since the ShowHN, but nothing substantial.<p>This Show HN is my first animated episode from my adventures as a taxi driver. I’d forgotten about this until years later, when I observed another lunar eclipse [2]. To quote the video: “While watching the progression of that eclipse, I remembered the time I’d amused myself <i>by becoming a false prophet.”</i> To better convey the story, I commissioned a friend’s help for this animation.<p>This episode tells the of the time I used my passenger’s ignorance of celestial mechanics to convince her of an imminent calamity. Her companions and I amused ourselves at her expense; hopefully she learned to not freak out so easily.<p>Discussion: To misquote <i>The Refreshments,</i> ‘Everybody knows that the world’s full of simple people’ [3]. We’re all prone to freak out about something, and even smart people can be taken advantage of by jerks like me, who know just a little bit more about how specific aspects of the Machine work.<p>What can be done to help people be less vulnerable to all types of trickery?<p>Blog Post (transcript): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taxiwars.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;false-prophesy.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taxiwars.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;false-prophesy.html</a><p>Twitter: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;TaxiCabJesus&#x2F;status&#x2F;1315004358887501824" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;TaxiCabJesus&#x2F;status&#x2F;1315004358887501824</a><p>Facebook: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;TaxiCabJesus&#x2F;posts&#x2F;1433881090136669" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;TaxiCabJesus&#x2F;posts&#x2F;1433881090136669</a><p>The Show HN rules - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;showhn.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;showhn.html</a> - say &quot;For books, a sample chapter is ok.&quot; When I have funds I intend to commission more animations, so this is basically a sample chapter. Apologies if this is not appropriate as a &#x27;Show HN&#x27; submission.<p>My idea of the <i>Taxi Wars</i> is that they are anecdotes are of my passengers’ (and, by extension, Humanity’s) struggle against the machine we’ve created for ourselves. In the earlier episodes I’m an observer of someone else&#x27;s predicament, sometimes offering help in some way (free rides, bail money, etc).<p>I’d also appreciate your feedback on presentation. My next video might be on &quot;the predicaments of old people&quot; (based on an unpublished anecdote from the time my passenger referred to himself as an old person), or some of the other stories I’ve drafted&#x2F;posted.<p>p.s. Seinfeld fans, which Kramer [4] compilation on youtube would you recommend for people who aren&#x27;t familiar with the reference? Wikipedia says Kramer was the stock character of the &quot;Lovable Rogue&quot; [5].<p>[0] Show HN: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12193273" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12193273</a><p>[1] “RIP Kuro5hin”: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11609802" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11609802</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;January_2019_lunar_eclipse" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;January_2019_lunar_eclipse</a> - I think it would’ve been this one<p>[3] The Refreshments &#x2F; Banditos: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IfZbFh7qlCQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IfZbFh7qlCQ</a> (The actual quote is &quot;Everybody knows that the world&#x27;s full of stupid people, so meet at the mission at midnight, we&#x27;ll divvy up there...&quot;, but I think &#x27;simple people&#x27; is fairer to the mass of humanity.)<p>[4] Kramer (Seinfeld character [TV]): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cosmo_Kramer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cosmo_Kramer</a><p>[5] Lovable Rogue: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lovable_rogue" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lovable_rogue</a>')
