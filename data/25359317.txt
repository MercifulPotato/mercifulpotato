It doesn&#x27;t give any empirical numbers at all.<p>I&#x27;ve had a small FreeNAS server using 4 x 3TB SATA drives in a mirrored config for years now and it&#x27;s out of space. I&#x27;m about to build a new server using used 10 x 3TB SAS drives and intend to put all ten disks into a RAIDZ2 vdev. I care more about space than performance or rebuild times. Before I load it with data, I&#x27;ll do some testing of read&#x2F;write performance and rebuilding times. If they&#x27;re unacceptable, I&#x27;ll try two smaller RAIDZ vdevs and if that still doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll go back to mirrors.')
