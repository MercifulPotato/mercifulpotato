I daydreamed about creating a similar site about ten years ago, after I started exercising seriously, but I never went beyond daydreaming. Congratulations on actually doing it.<p>When I was daydreaming, I thought of demonstrating the exercises with human-like animated figures rather than videos of real people. I had the impression that the well-built, athlete-type people who often appear in exercise videos can discourage beginners and people with body-image issues. I may have been wrong, though. In any case, your videos look good to me now.')
