Not good for editing, not good for copying or moving code, not good for navigating, not good for working with brackets or parenthesis despite the lisp language being almost native to Emacs.<p>My recent exploration into org-mode introduced me to Evil. It&#x27;s 95% of the VI language, in an amazing text editing platform. I&#x27;m currently only using Emacs for org-mode right now, but suddenly new worlds are opening. For instance, I&#x27;ve been looking for a good tool to navigate CSV files from the CLI (or any other keyboard-controlled environment) for over two decades. I&#x27;m not yet explored the possibilities with Emacs, but I&#x27;m told they are good. Then possibly browsing simple websites, such as HN and Wikipedia, maybe a better Git interface, maybe a good Telegram &#x2F; Slack &#x2F; IRC combined messenger, maybe a good email reader.<p>Suggestions welcome!')
