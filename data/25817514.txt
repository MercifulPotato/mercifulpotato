The cookies reappear even if you delete them, just because you are signed into Chrome Sync. Now, that same identity (&lt;you&gt;@gmail.com) is not just used for Google&#x27;s own websites, but also made available to anyone who uses Google Analytics - which is 90% of the web - including your cross-domain and cross-device history. Of course, none of this is new, but I shudder every time at the thought of how much information the user is giving away about themselves.')
