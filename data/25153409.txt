I am reading The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell.<p>Part of the plot is that a radio astronomer at Arecibo discovers intermittent Alien radio signals originating from the Alpha Centari System. The protagonists can&#x27;t figure out why the Alpha Centari&#x27;s are transmitting such strong radio signals and why they are intermittent. It turns out that their planet doesn&#x27;t have an ionosphere to reflect broadcast radio waves, so the inhabitants instead bounce radio off the moon to broadcast it back to the surface.<p>Arecibo only picked up the radio signals when they bounced off the moon at the right angle.<p>The origin of radio telescopes in the 60s must be the kernel for that bit of plot.')
