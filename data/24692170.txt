I did not realize you had separate stacks which would allow you to save on the caller stack before a switch to the callee stack. I was thinking you were nesting on a single stack like “stackless coroutines”.<p>So if I am understanding correctly, essentially in your design each coroutine uses the end of its stack to push its context which can be trivially popped when you switch back to it and its stack.')
