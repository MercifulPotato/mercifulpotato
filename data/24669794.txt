Being humans living in the world, they obviously experienced and understood that depth existed all around them, but had a hard time grasping the concept as a whole. I feel like we&#x27;re kind of in a &quot;medieval depth&quot; phase of gravity&#x2F;spacetime understanding...it&#x27;s literally all around us, we know <i>something</i> is there, but we can&#x27;t quite grasp what it even is we&#x27;re looking for.')
