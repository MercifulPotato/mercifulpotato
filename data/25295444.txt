Bunch of people, including Timnit Gebru, replied he is wrong and the biases are every where and systemic.<p>Yann later tweeted again to explain what he meant in the context of deep learning models without hand engineered features, but people ignored him and still replied he was wrong.<p>It looks like they were accusing Yann of all the systemic biases of society... common.<p>Is there a paper showing that the Transformers based models are &quot;biased&quot; no matter the dataset ?')
