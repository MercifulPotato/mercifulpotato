(I think maybe I’m searching for a list of hook points?) I keep seeing tantalizing hints about all of the things it lets you do, but the tutorials I’ve seen only seem to cover networking and tracing.<p>(The project I have in mind at the moment is making a bindfs-like filesystem without FUSE, but I’ve had a few different ideas where eBPF seemed like it might have been a good fit if I could figure it out.)')
