I agree with a lot of the criticism here, but I think the author&#x27;s choices are reflective of the new grad hiring climate.<p>Hiring for any competitive tech job relies on having a stellar resume with impressive sounding projects, and ideally a degree from a top CS school. Interviewers have little time to review projects, so new grads market small projects like this as much more impressive than they are, knowing they&#x27;ll only be asked about them in passing as a break from algorithm problems.')
