I fell head over heels for Blackmagic and we now own several Ursa mini pro g2 cameras and a few of their smaller 6Ks. We shoot on canon lenses and our entire workflow is Resolve.<p>Resolve is the best color grading software in the biz, without question. Most Oscar winners each year have used Resolve for their grade. The node based workflow is a game changer.<p>Fair light is the sound editing software and is built on a company they purchased that was a leader in the field. What is truly unbelievable is that you get the full version of fair light in the free version of Resolve. In fact the only thing you’ll miss in the free version is a few plugins. Last year I was doing a color grade and accidentally upgraded to free. Took me an hour to realize.<p>Fusion is also very powerful for VFX and does an excellent job with a few plugins for planar tracking.<p>Resolve provides a complete workflow including media management, two editors, color, sound, vfx and export. It is remarkably fast and stable. The BM folks are also super friendly and helpful. Met a few at a DP seminar in NYC end of last year.<p>I’ve been trying to create awareness about how much BM is giving away and how powerful Resolve is so I’m glad to see it here.<p>One last thing. Blackmagic raw is unbelievable in the latitude it gives you for heavy grades. We came over from Sony s-log2. One shoot and we were hooked. I kept pushing the footage and waiting for that Sony purple grain to appear in the darks and they stayed clean with a ton of detail. Amazing.')
