You already seem pretty disinclined to agree with me as evidenced by how you keep trying to suggest that I&#x27;m talking about condemnation of unprotected speech, which I haven&#x27;t and have said so several times. My first comment was merely asking someone for clarification on how he parsed these threads; I didn&#x27;t even talk about the subject at hand because I have no interest to and yet that&#x27;s almost exclusively what you have tried to talk about. Not sure what exactly would be changed in this conversation by my giving you an example. You&#x27;ve been assuming bad faith on my part from the get go so I feel it would be just another fruitless exercise, or lead into another discussion on the merits of free speech I <i>certainly</i> don&#x27;t want to get into, again.<p>By the way, you&#x27;re completely free to defend these gigantic corporations deplatforming whoever they want; I wasn&#x27;t talking about that in my original comment. That implication was already present in my first reply, but maybe my saying it outright will convince you that I don&#x27;t mean anything bad with my comments.')
