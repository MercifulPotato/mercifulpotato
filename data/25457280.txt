There are many things that make America, and every other country, unique. Maybe America produced Google because it&#x27;s the only country with that population size that&#x27;s made up virtually entirely of immigrants?<p>It&#x27;s also an is-ought fallacy. America is also the only rich country that&#x27;s built that much of its wealth on slave labour, so does that mean slave labour is a good thing?<p>&gt; let their ridiculously permissive (and coddling) employer pad their bank account<p>As a reminder, just in case the principles of capitalism, quite ironically, elude you, the company hires employees it expects will pad its own bank account more than it pads theirs.<p>&gt; Not once they realize how everyone else lives.<p>It is certainly true that the conditions of most Google employees are much better than those of the rest of the world, but they are so <i>because the company&#x27;s employees created that wealth</i>.')
