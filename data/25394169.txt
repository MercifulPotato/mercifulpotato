Item(by='unpixer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607735673, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25383485, text='Long ago, Ambrosia Software had a booth at one of the major tech conferences. Contests, trivia questions, t-shirts to win, the usual. Also, they were at the end of a major push to fix bugs in their games, and to celebrate they&#x27;d cooked up a bunch of food with bugs in it, and--somehow--convinced their marketing guy to eat the stuff in front of a bunch of attendees. (Maybe he lost a bet?)<p>And yes, I mean actual bugs. Insects. I&#x27;m talking roach pizza, worm casserole, that sort of thing.<p>Anyway, he shilly-shallied a bit, and finally agreed to do it, as long as he got to wash the stuff down with wine. (I&#x27;m assuming this part was staged as they&#x27;d brought a bottle.)<p>There was just one problem.<p>No corkscrew.<p>An appeal went out to the couple of dozen attendees: &quot;Does anyone have a corkscrew?&quot; Bunch of nerds at a tech conference, and nobody had a corkscrew...what are the chances?<p>Well, nobody except me, because I&#x27;m so ragingly dorky I never go anywhere without a Swiss Army knife of some sort.<p>I offered it up, the bottle was opened, there were cheers, and the guy standing next to me began lobbying the employees to give me a free t-shirt. Other attendees around him took up the chant, and the Ambrosia Software employees, to their credit, handed me a t-shirt when they returned my knife. It was a really nice one, black cotton with that big square maroon Ambrosia Software logo on the back, and the single word &#x27;thaumaturgy&#x27; on the front in white lowercase monospaced font.<p>I wore that shirt for years afterward, until it somehow got lost in the shuffle of dropping laundry off at the laundromat. I&#x27;m still sad about its loss, because I was wearing that t-shirt the first time I talked to the woman who later became my wife. It was the shirt that initially caught her attention. We&#x27;re still together to this day.<p>So thank you, Ambrosia Software. Thanks for the games...and everything else.')
