To be nice to Windows expats.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s expertly put together, but there&#x27;s really nothing more to it than that.<p>It&#x27;s ultimately configurable! So it can be anything you want. (Plasma can &quot;simulate&quot; any DE with the right config).<p>Additionally modern KDE&#x2F;Plasma is more lightweight than &quot;anything GTK&quot;. (This may sound strange to the older people but things changed over the last years).')
