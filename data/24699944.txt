I build personal projects on it.<p>I was able to find a few jobs, but not a ton (this was a couple years ago).  The jobs that are out there all wanted experience but obviously that&#x27;s hard to do with a new platform.  I got an interview with one company that I thought understood that I only had a few months experience as a hobbyist (which means I&#x27;ll be doing a lot of Googling even for common APIs) but they rejected me.  At this point my experience with professional Elixir has not been positive.<p>I love the language but I&#x27;ll probably just stay a hobbyist, at least until things change.')
