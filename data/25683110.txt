An AI diagnosis of a medical image seems redundant indeed, however in this situation a patient has seen a doctor out of complaints and has been sent to the radiologist for further investigation. This medical practice is reactionary, and suspicions are already present, so of course the AI isn&#x27;t doing much useful here.<p>Alternatively, imagine a proactive medical world, in which preventative screenings are commonplace. Currently, the implementation of routine screenings without any complaints is prohibitively expensive on a large scale. This is because it requires manpower, and manpower is prohibitively expensive and the expense of manhours needs to be justified by a medical practitioner. However, AI can help in this proactive medical world by reducing the number of hours real people are looking through data to detect problems of patients, reducing the cost of routine screenings at large. Again, this wouldn&#x27;t replace doctors, as you&#x27;d still need a specialist to analyze any positive hits, but it differs from your scenario in which the AI diagnosis seems redundant.<p>So, when preventative medical practices are more prevalent, the mass routine screening procedures will need help from machines to keep it cost effective, and that I believe is where this technology will find its application.')
