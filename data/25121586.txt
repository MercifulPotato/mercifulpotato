Item(by='labcomputer', descendants=None, kids=[25124672], score=None, time=1605604433, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25118369, text='I know everyone likes to use Kodak as a case-study for innovator&#x27;s dilemma, but...<p>Kodak&#x27;s patents on CMOS image sensors (which were invented in the 1970&#x27;s) ran out just about the same time as all the complementary technologies became commercially viable.   Things like signal processing, data storage, and energy storage.<p>Think about how you would perform the DCT to do JPEG compression in the early 1990s. You&#x27;d need an expensive, power-hungry ASIC.  Think about storing 10-100 MB of data.  That would be a 2.5&quot; spinning hard disk.<p>10 MSps ADCs (fast enough to shoot a frame per second) were not exactly exotic, but still very expensive.  16MB of DRAM was a luxury on Unix workstations.  How much of that do you want to spend on a framebuffer?<p>Think about how you&#x27;d power all this hardware.  Heavy NiCd batteries with memory, yuck!<p>The first DSLR that really took off for photojournalism (i.e., good enough quality to use in a printed newspaper) was the Nikon D1, in 1999.  It&#x27;s not that nobody had the right idea (Kodak had been selling digital cameras since the late 1980&#x27;s), but it took that long for technology to catch up with the idea of a digital camera.  It turns out (gasp!) that nobody wanted a digital camera that weighs 40 lbs, stores fewer photos than a roll of film, and has lower image quality.<p>It&#x27;s fun to blame Kodak management for being short-sighted, but I really don&#x27;t see a winning scenario.  Short of a &quot;Bet the whole company on CMOS in 1980 on the assumption that multiple enabling technologies from 3rd parties will improve by 10-100x in 10 years and that consumers will actually <i>like</i> the new product while we develop <i>the right</i> competencies and starve investment in growing lines of business.&quot;  That doesn&#x27;t sound like a way to get your year-end bonus.')
