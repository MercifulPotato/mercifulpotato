If something changes, and their system feels slower, they&#x27;re going to reasonably assume the thing that changed is at fault. That&#x27;s doubly true if there&#x27;s an easy switch to turn that thing on and off (which there often is, by picking a Wayland or non-Wayland session at login), and they can easily evaluate the difference in isolation. It might be cathartic to spend time yelling at people about who is actually at fault, but fixing the root cause would make there not be a fault to seek blame for.<p>People aren&#x27;t going to stop running GNOME en-masse. Distributions are not going to abruptly abandon GNOME. If (and I do mean &quot;if&quot;) there&#x27;s some issue with GNOME&#x27;s Wayland implementation, that&#x27;s going to be many people&#x27;s primary exposure to Wayland as a technology.<p>People will continue working on optimizations, to many places in the stack. It doesn&#x27;t matter where the fault lies or where the fixes need to happen, the <i>net result</i> is people saying things like &quot;I switched to Wayland and things got slower &#x2F; less smooth &#x2F; etc&quot;, and they&#x27;re going to continue saying things like that. It&#x27;d be nice if people phrased it more that way (slowness associated with switching to Wayland, rather than Wayland being slow), and provided more details about their environment, rather than implying that &quot;Wayland&quot; is a single piece of software which should incur their ire. It&#x27;d be even nicer if there were less ire to go around because more things Just Work.<p>It&#x27;s also entirely possible that some of the people in these various threads have issues with some <i>other</i> piece of software in the stack.<p>&gt; If you have a beef with GNOME, then bring it to GNOME.<p>I&#x27;m not the one with a beef with GNOME; you seem to be. If <i>you</i> have a problem with GNOME, take it to GNOME. GNOME works great for me, and I don&#x27;t care which Wayland protocols it does or doesn&#x27;t choose to implement. You haven&#x27;t even specified what precise change you think ought to happen there, just some general complaints about protocol extensions.')
