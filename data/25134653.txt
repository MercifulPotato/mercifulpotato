Why should we deny such countries the benefits of full industrialisation?<p>Secondly - while in some respects you are correct, looking at CO2 numbers some kind of drastic action seems to be required, it also leaves unanswered the question of &#x27;at what cost&#x27;. During the covid19 situation we&#x27;ve seen the impact of shutting down parts of the economy on GDP. That naturally always translates into deaths, and the kind of economic impact such drastic action would entail would likely run into millions of deaths, many of them far away in poorer nations receiving less govt aid (as with covid!)<p>I think the whole &#x27;nothing is enough the world will end!!&#x27; mentality does nothing but put those who are inclined to care into a state of deep depression and anxiety and those who are inclined to deny climate change into a better position to argue that the other side are being ridiculous. It does NOT help.<p>The correct approach is a practical middle ground where we try to do what we can.<p>In any case this govt response does somewhat epitomise the &#x27;climate hysterics&#x27; mentality in that it is hugely impractical, ignores many questions of trade-offs and impact as if there were none to be answered and is unilateral enough to be meaningless in the wider global context.<p>Keep in mind that if one country decides to take drastic action which tanks its economy, do you think other countries are likely to follow suit or rather elect govts that entirely unwind all and any climate action?')
