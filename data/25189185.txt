In my experience, the process of continous deployment, and the automation and defintion of processes to do it well bring more stability than the &quot;move slow and keep things stable&quot; environments.  When you deploy once a month (or less!) you view deployment as a one off thing.  When you deploy every day or every week.  You view releases as a regular part of development.  That change in mentality is critical to stable releases.')
