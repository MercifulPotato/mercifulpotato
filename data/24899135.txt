Item(by='fossuser', descendants=None, kids=[24899194], score=None, time=1603735628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24898803, text='The Apple Card is great - I switched to it and closed all my other credit accounts (even though the others had better overall cash return when factoring in their points value).<p>I did this for a few reasons.<p>- Better software: The iOS integration with Apple Card is really good. The second best I&#x27;ve seen was Amex, but they were still a distant second.<p>- &quot;Daily Cashback&quot; - just automatically putting the 1%&#x2F;2%&#x2F;3% back onto the cash card on my phone daily rather than having to deal with the card software&#x2F;points etc. The time&#x2F;value return on point optimization is fun, but ultimately just not worth it to me.<p>- Third party transaction protection: Apple made [edit: Goldman Sachs] agree to not resell transaction data.<p>- No upsell: Other cards are constantly spamming you with offers to get their checking account, services, etc. I don&#x27;t want any of these things, often the attempts to disable the emails doesn&#x27;t totally work.<p>- Easy cancel: Other cards require you to call and deal with retention services in order to cancel.<p>Other card services really dropped the ball on this, AMEX in particular is user hostile. Want to use the airplane points? You must pick an airline (not obvious). You want to get the money towards rideshare? You must click the boxes the enable it or you don&#x27;t get it. Oh - you also get the rideshare money doled out $15&#x2F;month without rollover to make it maximally hard to use. Paying $550&#x2F;yr and then feeling like they&#x27;re screwing you at every turn doesn&#x27;t create much loyalty. The Chase Sapphire Reserve was probably the best overall card before I switched to the Apple one.<p>If the other companies actually cared about their users they could have made a much better product. There&#x27;s huge opportunity in this space to make something that doesn&#x27;t suck with rewards that people actually want.')
