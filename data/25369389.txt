I&#x27;d argue that this is kind of a double standard (a traditional RDBMS may well be copies of &quot;deleted&quot; data on dirty pages, and may well leave that data on the physical disk indefinitely, for much the same reasons as Kafka does - it just makes it a bit fiddlier for you to access it), but your legal team may decide that it&#x27;s required.<p>I don&#x27;t think your overall scorn is warranted - there are bigger problems that are endemic to RDBMS deployments, and the advantages of a stream-first architecture are very real - but there are genuine difficulties around handling data obliteration and it&#x27;s something you need to design for carefully if you&#x27;re using an immutable-first architecture and have that requirement.')
