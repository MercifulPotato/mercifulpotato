But his book detailed just how horribly disastrous it went and how out of touch commanders ended up being in their planning, tying confidence to their egos. An example of one thing that went wrong, they landed some 35,000 paratroopers in the operation and the British group&#x27;s radios had an effective range of 3 miles, but the groups that needed to talk to each other were landed 8 miles apart.  Another part of the plan called for a group to head down a road to join another contingent for the next step, but didn&#x27;t accurately estimate the road&#x27;s capacity or how clogged it would get and how long it would take for them to make it - which ended up being 3x+ times as long, obviating their combat role.<p>Takeaway: that muddy terrain thing you mentioned is pretty important.

Short version, British women could do maintenance, spotlighting, loading and aiming but were not allowed to pull the trigger because only men were allowed to shoot at other men.  By contrast, Russian AA all-women teams were allowed to.  Here&#x27;s a starting point that just barely touches on this very-fascinating subject and shows how wide it is - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iwm.org.uk&#x2F;history&#x2F;the-vital-role-of-women-in-the-second-world-war" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iwm.org.uk&#x2F;history&#x2F;the-vital-role-of-women-in-th...</a><p>Takeaway: German pilots had their opinion of the matter, and they much preferred the British solution.')
