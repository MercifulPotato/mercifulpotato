Lockdowns are disruptive (surely nobody could disagree with that); pandemics are disruptive (again, presumably nobody disagrees). The important question is <i>to what extent</i> the population is disrupted in the &quot;lockdown&quot; and &quot;non-lockdown&quot; scenarios, and what costs the society pays in human death, a collapsed economy, long-term health effects etc in the two cases.<p>A reasonable discussion has to start by accepting that every course of action is shitty here! The task is to weigh up the amount of shit and the different qualities of the shit down each pathway; it&#x27;ll help nobody to claim that one pathway is shining and clean.')
