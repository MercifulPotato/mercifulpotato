Good luck being a plumber in most EU countries with only commanding the English language. That may work in tech but on a construction site or any blue collar job the customer or your boss will address you in the local language not English or your native tongue and if you don&#x27;t speak it then you&#x27;re a huge liability for the business.<p>Also, all bureaucratic issues with the banks and local authorities for setting up a business if you&#x27;re self employed are also not done in English but in the local language.<p>Try getting a blue collar job in Germany, and I don&#x27;t mean a barista in a hip touristic district where all clients are foreigners. You&#x27;re expected to pick up the local language yesterday.<p>The US having English as the default language everywhere means much less friction for everyone including foreigners be them employees or entrepreneurs.')
