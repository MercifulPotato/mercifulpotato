I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of it actually, and am a big fan - I just don&#x27;t see how GitLab&#x27;s new pricing can compete with AzDo, or even GitHub.<p>$49&#x2F;user&#x2F;m for Premium seems really expensive compared to AzDo and GitHub. Does GitLab have some killer feature I&#x27;m not aware of that justifies spending 2-10x that of the competition?<p>$99&#x2F;m for Ultimate eds? It doesn&#x27;t even explain on the pricing page what you get for that, beyond a couple of bullet points of biz-speak - it&#x27;s almost like they think anyone who buys that kind of language has more money than sense. Might have a point there to be fair, but still hard to see the point of Ultimate - would be really interested to hear if anyone here pays for it, and why?')
