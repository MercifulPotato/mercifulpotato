App stores, platform package managers (apt dnf ports homebrew), language package managers (gems pip maven CPAN npm etc), stand-alone installers (dmgs install exe-s), maybe even containers.<p>These services could form a layer with some autonomy from the underlying project — the author of the project rarely handles alll (or sometimes any) of the distro channels.<p>Anecdotally I feel like most of this stuff happens outside of GitHub, which is fine and actually good, but maybe there are things GitHub could do to smooth the process? To help the original authors arrange things in releases or set metadata in a way that’s useful downstream to packagers?<p>But some of it happens in projects already, sometimes for a desktop type app you’ll see a dmg or some other installer right in the project files. This could probably be more standardized.')
