This was back in the Kazaa days (p2p file sharing). He clipped the whole thing together and made it like one of those old mastercard commercials. The file was called &quot;master card revenge.&quot; He&#x27;s in the video himself and it&#x27;s clear he made it because it was an explicit fuck you to her. He even put her email address and physical college address in it. I&#x27;m not sure what came of the incident. This was about 15 years ago.')
