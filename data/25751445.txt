Item(by='slg', descendants=None, kids=[25751772], score=None, time=1610477124, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25751232, text='&gt;The most glaring example of this was public health authorities pushing for hard shut downs of pretty much all public spaces, but then turning around and giving the greenlight to densely packed BLM protests as critical to public health.<p>The BLM protests weren&#x27;t the first protests since the pandemic started.  There were anti-lockdown protests going on before that which were just as if not even more &quot;greenlit&quot; than the BLM protests.  I will also note that the BLM protesters were much more likely to follow basic precautions like mask wearing and only holding events outside when compared with the lockdown protesters.  In the end multiple organizations reported that there were no noticeable COVID spikes related to the BLM protests.<p>&gt;Another example is the imbroglio about vaccine prioritization, though that&#x27;s more about values (is it worth saving more lives if the saved lives are disproportionately white?) than it is about factual claims.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you are talking about here.  Care to share a link to a mainstream institution arguing that we should prioritize diversity in vaccine recipients over saving lives?')
