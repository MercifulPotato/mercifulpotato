However the pace is very brisk and would serve better for an intermediate learner familiar with the concepts. As a practical tool it would not provide much unless you really  know what you are doing and plan to leverage the use of SMT Solvers and code generation. You&#x27;d be better off with simpler and more focused learning materials. The Little Prover or Software Abstractions for example.')
