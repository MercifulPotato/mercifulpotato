GDP growth will cease to be a viable goal (and probably we&#x27;ll all be too well fed and entertained to care). But <i>until</i> we reach the point of using all our resources optimally, it&#x27;s reasonable to assume expansion and better allocation of production is a sensible goal, and to achieve it economists are arguing against more short-term, mutable obstacles like human rules.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like the probable existence of hard physical limits to human lifespan doesn&#x27;t invalidate the field of medicine. Or indeed, the probability that we&#x27;re\nnot smarter than twenty years ago doesn&#x27;t invalidate the field of computer science&#x27;s attempts to find more efficient ways of handling data,')
