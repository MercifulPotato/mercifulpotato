I work in an electrical engineering department that is filled with physics curriculum, problems, and culture.  The EE grad students don&#x27;t know many of the things I learned in EE undergrad, but have hefty physics chops.  Most everyone is a combined experimentalist and theorist.  The pure theorists are a little less grounded, but everyone else knows where the expertise ends and are content to not discuss things they don&#x27;t know about.  If my colleagues were more of the typical grant-driven hotshot type I probably wouldn&#x27;t have stuck around for any amount of time.')
