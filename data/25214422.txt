Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606339231, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25211334, text='&gt; It&#x27;s like trying to pass a basketball through a slit. Yes, there&#x27;s a theoretical interference pattern, and you can calculate it, but you can&#x27;t do the experiment because you can&#x27;t pass the basketball through a slit that small (in the case of basketballs, if I recall, the largest slit is angstroms if not smaller).<p>I know this doesn&#x27;t have too much to do with the core of your post, but I want to mention it nevertheless: QM does not imply that there is an interference pattern for basketballs. There might or might not exist one, but we would need an answer to the question of measurement to predict one way or the other.')
