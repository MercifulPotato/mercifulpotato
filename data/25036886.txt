Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604941550, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25030700, text='Right, most recently I was looking at the reference for buildGoModule, which produces two derivations--one for pulling the dependencies (e.g., go mod download) and another for building the package. Basically the idea is to avoid re-downloading dependencies if only the package&#x27;s source code has changed. Anyway, buildGoModule takes a `goModHash` field (or something like that, anyway) which is supposed to be <i>the hash of the dependencies derivation</i>; however, it completely omits any information about how to actually get that hash (and if you think you can just build the package and get the correct hash from the error message, you&#x27;re mistaken). Googling around a bit online you&#x27;ll find that you can use nix-prefetch, but it appears to only work on Linux. Note that this quirk is particular to Go, but this is the same sort of thing that you run into all the time in the Nix ecosystem.')
