When I first moved to the US I lived in an ~800 sqft 1 bedroom apartment. A deep dark cave with windows on only one smaller side.<p>It was so much worse than the 1970s ~600 sqft 2 bedroom apartment I had previously lived in in England. While smaller, the two bed apartment felt larger since it had separate rooms, not just a bedrooom, bathroom and a single large open plan area.')
