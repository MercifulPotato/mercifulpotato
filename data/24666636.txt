All I learned from reading it is that it supports markdown but not really what kind of site it&#x27;s for (e.g. blogs like wordpress etc).<p>I&#x27;m looking for a static generator to make a blog (static mainly for security and because I don&#x27;t want to do anything complex anyway). But not sure if this will suffice.')
