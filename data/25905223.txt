I think this 4chan Post describes the Kraken very well: \n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.4plebs.org&#x2F;pol&#x2F;thread&#x2F;301180971&#x2F;#301180971" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.4plebs.org&#x2F;pol&#x2F;thread&#x2F;301180971&#x2F;#301180971</a><p>&gt;This is my contribution to the Trump team&#x27;s legal case against election fraud. The Kraken was a crowdsourced legal case that they were building with the help of hundreds of volunteer experts, but most of it never got to see the light of day. We were explicitly told not to release any information to the public because that could undermine their case, since it would expose our work to the ongoing media slander campaign and allow the defense to more easily prepare counterarguments. Clearly that&#x27;s no longer a concern, so I&#x27;m publicly releasing my contribution to the case.<p>&gt;Interactive Colab notebook with code and full replication of findings:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colab.research.google.com&#x2F;drive&#x2F;1PwiipIQif63EMCxGFYA9jAjL-8Y5cCE1?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colab.research.google.com&#x2F;drive&#x2F;1PwiipIQif63EMCxGFYA...</a><p>&gt;The key takeaway of this analysis is that the Biden vs. Trump advantage of a vote tally reporting batch is highly (i.e. extremely) correlated with meta information about the counting process itself. This implies that if you counted the votes a different way you would have gotten a different final total, which is absolutely preposterous and a clear indicator of fraud. Additionally, we don&#x27;t see this happen')
