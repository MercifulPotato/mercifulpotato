Which for now is mostly Coal and Gas Power Plants. Coal is extremely poluting and Natural Gas is both polluting and has a geo-political mess of supliers.<p>Fusion is still years in the future and if even if there was a political will for nuclear it cannot be realistically rolled out quickly enough to decomission coal in terms of climate damage.<p>Without knowing all the details it seems like a much easier problem to solve:<p>- Get 24&#x2F;7 heat out of deeper earth&#x27;s crust without &#x27;fracking&#x27; earthquake&#x27;s<p>Vs<p>- Energy efficient time sustained nuclear fusion<p>As a bonus, if I&#x27;m allowed to be completely cynical, geo-thermal could enable much of the Oil and Gas drilling technology and know-how to transition to a new industry, giving them an exit strategy rather than continue this tactic of agressive lobbying and squeezing the final dollars out of the Petro-Chemical industry at the cost of Human Future.')
