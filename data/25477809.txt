In a social network, &quot;content&quot; is people (and what they post). In a search engine, it&#x27;s documents (and what&#x27;s in them). In an app store, it&#x27;s apps.<p>If there was nothing worth reading online, no one would use Google. If no one was posting anything interesting on Facebook, it would have no users.
