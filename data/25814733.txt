Neither of these are &quot;JS&quot;, but loads of people (both those who spend their days steeped in GitHub issues related to NodeJS development and those looking to heap scorn upon it) will argue as if they&#x27;re inseparable or synonymous, even though that&#x27;s not the case at all.<p>Imagine if people conflated Android development with programming in Java.  (This might be a more appropriate metaphor than intended, since most of the time the people who strike me as being out for blood regarding JS tend to exhibit the arrogance and nuance of someone coming straight from their university&#x27;s second year Java course.)')
