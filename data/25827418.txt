Some cars are depicted, but roads in the rural depictions are still dirt roads, not anticipating they would be paved.  Paved roads did exist before the 1890s, as they were generally used for cyclists.<p>With the Panhard brothers arranging the Paris to Lyon race in the 1890s, you&#x27;d think the artist would have heard of this, and anticipated more cars.
