And, sure, that&#x27;s an argument that Fair Use applies, which I missed, but is <i>not</i> an argument that this isn&#x27;t a valid 512 notice. A valid 512 notice <i>does not</i> require actual infringement, it requires that the person the sending the notice have and assert a <i>good-faith belief</i> in infringement. While we can&#x27;t explore the mind of the RIAA as to whether they have such a belief, they clearly have asserted that the tool exists for the express purpose of infringing their works such that knowingly distributing it would make the host liable for contributory infringement as well as making anti-circumvention claims.<p>An assertion of non-infringement, whether based on fair use or anything else, is obviously a basis for a <i>counter-notice</i>, and also an argument to make if the RIAA actually sues the content provider after the takedown (without or without counter-notice based restoration) to the service provider.')
