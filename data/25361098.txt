But I&#x27;m not a person who generalizes this to overall companies, incl. Oracle.<p>I personally don&#x27;t use Microsoft OSes, however I have several licenses since my family uses them. I also have a personal lincense (albeit it&#x27;s booted once a year) for some odd application I may need if stars align on the Friday, 13th. OTOH, I always have praised them for their ergonomics research, resulting hardware and their choice for keeping Kinect open back in the day. I won&#x27;t ever trust them but, I&#x27;m not delusional.<p>I don&#x27;t use Android devices or Chrome. Only some Google services. However day by day, I&#x27;m using their services less and contemplating to switch over to something like Proton. Also I loathe them for making pseudo-open stuff and closing it later. However, they&#x27;re pioneer of software defined network due to sheer size of their networks.<p>I have Apple laptops and iPhones but, my main desktops&#x2F;workstations are vanilla Debian boxes and always will be.<p>&gt; You are missing the whole point with Java, it isn&#x27;t about Java, rather all mainstream languages just like Java only move forward with dirty money (from HN point of view), but hey it is cool to hate Oracle.<p>No, I don&#x27;t hate Oracle per se. I only hate their money greed. Especially the money greed via Java. I&#x27;ve used their ZFS appliances after they acquire Sun. They were nice up to a point. I applaud them for the enterprise ecosystem around their OracleDB. I like how they managed to fuse Sun&#x27;s hardware with their software. But I don&#x27;t like their greed. Maybe this greed is required from their point of view, but I don&#x27;t like it.<p>Similarly I&#x27;m not keen on nVidia&#x27;s strong-arming everyone and pushing people around. Also I don&#x27;t like their arrogance. Yes, CUDA is nice, it&#x27;s the de-facto standard for now but, it doesn&#x27;t justify bullying others around.<p>Microsoft also contributes to Linux Kernel, I&#x27;m aware who&#x27;s doing what.<p>&gt; Do you also feel like removing Oracle contributions from the Linux kernel?<p>No, but I feel like you may like replacing it with a Java re-implementation running on a bare-metal HotSpot VM.<p>Not liking a part of something doesn&#x27;t need to spread all over that thing. Do you leave your car to a junkyard because you dislike the engine sound at a particular RPM? Do you change your PC because its USBs are a little slow to a similar model? Same idea.')
