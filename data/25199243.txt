The thawing is releasing massive amounts of Methane, and Nitrous Oxide which are far more impactful than CO2.<p>Due to warming temperatures more ice is melting and it&#x27;s raising the temperature of the oceans and it&#x27;s causing them to be more acidic, both of which is bad for phytoplankton populations, which have already declined steeply.  Phytoplankton is the basis for the entire marine ecosystem.<p>Like most collapses, a declines happen gradually then suddenly it crashes, my fear is that the phytoplankton population will crash soon, and when it does we&#x27;re in deep trouble.   20% of the atmosphere&#x27;s oxygen comes from phytoplankton, more than all the world&#x27;s rain forests combined.<p>The ocean is responsible for somewhere between 50-80% of the atmosphere&#x27;s oxygen, there is no telling what happens when the phytoplankton population crashes.  We could see a huge drop in oxygen levels in the atmosphere very quickly.<p>30% of the world&#x27;s population relies on the oceans for their primary source of protein, and about the same number of people rely on the marine ecosystem for their livelihood, when the phytoplankton population crashes, those people will be in serious, serious trouble.<p>Reducing our carbon output isn&#x27;t enough, slowing an increase still means we are increasing concentration levels, we need to be removing more than we are releasing, and I don&#x27;t see any possible way to achieve that with any known technology.<p>I don&#x27;t think we can stop, or even slow what we&#x27;ve started.  The earth is now seeking it&#x27;s new equilibrium state, it&#x27;s hard to say if we are part of that equilibrium state.')
