I think of graying out more as “the poster hit a nerve”, quite often a good thing and thus a good post.  Graying out to me isn’t the same as striking through someone’s text.  In polite conversation, the poster would “self-gray-out” their comment in some way, after having made their uncomfortable point to the relevant audience.<p>Agree with the comment about somehow getting greater refinement in negative feedback.  The idea should be to create a cultural norm that a downvote is about relevance, clarity, accuracy and not personal taste, political affiliation, cultish taboos.  But much like the everpresent need to change someone’s copy, there should be a way to allow certain people to vent that irrepressible urge to say “You’re wrong!”, just in a different manner.<p>More interesting to me is the psychological impact of the downvote.  Folks, especially the young, can take it much more seriously than it was meant to be.  This might be their first “adult” conversation, so to speak, and the idea is not to squelch them but not to drag down the general tone of discussion either.')
