It barely worked, and I gave up due to the cost of running it.<p>- Jobs? Ok!: a job board<p>This was probably the dumbest idea I had business-wise - I would scrape jobs from other sites, and ask people to pay to post their own jobs amongst the scraped jobs.<p>On the tech side of things, it was my first time using React and GraphQL, and I really enjoyed it. Oh and I used DynamoDB for highly relational data, which I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.<p>- Appointment Scheduler: a SaaS kinda like Calendly<p>By this point I sort of had an idea of how to build, I started using infrastructure-as-code (terraform), and building new ideas was just a matter of having one, and copy pasting assets. Tried selling the idea to consultant friends of mine, but they were happy using Outlook.<p>- Room Booking Co: Same idea as Appointment Scheduler, but for meeting rooms<p>This one I basically built to test the Google Calendar API. Turns out it&#x27;s extremely limiting for interfacing with public calendars.<p>- Online Or Not: a SaaS that performed contract testing on GraphQL endpoints, pivoted to an uptime monitor<p>I feel like this idea had legs, just launched too early: basically it would snapshot a &quot;good&quot; version of your GraphQL response, ping it every X hours, and alert when the response changed.<p>I actually took sales meetings on this one, built features that potential customers said were <i>must haves</i> before they could use it. Punchline: those &quot;potential customers&quot; ended up ghosting me.<p>All of those projects led me to where I am today: running <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;PerfBeacon.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;PerfBeacon.com</a> - (PerfBeacon helps you keep your app&#x2F;site fast by automating Google Lighthouse checks), and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;MaxRozen.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;MaxRozen.com</a> - where I write weekly about React, and have started selling a book on useEffect.')
