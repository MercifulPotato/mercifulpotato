Some concepts can&#x27;t be broken down to the simplest words and still keep the quality of the conversation, the precision, the density of information.<p>I think it&#x27;s just better to keep language as simple as it can be, as simple as the topic dictates. Don&#x27;t complicate it just for the sake of sounding smart if the discussion doesn&#x27;t require it.')
