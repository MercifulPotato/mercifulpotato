I&#x27;ve used AWS&#x27; service, it&#x27;s awful. Elastic&#x27;s is better, and price is comparable or better in fact. But the point is they don&#x27;t even have to compete on price if quality is superior!<p>If I&#x27;m spending $100k&#x2F;mo on my logging stack, and it&#x27;s falling over frequently (which in AWS-land means multiple days of back and forth, opening tickets etc), I&#x27;d way rather pay $120k&#x2F;mo for something that actually works.')
