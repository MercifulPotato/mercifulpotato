Cost of living is higher than London in somewhere like Geneva.\nFor growing US tech companies, what is the main reason why they want to open a tech office in Europe? If it&#x27;s just regulatory &#x2F; business &#x2F; tax stuff, there&#x27;s no need to employ developers: it could just be business &amp; legal side. If it&#x27;s access to talent then London is still great. Perhaps that will decline as it won&#x27;t be as easy to bring EU citizens over to work there.\nI know that the Silicon Valley salaries can be several times higher than in London, but for some Europeans it just doesn&#x27;t seem super attractive to live and work in the US.')
