[1]<p>I mention this mainly because I doubted my memories when I saw the date 1984, which would have put me in uni rather than as still at school.<p>At that time, I was probably more of an arsehole than I am now, but I credit the film for making me rethink some really important things, mainly to do with rights&#x2F;respect for others. I would like to think that its effect on me was positive.<p>At the time of watching it in the cinema (1982, with the explanatory voiceover &quot;I knew the lingo, every good cop did&quot; etc), I remember being uneasy with Deckhard&#x27;s pressuring of Rachael to kiss him etc. But it didn&#x27;t spoil the film for me.<p>Years later, I got a DVD collection with various cinematic releases and director&#x27;s cut (without the voiceover narrative and with previously cut scenes) etc. I was surprised that the Deckhard&#x2F;Rachael stuff hadn&#x27;t been revisited; years after having watched it in the cinema, it looked to me to be even more like an abuse thing. However, I still rate the film for providing a slap in the face about discrimination etc.<p>I&#x27;d like to see another cut - with the voiceover, which helped me and I like it - but with revisions to the Rachael&#x2F;Deckhard pressured relationship thing.<p>It isn&#x27;t as though Harrison Ford hasn&#x27;t had revisionists messing with his work, after all. We all know that Han shot first. ;-)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blade_Runner#Release" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blade_Runner#Release</a>')
