It&#x27;s not because they believe in smaller government or lower taxes.<p>Conservatism plays this game where it uses this violent rhetoric casually and then acts all surprised when its own members act on that rhetoric. They tell each other that anyone who disagrees with them is an anti-american who want to make this a communist&#x2F;socialist&#x2F;fascist state. That voter fraud is rampant and that they will need to overthrow the government with violence. They do this is, in much more graphic detail than I&#x27;m using here.<p>Then, when something violent occurs, we&#x27;re all just supposed to sit here and pretend like it&#x27;s just some happenstance and we shouldn&#x27;t judge them by their own inaction in stamping out the rhetoric from their midst.')
