Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=[24930480], score=None, time=1603979015, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929682, text='&gt; I think the most reasonable explanation for this attack is that people who disagreed with Jeremy&#x27;s political opinions (mask use good) found a smokescreen to attack him with (liking notebooks, not being kind).<p>Is mask-use unpopular with the SJW crowd though? Because CoCs in general and &quot;that was not kind&quot; + the process they chose sounds very much like the SJW crowd, and I&#x27;m not aware that they are anti-mask.')
