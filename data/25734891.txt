I noticed that Whatsapp allows me to add someone to a call (sort of like upgrading a phone call to a group call). I couldn&#x27;t find a way to do that with Signal - although Signal supports group calls (that is, calling an entire group at once).<p>It&#x27;s a minor feature, but I discovered that I rely upon it quite often.<p>2. Last year, I attempted to switch from iOS to Android - and I discovered that there isn&#x27;t a clean way to move my whatsapp messages over. On iOS, whatsapp creates a backup on iCloud, there isn&#x27;t any way to recover that on Android.<p>I aborted the attempt to switch to Android only because losing my whatsapp chat history was unacceptable.<p>Signal currently seems to be just as bad. However, if signal can implement a reasonable way to create backups and recover them across devices and operating systems, it will seal the deal and convince me to permanently delete whatsapp from all my devices.')
