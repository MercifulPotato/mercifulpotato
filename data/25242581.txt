Item(by='bjourne', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606618413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25240961, text='&gt; As an avid city cyclist I don&#x27;t get the appeal of e-bikes as a mode of transport.<p>&gt; They&#x27;re heavy and expensive and require more maintenance than regular bikes. For many cities, riding at 35 km&#x2F;h on average also sounds pretty dangerous.<p>Most e-bikes with 250W engines are capped at 25 km&#x2F;h so, essentially, for a <i>fit</i> cyclist they only help for uphill climbs and acceleration. But even 25 km&#x2F;h is good because it means you can keep up with more traffic and thus ride on heaver trafficked roads.<p>I agree that e-bikes aren&#x27;t that amazing in good weather, but they are very practical in cold, snow, and rain. A 250W engine makes a huge difference when its snowing and you have a 12 km ride home.')
