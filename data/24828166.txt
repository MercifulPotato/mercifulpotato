Even if they have an implicit bias in their moderation.  Even if they have an explicit bias in their moderation that they put in their ToS.  It specifically says &quot;that the provider or user considers obscene...&quot;, which explicitly states the bias of the provider is considered.<p>The only way Twitters moderation could remove their Section 230 protections is if they did it in bad faith.  If they were doing it specifically to try to lose Trump the election, that might count as bad faith because it has nothing to do with limiting access.  They are, however, free to remove everything he posts because they find him to be objectionable.  Or to remove things they think they are objectionable.  Or to only remove violations of their ToS when Trump does it, because they find him or his past patterns objectionable.  Or because they find it more likely to lead to flamewars, etc on the site when he does it.  Etc, etc, it&#x27;s mostly a hypothetical because you have to prove bad faith, which is hard unless someone is dumb enough to write it in an email.')
