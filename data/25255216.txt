But they&#x27;ll still have the ability to pass on that infection to someone who wasn&#x27;t vaccinated, or falls into the 5-10% of people who the vaccine isn&#x27;t effective for.<p>Obviously the vaccines have benefits, especially for high risk populations. But I see very little benefit to these corporations requiring their customers to have it, since their customers can still be infected and spread the virus.')
