There are a lot of people who work in well-paying jobs and have never really experienced what the labor that enables their relatively privileged lifestyle actually feels like. They often weigh in with &quot;well, get a better job&quot; but not only is that not an option for everyone, it means you&#x27;re devaluing absolutely critical work. The snobbery among people who fail to see that is aggravating.')
