BF is great but it&#x27;s not a parallel HN where a secret world of similar discussion is going on. To overgeneralize a bit, topics there tend to be narrower and oriented around specific concrete situations. A lot of it is about hiring, offices, things like that. There are a lot of Launch posts, especially by startups in the current batch who don&#x27;t feel ready to go to a bigger format yet.<p>Actually I think YC would probably like BF to become more HN-like and may find ways to encourage intellectually richer discussion (I&#x27;ve been asked a few times to advise about that). But if YC founders aren&#x27;t posting to HN, it&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re busy participating in an alternative-universe HN. It&#x27;s more likely as the GP said, that they&#x27;re busy workingâ€”as they should be.')
