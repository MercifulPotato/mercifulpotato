However the price of software should be factored in the price of the product itself (hardware + software). I am paying for both to own the product. If they issue a software update that makes better use of hardware, it means they failed to release good software to begin with (ofc perfect software doesn&#x27;t exist). Now imagine if they found a way to increase battery life just with software, and asked you to pay for it.. kinda not fair right?')
