Games were often resold, with each time no revenue going to the developer.  I worked on a popular Xbox &#x2F; PS3 game that was resold like 7-9 times on average.  Our marketing people figured that GameStop made a lot more money on the game than the developer.<p>Why is that bad?  Big console games started to need to be really long, because if you could finish them in a week you would lose a ton of sales to retail.  That&#x27;s why you started to see games where you had to wander around, grind, play through a level backwards, chase achievements.  It also caused an emphasis on in game purchases (in console games) and online play.  It just got a lot harder to make a short single player game on console.<p>A lot of those problems go away as console games are sold in a digital store.')
