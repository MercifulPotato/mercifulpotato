I hope they don&#x27;t do the same to Rust. Just use Haskell and leave the rest of us alone!<p>It sounds silly but its true.. as you increase the complexity  of the language, the hardcore users making the libraries adopt those features, which means users have to adopt those features as well. Pretty soon everyone is talking about monad transformers and HKTs and it takes 4 hours to write something that would take 15 minutes in Python.<p>Then the wave of FP consultancies and trainings show up so they can bill you $10000s on workshops and conferences to teach your devs monads.')
