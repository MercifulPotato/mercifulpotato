It&#x27;s improved a lot in the last few releases.<p>But none of my clients even ask about Firefox support anymore. They don&#x27;t care and neither do 99% of their users. Supporting FF maybe be the morally correct and heroic thing but it&#x27;s like being vegan. You&#x27;re a rounding error on policy decisions that matter.<p>As a thought experiment - what has the existence of FF done to prevent Apple &amp; Google from going their own ways lately on web features? Not much if anything at all.')
