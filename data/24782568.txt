Bandcamp is exactly that (giving you your choice of FLAC or MP3 or whatever, without DRM, and available for download again so long as Bandcamp continues to exist) and is good for artists, since it&#x27;s an actual album sale, so none of the nonsense associated with streaming payouts.<p>It&#x27;s good for discovery also, since while Bandcamp Daily is a marketing tool, it&#x27;s still written by music nerds who do a good job curating music from local scenes and odd genres. Indie labels also often run storefronts on Bandcamp, and are a decent way of finding the same, as most release music from their local area or with a similar sound. It&#x27;s different from algorithmic discovery, and requires a bit more effort, but IMO it&#x27;s worth it to explore on your own, and a fun way to learn something more about an album or track than streaming services&#x27; &quot;Chill Hip Hop Beats To Study&#x2F;Relax To&quot;-style personality-void mood-based curation.<p>Bandcamp isn&#x27;t perfect, to be sure. It&#x27;s not as good for older music (though there are niche labels like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;habibifunkrecords.bandcamp.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;habibifunkrecords.bandcamp.com&#x2F;</a> that dig up old recordings and re-release them digitally) or big-name artists on major labels, but there&#x27;s so much music available nowadays that you usually won&#x27;t be at a loss for something to listen to, you just won&#x27;t always be able to find a specific track as easily as on Spotify. Their mobile app also isn&#x27;t great, and really needs to add a way to download tracks for offline listening, but hey, no music service is perfect, and I&#x27;m fine using a mix of both it and Spotify where one offers a better experience than the other.')
