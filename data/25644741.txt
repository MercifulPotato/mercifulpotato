Your product seems useful, so useful in fact I bookmarked it.<p>2. However you hardly had any Google traffic to begin with - maybe Google traffic is not something you should optimize for - <i>except</i> for when people specifically search for your product<p>3. with which your landing page might not help.<p>Let me expand:<p>1. I tried a few searches on your site and it generally came back with good results. I like that the articles are short, to the point and didn&#x27;t waste my time. Some commenters here recommend to make those articles longer for SEO - don&#x27;t. Making users read long articles is the opposite of what your site promises.<p>2. Google traffic is way less important for useful websites than SEO people would make you believe. If your product is good, people will come - and come back. SEO can actually <i>hurt</i> the usefulness of your product, and thus its long-term growth. Never <i>ever</i> listen to SEO people who want you to make your product worse. I may be suffering from survivorship bias, but less than 10% of my site&#x27;s traffic comes from search engines, and 99% of that search engine traffic was just people searching the name of my sites. I can&#x27;t tell you whether <i>any</i> site could survive on this, but I can promise you that this &quot;independence&quot; comes with peace of mind (I don&#x27;t <i>care</i> whether I show up on Google at all).<p>3. It took me a moment to figure your product out. &quot;This website exists to make shopping less time consuming&quot; did not help at all - there&#x27;s hundreds of ways I can imagine one might make &quot;shopping less time consuming&quot; after all. My confusion ended when I read &quot;Find above-average products selling for below-average prices&quot;. Maybe that should be at the very top with the search field directly below it - which can also contain text other than just &quot;Search.&quot;. Check the mockup at the beginning of this post. You could place the &quot;less time consuming&quot; text somewhere else, I just was too lazy. Some things besides &quot;less time consuming&quot; that people might search are &quot;best budget products&quot;, &quot;best value for money&quot;, etc. - so you could make sure these show up on your landing page too. Except <i>after</i> the text that explains the site for the <i>human</i> visitor.')
