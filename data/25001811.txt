The reason?  I wanted to know my programming languages better.<p>Instead of auto-imports and auto-complete I was forced to have java&#x2F;scala docs open for whatever library I was using.  Beyond giving me better muscle memory for the core language libraries, this had the interesting side effect of only using well documented libraries.<p>The lack of jump-to-definition also made me think more about dependencies in the code I was writing since they would require a cognitive leap and reasonably heavy context switch.  Since cross-file refactoring requires bash-fu and is also a heavy process, this furthered my desire to minimize coupling.<p>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m more productive and if I were coding day in and day out for my day job I would probably still use IntelliJ (especially for large Java code bases that were crafted by advanced IDE usage), but I find coding to be a more holistic endeavor now.')
