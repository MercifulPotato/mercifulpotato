It will not work. It&#x27;s waiting for an O, and once that is triggered it waits for an X and so on.<p>If you try to make a move out of turn it seems like the illegal move is still &quot;queued up&quot; somehow. So as soon as you make a legal move the previously attempted illegal one occurs, as it&#x27;s now legal.<p>In fact, this resulted in an interesting game where both sides won:<p><pre><code>    { type: &quot;X&quot;, payload: 0 }\n    { type: &quot;O&quot;, payload: 8 }\n    { type: &quot;X&quot;, payload: 1 }\n    { type: &quot;O&quot;, payload: 2 }\n    { type: &quot;X&quot;, payload: 3 }\n    { type: &quot;O&quot;, payload: 6 }\n    { type: &quot;X&quot;, payload: 7 }\n    { type: &quot;O&quot;, payload: 5 }\n    { type: &quot;X&quot;, payload: 4 }\n    { type: &quot;XWins&quot; }\n    { type: &quot;OWins&quot; }\n</code></pre>\nI guess it needs a few more behaviours...')
