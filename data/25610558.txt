Of course, such packages are provided in spas these days. Obviously not practiced as in the texts.<p>Having said that, I have translated tamil and Sanskrit texts. I distinctly remember a verse that describes a preparation made with heavy metals ..I believe there was arsenic. And my fav ingredient there was Mercury. That would fix ani-ageing.<p>I always keep an open mind. One never knows. If only we knew what the ‘Soma’ creeper is and where it can be found..<p>Random google search result:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ayurveda-sedona.com&#x2F;knowledge-center&#x2F;anti-aging-rejuvenation&#x2F;kaya-kalpa-anti-aging-therapy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ayurveda-sedona.com&#x2F;knowledge-center&#x2F;anti-aging-rejuv...</a><p>[..] First of all, one is sequestered for about 90 days. The patient is to remain in a “Kuti” a specially built closed cottage or hut, where light does not enter. During those three months, they remain in the darkness, shielded from sunlight and outside visitors. There, they begin complete purification of the body through Pancha Karma detoxification techniques. Certain herbal pastes are rubbed onto the body to exfoliate, and than allowed to dry, drawing out toxins. Medicinal plants, leeches, sweating and vomiting therapies are used for further detoxification of every organ system. During this time, diet is very minimal, perhaps eating only once a day, or even fasting on liquids. Some yogis drank only warm cow’s milk, considered sacred by Hindu’s, during the whole process. Specialized salts were ingested to preserve the body.<p>After weeks of cleaning the body of all built up impurities, it is time to re-nourish tissues at the deepest levels. Abhyangha massages, mineral baths, shiro dhara, sacred essential oils and precious gems were used to anoint the body. At this time, the immune boosting rasayana herbs and fresh juices were administered. These tonics are full of antioxidants, fighting free radical damage. There are legends of rare, specialized rasyanas, such as the elusive “Soma” plant, found in the mountains of India. It is not quite clear where this creeper was exactly located, but apparently it was the secret ingredient necessary in the magical elixir of youth.<p>After their morning spa therapies, patients spent the majority of their time performing tapas, meditating, reciting mantras, and practicing yogic breath. This time of hibernation not only cleansed their physical body but transformed their subtle and emotional bodies as well. They release all stuck emotions, anger and grief. They clear karmas of past lives through inward reflection. They often had visions of God, bestowing blessings upon them, and filling them with light. Universal knowledge is revealed to them from the cosmos. They cultivate inner peace.<p>After the “Kuti-pravesika” (living in the dark cottage, sequestered for 90 days) the person emerges completely transformed. The old grey hair falls out and is replaced by black hair. Old teeth fell out, replaced by new teeth. Complexion becomes fair, wrinkles smooth out and skin’s elasticity is restored. Eyesight and hearing drastically improve. Age related joint&#x2F;body pain is gone. Memory and concentration is sharp, and there is spiritual clarity. The normal gross, dense vibrations of the physical body are sped up to a lighter, subtler frequency.[..]')
