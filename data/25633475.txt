Sounds unlikely right? Running the same broken experiment any number of times won&#x27;t change that it&#x27;s broken. So if these &quot;100 million+&quot; ad experiments are more or less copies of each other they could all be wrong. How likely is that? I don&#x27;t know, but I do know that at a big Silicon Valley tech company that you&#x27;ve definitely heard of I was involved in an exercise where we were told to create an experiment. The type A take charge person in our group did what they do, which in this case was talking over and shutting down the Los Alamos trained particle physicist who was trying to explain to her why her &quot;experiment&quot; could never show anything.')
