It&#x27;s not unusual for a language to make breaking changes in early versions. What happens when you realize you need to do it late in the game? Tough call. I think it&#x27;s probably impossible to know whether cost of breaking changes in the short term (people leaving Python for Go, etc.) was justified relative to the cost of a crufty and inadequate Python in the future (people leaving Python for Go, etc.). I&#x27;m generally sympathetic, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get into Python until the transition was well underway.')
