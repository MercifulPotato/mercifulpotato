The stealthier way to do that would be to have real-time access and then inject the ballots at the last minute in the names of people they know didn&#x27;t vote, so there wouldn&#x27;t be duplicates.<p>The scattershot method would be to predict who isn&#x27;t likely to vote, e.g. because they didn&#x27;t vote last time, and submit ballots in those names. Then they would have some duplicate ballots, but if the predictions about who wouldn&#x27;t vote were mostly right, they could submit thousands of ballots and only have a small percentage of duplicates. There would be <i>some</i> duplicates, but then what do you do? You could throw out the duplicates, but one of the two was a legitimate ballot, and the majority of fraudulent ballots wouldn&#x27;t be duplicated and would still get counted. It&#x27;s also not obvious how to distinguish between whether a small percentage of duplicated ballots out of millions cast are a result of a single act of intentional fraud or many independent acts of incompetence.<p>Another alternative would be to register people who didn&#x27;t request to be, e.g. people who are institutionalized and a worker at the institution is in a position to register them and then intercept their ballots and submit them.<p>Some privileged positions would allow someone to do this at greater scale, e.g. postal workers. A postal worker in a high density city could have many thousands of residences on their route, each with multiple eligible voters. Get a copy of the voter rolls, register every eligible voter on their route who isn&#x27;t already in there, use their real social security numbers obtained from a copy of the Equifax leak or similar, then request mail-in ballots to take and submit.')
