He prepared when the communists were taking over by getting fake identity papers. Learned a new skill to earn a living in the cash economy. Moved several times. Eventually got rescued by an American immigration program accepting those who worked for American contractors. If America becomes a failed state I really donâ€™t know where to turn.')
