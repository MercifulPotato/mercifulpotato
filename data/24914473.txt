Formalizing these DSLs in ZFC is a nightmare because its axioms are arcane and far from common mathematical discourse (much like assembly).  On the other hand, the type formers and rules of (say) MLTT are natural generalizations of the rules of ordinary logic.<p>&gt; Mainstream mathematicians are not being prevented from proving theorems because they lack &quot;better ways of reasoning about equality of types.&quot;<p>How do you know?  I&#x27;ve made the mistake of assuming that the definition of a certain morphism is natural with respect to a certain object when it wasn&#x27;t (coevaluation in a rigid monoidal category).  Better language for equality and naturality are precisely what HoTT provides.  More importantly, the hope is that type theory will not only provide better language, but relieve us of the tedium of checking proofs by hand.<p>&gt; The importance of ZFC is that it ensures our common language reasoning isn&#x27;t incoherent.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is true. AFAIK, no one has written down the definition of (say) a scheme from first principles in ZFC.  In fact, if you care about coherence&#x2F;verification, you should care even more about type theory.  IIRC this is what drew Voevodsky to type theory in the first place -- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathoverflow.net&#x2F;questions&#x2F;234492&#x2F;what-is-the-mistake-in-the-proof-of-the-homotopy-hypothesis-by-kapranov-and-voev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathoverflow.net&#x2F;questions&#x2F;234492&#x2F;what-is-the-mistak...</a>')
