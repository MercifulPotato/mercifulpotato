To go from WGS84 to LTP, the coordinates first need to be transformed to Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinates and then translated and rotated.<p>I was quite surprised to find that while it is straightforward to go from WGS84 to ECEF with a closed form, the other way, from ECEF to WGS84, needs to be computed iteratively [1] and is not trivial to find.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Geographic_coordinate_conversion#From_ECEF_to_ENU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Geographic_coordinate_conversi...</a>')
