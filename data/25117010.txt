There are products that behave like this on Windows, but they&#x27;re typically part of a security suite which one may or may not want. Others are free and display ads or collect information about the user.<p>I&#x27;ve used two products in the past, NetLimiter and ZoneAlarm. Back then NL was just getting some basic firewall features, since its main feature was throttling the connection per app. I used ZA as a free product, but now I see they have a paid version. \nLast time I checked a couple of years ago I also found GlassWire, but I didn&#x27;t purchase it because it kept being detected as infected by VirusTotal and the dev didn&#x27;t have a clue what was wrong.<p>Frankly I don&#x27;t know how trustworthy any of these apps are - this is a big problem with security software on Windows - you don&#x27;t know if the anti-malware is going to behave like malware.')
