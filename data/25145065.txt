The bigger the company, the more crap you&#x27;ll be required to pass through.\nIt&#x27;s not just tech related, any office job has the same.<p>Politics, indoctrination, favouritism, corruption, boring tasks.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, some small companies can be hell as well, if the founders &#x2F; first hires are not great. But the bigger the company the higher the chance of finding some of those people who will create a bad environment.<p>It&#x27;s often done in good faith, sometimes for personal gain.<p>Starting your own company will give you the freedom to either run solo or hire people you like, giving you the creative freedom you long for.\nI wouldn&#x27;t recommend going the startup-raise-millions-burn-millions route, chances of success are low and it&#x27;s a stressful ride.\nCheck out the video Bootstrapping Side Projects To Profit by Pieter Levels.')
