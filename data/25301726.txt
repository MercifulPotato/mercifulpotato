They should not cost so much - because their services are valuable and therefore, more of them should be produced to make medical costs lower.<p>Physician salaries make up about 8% of medical costs. And even if you doubled medical school class size, you wouldn’t get 2x the doctors because there aren’t enough resident slots available.<p>And even if you had enough slots available, you’d still need to guarantee high salaries afterwards. Most people who are smart&#x2F;driven enough to be doctors aren’t going to work 80-100 hours in a high stress position for 3 years if they are only going to come out making $80k.<p>So the only way to drastically increases (3x,4x) the supply of doctors is to drastically decrease the standard of training.<p>So you reduce residency down to 1 year and you triple the number of doctors. Now you’ve reduced the quality of doctors, and you save people less 5% in healthcare costs, but no one even notices because that number gets drowned out by the continued rise in the other 92% of healthcare costs.')
