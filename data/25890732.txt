While I have no statistics at my disposal, I&#x27;ve also seen a non-trivial number of HNers who shared a similar view (though I likely have cognitive biases towards this similar line of thinking).<p>Having lived in SF and San Jose, as well as having spent time in Chicago and New York... Give me a decent sized house in suburbia, a car, and a decent spot in town that doesn&#x27;t look like it is just trying to die but people are keeping the husk of it alive for it&#x27;s &quot;charm&quot;. Surround me with food and entertainment that doesn&#x27;t cost city prices to enjoy, passersby who greet you warmly instead of burying themselves in their phones or music, and feel free to let most of that experience be pretty generic - I don&#x27;t need some to be sold on some place&#x27;s history or background or mission statement when all I want is a burger.<p>Cities are many things to many people. I respect that people enjoy them and wouldn&#x27;t want to take them away from anyone. But it&#x27;s not for me, never has been, and likely never will be. I&#x27;m glad to have found a company that respects that.')
