Item(by='nyanpasu64', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604539435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24993440, text='&gt; Vectorized icons on the other hand take up much less memory and can auto-scale to different displays and use-cases.<p>In the absence of grid-fitting and hinting, monochrome vector icons are just as mediocre at scaling to arbitrary sizes as colored vector icons. However, I think one &quot;advantage&quot; is that fuzzy monochrome borders look less bad than fuzzy outlined borders.<p>TTF bytecode supports grid-fitting and hinting (I believe SVG doesn&#x27;t support it), and it would be interesting to see that applied to rescalable icons. However, you&#x27;d have to turn off subpixel antialiasing.')
