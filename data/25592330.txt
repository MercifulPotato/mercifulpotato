Item(by='beagle3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609420482, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25592128, text='&gt; does this mean it can be deactivated?<p>Sort of. You either deactivate it completely with --gc:none ; or, you do it on per-variable basis by using a &quot;ptr&quot; (pointer) type, which is <i>outside</i> of the GC&#x27;s realm. Any variable declared &quot;ref&quot; (reference) is <i>within</i> the realm of Nim&#x27;s GC, and will be tracked by the gc you chose (none, boehm, mark&amp;sweep, arc, orc, ...).<p>Additionally, you can define type bound operators to help the GC do its job, but IIRC (and I&#x27;m not sure I understand correctly), that doesn&#x27;t turn off arc&#x2F;orc - rather, it tells them how to apply some things.')
