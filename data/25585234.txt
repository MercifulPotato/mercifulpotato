It worked. It never didn&#x27;t work. I got the surgery I needed. I always got to see a doctor when I was sick.<p>A lot of talk about the disfunction in the American system misses the point that it is functional. We don&#x27;t have millions of people dying on the streets because they can&#x27;t get health care.<p>We do spend a colossal amount on healthcare here, and there are definitely improvements that could be made. But we also have one of the least healthy populations on the planet.<p>Realistically to transition the USA to a socialized system you need to make the current system collapse. You won&#x27;t succeed in major changes to a functional entrenched system like we have now.')
