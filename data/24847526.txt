When I wake up my Mac from sleep mode the keyboard and mouse are unresponsive for a up to a few minutes in some extreme cases, sometimes I even have to hard reboot. I found online that it was related to VPNs trying to restore their connection but I could never find the link between the keyboard and the VPN.<p>It was also compounded by the VPN setting I use to disable all traffic until it successfully reconnects. Meaning whether my computer works or not is dependent on my VPN providers reliability.<p>Now that I know Apple thinks I need an internet connection to wake up my laptop securely I&#x27;m quite pissed by this. Brand new $4k laptop is a paperweight if my VPN can&#x27;t connect.')
