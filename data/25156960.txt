Your employer cares about the bottom line, so make it about the bottom line. The Linux Kernel is a fantastic example of egoistic altruism in action. You don&#x27;t need to hire people to fix arbitrary things in OSS (although that would be appreciated), just fix the things you care about.<p>Finally, getting a PR merged into a big project makes any other method of training look grossly incompetent - and it&#x27;s free. Go ahead and cancel that company-wide Pluralsight or Linked-in Learning contract, now we&#x27;re saving money.<p>Don&#x27;t ask for open source developers, ask to fix things in open source.')
