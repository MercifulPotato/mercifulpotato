Even if one can technically use it whenever, according to what @throwaway998662 says, in practice this means you can only crap during the 1-2 hours <i>a day</i> when your cell mate(s) are gone.<p>Yeah, you could get a capricious teacher that says &quot;no&quot; when you ask, but that doesn&#x27;t seem like much in comparison to the degradation and potential for violence of using the toilet in prison...')
