Item(by='thisiszilff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608318866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25470473, text='&gt; Consolidation is a decent goal, but it really needs to be measured. For me, it is FAR more important to consolidate on the how to do things and not the what does things. In otherwords, rather than making an &quot;elasticsearch connection library&quot; specify &quot;This environment variable is the elasticsearch host&#x2F;credentials&quot; and let the apps move from there.<p>I think we&#x27;re in agreement here. Config is the most basic kind of knowledge because when something wants to know about the elastic credentials,it almost never makes sense to have it in two places if those two places are supposed to be the same thing.<p>How to actually connect to elastic -- that&#x27;s the part that is more iffy. If there is some knowledge we&#x27;ve added there, then it makes sense to DRY it up, but the knowledge of &quot;this is how you pass credentials to this elastic search client&quot; isn&#x27;t the kind of system knowledge we care about. If, for example, there were some kind of parameters that we had to set on each connection and we claimed it as a piece of knowledge that all of our connections to this service are of this specific TYPE and have these specific parameters, then we&#x27;ve started to add some additional systemic knowledge that might need to get consolidated.If someone were to start working on a piece of code and I feel the need to tell them &quot;Don&#x27;t forget about X&quot; then that is the kind of situation where DRY comes into play. If it&#x27;s just a vanilla connection to a database and we don&#x27;t care about the connections made, then I do given&#x27;t think we have a violation of DRY given that there isn&#x27;t an important piece of knowledge that&#x27;s repeated.<p>At some point, especially when we pay too much attention to copy-pasted code, we end up abstracting. Abstracting is hard, more general, very difficult to do right, almost always done to early. DRYing out knowledge is easier and almost always improves things.')
