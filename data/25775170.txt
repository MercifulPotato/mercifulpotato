I bought one for 35k euro 4 years ago.<p>However, we are about to become expats in one month so I kind of think of selling now (few reasons, government taxes, house prices went up). I think that renting is way better in a long run (unless you plan to live in one city for more than 10+ years). As for buying, maybe some small house in my 50s in some less populated area like mountains or forest :)')
