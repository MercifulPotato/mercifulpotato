AFAIK signal does empty APNS push to wake and then pulls data with it&#x27;s own connection and then displays text content with a local notification.<p>The main reason for the restriction to apple-only for notification services is battery life, and they&#x27;ve been proven right by bad behavior demonstrated on android.<p>Interestingly, if your a VOIP app you can actually circumvent a lot of the background networking restrictions, but it&#x27;s still hard to do when you don&#x27;t have an active call in place.  You also have to be an actual VOIP app to get approved with that entitlement.  Which wouldn&#x27;t be hard to get approval for if you made a fork of signal for example, since it does have real VOIP capabilities inside.<p>Either way the battery life of your device would be worse with your custom VOIP app always keeping a connection open vs. apple&#x27;s native OS notification system.')
