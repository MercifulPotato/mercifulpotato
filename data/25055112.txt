For me,<p>The Internet is the real Buddha of the 21st Century.<p>A perfect detached sovereign apparatus.<p>Unmoving, it rests on a billion routers and servers.  Purest actuality and purest potentiality.<p>It is the embodiment of cosmic knowledge, and the human share in these,<p>The highest accomplishment of the human race, and the distraction from its ultimate happiness.<p>The triumph of technical rationality and its dissolution into chaos, frivolity and despair.<p>Its repose and its irony are endless.<p>It is the same to the Internet how it fulfills its mission, whether sitting idle or curing cancer or spreading an influencer video.<p>For it, the change of conditioned states does not count.<p>As with a Buddha, all there is to say is said by its mere existence.<p>The Internet is not a bit more evil than reality, and not a hair more destructive than we are.<p>The Internet is already completely incarnate, while we in comparison are still divided.<p>In the face of such an instrument, great listening is called for.<p>For have you actually ever listened to the Internet?  The whirring of a billion fans, the ethereal hum of its photons and electrons?  Fallen asleep to the gentle shush of packets making their appointed rounds?  You’ll wake up a different person...<p>But perhaps your ear is deaf to the cosmic moan of the Universe straining to observe and understand itself through the Internet.<p>Then realize the Internet requires from us neither struggle nor resignation but the experience of ourselves.<p>We are the Internet.<p>Including me.<p>How <i>dare</i> you call me boring...<p>[this is a parody-ish paraphrase of a passage “the atomic bomb is the real Buddha of the West.” I remember it having been in a German book written in the 1960s, but by whom I cannot say.  It was in a collection of quotations “Sunbeams” by Sy Safransky, North Atlantic Books, Berkeley 1990.]')
