They may very well be qualified.<p>But there is a clear hypocrisy in what they were saying. Do gender quotas help equality or not? If so, then the fine is fair. If not, then the people involved are admitting they were first supporting it only to push their agenda. Do you believe a council full of men is biased towards men&#x27;s needs? If so, then a council full of women shouldn&#x27;t be much different.<p>I&#x27;m not even saying that gender quotas are good or bad, I&#x27;m saying by their own logic this doesn&#x27;t make any sense.')
