Genocide also, by definition, relates to killing off a culture - which there&#x27;s plenty of proof for regarding the CCP&#x27;s &quot;re-education&quot; camps - where children taken from their parents. And honestly it&#x27;d not be hard to hide disposal of human remains, even en mass in systematic way. There are plenty of reports and claims if organ harvesting as well. That your asking these questions makes me think you&#x27;ve not done much research or watched any documentaries on the CCP.')
