I predict they&#x27;d all stand down rather than serving in such a ridiculous fashion.<p>First you should take into account that the US is not the UK (or another European nation where police officers don&#x27;t carry guns). We have a serious gang and violent crime problem here. Cities like Chicago are battlefields, there are multiple murders every weekend. On holidays, you can casually see 100+ murders take place in two days.<p>Combine that with a big underclass population, wide availability of guns and drugs that induce and amplify psychotic behavior, intense racial hatred, hatred of the police, entire city blocks being infested with gangs, drugs and guns and do you really think disarming the police is going to solve anything? It&#x27;s a recipe for disaster that&#x27;s going to empower criminals and cause even more violence and death in the future.<p>You can&#x27;t pretend -like most progressives- these problems don&#x27;t exist just because you&#x27;re well-off, living in your upscale, well-patrolled neighborhood. This is you living in a bubble. Most of the folks advocating for disarming the police, should go take a stroll in South Side Chicago or east St. Louis.')
