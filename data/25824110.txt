One big one is simply that doctors in the US command a much higher salary than their counterparts elsewhere in the world:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;economix.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;07&#x2F;15&#x2F;how-much-do-doctors-in-other-countries-make&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;economix.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;07&#x2F;15&#x2F;how-much-do-do...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;agenda&#x2F;story&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;25&#x2F;doctors-salaries-pay-disparities-000557&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;agenda&#x2F;story&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;25&#x2F;doctors-sal...</a><p>Another big reason is that the US is unique in that it&#x27;s one of the only countries in the world where you get your healthcare through your employer. What we&#x27;re seeing in healthcare costs is analogous to what you might see happen to airline ticket costs if we all got our air tickets through our employers: the vast majority of us would fly business class, while the unemployed would be simply unable to pay for business class fares out of pocket. Employers (especially medium-to-large businesses) have a much higher purchasing power (and hence, willingness to pay) than individuals.<p>Now, if you take this behavior and combine it with the fact that health insurers&#x27; profit margins are capped by law by percentage, insurers pay more for treatments (which doctors happily accept), charge more to employers (who are generally less price conscious vs individuals), thus bring in more absolute revenue, and therefore more profit because a capped profit percentage of a higher revenue is higher than a capped percentage of lower revenue. It&#x27;s somewhat counter-intuitive, but the policy combination of an employer mandate and insurance profit cap results in the mother of all local optima.<p>Disclaimer: I work on health pricing in the US and sometimes adjust claims myself.')
