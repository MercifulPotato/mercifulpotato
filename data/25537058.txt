Item(by='jcfields', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608911063, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25536853, text='Mac OS has had a built-in file versioning system (separate from Time Machine) since Lion or so that works with any program that uses the standard document saving APIs. Most Mac users probably aren&#x27;t aware that their computer stores potentially hundreds of previous versions of their documents (in evictable space, of course). The interface for it is kind of trash and isn&#x27;t accessible in every app, though.<p>(Over the summer, I made a command-line [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;jcfields&#x2F;versions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;jcfields&#x2F;versions</a>] and a GUI program [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;jcfields&#x2F;restore" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;jcfields&#x2F;restore</a>] for accessing this system outside of the standard UI, if anyone&#x27;s interested, though the binaries are not notarized so the OS will show a scary warning the first time you use them.)<p>Granted, it&#x27;s not exactly the same thing since you&#x27;re not making commits at discrete and meaningful points like in a software version control system and since it works on an individual file level, which might not be ideal for every workflow, but it&#x27;s still really useful when you realize you need to roll something back to an earlier state.<p>I think modern versions of Windows use the Volume Shadow Copy service to store backups of files at given snapshot points (such as when your computer runs a scheduled backup or creates a System Restore point), which can be pulled up in the file properties. I use to use NTBackup to do basically the same thing in a more crude way back in the Windows XP days. This isn&#x27;t as nice as the Mac Versions feature since it requires setting up periodic backups, but it&#x27;s something.<p>I&#x27;d be curious if any of the free desktops have come up with a simple and user-friendly solution to this. I feel like this is an area where there&#x27;s a lot of room for improvement, since the majority of users would probably benefit from these systems but most aren&#x27;t even aware they exist.')
