When I say, &quot;I like the wine I&#x27;m drinking&quot;  I mean the wine I am drinking.<p>I am not <i>using</i> a term &quot;wine&quot; in some sentence constructed from fragments of prior text. I mean to refer to the object in my hand.<p>And likewise, if i ask a friend to &quot;pass me the wine&quot;, i mean a particular part of our shared environment.<p>Text reassembly can <i>appear</i> to refer, but it is genuinely proto-schizoprhenic to attribute to this system reference. It isn&#x27;t saying anything.<p>It isn&#x27;t with me expressing an attitude to our shared environment. It&#x27;s generating text. It will generate inconsistent text fragments on each generation run. It isn&#x27;t talking about anything, there isnt any intention to express anything behind the generation of text.<p>There is in fact no mechanism by which it can speak about an enviroment. It&#x27;s fragaments of prerecorded text reassembled on every run which appears to say something, but only because the people it steals from said somehting at the time. Now it it just a bad rehersal.')
