It’s a byproduct of how the stock price isn’t based in reality: it’s just based on investor perceptions. I don’t think the “barrier” of trading fees is really enough to say that it’s not about gambling in the first place. I might even go as far as saying that it’s purely accidental that the stock of a reputable company will likely go up. If investors get into a feedback loop of “investors don’t want to buy X stock”, the stock price will plummet regardless of how well the company actually does. You have to have enough investors with faith in the stock for it to stay up.<p>I think we’d do better judging the stock market for this systematic issue rather than some app which makes it easier to exploit that issue. Is robinhood part of the problem? Sure. But it’s not at the root of the problem.')
