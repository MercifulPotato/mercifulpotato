If I went any lower than 74 kB, the banding on the road became really obvious to me, and some of the grey parts of the road appeared slightly purple in a noticeable way, […]</i><p>&gt; <i>The fine detail of the road is lost in all of the compressed versions, which I&#x27;m ok with. However, you can see the difference in detail Kornel was talking about. Look at the red bodywork in the original, there are three distinct parts – the mirror, the wing connecting the bargeboard, and the top of the sidepod. In the AVIF, the smoothing removes the division between these parts, but they&#x27;re still mostly there in the JPEG, especially the 74 kB version.</i>')
