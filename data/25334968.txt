For instance, _requiring_ that new homes have electric vehicle chargers in the garage does nothing to help immigrant families purchasing their first home is a similar proposal that doesn&#x27;t nothing but increase harm to the environment and low income families.<p>Adding a level 2 charger to an existing home ranges from a few hundred dollars up to around $2k, depending on where you are in the US and whether or not you need a new 240 V circuit installed.<p>For a new home, where you can put in a 240 V circuit for it while you are doing all the rest of the wiring, with very little additional material or labor.
