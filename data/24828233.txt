Different news agencies have different reputations for verifying that authenticity of what they report.  I&#x27;m not going to give a story in the National Enquirer the same credibility as a story published in the New York Times.  It isn&#x27;t an ad hominem attack to voice that opinion.<p>Although I do notice that you did not address the merit of my post.  There is a little irony there.')
