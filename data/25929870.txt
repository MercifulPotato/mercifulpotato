I don&#x27;t know of any other language or interpreter that go this far for security by default, so Perl might be the most secure language in this regard. However, <i>suidperl</i> was dropped in 5.12.<p>My main point was that you could rewrite <i>sudo</i> in all sorts of languages, but saying <i>&quot;just rewrite it in Perl&quot;</i> (assuming it worked) isn&#x27;t a enough justification to make it happen. Nobody is going to re-create their own project in Perl, Rust, etc just to eliminate buffer overflows. If somebody wants <i>sudo</i> in Rust, they&#x27;ll have to do it themselves, and it still might never replace the original.')
