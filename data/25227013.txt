They&#x27;re not just about protecting the consumer but a kind of protectionism. So ever since the protection was extended to the word Parmesan (for a while only  Parmigiano-Reggiano was protected) supermarkets here in the UK have all kinds of weirdly generically-named cheeses that are basically cheaper imitations of Parmesan, but they can&#x27;t describe them as such. There is no longer any generic name for this style of cheese in the English language they&#x27;re allowed to use.')
