Yes maybe they were very narrow edge cases and maybe the photos were doctored, but there&#x27;s easy enough to find &quot;evidence&quot;. But we don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s actually evidence or not, because it hasn&#x27;t been heard in a court (they&#x27;d have to commit perjury to try to submit fraudulent evidence).')
