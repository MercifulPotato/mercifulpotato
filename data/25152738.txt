I also run a self-hosted mattermost.  Do you use the EE or CE?<p>Because you seem to care about this kind of stuff, note that at least the CE (and presumably also the EE) versions of Mattermost have phone-home to segment.io embedded in the server, which can be disabled with the undocumented and exceedingly misleadingly-named &#x27;MM_LOGSETTINGS_ENABLEDIAGNOSTICS=false&#x27; var in the env.  It&#x27;s part of the growing trend of free software spyware being developed by small groups of isolated people in for-profit enterprises.<p>The other phone home it does is to check for a version&#x27;s security alerts, which you may want, but is still assume-consent-and-dont-bother-to-ask phone-home and can be disabled with the similarly undocumented &#x27;MM_SERVICESETTINGS_ENABLESECURITYFIXALERT=false&#x27;.<p>I made a Dockerfile that actually patches out the spying in the binary using sed, rather than figure out how to rebuild it without it or trust that the env vars work.
