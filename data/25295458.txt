Sure, the Regals and the AMCs might suffer, but the living room theaters? I suspect those will continue to do just fine.<p>My wife and I saw two or three movies a month in a theater (pre-Covid, obviously). I think I&#x27;ve seen one movie without a waiter in the last decade.<p>Movie-going as a mall pastime, as an activity to kill time, will probably die. Movie-going at discount theaters available to the working class will probably die.<p>But theaters will remain. There&#x27;ll be fewer, and they&#x27;ll be more expensive, but they will continue to exist.')
