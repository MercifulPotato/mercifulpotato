Item(by='dspillett', descendants=None, kids=[24720163], score=None, time=1602146142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24717081, text='<i>&gt; Why would users expect that?</i><p>People are impatient and expect everything on three computer to be as fast as the faster things on it. Anything slow can feel like there is something wrong.<p>They don&#x27;t expect things to be instant, but your page turning example is relevant: if losing a new page take the time of a physical page turn or two then it is probably fine and feels smooth. More than a few hundred ms and things feel more &quot;janky&quot;. This is something some people cite as why they don&#x27;t like e-ink devices.<p><i>&gt; some SPAs are much harder to navigate because they are over engineered</i><p>This is definitely true, but also holds for many non SPA sites too.<p><i>&gt; &gt; blank screens</i><p>This part of the parent post is significant IMO. If the previous page vanishes I find I&#x27;m less patient waiting for the new information. This is worse if there has been a delay before that happens too.<p>Though likewise if nothing changes I might think something is amiss: did my click even register? Some extra indication of action (the click target changing colour is sufficient) helps here, when the background request doesn&#x27;t show in the browsers built-in activity indicators.')
