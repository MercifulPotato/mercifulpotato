In that sense we are all hypocrites—but the <i>word</i> &#x27;hypocrite&#x27; is primarily used to condemn such contradictions in others. You&#x27;re right that I shouldn&#x27;t have said &quot;only ever&quot;—other usages exist—but they&#x27;re secondary.<p>Another way of making this point about self-contradiction is to say that anger at others for being hypocritical is itself hypocritical.')
