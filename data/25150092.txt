Item(by='ivan_ah', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605797626, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25148445, text='There is another project called JUMP math which has shown some great results, and is now getting adopted widely in Canada. Essentially the approach is to present concepts as bite-sized chunks (more scaffolded) and make students gradually work their way up to tougher problems.<p>If you think about it, it makes sense: if the problem in math is people get stuck at some foundational step where they are required to &quot;get&quot; something, and start to think they &quot;suck at math&quot; because they are missing this piece, then making the steps VERY small will make sure everyone can make those steps, thus making everyone &quot;good at math.&quot;<p>Similar to Singapore math, it&#x27;s not based on a &quot;textbook&quot; that you read but an &quot;exercise book&quot; that you write and solve exercises in. I don&#x27;t have personal experience with teaching using this approach, but I have heard many good things.<p>books: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;s?k=jump+math" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;s?k=jump+math</a> (non free)\nsamples: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jumpmath.org&#x2F;jump&#x2F;en&#x2F;learn" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jumpmath.org&#x2F;jump&#x2F;en&#x2F;learn</a>\npodcast: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;listen&#x2F;live-radio&#x2F;1-63-the-current&#x2F;clip&#x2F;15756534-john-mighton-on-math" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;listen&#x2F;live-radio&#x2F;1-63-the-current&#x2F;clip&#x2F;1...</a>')
