So far, most shops have given me quotes in the hundreds of dollars so I&#x27;ve been waiting until I meet someone that has the capability to just do it in their garage.<p>Most new cast iron cookware now has a raw surface with lots of pits and bumps from the casting process as well, which doesn&#x27;t seem to get nearly as smooth and non-stick as &quot;vintage&quot; cookware.')
