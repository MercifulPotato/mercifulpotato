I suspect it is a common practice.<p>this just provides GD to turn into a Yelp of sorts that can do the &#x27;reputation management&#x27; on the side.<p>Sigh, I have come to believe that its impossible for the profit motive companies to stay neutral in long term, esp if thats their main revenue source.<p>I wonder if there is a publicly funded entity that is also responsible for public good that can &amp; should run something like this. but then if widely adopted that has a high probability of turning into china&#x2F;black-mirror style reputation system.')
