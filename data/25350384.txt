Note that (1) most of the stacks are close to two decades old, which means that many versions of their code exist, and many devices using the stacks are probably end-of-life; and (2) we only provide examples of notable OSes using the stacks, so the list is far from being exhaustive.</i><p>... which in my book is a life-cycle problem. none of these devices were meant to be maintained once online. upstream FOSS devs were likely not asked even if they could provide commercial support.<p>so it reads like a blame for some very deep fundamental issues (of not being able to upgrade - never mind the lack of the technical process there isn&#x27;t even a business reason) that is blamed on old vulnerabilities.')
