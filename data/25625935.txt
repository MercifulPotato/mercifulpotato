Eating together is \nan ancient tradition. Breaking bread.<p>It is a common misconception that it takes a lot of time.\nIf you are not used to cooking yourself then it will take time\nto learn how (not just how to microwave),and then learn how to \nadapt it for your own taste buds. Then you get used to it and \na lot of dishes can be made fresh in less than 10 mins.<p>It also involves going to the store. \nIf going into a sad US supermarket with plastic wrapped everything,\nIt is easy to understand the reluctance to spend time on it.<p>Yet a proper market with the flavors, the colors and variety\nit is a different experience.<p>I often feel happy once I have found a right cut of fish, I cant\nwait to get home, prepare it and eat it.<p>I am sad that in some countries and in some circles it \nis seen as a &quot;must do&#x2F;boring&quot;, instead of &quot;This is going to be delicious&quot;.<p>For some scarfing down a Granola bar and a protein milkshake \nis what eating has been reduced to.<p>Granted that would save a lot of time and people are different.<p>Everyone should spend time satisfying the foundation of Maslow pyramid.\nthat a lot of users of this site can take somewhat for granted \n(Not everyone :( )<p>Having been in the army for a while and at war  (\nAs a means of getting out of a bad background)\nI was made aware of how important all the parts of the foundation is.<p>I swore to myself that I would always remember to be grateful when I enter a \nplace that is dry and comfortable, when I have an actual bed to rest on, \nwhen I have dry clothing and boots in the morning, and how miraculous it is \nto have a say in, and the ability to not eat what minimally sustains you.\nA toilet that flushes and is private and a the ability for a shower.<p>We should all be conscious of the privileged it is to have these things available to us\nand take joy in it.  It might not last.<p>Still even with old rations for 90 days straight the communal experience of sharing\na meal was present.<p>Also sex. It is not mentioned in the schedule. \nThat may be for puritanical reasons. That is no business of yours buddy, and \nthat is fine, but spend a bit evaluating what is included and what is not.\nMost of this logged time in self actualization. Is it also a reflection of what\nthe author is proud of &#x2F; wants to share.<p>Eating and sex both can be wondrous or a ration pack that should have been thrown\naway 12 years ago. Both low on the pyramid.')
