Immutability and value semantic is enforcd by the language and the typesystem is rich enough to allow to use generic data sructures while been statically typed. As a functional language Elm has closures allowing to violate separation of data and code and get non-literal data types, but this is strongly discouraged by documentation, runtime (aka Elm architecture) and tools.')
