The world used to be less connected and as a result, had lots of inefficient redundancy. If you wanted to see a play before, your options are pretty limited. Now, you can watch the best cast in the world from 10 years ago. It&#x27;s only bad to be an artist now because art has become competitive.<p>This is awful for the artists, but awesome for everyone who enjoys art. This is truly the peak of art. Think about what you could experience before and what you can experience now. And not only think of yourself, but all of the people in the world who now have access. It&#x27;s mind-blowing.<p>Like all industries, competition sucks for the entrenched. Artists can&#x27;t just write a book anymore or can&#x27;t just paint something beautiful. The landscape has completely changed. The choice has never been greater and artists must adapt by finding their niches.')
