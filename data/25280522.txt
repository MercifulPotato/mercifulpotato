Open <i>services</i> were never a thing, and what we&#x27;re observing is that the SAAS model is eating the entire marketplace because tying services together to solve tasks is far easier (and depending on scale, more maintainable) than tying software together to solve tasks on hardware you own and operate exclusively. Owning and operating the hardware in addition to owning and operating the software that does the thing you want to do doesn&#x27;t scale as flexibly as letting someone else maintain the hardware and provide service-level guarantees, for a wide variety of applications. But the software driving those services is generally closed-source.<p>If by &quot;open source&quot; you mean &quot;Free (as in freedom) software,&quot; the ship has kind of sailed. The GNU-style four essential freedoms break down philosophically in the case of SAAS, because the underlying assumption is &quot;It&#x27;s my hardware and I should have the right to control it&quot; and that assumption breaks down when it&#x27;s not my hardware. There may be an analogous assumption for &quot;It&#x27;s my data and...&quot; but nobody&#x27;s crystallized what that looks like in the way GNU crystallized the Four Freedoms.')
