Consider the following (contrived) program:<p><pre><code>  char* q[1] = {0};\n  int iq = (uintptr_t)q;\n  int ip = 0;\n  while (iq&gt;0) {\n    iq--;\n    ip++;\n  }\n  char* p = (char*) ip;\n</code></pre>\nYou can make this more efficient (albeit no less contrived) by iterating through iq bit-wise.<p>Less contrived would be sending a pointer through some IPC mechanism (allowing it to be used as an opaque handle externally, while the program will blindly dereference it when it is passed back in); or even passing it within a program across compilation units.<p>If you treat provenance like a taint, you need to track every way it could be propagated, and that does not seem solvable.')
