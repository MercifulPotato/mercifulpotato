But I think it applies here too. GraphQL and REST are tools&#x2F;patterns that have pros and cons. All tools have pros and cons. Why would you get mad at a hammer for not being good drill? Because that is what people do in our industry and it&#x27;s silly.<p>I tried two years ago to write an article with this in mind, and the conclusion I came to in How and When to use GraphQL [0] is that it is an abstraction. Nothing more, nothing less. It&#x27;s up to the individual to determine whether that abstraction makes sense to them.<p>Haters are always gonna hate, and I do appreciate your taking the time comparing and contrasting the two. Too often articles that say &quot;Hey wait a minute here, we might be drinking the koolaid for x&quot; come across as contrarian and spiteful. I think you managed to keep a respectful tone while asking important questions. Thank you :)<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@JeffLombardJr&#x2F;when-and-why-to-use-graphql-24f6bce4839d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@JeffLombardJr&#x2F;when-and-why-to-use-graphq...</a>')
