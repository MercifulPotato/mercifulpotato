It&#x27;s usually non-technical users that set up Excel,</i><p>I disagree that lack of db knowledge is the primary reason.  I&#x27;m a programmer and I usually use MS Excel because it&#x27;s <i>easier</i> than relational databases.  I prefer Excel even though my skillset includes:<p>+ Oracle DBA certification and working as a real db administrator for 2 years<p>+ MySQL and MS SQL Server programming with raw &quot;INSERT&#x2F;UPDATE&#x2F;DELETE&quot; or with ORMs<p>+ SQLite and programming with its API in C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;C#<p>+ MS Access databases and writing VB for enterprises<p>The problem is none of the above databases (except for MSAccess) come with a GUI <i>datagridview</i> for easy inputting data, sorting columns, coloring cells, printing reports, etc.<p>Yes, there are some GUI tools such as SQLyog, Jetbrains DataGrip, Navicat, etc... but none of those have the flexibility and power of Excel.<p>Yes, a GUI frontend to interact with backend databases can be built and to that point, I also have in my skillset:  Qt with C++ and Windows Forms with C#.<p>But my GUI programming skills also don&#x27;t matter because for most data analysis tasks, I just use Excel if it&#x27;s less than a million rows.  Databases have a higher level of <i>friction</i> and all of my advanced skills don&#x27;t really change that.  Starting MS Excel with a blank worksheet and start typing immediately into cell A1 is always faster than spinning up a db instance and entering <i>SQL &quot;CREATE TABLE xyz (...);&quot;</i> commands.<p>Of course, if it&#x27;s a mission-critical enterprise program, I&#x27;ll recommend and code a &quot;real&quot; app with a relational database.  However, the threshold for that has to be really high.  This is why no corporate IT department can develop &quot;real database apps&quot; as fast as Excel users can create adhoc spreadsheets.
