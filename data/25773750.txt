Bug reports absolutely do take effort to file, especially good ones. Automatically closing bugs for <i>inactivity</i> shows that you don&#x27;t value that effort. Personally, that would mean every future bug report to your project would receive minimal effort. If you don&#x27;t like bug reports then you should not have a bug tracker at all. If you do have a bug tracker, try seeing it as a mutually beneficial exchange that is not free for either side.')
