Lot of people just get a regular job at these companies just like they would at a large company. There is no expectation of any additional payout because they are employees who get decent salary, benefits and are happy to go home with a work life balance. If you want founder benefits, you have to be willing to work like a founder and most people don&#x27;t want to do that contrary to what HN crowd may think or believe.')
