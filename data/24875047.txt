Chernobyl has been a hazard now for 4x longer than the reactor was in service.<p>That&#x27;s the thing I would like to see from the pro-nuclear side - not more assurances that modern reactors are safe,  but a demonstration that if something does go wrong, we could actually clean it up and it won&#x27;t become another permanent blight on the landscape.<p>Fully clean up Chernobyl (or Hanford, Washington, which wasn&#x27;t an &quot;incident&quot; but is still a radioactive mess) and I&#x27;ll support more nuclear reactors 100%.<p>But I want a better remediation plan than &quot;bulldoze all the radioactive stuff into a pile, pour a bunch of concrete on top and wait for a few centuries&quot;.')
