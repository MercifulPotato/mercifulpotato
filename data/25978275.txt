That&#x27;s circular. You&#x27;re arguing that the way things are done is an argument for things to continue to be done like that.<p>Actually no, what you are describing is ideally having no scaling at all in the compositor on any particular monitor. (Unless of course a window is stretched between them) I&#x27;m not arguing for things to be done any way, I&#x27;m saying don&#x27;t misuse a feature that was designed to do something else than what you&#x27;re asking for.<p>For a vector UI that is supposed to be pixel-aligned, you can&#x27;t render that at a non-integer scale without the same blurriness that you would get with doing the scaling in the compositor. That&#x27;s different from rendering print content that has no relation to pixels.')
