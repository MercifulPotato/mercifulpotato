I founded a contactless personalized food production and automation robotics venture in 2016. We tore through specialist and generalist employees alike trying to make progress toward a final prototype. We&#x27;re now essentially there, but lost the team over COVID, while the investment environment for our technology is currently extremely hot. In taking stock of the situation to move forward, I&#x27;ve realised it&#x27;s actually a blessing: the skills needed to reach mass-production on a very complex assembly are very different to the skills needed to iterate early and mid-stage prototypes rapidly and effectively. It would have literally been harder - and more expensive - to drag people &#x27;over the line&#x27; in to production than to just hire a new team.')
