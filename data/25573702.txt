Bitcoin is a ~decade old open source project with a clearly established philosophical divide between small-blockers and big-blockers. In other open source project variants, small name changes like adding&#x2F;changing a suffix or prefix are common, why would Bitcoin be the exception?<p>Given that you accepted that BCH is the continuation of big-blocker&#x27;s vision of the Bitcoin experiment, your comparison of it to gold-plated tungsten is flawed. BCH has a legitimate reason to exist. Your comparison might be more apt if BCH weren&#x27;t born out of the block-size debate, but that&#x27;s simply not the reality.<p>Ultimately, the market has spoken on this issue. The Bitcoin Cash name has been accepted as valid. It&#x27;s not a trademark violation and it&#x27;s not fraud akin to gold-plated tungsten. It&#x27;s a legitimate continuation of big-blocker&#x27;s vision of the Bitcoin experiment.<p>The term &quot;bcash&quot; on the other hand is quite clearly a pejorative and a transparent attempt to manipulation language. I&#x27;d expect better on a forum like this, but of course there will be some low-brow argumentation style anywhere you go. I&#x27;m frankly surprised you&#x27;re still defending its use at this point.')
