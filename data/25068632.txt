I primarily use 2 clients: Clementine&#x2F;Linux and play:Sub&#x2F;iOS. I also tested a audiobook-only-installation against BookSonic&#x2F;Android.<p>Notes:<p>- Gonic doesn&#x27;t support many routes. The *sonic protocol supports special routes for Podcasts&#x2F;Audiobooks&#x2F;Radio Stations for eg. [0] details missing routes<p>- It heavily uses `folder.jpg` as the album art. Doesn&#x27;t work well always. I used sacad[1], but it wasn&#x27;t perfect.<p>- Not all players will work perfectly with Gonic. I use play:Sub and it had some issues with album names being blank because Gonic used `name` field in album info while keeping title blank (I think). This is now fixed mostly, but I still have a few blank albums that I need to investigate<p>- I liked the transcoding options on the server side. You can set it per-client and that client will forever get MP3 for eg.<p>- It doesn&#x27;t do artist art. Not sure why<p>I haven&#x27;t faced any breaking-issues other than the blank album names so far (and that was fixed).<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sentriz&#x2F;gonic&#x2F;issues&#x2F;7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sentriz&#x2F;gonic&#x2F;issues&#x2F;7</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;sacad&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;sacad&#x2F;</a>')
