They have documents ready for your notary. At your local notary you change the company name, address, shareholders, it 1-2 signatures. Then you transfer ownership of the bank account (new bank cards, new mobile app credentials) and you&#x27;re ready for business and can sign contracts in the name of the new company. Takes 3-5 days.<p>Next you find an accountant. But payroll setup, health insurance setup, accident insurance (required in Germany but very cheap), local tax, VAT tax setup can wait. You&#x27;re not really allowed to use the 25k to pay your own salary anyway, only business expenses. Expect ongoing 500-1000 Euro&#x2F;month for a GmbH accountant.')
