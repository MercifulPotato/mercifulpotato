Mostly in small towns in Texas, but a couple in a big city. It was fun and good for awhile. It got lonely and hard after year 5. I didn&#x27;t do a good job of getting enough rest and time away from work, and got burned out. It took 3 months of part time to get back to normal.<p>Your team has a big impact on your well-being. If they encourage healthy work&#x2F;life balance and you have a healthy routine, you&#x27;ll be better off than if they encourage longer hours and more, more, more.<p>Very thankful with where I am now, though. I&#x27;ve spent this afternoon working on a patio at a little cafe in the downtown area of a small town. That&#x27;s pretty amazing.')
