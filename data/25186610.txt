If the circuit\nis represented as a graph, then a tool like this could find clusters of\nlocally connected components that could be replaced by something\nsimpler. The brute force approach would depend on solving subgraph\nisomorphism, which is NP-hard, but the authors claim to have found an\neasier way. I&#x27;ve only skimmed the paper so I&#x27;m in no position to\njudge.')
