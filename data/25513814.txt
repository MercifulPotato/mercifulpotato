They don&#x27;t want volatility.<p>Ideally, AirBnB sells to the bank&#x2F;underwriters, the big funds buy from the underwriting bank and then hold. All of this will have been established&#x2F;prepared for during the roadshow. AirBnB is huge, Fidelity wants a cut, so they&#x27;ll take an allocation X shares for $Y on &#x27;the day&#x27;.<p>Nice, clean, straightforward, not a lot of volatility.<p>Going an &#x27;IPO&#x27; is like &#x27;being born&#x27; - it&#x27;s a sensitive time and a lot of money is changing hands you want it to go &#x27;as planned&#x27; and &#x27;smoothly&#x27;.<p>So there&#x27;s likely a smaller number of shares really floating out there on day 1, which may enhance the pressure from the demand curve.')
