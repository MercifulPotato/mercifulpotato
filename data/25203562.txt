If you can&#x27;t transfer large amounts of data, what good does the speed do?<p>It saves a lot of time. Having a new update&#x2F;game or sharing large files in minutes instead of hours matters. Why not just start download earlier? Foresight on a long timescale takes a lot of brainpower and is pretty stressful because cost of miss is high. I will start this download and go get water is a whole lot better than I will queue this update and and it will be done in the morning.')
