I&#x27;ve worked in React, at enterprise levels, for close to 3 years now. Except for the addition of hooks, there hasn&#x27;t been a whole lot of churn. React today is still the react of yesteryear, but with extras.<p>I have been using it since you could only track state in class components, and I personally think it looks drastically different with the evolution of hooks. I interpret components differently than before. The patterns for doing most things has changed, such as the inherent deprecation of the higher order component and render props pattern. I&#x27;m not implying that it&#x27;s bad there have been changes (some are absolutely warranted), but rather explaining how I do believe the library looks different than it did before hooks.')
