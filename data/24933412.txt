I am eating something &quot;healthy.&quot;<p>Maybe we&#x27;re going too far into a discussion on epistemology here, but I don&#x27;t think it is FUD to call out that we cannot clearly say the same thing about Soylent that we say about a serving of cruciferous vegetables. One is healthy and the other is unknown and ambiguous.<p>However, if we still want to call this FUD, I&#x27;d argue that maybe FUD is necessary when thinking about what we put into our bodies. I&#x27;d also practice FUD when thinking through whether I should approach a mountain lion, and I&#x27;d encourage everyone else to do the same.')
