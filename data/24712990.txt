I have already seen many bot-like real users on reddit and HN. They are frequent so I will end up false labelling and calling someone bot isn&#x27;t very nice.<p>I guess, social media will soon start requiring identification and any other place will be full of bots talking to each other. Maybe we will transition to video-based social media.')
