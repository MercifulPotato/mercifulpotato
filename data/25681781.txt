When I was able to help other people with my knowledge and with the experience that I had, the title became basically a part of who I am.  I think the best way to say it is that when you look at the way that people work when you have someone who is going above and beyond to help others you might consider them a lead engineer but that kind of implies other things such as some management duties  means a lot more meetings, but to me the senior role is more about helping people make progress with their projects using\n your technical expertise you have learned on the job.  For me it came after 4 years of consecutive employment after school; when I was able to contribute to projects at a high level, complete my work on time and then have extra time to help others.')
