There are those who write with frequency but stop at &quot;good enough&quot;, the satificers who are usually quite good at keeping their word count within genre bounds, understand market trends, and if they&#x27;re working full time can put out two or three books per year.<p>Then there are the ones who spend years studying rhetoric and linguistics, have worlds and characters they&#x27;ve been building for years, and want to write &quot;Big&quot; novels that often hit 200,000 words or more and can&#x27;t really be compressed. They&#x27;re as hard working as the prolific crowd, but from the outside it looks like they&#x27;re dilly-dallying. When they finally publish, they&#x27;re putting forward the best 200K words out of 2M... which makes a distinction that a few people care about although, to be honest, most readers don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not an economical way to write. You do it because you&#x27;re chasing some kind of deified Relevance that you&#x27;ll never fully know if you&#x27;ve achieved because the real test is whether you&#x27;re remembered 100 years after you die.<p>I&#x27;m immensely curious to see if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named gets his book out, just to watch the YCs squirm. Rumor through mutual acquaintances is late 2021, but having never met this person, what do I know.')
