I&#x27;m all for having deep discussions about Bitcoin and the environment and the undeniable fact that Bitcoin mining wastes energy, but not with a person that refuses to understand how value works.<p>Things have value if and only if there are people that believe it has value. There is no other principle. No &quot;inherent&quot; value, no guarantees, nothing.\nEverything is exactly as valuable as the majority of people perceive it to be. Dollars, gold, food, Justin Bieber, freedom, Bitcoin.<p>You may not agree, but then it&#x27;s still happening, only without you.<p>If you don&#x27;t sell Bitcoin, you&#x27;re not the supply and you don&#x27;t have a say.\nIf you don&#x27;t buy Bitcoin, you&#x27;re not the demand and you don&#x27;t have a say.')
