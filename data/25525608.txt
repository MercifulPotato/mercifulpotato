I work on building highly concurrent systems every day but async drives me insane. to me the fundamental issue is that although the code now reads linearly, it no longer executes linearly (or reasonably close to linearly), which is 1000x more confusing.<p>the other thing, when I&#x27;m using rust to build something high performance, part of the reason is it provides greater control. I just can&#x27;t square that with macro-decorating my main function, and handing over the core control-flow to someone else&#x27;s runtime.')
