And once again, there&#x27;s no <i>there</i>, there. Seems to be another important omission in your follow-up <i>yeah, but</i>.<p>I&#x27;ve no interest in this side vs. that side. For sure, there are no saints to be found. But the original point is that the New York Times played a key role in the spread of misinformation that we know, and was fairly obvious from the beginning, was actually political disinformation. And it&#x27;s clear those media outlets weren&#x27;t simply patsies - they were willful propagandists.<p>Many good people were misled because they trusted the Times and other outlets they considered reputable. The Times abused that trust. And now the Times is assuming that, thanks to some form of Gell-Mann Amnesia, people will believe tomorrow&#x27;s paper is honest reporting even though yesterday&#x27;s paper was a pile of lies.')
