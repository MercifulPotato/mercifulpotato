Honestly, they should be more scared about your article uncovering their bad business practices -- they&#x27;ll lose more from that than the $88 you settled for.<p>However, despite the title including the word &quot;debt&quot;, this is not a &quot;debt&quot; you were collected because the exact amount was not discussed. Instead, $88 just seemed like a mutually agreeable number. But it could have been a lot higher or a lot lower.<p>Basically, you just agreed to settle and not continue to press your valid claims of potential affiliate fraud.')
