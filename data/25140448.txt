The formulas are derived from the study of relatively simple ODEs, in this example f&#x27;(x) = x.f(x) + 1 and g&#x27;(x) = x.g(x) âˆ’ 1. The latter was solved 100 years prior by Jacobi. While the solutions are non-trivial, they are fairly compact, accessible to a high schooler. The presentation linked from the blog is pretty good at unveiling the magic.<p>This is to say that, with proper guidance, the kid down the street can too become as cool as Ramanujan.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.ucr.edu&#x2F;home&#x2F;baez&#x2F;ramanujan&#x2F;ramanujan_whittier_web.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.ucr.edu&#x2F;home&#x2F;baez&#x2F;ramanujan&#x2F;ramanujan_whittier_...</a>')
