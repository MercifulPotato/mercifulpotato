You&#x27;re complaining about a function name (created decades ago) in a system level language as an example of &#x27;needless complexity&#x27;. That&#x27;s not complexity - that&#x27;s just a quirky name kept around for backwards compatibility. By the way if you don&#x27;t like &#x27;creat&#x27; or find it difficult to use then don&#x27;t use &#x27;creat&#x27; use &#x27;open&#x27; with the relevant flags. Any complexity around C programming does not come from this ... Honestly.<p>I have yet to see someone actually point out a good example of needless complexity in programming - something that the blog author is complaining about that apparently you agree with but cannot come up with a single reasonable example.')
