When prefetch is used instead of push, the decision on when and what to fetch is on the client, so if the server <i>could</i> generate them as a group, a proxy like Vulcain would have to buffer the results somehow until the browser asks for them, which is not ideal. I might be wrong, but I don&#x27;t think their server ever intended to fix the Query+1 issue.<p>If Vulcain and Push already worked well for you in the past, maybe it&#x27;s still as effective without Push though!')
