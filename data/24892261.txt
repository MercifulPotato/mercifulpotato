Whenever I clone a repo off GitHub for a quick build and don&#x27;t care about sending patches back, I always use --depth=1 to avoid any history or stale assets. Is there a reason to get more commits if you don&#x27;t care about having a local copy of the history? Do automated build pipelines need more info?')
