Do you think murder was first outlawed 2000 years ago?  I mean &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; is one of the Ten Commandments which is part of the Old Testament which predates Christ by at least several hundred years if not over a thousand.  Even the Code of Hammurabi references charges of murder and it is closer to 4000 years ago.  The idea that murder is bad is probably as old as civilization itself if not older.')
