The 1960s defined poverty for me, because it was when I was born into some awareness of what it could be. Learning in the late 70s that &quot;no access to colour TV&quot; was a signal of relative poverty struck me as bizarre at the time, but having said that, nobody would blink at the proposition &quot;cannot afford a tablet for kid at school&quot; as a relative poverty measure.<p>This, alongside &quot;cannot afford regular meals&quot;, at the same time: so more computing power than man-on-the-moon, in the same breath as not-enough-food. Truly wierd.')
