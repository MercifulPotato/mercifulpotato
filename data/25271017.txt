Yes, I definitely should have talked more about this. I got close to it once or twice, but it&#x27;s an omission to be sure. (I have a friend who&#x27;s big into cycling and is, therefore, impossible to buy cycling gifts for because nothing will cut the mustard.) Basically, I a) wasn&#x27;t able to find much in the way of research that supported what I wanted to say and b) fumbled this point and should have found a way to stick it in there somehow.<p>But then again I had no idea it would hit the top of HN. I&#x27;ll be more careful next time!!')
