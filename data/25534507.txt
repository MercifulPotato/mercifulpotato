Item(by='sinenomine', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608875021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25522502, text='&gt; Well, would you mind giving us all a hint here? I&#x27;m curious.<p>Given IQ like many other human traits can be modeled as GxE, one can optimize the &quot;E&quot; part, which boils down to avoiding ruining the realization of genetic potential of the child (i.e. the influence of the environment is often negative). There is a list of small factors in early life that are associated with IQ and related life outcomes. Mostly these tend to have something to do with pre-natal, natal, and early childhood environments.<p>To give just one innocent example - the month of conception statistically influences many life outcomes, including lifespan (+ 6 months of it if the child is conceived in winter and born in autumn), likelihood of Alzheimer&#x27;s, multiple sclerosis, and 2-4 points of IQ difference.<p>One can argue here about statistical controls, but let&#x27;s avoid this line of thinking.')
