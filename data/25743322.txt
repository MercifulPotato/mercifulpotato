Absolutely agree with his gripes in the first article about the traditional historically-oriented introduction to QM confusing students.<p>The rest of the articles (still reading them) appear to be pretty much the route taken by Feynman&#x27;s _QED_ book (which, of course, is fantastic).  It&#x27;s also very interesting how his 1960&#x27;s Feynman Lectures books seem to tell the student &quot;QM is confusing and weird and hard and scary&quot; roughly every ten pages or so, whereas by the 1980&#x27;s with _QED_ he dropped the fearmongering language.')
