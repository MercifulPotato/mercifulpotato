Most people don&#x27;t realize the overlap, and think &quot;programmer&quot; when they hear CS and &quot;smart person&quot; when they hear math (I have both and this is my experience, ymmv).<p>If you&#x27;re not sure what else you want to do, working as a software engineer for a while is not a bad idea, and may be a very good idea depending on your financial situation - if you want to focus on solving problems instead of working on large software systems, maybe try a smaller company.')
