I like humor too.<p>I bet me liking humor puts me in a sizable minority, if not even silent majority, of HN readers.<p>Another thing I don&#x27;t like, which I&#x27;ve seen many other HN readers express that they also don&#x27;t like, is over-politicization. That leads me to realize there&#x27;s more about that line that I don&#x27;t like besides just being dumb. The joke is lame, and by using the word &quot;whiteness,&quot; it&#x27;s deeply, unnecessarily, politicized.')
