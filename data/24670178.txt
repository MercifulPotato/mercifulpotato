If you want to claim the moral high ground changes need to happen <i>before</i> they become scandals. It is okay to make mistakes. It is okay to fuck up big time. But this just feels disingenuous. The reason people like The Social Dilemma is because it is real people saying &quot;sorry, we fucked up. We take the blame, but let&#x27;s solve the problem.&quot; This response feels like a childish response of &quot;We didn&#x27;t fuck up, you did.&quot;<p>&gt; We don&#x27;t sell your information to anyone.<p>IIRC the movie didn&#x27;t claim this. Most people criticizing FB aren&#x27;t claiming this. FB is selling access to the data.<p>&gt; just like any dating app, Amazon, Uber, and countless other consumer-facing apps<p>I&#x27;m reminded of my mom saying &quot;If all your friends jumped off a cliff would you?&quot; I can&#x27;t be the only one. Just because Netflix is guilty of similar crimes doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re in the right. No one respects this defense.<p>This response is weak and does not feel genuine.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cambridge_Analytica" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cambridge_Analytica</a>')
