What if there is a different bug, and so a dev starts logging requests somewhere down the line? You accidentally start logging cleartext passwords. Oops. Facebook was fined for this not that long ago.<p>But if the password is encrypted, then it’s not really an issue, and the black box blob can be forwarded to a login microservice. There, the team decrypting will be on higher alert.<p>So depending on the structure of various teams, you now have fewer teams that need that kind of security oversight and can move faster.<p>Smaller blast radius of something goes wrong.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;sroussey&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347688753221931010?s=21" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;sroussey&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347688753221931010?s=21</a>')
