I was using Sparkfun, Eagle, and KiCad back in 2013 and before when it was still with Cadsoft:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.sparkfun.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;how-to-install-and-setup-eagle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.sparkfun.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;how-to-install-and-setu...</a><p>Even then, it was pretty limited: 100x80mm board size maximum, only 2 layers, 2 schematic pages, for personal use only, but Kicad was pretty hard to get configured. Altium, Cadence etc. were still the industrial behemoths.<p>But now Eagle is among the behemoths, owned by Autodesk. It requires a subscription and an Internet connection, the subscription is free for one year, and then costs $495&#x2F;year to continue to get access to your files on Autodesk&#x27;s cloud. One hazard I remember from projects at school in 2010 was that the school had an education&#x2F;commercial license from Cadsoft (the original manufacturer) and you were essentially unlimited in the schematics and PCBs you could create. However, if you created a design on your laptop in the freeware version, opened it with a school computer using their paid license, you could no longer open it on your freeware license - that&#x27;s a pretty old bug (or feature, depending on your definition. I trust that when Sparkfun sends back Eagle files, they&#x27;re able to be opened by people with a &quot;Fusion 360 Personal&quot; subscription Eagle license.<p>Kicad is much, much easier to use today, especially after the big development push from CERN. And it&#x27;s open source, so whether Sparkfun would want to extend it with Python scripting, write a plugin, or modify the software itself, something like this could be trivially automated.<p>The choice of Eagle seems to be obsolete by half a decade, when you&#x27;re looking for a open-source-hardware electronics CAD package, especially if you&#x27;d want it to be scriptable and extensible, as I&#x27;m sure Sparkfun ALC is (I can&#x27;t imagine they&#x27;re paying someone in Colorado to route traces for $950).  On the other hand, there&#x27;s a lot of institutional inertia when all of Sparkfun&#x27;s early designs were created in Eagle.  Sparkfun is one of the big drivers of hobbyist Eagle adoption. I wonder if any early discussions of how to implement ALC were guided by an in-house Autodesk rep...')
