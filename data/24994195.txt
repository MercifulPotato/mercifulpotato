Not because of games, but because having modern or many Displayport&#x2F;HDMI connections is nice, and modern hardware video codecs can offload a lot of heavy duty number crunching work from your CPU [1].<p>Any Sandy Bridge to 1st gen Skylake desktop does not have these connections or codecs and could often really benefit from a decent $50-$80 add on GPU. Desktop Sandy Bridge can still make for a very decent computer if you can keep upgrade costs in check. An Intel Xe would also be a decent upgrade if you now already depend on some crappy older Nvidia or AMD GPU.<p>[1]: Besides your basic h264&#x2F;hevc&#x2F;vp9 decoding, it seems Intel Xe has AV1 hardware video decoding, which you can otherwise only get in the very expensive&#x2F;hard to get&#x2F;power hungry AMD and Nvidia discrete GPUs (to be) released this month.')
