Is this just the market being irrational and Musk being a good salesman?<p>Is there any reason to think mainstream automakers can&#x27;t put batteries in their cars? Is there any reason to believe Tesla&#x27;s self-driving aspirations will pay off (over say, GM Cruise, or Waymo)?<p>I&#x27;m sure Tesla is fine and they make a few nice luxury cars, but I feel like I&#x27;m going crazy here: How is Tesla worth $380B, but Porsche is worth only 20B?')
