But I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how I would then give the browser-user access to the wayland socket.<p>In X11 I can just make use of &#x27;xhost si:localuser:browser-user&#x27;. But it seems that I would need to give full access to my main user&#x27;s XDG_RUNTIME_DIR (&#x2F;run&#x2F;user&#x2F;1000&#x2F;), so that it can access the &#x27;wayland-1&#x27; socket from the browser user. Is there a better way to do this?')
