I&#x27;ve found it to be a lot more reliable than SD cards, faster too.  Of course with 1 Gb networking you can move the heavy lifting storage for containers and VMs to something like Ceph and only use the eMMC for OS root disks and local storage.<p>For my Turing Pi, when it&#x27;s delivered, I&#x27;m hoping to start with a small Kubernetes install for testing.  Then when the TPi 2 is released next year, build a second one with CM4 modules for more involved Kubernetes testing&#x2F;development while putting Ceph on the old one.<p>(To head off inevitable comment: no I&#x27;m not expecting this to perform well, and it&#x27;s not for production work, it&#x27;s purely for experimentation with clusters)')
