They try to escape the annoying and slow as molasses dbaâ€™s&#x2F;devops and install&#x2F;create&#x2F;buy&#x2F;saas systems to avoid the red tape. But then the same things as with startups go wrong. And rather often too; we often had these calls asking if we could restore.<p>Obviously there are plenty of large enterprise wide data breaches, which, I would say is actually worse than losing a day of data in a lot of cases. So also not so many satefy measures, again, worse than startups; at least they have an excuse of being understaffed and underfunded.')
