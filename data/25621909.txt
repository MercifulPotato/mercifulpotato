The language&#x27;s simplicity and fast compilation helps with other types of correctness, too (i.e. beyond memory safety).<p>&gt; Although I am sceptical about the claim that in truly safety-critical domains Rust would not be adopted where Zig would<p>I don&#x27;t know if Zig would, but Rust has several problems for such domains that C and Zig don&#x27;t: porting it is a challenge (both Rust itself and LLVM are very complex), understanding what a program does is a challenge (a lot of implicit behaviour), and handling allocation failures is a challenge.')
