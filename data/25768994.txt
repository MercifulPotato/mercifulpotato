What I&#x27;m getting at is that  to say that &quot;even if Apple goes 100% M1, there&#x27;s the other 85% of the market that Intel is likely far more concerned about.&quot; is somewhat far-fetched. Apple can make their own desktop chips because it&#x27;s an easier problem than making a phone chip (performance&#x2F;thermal efficiency), but Intel can&#x27;t make because they&#x27;ve sacrificed thermal efficiency time and time again -- not just this time but a decade ago. Remember Prescott?<p>I think that is why Intel should be (and probably is) worried about Apple. They will make Intel redundant by having solved a harder problem which their own problem becomes a subset of.')
