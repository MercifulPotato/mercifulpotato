When you search for Firefox or Chrome on Bing (the default search engine on Edge), the first result in large font and contrasting background is &quot;Microsoft Recommends You Keep Using This Browser&quot; (referring to Edge). When you visit the Settings to change your default browser to something else, Edge has the line &quot;Recommended for Windows 10&quot; below it in bright letters, and switching it to anything but Edge pops open a confirmation window that reads &quot;Before You Switch: Try Microsoft Edge&quot; with the primary action being to do that, and the actual switch option below it in small gray lettering. OS updates spontaneously reset your default browser back to Edge, and every once in a while the OS will decide to send you a notification helpfully reminding you that Edge just got an update (it didn&#x27;t) and you should check it out.<p>This is unrelated to Edge, but among the most despicable things I&#x27;ve seen Microsoft do was to promote their &quot;Your Phone&quot; app by popping up a notification that reads &quot;You Got A Message&quot;. I didn&#x27;t just get a message, and there&#x27;s no way they could know that because I hadn&#x27;t even installed their crap on my phone! Its like they&#x27;re just pretending its all connected and displaying message notifications on your PC to get people to click it, then go through the setup.<p>Microsoft is a big company, with many divisions that are doing really great work. Their Windows division is so unimaginably the opposite of this, and has been for near a decade, that I&#x27;m beginning to think their push toward services and the cloud is only to hedge against this division, like leadership knows left to their own devices they&#x27;ll crash into the ground and take Microsoft with them and no one can stop it.')
