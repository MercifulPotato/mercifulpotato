But I wasn&#x27;t suggesting it&#x27;s a real law.<p>From Wikipedia:<p>Although the principle is an oversimplification, it can be restated as: &quot;In a property dispute (whether real or personal), in the absence of clear and compelling testimony or documentation to the contrary, the person in actual, custodial possession of the property is presumed to be the rightful owner. The rightful owner shall have their possession returned to them; if taken or used. The shirt or blouse you are currently wearing is presumed to be yours, unless someone can prove that it is not.&quot;[2]<p>Beyond the presumption of being the rightful owner that stems from having possession, is the barrier to legal action that often prevents ligitation in the event of a contract dispute. In such cases, the party in possession will likely maintain it. These barriers could be multiplied in multi-jurisdictional cases involving pseudonymous parties, as is often the case with FOSS projects, and other internet community endeavors.')
