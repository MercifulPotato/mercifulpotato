Item(by='SV_BubbleTime', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611853646, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25943900, text='&gt; There are a LOT of people who can figure out panel gaps.<p>I work in the industry. There are less people to do this than you think. Talk to anyone at GM and there is a good chance they at some point in their career worked for Ford or Chrysler or Toyota or Diamler or Tada or Fiat etc. There is a lot of employee and information exchange that goes one. Tesla is very small and outside of MI&#x2F;IL&#x2F;OH and miss a bit of this. Plus I suspect that Tesla wants their own way of doing things and “the guy that handled fog lights” from Ford Trucks for 15 years only knows TeamCenter and CATIA and that might not fit well at Tesla (I have no idea really, just assuming Tesla doesn’t use the same systems as legacy mfgs).<p>I think the biggest issue most people overlook is that <i>“it’s hard to build cars”</i>. That there is a ridiculous amount of “boring” engineering in boring cars to make sure they wont be service costs until the warranty is up. Tesla came in building an electrical system that had seats and a steering wheel, so they are just getting around to doing those little mundane things like fundamentals of modern vehicle body assembly.')
