The problem isn&#x27;t lit-element, the problem is the native API is not that good, not ergonomic, still incomplete and so far removed from the modern way of building reactive websites, i.e. view = render(state)<p>You need some abstraction on top of the native API, working directly with it is even more painful. The fact I&#x27;m using lit-element is because many WC libraries force shadom DOM upon you, and only some make it optional (Stencil is one of those few, but the TS requirement is a no-go for my use case)')
