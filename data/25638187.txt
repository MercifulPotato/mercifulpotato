Yes, covid is bad and yes it kills people. Did people in Belgium die who otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have? Yes. Can we move on to the real issue?<p>&gt; If you do not get a handle on this, your healthcare system will be overwhelmed eventually, and no sane person wants to see that happen.<p>Ignoring this ridiculous strawman attack (if I disagree, I&#x27;m insane) I&#x27;m very unclear where I suggested we shouldn&#x27;t get a handle on it. Did I suggest that I want out healthcare to be overwhelmed? What is this? You&#x27;re just throwing up charts an screaming about how bad covid is. We already know this.')
