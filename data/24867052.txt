Nobody forces you to learn PHP, you can learn any of the many other open source existing languages. There&#x27;s no gatekeeping preventing you from learning languages other than PHP.<p>I&#x27;m just calling it for what it is: a broken tool. I&#x27;m suggesting we let go of this broken tool and focus on tools that already work great, instead of wasting millions of human work hours on sub-par coding. Sure, you can still make billions with broken tools, but you could also have done that more easily with the right tools.')
