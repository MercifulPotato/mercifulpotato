Want internationalization? Better compile ICU and ship 5+mb worth of code and data with every app, because the web platform is an absolute disaster for anyone who doesn&#x27;t speak English. Want cryptography? Well, you can get it as long as you rewrite all your code to call out to JS and use async APIs for a synchronous operation. Want to decompress GZIP or Brotli? Time to compile those too and ship big blobs because the browser won&#x27;t let you access its compression codecs either.')
