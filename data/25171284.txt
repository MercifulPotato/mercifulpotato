Most people are not vindictive against people who received help.<p>As an example there were people who lost their jobs during this pandemic and I was lucky enough not to. The people who lost their jobs received an extra 600 dollars on top of their normal unemployment. This benefited society as a whole since jobs were very scarce for certain groups and kept a lot of people from having problems. If I ever lose my job and take unemployment I won&#x27;t be upset at those people from receiving an extra benefit during this time period and wish they had been made to suffer instead. I&#x27;m also not angry at the local government for building a library on the other side of the city that I will almost certainly never go to.<p>Bringing it back to these scrimping and saving people, most people save money to reduce their loan burden after college. Its a vanishing small number of people who are not rich or receiving large scholarships that pay for college completely out of pocket')
