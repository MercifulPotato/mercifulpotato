No. Rust has some influence from Haskell in terms of traits and such, but Rust&#x27;s parallelization capabilities comes from its tracking of mutability. (No, Haskell did not invent caring about mutability.)<p>Also, succinct expression of parallel algorithms isn&#x27;t a particularly unique feature. Like half of the named algorithms in the C++ standard library can be parallelized by adding a single parameter.')
