I noticed most of the western philosophers who I thought got closest to the truth - Schopenhauer, Spinoza, Wittgenstein on language, Hume on the self, Parfit - all seemed to have either been influenced by or have a lot of crossover with more eastern thought, which I hadn&#x27;t taken as seriously as it deserved.<p>Normally I can get friends to agree with most of the propositions, even that &#x27;they&#x27; don&#x27;t ultimately exist in the conventional western sense, but I don&#x27;t think they buy into it emotionally, which is probably where it counts.')
