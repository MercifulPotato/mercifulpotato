Item(by='SamBam', descendants=None, kids=[25001088], score=None, time=1604603044, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25000716, text='&gt; Certainly they would not have been able to be sold on any legitimate exchange<p>I&#x27;m ignorant about this. Would they not have been able to be sold because there&#x27;s some kind of master list of coins related to criminal activity, and exchanges blacklist them? Or would buyers somehow know specifically which coins they&#x27;d be buying and their provenance?')
