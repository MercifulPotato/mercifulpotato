Suddenly, the need for employable skills became much more real. Before that, it was a sort of far-off theoretical thing that didn&#x27;t really count.<p>Learning by failure doesn&#x27;t work with a kid who just doesn&#x27;t care. Kids often don&#x27;t see a reason to care because the future seems so distant. Flunking classes doesn&#x27;t seem to change anything, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a reward for passing classes.
