Coupled with some p2p lending that could easily convert millions of people to solar power with little of difference in monthly cost (well quick math says +50% for first 10 years, then -90% till panels decay).<p>Retrofitting roofs with panels seems wildly inefficient compared with using robots to plant thousands of panels few hundred miles away.<p>n.b. you do get slightly dicked by &#x27;maintenance fees&#x27;, but those probably gonna go down with time.')
