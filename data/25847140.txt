And these are low wage, button clicking jobs along the lines of the AWS mechanical turk where without very explicit clear guidelines, you fall flat on your face.<p>For context, reviewers apparently typically spend ~0-3 seconds to determine if a piece of content (mostly pictures) is acceptable. Given the pace of content creation, I&#x27;m amazed they even get that long, I assume algorithms do a lot of the heavy lifting as well.<p>Even if you have extremely smart reviewers, if your guidelines aren&#x27;t clear and you leave it to the reviewer&#x27;s interpretation, you&#x27;d likely get extremely inconsistent results and that feels like a worse product experience than having no moderation at all.<p>So either have the govt decide these guidelines (esp. on political speech) and let them eat humblepie or let the platform do it and don&#x27;t complain when they ban the POTUS.')
