Romaji (Latin characters used to phonetically transcribe Japanese words -- &quot;Satoshi&quot; in this case) are based on the phonetics of the word. If two words have the same pronunciation but different kanji, they&#x27;ll be transcribed the same way in romaji.<p>This is equally true for hiragana and katakana (the other two Japanese writing systems, which are phonetic) and all the names would be written as さとし in hiragana.')
