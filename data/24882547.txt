I think there exists a finite set of properties your problem <i>needs</i> for blockchain to be an effective solution.<p>First of all, you need multiple sources of truth. i.e. Everyone can make transactions with money, therefore everyone is a source of truth.<p>Second, you want to solve your problem in a distributed fashion and you need to figure out the incentives for each node that contributes. i.e. Everyone wants to participate in the economy and is okay with giving a small commission for a transaction.<p>On top of all this, you also want to maintain some invariant. i.e. Transactions do not create money.<p>I have thought of more properties, but they are much more boring. These are enough to throw away pretty much all the hype around blockchain. Every time someone suggests blockchain to solve a problem ask yourself if these properties apply to the problem at hand.<p>Example: Someone suggests logistic company x could use blockchain in order to keep a log of their distribution. But then, you astute reader ask yourself: If a single company essentially holds all the information, there are no multiple sources of truth. How would this instance of blockchain be different from a centralized database? What values does it add?')
