Their accounting of every subsidiary is in a different system and creating consolidations is usually done periodically (and expensively).<p>Allowing an open accounting architecture for multinationals could boost innovation and kill companies like SAP who really is the only player in town that can handle the complexities multinationals face.<p>A company like facebook or google could develop this and open-source it')
