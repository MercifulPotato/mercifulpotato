The practice involved is in response to the absolute garbage of misrepresentation of a restaurant&#x27;s telephone number to be intercepted by your own call centre&#x27;s.<p>Sure, that&#x27;s bad and <i>that</i> should be banned. But that&#x27;s not the practice banned. What got banned is me paying someone to pick up my food for me.<p>I could still run a website that misrepresents the restaurant&#x27;s telephone number and intercepts your calls. I can take your order (at a mark-up) and relay that order to the restaurant. They&#x27;d just make me pick it up.<p>You could ask why would I use that service. Maybe for the convenience of being able to order from any restaurant from a single website. Maybe I wouldn&#x27;t. Maybe they give me rewards points. Maybe there&#x27;s a discount and they just want to harvest my data.<p>But really. it&#x27;s irrelevant why&#x2F;if I&#x27;d use the service. The problem is that the law doesn&#x27;t address the one thing you&#x27;ve pointed out as absolute garbage. It <i>only</i> bans the part that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> terrible.')
