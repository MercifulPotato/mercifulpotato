It was certainly a risk, but not really a bad one going on fundamentals. They just failed to predict the mob mentality of retail investors.<p>Of course, those retail investors who got in on Thursday, Friday, or Monday; that seemed like a bad purchase. So bad that Melvin double-downed on their naked short position. There&#x27;s no way the stock could go up. The fundamentals aren&#x27;t there. But it did. A lot. And those retail investors made a ton of money.<p>So, we&#x27;re at today, where you&#x27;re saying that it would be a bad time to invest because it won&#x27;t end well. You, and to some degree Robinhood, are making a prediction on the stock market. You may be right; you may be wrong; but you&#x27;re <i>definitely</i> not certainly right or certainly wrong. You&#x27;re making the same mistake anyone who tries to pick stocks does; you&#x27;re just doing it in reverse.')
