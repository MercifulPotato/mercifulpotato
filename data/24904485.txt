Item(by='dazhbog', descendants=None, kids=[24904529, 24905253], score=None, time=1603772819, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24898990, text='I live in China as a foreigner, I didn&#x27;t lock my apartment for 3 years. In the first year I didn&#x27;t even have a key since my flatmate lost it. I can literally walk in my neighbor&#x27;s flat if I accidentally exit on the wrong floor. All their doors are wide open 24&#x2F;7.  Sometimes, small kids playing in the corridor open my door (the only reason I might lock the door hehe). Delivery guys leave all the boxes outside the front door. People leave their macbooks and bags unattended in coffee shops.<p>Surveillance surely plays a role in all this, the question is how much. How much is surveillance vs. the upbringing of an individual.')
