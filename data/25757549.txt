Counting this link, the evils up for ranking are:<p>1. Twitter banning Trump&#x27;s account.<p>2. Trump using his account to incite hate.<p>3. Internet service providers being ordered to block social media and messaging apps.<p>If I had to rank them from most -&gt; least evil, I&#x27;d say 3, 2, 1.<p>Possibly others here will have a different ranking. But for gods sake lets argue about the ranking and not about whether censorship is bad or not, since that dead horse has been brought to life and beaten to death again.')
