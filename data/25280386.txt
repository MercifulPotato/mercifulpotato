I mean look at any of the &quot;No Nuance November&quot; content on TikTok<p>It&#x27;s funny, IG was just materialist imagery accompanied by platitudes of self-liberation but TikTok realized people desire to stoke their moral indignation as a means of coping with increasing complexity of the world')
