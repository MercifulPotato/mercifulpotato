It provides a lot of common functionalities that can inspire you for build your library in .net core, or you may find someone else have already done one.\nBTW, this is my first comment ever. I used to programming in C# and .net for 10+ years but for the past 5 years I switch to javascript&#x2F;typescript on Node.js and python.')
