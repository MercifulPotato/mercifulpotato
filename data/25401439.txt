I want my build step (whether gradlew or make) to be runnable in the same way as it runs in scripts.  I get to set (and read!) env vars when they&#x27;re right there in front of me, not hidden away behind dialog boxes.<p>&gt; 1000x faster than opening a shell<p>Don&#x27;t close the shell.<p>&gt; trying to grep all the project files for word phrases which, not being language aware, can&#x27;t tell if one &#x27;foo&#x27; is relevant or irrelevant from another &#x27;foo&#x27;.<p>IntelliJ is the gold standard according to my Java buddies and when I search for a class (by hitting ctrl-N ... go figure) I frequently don&#x27;t get any results.  Some kind of misconfiguration will silently make things not work.  It happens enough that I have to second-guess its results, even when they&#x27;re correct.  Now I only use ctrl-N to jump back and forth between classes I know exist.  Actual searches I&#x27;ll leave to find&#x2F;grep&#x2F;ag.<p>Likewise when I optimistically right-click some part of my project and click &#x27;Run all tests&#x27;... &quot;No tests were found&quot;.')
