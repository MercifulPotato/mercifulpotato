The discovery tools of boost&#x2F;reply aren&#x27;t always perfect, but they are a somewhat naturally formed friend-of-a-friend discovery protocol honed from much Twitter experience.<p>Anyway, yes, the initial bootstrap is always the toughest to get those first few accounts to even have friends-of-friends to explore. Like I said, I used a Twitter bridge that let people link their Mastodon and Twitter accounts and if you signed in with Twitter it would show you everyone you followed who had a Mastodon account connected.<p>Unfortunately, that bridge (which was a part of joinmastodon.org) got shut down a couple years back due to maintenance headaches (Twitter API shifts).<p>Asking friends on existing social media if they use Mastodon is still probably the key bootstrap tool even with fewer direct bridges. There&#x27;ve been some &quot;follow me on Mastodon&quot; threads here on HN, too, and I have seen at least a few Mastodon addresses in HN profiles (and more rarely in Twitter profiles and on blogs and elsewhere). It&#x27;s also a bit of a shame that Keybase&#x27;s Mastodon support only really supports the Big Instances by design since instances have to be added manually by Keybase staff last I checked.')
