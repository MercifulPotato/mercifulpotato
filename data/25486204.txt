Read the Lisp curse article, but exchange Lisp for D and you&#x27;ll have a good idea of the problem.<p>D is very similar to Lisp in many aspects. It&#x27;s a powerful language which allows you to create your own minilanguage within a language. In Lisp, you&#x27;d do it with macros, in D you can use templates. This makes it a secret weapon which appeals to lone wolf programmers, but it makes it harder to interact within a wider community. Similar with the language features. D allows multiple paradigms, as a result, many libraries don&#x27;t interact well together. Some people code in OOP fashion, some people refuse to use the garbage collector, some people even reject the entire runtime (betterC_mode).<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.winestockwebdesign.com&#x2F;Essays&#x2F;Lisp_Curse.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.winestockwebdesign.com&#x2F;Essays&#x2F;Lisp_Curse.html</a>')
