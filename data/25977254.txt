It reminds me of VBA, which can do the same exact things inside excel sheets.\nI remember working at amazon there were a lot of programs where the entire software was hidden behind an excel sheet using this mechanic. It would literally just be a small Visual Basic wrapper that runs compiled code. It was literally because your end user wouldn&#x27;t trust software you write unless it was either a web app or an excel sheet. So if it had to interact with excel sheets, why not shove it inside one?')
