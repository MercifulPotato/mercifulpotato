Despite the ease of obtaining an EMT license in states in the US, it is relatively difficult to hire them [at the wage the market wants to pay, which is near minimum for commercial services]. You&#x27;d likely lose a substation portion of your service&#x27;s staff by making that rule.<p>I think there&#x27;s a substantial difference between wearing PPE and vaccination, both on the employer&#x27;s side as well as the individual employee&#x27;s perspectives. Mandating proper use of PPE can never have unintended side effects. No adult has ever died from improper use of an n95 face mask or nitrile gloves. The jury on the new vaccines is going to be out for a while on long term effects. It&#x27;s not reasonable for an employer to require them yet.<p>Besides, that would spread the legal burden to the employer were something to go wrong.')
