The key thing to realize is that modern Flat Earth isn&#x27;t just about Flat Earth; it&#x27;s basically a (<i>very heavily</i>) syncretized modern Gnosticism. By that I mean that it combines several beliefs:<p>* Absolute dualistic cosmology: there is an Absolute Good and Absolute Evil locked in a titanic struggle in which humans are the pieces. The forces of Absolute Evil are expending every effort to knock us off the narrow path to Absolute Good.<p>* Gnostic notions of revelation: the path to salvation is mostly, if not entirely, dependent on the knowledge of the revealed truth of the universe. Acquiring this knowledge is difficult, and (following the above point) the forces of Absolute Evil are trying their best to prevent you from gaining it. But fortunately, those who have come before us can help us in the acquisition of knowledge.<p>* Evangelism: once you acquire the knowledge, you must (as a good person should!) turn around and save as many people as you can by educating them on the revealed truths of the universe. And if they look at you like you&#x27;re a rambling lunatic or try to &quot;fix&quot; your knowledge, then clearly they must be agents of Absolute Evil trying to drag you down with them.<p>* The actual cosmology: [insert a mishmash of the cosmology [1] of several disparate religions here] and the Earth is actually flat.<p>These kinds of belief systems, with a variety of substitutions for the last bullet point, have been around for millennia. Flat Earth isn&#x27;t even the first such system in my short Millennial lifetime. The actual beliefs of these systems are less important than the fact that you have the revealed knowledge, which is also why people seem to be able to move very quickly from one system to another (as Flat Earthers basically all jumped ship to Qanon).<p>[1] One of the things to draw attention to, from what I can tell, is that these sorts of beliefs tend to extract only the cosmological and supernatural beliefs from religion and ignore the moralist beliefs.')
