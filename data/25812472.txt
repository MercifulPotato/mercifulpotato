Item(by='Nextgrid', descendants=None, kids=[25812657, 25814203], score=None, time=1610903590, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25811696, text='One of the root causes for centralization is that we lost the ability to make our devices talk directly to each other.<p>Before the Internet, people could contact each other directly by just making phone calls, and the phone network was neutral, so any phone or any network could call any other (even internationally) provided they pay the fee. Same with SMS and MMS.<p>With the early Internet, every computer had an IP address and could send packets to any other one.<p>With the late Internet, because of NAT and unwillingness of ISPs to make progress on this issue, we&#x27;ve now lost that ability and now always require some kind of central coordination server for devices to be able to talk (through it).<p>There is no reason why Signal (or any other messenger) <i>requires</i> a central server if it wasn&#x27;t for this. Provided you have the person in your contacts (by having their IP address + a crypto fingerprint for authenticity) they should be able to talk directly.<p>Until we solve this issue, decentralized alternatives (such as Matrix, Mastodon, and others) are just bad workarounds that will never catch on because people aren&#x27;t willing (and shouldn&#x27;t have to) host a server (or use a sometimes unreliable benevolent one or a paid one) when they&#x27;ve already got a smartphone and are paying their phone&#x2F;Internet bill.')
