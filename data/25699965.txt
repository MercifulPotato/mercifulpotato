Both loving A or hating B more than you hate A can result in an A vote.  With millions of voters some people are going to vote based on silly crap like a candidates name being similar to someone they know, or a coin flip.  Hell, you can expect at least a few mistakes.<p>PS: 1,865,620 people voted libertarian, presumably a few felt the way you do but when you know someone isn’t getting elected that opens up even more options.')
