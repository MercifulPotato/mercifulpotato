They should. Why to force a lot of people to do math, when it is could be done in a jiffy on a server side? Isn&#x27;t there a javascript library, which makes such footnotes all by itself? If not then why not to write one?<p>In French newspapers it is probably doesn&#x27;t worth it, because the total majority of readers are familiar with the metric system. But English readers are divided on two camps, one is more familiar with the metric system, other with the imperial one. What on Earth prevent English writers from satisfying both camps?<p><i>&gt; Probably just easier to remember that 3.3 ft. is a meter.</i><p>Yes, I mostly divide by three to convert. But it gives a conversion error in a second digit.<p><i>&gt; Plenty of Americans do it everyday when they read articles that reference the metric system...</i><p>Do they enjoy it? Or may be they would be happy to have all references to the metric system converted?<p>It seems for me (as an onlooker from outside) that it is an ongoing war between imperial and metric systems, and each writer belongs to one of camps, and will do anything to win or at least to make life uncomfortable to an opposing camp. It seems stupid also.')
