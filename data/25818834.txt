Item(by='DanHulton', descendants=None, kids=[25818873], score=None, time=1610951341, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25818743, text='I would love to work for a place like this, but I can&#x27;t imagine a company choosing to pay for this HR service unless forced to by law. They can already get the version of HR that will side with them every time. Why pay money for a version that might rule against you?<p>That said, I can see an eventual path for this. The &quot;problem companies&quot; definitely won&#x27;t be interested, at least at first, and the only companies that would choose this are the ones least likely to need it. Given time and publicity, these companies may have an easier time hiring, until eventually there is sufficient pressure on the &quot;problem companies&quot; that they feel they have to change to this to continue to hire.<p>That might have an okay shot in industries like tech, where you could argue that employees still have a lot of choice in employer. I don&#x27;t see it working in other industries (that could probably use it a lot more), like the legal industry or food production.')
