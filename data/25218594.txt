I guess they could have taken over one domain to show the vulnerability rather than all of them.<p>But, if anything, they did the work to collate a useful set of abandoned domains, and all DO needed to do was say &quot;thanks, we&#x27;ve moved them to a special account we&#x27;ve set up and sinkholed on our own server&quot;.<p>Of course, then DO would be liable for the sinkholing, so maybe they thought it better to lock this guys account (&quot;we did our best to prevent the hacker&quot;) and kick the actual issue into the long grass.')
