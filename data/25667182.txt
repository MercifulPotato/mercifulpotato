(There is a left-wing media reality for sure, but it is microscopic, counterpunch is just not that highly trafficked!)<p>The riots in the capitol today demonstrated this quite clearly when contrasted with the protests that kick off the Trump presidency. The &quot;women&#x27;s&#x27; march&quot; was a fairly clear statement in acknowledgement of Trump&#x27;s presidency but a denial that it was truly representative of popular will. Today&#x27;s demonstration &amp; riot was populated by a mix of people consuming non-facts and fabulists exploiting those people. QAnon followers were prominent and appeared to be at least a plurality if not a majority of the participants. The people filming themselves in Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s office were prominent neo-nazis or YouTube provocateurs (Fuentes and BakedAlasaka).<p>A few thousand people on the capitol overwhelmed a police force that was at least partially sympathetic and was certainly understaffed, in the alternate reality where the opposition to Trump were anti-democratic in the same way they would overwhelm any force arrayed against them in a similar way much more easily through sheer quantity, but they don&#x27;t hold those views or endorse those methods.<p>Roughly 1&#x2F;3rd of voters thing the presidential election was fraudulent, but closer to 1&#x2F;5th think Trump really won according to Morning Consult, some of this is just facing the fact that the US has always been a bit of a low-trust&#x2F;conspiratorial society. Some of what is going on is certainly better reporting on what is really happening - things that have actually always happened. Some of what is happening is just good old fashioned bad leadership!')
