Well, that would be illegal wouldn&#x27;t it? Wouldn&#x27;t you want a whistleblower to feel like they could safely expose it?<p>By and large, it&#x27;s the government that <i>decides</i> what&#x27;s legal and what&#x27;s not. Even the Constitution can be amended with enough support. So exposing illegal government activities means you&#x27;re exposing that a part of the government was doing something that it wasn&#x27;t empowered to do, <i>by the government</i>. There are multiple branches of government for a reason. When the government is doing something illegal, it means <i>an office</i> of the government has either made a serious legal error, or gone rogue and disregarded its legal responsibilities.<p>That&#x27;s a serious problem right?')
