Item(by='jksmith', descendants=None, kids=[25411394], score=None, time=1607887544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25407718, text='I&#x27;m writing a major system using FPC&#x2F;Lazarus right now, and will fund additional dev as soon I can get a reference mvp done.<p>No idea how many people are using this toolchain to produce real work, but I consider it to be my secret weapon. I&#x27;ve never seen a truly multi-platform, batteries-included dev tool that is so coherent and comprehensive. At this point, the only add I would love to see is better macro expansion beyond the simple code macros that are provided now.<p>At any rate, depending on your definition of success, if you want to see an example of a decades old, open source project that really does work, throw the FPC&#x2F;Lazarus project in with Linux itself. I&#x27;ll spend the day today writing code on both a Windows and a Linux machine for the same project, producing the same ui heavy app with hardly any differences, thanks to this toolchain that runs pretty much exactly the same in either environment.<p>Seeing the love and dedication put into this project by contributors is a great way to remember how cool writing software really is. All devs should at least fiddle around with FPC&#x2F;Lazarus just so they know what it is.')
