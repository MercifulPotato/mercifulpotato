Can you cite a source for this claim that the black lives matters protests were propagated in any sort of widespread, organized concerted effort by &quot;ANTIFA&quot;? I hear this claim often from Trump supporters but as far as I can tell, they either heard it on talk radio or Fox News. Considering Fox News&#x27; coverage of Trump prior to the election, I don&#x27;t exactly consider them a reliable source. If you could provide a single source for these claims I think that would help your case tremendously.<p>Otherwise (and I&#x27;m so sorry if this sounds condescending), have you considered reflecting on the trustworthiness of the news you tend to digest? I think we can all agree that it&#x27;s time for the GOP to reflect. Many of them were willing to throw away their principles by repeating Trump&#x27;s lies that the election was unfair or stolen.  Have you not yet arrived at this conclusion finally?')
