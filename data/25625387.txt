Why?</i><p>[Added &quot;some&quot; for clarity.]<p>Let me try to restate the author&#x27;s article because he presents it in a confusing way.<p>The issue is that both Google and Facebook have &quot;core ad tech&quot; that works decently with proven ROI -- and they both have &quot;additional ad tech inventory&quot; (a.k.a the partners&#x2F;affiliates) that&#x27;s <i>much lower quality</i>:<p>Facebook &quot;quality&quot; ad placements on their core platforms with decent ROI:<p>- ads in Facebook Newsfeed<p>- ads in Instagram feed<p>The &quot;questionable&quot; ad placements with much lower (possibly zero) ROI:<p>- ads in Facebook Audience Network<p>(Here&#x27;s an example screenshot in Facebook&#x27;s Ads Manager to visualize the options above:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;website-production&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;ad-placement-options-facebook-1.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;website-production&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;20...</a>)<p>Same concept applies to Google AdWords.  The adwords clicks on &quot;google.com&quot; perform better than the ones coming from partner websites.  The lower quality ad tech in partner networks has more bots, more scam websites, more fraud, more negatives, etc that reduce ROI.<p>Bottom line is... if you&#x27;re buying digital ads, you need to understand <i>exactly</i> what <i>type</i> of clicks you&#x27;re paying for and how it actually performs.')
