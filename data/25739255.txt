I never found any of it to be very good at all, and I grew up with access to both 8-bit (and later, 16-bit and 32-bit) computers and a few electronic typewriters. (contrariwise, I do have fond memories of the IBM Selectric, as does anyone who learned to touch type on one, I&#x27;m sure)<p>But I am utterly interested in what typewriter model you&#x27;d nominate as equal to the DOS + WordStar&#x2F;Word&#x2F;Sprint + PC combo of its era! If it&#x27;s hardware you used and liked for some reason, that&#x27;d be something to hear about... not a lot of people reminisce about that hardware. (because it was horrible... ahem)')
