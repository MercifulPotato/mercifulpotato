I also have normal talk with friends every once in a while. The way I see is that these imaginary conversations drastically reduce my needs to actually talk to people. Also IMO once I have has enough conversations with people I pretty much know what they will talk about next time in general unless they have some personal news to deliver. So in Claude Shannon&#x27;s sense total  information content is very low and I do not even find them funny to continue talking.<p>Now it all may be odd sounding thing but it seems okay for me as I do not look to confirm to any group nor looking for anyone to confirm to my ideas.')
