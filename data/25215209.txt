Jira makes it easy to add a new field, plugin, or workflow step for a particular use case, but it is much more difficult to determine if an existing field&#x2F;plugin&#x2F;workflow step can be safely removed. As a result, everyone is afraid to touch it, projects accumulate cruft over the years, and it degrades the entire workflow.
