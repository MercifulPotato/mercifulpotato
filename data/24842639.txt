They’re made by the Folkhälsomyndigheten (the public health agency) which consists of people (doctors, virologists, statisticians, epidemiologists) that are actually qualified to have an opinion on this kind of stuff. The public health agency isn’t beholden to political will; the government can only affect policy by changing the laws.<p>So yeah, maybe the Swedish strategy is the wrong one, but if that’s the case then how come all these subject experts  agree that this is the strategy most likely to succeed?<p>One more thing: There’s lots of people being quoted in the media that sound like they should be experts when they’re really not. Doctors, virologists and statisticians are not subject experts in isolation.')
