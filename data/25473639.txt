I believe one such thing is how the dark matter can seem to separate from the host galaxy in a collision with another galaxy. Someone can correct me as I might not be remembering that quite right. That&#x27;s tough to explain with just gravity alone.<p>I really like the idea of MOND as requiring an invisible unknown particle to explain galactic rotation always smacked of the old ether theories to me. But my understanding is it&#x27;s nearly impossible for a mond theory to encompass all of the current evidence for dark matter without being totally contrived.')
