At the same time it&#x27;s noteworthy just <i>how much</i> we hear from the people who insist they&#x27;re being censored - most of them have platforms far in excess of most people even after these bans. What they&#x27;re complaining about is being stripped of a level of <i>amplification</i> that previously didn&#x27;t exist.')
