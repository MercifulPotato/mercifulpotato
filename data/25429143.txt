Item(by='Namidairo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608030369, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25427761, text='&gt; The Archer VR1600V software is licensed under the GPL. This can be used to compel TPG to release the source behind their modifications, if anyone wants to use the legal system to chase TPG for information.<p>I doubt many of the modifications done for them fall outside of flicking random config switches on&#x2F;off and making sure the factory config will provision properly.<p>Most of the source drops I see from embedded hardware manufacturers aren&#x27;t usable out of the box for one reason or the other anyway. Open source devs won&#x27;t touch a lot of Broadcom hardware just because the driver situation is an unabated nightmare.<p>Despite this, many&#x2F;most of the TPG (2nd&#x2F;3rd largest Australian ISP) customers will have to keep their VR1600V&#x27;s connected in some form anyway, as they provision the sip credentials to them, and refuse to allow you to use your own voip hardware...')
