Who cares what historians think when they&#x27;re so obviously vulnerable to contemporary politics? When a random group like the NYT can kickstart a politically motivated effort to rewrite history and the only meaningful objectors are the economists it&#x27;s pretty obvious that American historians have lost the integrity needed to engage with their subject in an objective fashion. It&#x27;s beyond laymen to understand which parts of historical study have been politically coopted and so the only solution is to assume all histories are now compromised. From that position, things like upscaling don&#x27;t matter in this context because the integrity of the historical record was already sacrificed.')
