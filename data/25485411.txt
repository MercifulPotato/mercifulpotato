For my eyes DLSS is unacceptably blurry (even in ”Quality” mode). You can look at it - ok, but it&#x27;s only one of the opinions. You can spend 1 minute in google to find quite contrary opinions. Whole your long comment is based on the idea that upscaling is an optimization - you are forgetting that upscaling is a tradeoff.<p>My main complaint about DLSS ”hype” marketing is exactly about this: do not promise ”incredible quality” when under the hood it&#x27;s just a pity upscaling. Some HW is not good enough, some games are not optimized enough  - it&#x27;s fair and it&#x27;s okay, there are things to sacrifice, there are workarounds. Just don&#x27;t lie.')
