You can get the &quot;readable commit history&quot; with:<p><pre><code>    git log --no-merges\n</code></pre>\nYou can have the best of both worlds. git has had these features for as long as I can remember, but devs have had the &quot;NO MERGES ONLY CLEAN HISTORY&quot; platitude repeated so often they must think git lacks an alternative.')
