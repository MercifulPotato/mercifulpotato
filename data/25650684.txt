I don&#x27;t have the numbers in front of me, but I&#x27;m going to guess the trial size is more than adequately powered to detect differences 27 days out.<p>All this is exactly as theory would predict. Seroconversion typically takes about two weeks. Once seroconversion happens, immunity lasts years (if not decades), which is why most booster doses are given years apart [2]. And any talk of &quot;full efficacy&quot; is confusing population statistics with individual outcomes. To say that Moderna is ~85% effective after one dose, as it appears to be, is to say that 85% of the population will produce antibodies after a single dose. There is no &quot;partial immunity&quot;--you&#x27;re immune or you&#x27;re not.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;7cebed90-3267-4651-a249-56f5a9ae7684" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;7cebed90-3267-4651-a249-56f5a9ae7...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;schedules&#x2F;hcp&#x2F;imz&#x2F;child-adolescent.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;schedules&#x2F;hcp&#x2F;imz&#x2F;child-adolesc...</a>')
