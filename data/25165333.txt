It&#x27;s a place where people meet and talk.  Fortunately for 18th century humans, there were many pub owners who exercised varying degrees of control over the activities of their patrons.  Some banned radical politics, and some did not.  In our present era of concentrated control, we have a small handful of pubs controlled by a similarly small number of wealthy oligarchs.<p>Recall that the Green Dragon tavern was the unofficial headquarters of the American revolution.')
