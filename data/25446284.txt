But in retrospect I find it allowable&#x2F;acceptable.<p>The reasoning is Ethereum is an early project, its design is highly centralized like a startup because very few people have the convictions and breadth of knowledge that Vitalik and co. possess. It&#x27;s aspirations are not the same as Bitcoin: Bitcoin wants to provide value by being irrefutable property. Ethereum wants to be the world computer.<p>Ethereum&#x27;s technical complexity makes Bitcoin look like a Ford Model T, while Ethereum is trying to be a space ship with warp speed capability. Obviously it is not the within the spirit of blockchains to conduct a rollback to save people&#x27;s funds from hackers. But at that early stage, it might hurt adoption more than help if people get burned so badly. If we look at the tradeoffs, I think its worth it. If people prefer absolute immutability, they can use Ethereum Classic.')
