It’s just been so much fun building and using it.<p>If you use it, don’t worry about me abandoning it. It’s improved my life so much that I’m going to be constantly improving it and keeping it around. Working in an iOS turbo app for it next, and I’d like to build lending and expirations into it too. It’s going to be awesome.<p>Share your feedback with me if you use it!')
