I personally never understood the point of Redux and have always greatly preferred MobX for exactly what you say - it is far too verbose.<p>I also don&#x27;t really have a good read on how the future of these projects will go - I would have thought MobX would&#x27;ve won out long ago. Maybe now with MobX 6 moving away from decorators it can gain the steam it deserves. I think the key blocker has been &#x2F; is that MobX is building a runtime graph, and people don&#x27;t understand graphs (let alone dependency graphs) very well, so it feels like magic. It&#x27;s really easy to use though.<p>With features like Suspense, I feel like React will continue to push for more concise ways to write your components, but I also wonder if even the one level of misdirection that Suspense shows will be enough to limit its adoption. So far, explicit and non-magic seems to be a strange community preference')
