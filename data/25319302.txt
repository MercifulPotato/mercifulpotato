Francis Schaeffer said that the problem of modern man is basically epistemological.  (Epistemology is what we know, and how we know, and how we know we know.)  You can see this showing up in things like &quot;post truth&quot; politics, the replication crisis in science, and the problem of determining what&#x27;s going on from news reports that are biased in various directions.  In whatever route you take, it might be worthwhile to make sure that you get at least some epistemology in your studying.<p>2.  It sounds like you&#x27;re interested in a rather pragmatic way, rather than academic.  If so, I&#x27;m not sure groveling through the original authors is the optimal way to do what you want.  Explorers take dead ends.  Those dead ends are interesting, in an academic way, but not so interesting to a pragmatist.<p>3.  If you&#x27;re not going to read the original authors (<i>all</i> of them), then you&#x27;re going to be relying on some kind of a guide (or more than one).  Choose carefully, because who you choose will shape your journey, and probably your conclusions.  Maybe more than one guide, from more than one perspective, would be useful.<p>4.  Personally, I really like Francis Schaeffer.  I&#x27;d recommend <i>Escape From Reason</i> and <i>He Is There And He Is Not Silent</i> as very short overviews of much of philosophy.  But you&#x27;re going to have to do some work, because in a short book, he does not answer every objection or fill in every blank.  You are left the exercise of applying his ideas to your questions.<p>Schaeffer is a Christian, and his philosophy is explicitly Christian.  If that turns you off... then it does.')
