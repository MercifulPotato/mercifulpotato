I would like to share something I told someone just yesterday about plant sentience.<p>Two years ago, I was doing very brisk business selling chive blossoms. These are the aerial parts of the chive herb. They are pretty and puffy and pink. They have a strong onion’y taste too. And so make great looking garnishes for a variety of dishes.<p>High end restaurants love chive blossoms. And are willing to pay for it. I was selling wholesale to a distributor who was sending them all over the west coast. Growing chives for flowers is a tad tricky in the field tho. Chives are grown for their long stalky leaf parts.<p>To make them flower consistently  and prodigiously, I had to ‘torture’ them a bit. Because I had to send at least a 100 clamshells a week with 30 blossoms per clamshell, the chive plant has to believe it’s going to die.<p>The plant sends out buds that will flower quickly to make seeds because it senses that it’s prime directive is done and over. So it’s two seasons worth of making it think it’s going to die and then feeding it.<p>That is outright cruel if it were a cow. In fact that’s what we do to dairy animals. We breed them so they can birth their young so we can milk them. Plants are not mammals. But...just because we can only relate to mammals doesn’t mean that the plant lacks sentience.<p>Human beings are just meat sacs that are directed by the impulses generated by the chemical soup we hold inside our skulls. And we are considered to be ‘sentient’.')
