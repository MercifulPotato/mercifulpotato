I don&#x27;t want to be part of a game where words can be arbitrarily redefined by one party to mean exactly what they want it to mean now.<p>It is enough now.<p>And this is coming from someone who wasn&#x27;t allowed to play in the schoolyard as a child, someone who was knocked in the head by an older classmate, got beaten etc while teachers looked the other way. This went on until I learned to fight back and I got a teacher who didn&#x27;t care that I was outgroup and stood up for me.<p>My mind and body knows a bit about this and I&#x27;m confident that what we are seing here isn&#x27;t a solution rather than extremists making things worse.')
