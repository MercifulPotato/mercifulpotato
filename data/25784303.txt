I got hired as a ML engineer to bring a data scientists models into production. I did the same as you by tearing the whole thing apart and engineering it properly. I also look at the models, and oh boy... that data scientist had no idea what he was doing. Couldn&#x27;t explain why he chose the model, didn&#x27;t have any performance metrics (or even knew what metric to use to measure the performance) and just generally did not understand the basic concepts of his fields. I had to try really hard to drag answers out of him, but in the end I came out dissatisfied.')
