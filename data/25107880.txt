NASA has no say on SpaceX&#x27;s engineering practices, the exact specifications beyond specified in the contract, or whether or not a senator&#x27;s favourite supplier is used for certain parts. At the end of the day, SpaceX can choose to spend its profits however it pleases, whether that it on a stainless steel giant rocket or digging tunnels because the CEO is tired of sitting in traffic, without needing approval from any politician.<p>You also would do well to read up on the details of SpaceX&#x27;s financing. Private capital has contributed several billions to its funding - just earlier this year, they raised $1.9 billion. Several projects were entirely privately funded, including Falcon 1 and its engines, Falcon Heavy and until recently, Starship. Government funding is of a similar magnitude of course, but it is disingenuous to say it comprises the entirety of SpaceX&#x27;s finances.<p>As another poster said, just NASA&#x27;s choice of using commercial operators (including Boeing) was hugely controversial, drawing skepticism even from Neil Armstrong and other astronauts. It&#x27;s a massive departure from the previous approach where NASA would design the overall vehicle and subcontract portions of it to different subcontractors; instead, they&#x27;re paying for a complete package that is owned by a private corporation that designed everything on their own down to the spacesuits.')
