This started after reading Alice in Wonderland to my one year old and realizing that a kid who couldn&#x27;t talk yet obviously didn&#x27;t care what I was reading.  At this point my kids are two and five, and my older son is approaching the point where he&#x27;ll be able to follow longer books and I&#x27;ll shift to things he understands, but I&#x27;ve read about 15 novels in their entirety to the kids thus far.')
