While the DRM associations have made outlandish claims at times, I&#x27;m not aware of any serious attempt to say that you don&#x27;t own a copy of a movie when you buy it on Blu-ray or DVD.<p>The DRM coupled with the DMCA&#x27;s anticircumvention provisions combine to make it illegal to do things that would otherwise be fair use, but this isn&#x27;t because of a license.<p>One very important right you get by owning a copy is &quot;first sale,&quot; that the copyright owner can&#x27;t restrict you from transferring or selling the copy, and this is unaffected by the DRM. The store down the street that buys and sells CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays is evidence of that.<p>Even with the limitations of DRM, there&#x27;s a very real difference between the kind of ownership you have with a disc and the lack of it that you have with pure-digital &quot;buying&quot; from most sources. (Though I believe there&#x27;s some movement toward increasing consumers&#x27; rights to these kinds of digital &quot;copies,&quot; in Europe at least.)')
