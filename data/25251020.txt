It was like being lectured on the finer points of computer science by a cast member of &quot;Moonshiners&quot;. That was probably 20 years ago.  Now what strikes me is that this is the only example I can think of.  That is to say, there was this one guy with a strong southern accent, but how many others were overlooked?  Hard to say. That being said, I myself have a slight southern accent, which I was amazed to discover when someone pointed it out.  I was like, &quot;wait, what? I have southern accent? No I don&#x27;t!&quot;.  But, upon listening to recordings of myself..., yeah, I kind of do.  D&#x27;oh.')
