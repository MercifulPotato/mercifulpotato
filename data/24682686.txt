Taleb says the stock market systematically under-prices risk when in reality probabilities have fat tails, or high kurtosis.<p>2. Taleb took advantage of this by buying OTM puts which were being undervalued compared to the real risk. He&#x27;s now &quot;F you&quot; rich, awesome.<p>(correct me if I&#x27;m wrong on these two assumptions)<p>The next question I have is, now that the cat&#x27;s out of the bag, does this strategy still work? Is it possible that the market could over-value tail risk, making it a losing proposition to run this strategy (at least on certain stocks).<p>And if so, how do you know when that deep OTM put option is over or under priced?<p>I recall Taleb spent a lot of time talking about the problems but was light on actual details of how to make this strategy work out in practice (though it&#x27;s been a few years since I&#x27;ve read some of his earlier books).')
