If I had a macbook for my personal laptop, I&#x27;d still prefer touchscreen for all the use cases above. I wouldn&#x27;t think I&#x27;m the only one either, but maybe I&#x27;m wrong.<p>I don&#x27;t see what Apple gains by not at least offering it as an option. That way people who didn&#x27;t want one wouldn&#x27;t have to get it. I&#x27;d pay maybe $150 extra for it. I&#x27;d also bet it would outsell the non-touchscreens ten to one.')
