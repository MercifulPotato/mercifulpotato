He was showing me the generators and how they have 30 days of fuel on site. I asked him why 30 and not 40 (and so on), he said he asked his boss the same question and the reply was if this datacenter doesn&#x27;t have power and can&#x27;t get fuel after 30 days then there are bigger problems in society than accessing websites.')
