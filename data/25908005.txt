Maintain an activity for 21 days, and then you&#x27;ll feel compelled to keep it going! Make a plan for your activity, and then you&#x27;ll stick with it! <i>Visualize!</i><p>A lot of this kind of click-generating blog content takes a single paper and then dramatizes its findings. Bonus points for phrases like &quot;researchers have discovered&quot; and &quot;scientifically proven.&quot;<p>Speaking from experience, motivation, judgment, and decision-making are easy fields to publish in. Experimental psychology labs have a relatively simple time getting and publishing results. Make a slight adjustment to an experimental protocol, recruit 30-60 psych undergraduates (many programs even make participation mandatory or offer extra credit for it), and voila, a paper.<p>As a result, many labs are publishing <i>constantly</i> just to survive. And very few experiments make a goal of following up with their participants weeks or months later. But that kind of stability is exactly what you want in your healthy habits!<p>Personally, I was surprised and disappointed to find that activities that had entered my routine had never actually become a habit. They were just a routine. When the routine changed, the &quot;habit&quot; disappeared. Before last year, my daily schedule included an hour at the gym after work. I maintained a consistent pattern for several years. After gyms closed, I just stopped going and didn&#x27;t feel like anything was amiss.<p>Some time in the past year, I bought some simple home exercise equipment, such as a door-mounted pull-up bar and some adjustable barbells. I stuck to a consistent routine for two months. I have an entire notebook with pages filled with hashmarks in sets of five, counting sets of exercises. And then I also just stopped, for no apparent reason, and felt no urge to continue.')
