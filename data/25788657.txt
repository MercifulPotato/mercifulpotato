Think of it as a workspace or project manager from an IDE, but on the OS-level.<p>Started because of frequent multitasking of heavy work with limited resources.\nMade it because I wanted to switch between studying, working, reading, looking for an apartment, etc. without manually managing all states or consuming all resources.<p>I&#x27;ll release an Open Beta (macOS) as soon as I finish license verification and delta updates, but I keep getting sidetracked...')
