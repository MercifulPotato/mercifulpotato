Consciousness is a result of an electric feedback loop, and aging is apparently a result of a chemical feedback loop but that wasn&#x27;t proven completely yet (that&#x27;s the feedback loop I&#x27;d very much like disrupted).<p>But again, that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m talking about. You&#x27;re missing my point entirely. I&#x27;m talking about connections that aren&#x27;t obvious so no one looks for them in the first place and performs no experiments to reveal them. Example: sleep-deprived fruit flies accumulate active oxygen in their gut[1] and eventually die because of it. Is this an obvious connection to look for? Hell no. And there are many more examples of such unexpected and perplexing connections in the inner workings of living things. Nature doesn&#x27;t always choose the most optimal implementations either. Life is a fascinatingly complex Rube Goldberg machine.<p>1 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hms.harvard.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;sleep-death-gut" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hms.harvard.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;sleep-death-gut</a>')
