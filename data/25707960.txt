Item(by='amluto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610244760, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25689568, text='$9k buys a three zone ductless  multi split heat pump, installed, in a area with very high labor costs.  This heats and cools and can modulate to a reasonable degree.  (This price is for a Fujitsu system — I don’t know the price for other vendors.)<p>Maybe you can install a cheaper FIR system, but that system is actually just electric resistance heat. Sure, maybe you can operate in a regime where the mean radiant temperature where you are is enough higher than the actual air temperature to save some power, but that had better be a pretty big effect to overcome the 3-4x efficiency improvement of a heat pump.  And did I mention that the heat pump can cool, too?')
