There&#x27;s a LOT of games that are trying to get people (who don&#x27;t know any better) to spend money. But there&#x27;s also a lot of real quality games, too. Many of the best games have the option to spend money, but don&#x27;t shove it down your throat.<p>As an example, I played Bee Swarm Simulator with my daughter and I really enjoyed it. I decided to buy some robux and spend it on the game.I did this not because it gave me something I needed to enjoy the game, but because I felt the developer deserved it for creating something that entertained me.')
