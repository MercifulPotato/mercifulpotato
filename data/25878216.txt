What happens if they say &quot;Google Search and Google Play can&#x27;t be the same company in France&quot;?<p>Option one, they separate to keep the market. Probably not, but maybe if the whole EU does it.<p>Option two, Google is banned from France and some competitors take root. Those competitors are not going to limit themselves to the market in France, so now there is more competition everywhere.<p>Either one is a pretty good kick in the pants that would increase the level of competition.')
