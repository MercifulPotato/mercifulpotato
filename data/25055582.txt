If you&#x27;re moving around a lot, you might end up in expat&#x2F;international&#x2F;diverse groups. Most people who move to several countries aren&#x27;t moving to villages 4 hours from a city and speaking and blending in with the locals and really hearing what rural people think.<p>Growing up in a small town and moving between small towns across the US every year or so, I never had exposure to &quot;liberals&quot; until I started using the internet as a teen. Until then, everyone I was ever around talked about them like they were bogeymen.<p>In the country I live in now, I was initially exposed to much more &quot;progressive&quot; opinions from people. Now I&#x27;m seen as less &quot;that foreign guy&quot; and more of a local, and I hear what people would normally discuss with their friends and family. It&#x27;s quite different.')
