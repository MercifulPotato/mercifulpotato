You have to archive stuff yourself or hope somebody did it.<p>- Related to decoupling user networks from platforms, it would be nice to decouple comment sections from platforms and from the articles themselves too. People could comment the same article in different curated comment sections with different moderation policies using their own decoupled online identity.<p>- Create decentralized networked chains of trust (could help revitalize some scientific communities too).<p>Seems like very interesting things going on with projects like gemini, Urbit, IPFS, still on the early stages and only usable by power-users, but hopefully they will keep growing.')
