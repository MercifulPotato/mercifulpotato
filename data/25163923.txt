The situation of mixing up ligatures and their respective unicode chars is also nonsense, as those characters aren&#x27;t typable and will only ever be used in strings, so there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;d not know which it is and it&#x27;s pretty easy to check anyways.<p>Programming ligatures provide a tangible benefit to many of us, so the author&#x27;s insistence that they are a terrible idea is simply ridiculous (although, reading through some other articles on the site, not too surprising, as the site is 80% good common-sense advice and 20% poorly explained personal opinions being treated as gospel).')
