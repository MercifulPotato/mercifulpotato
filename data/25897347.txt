They’re just some randos saying that they don’t like A’s posting. While annoying, that’s going to happen on <i>every</i> social network. If I went on Gab and started posting a lot of pro-Biden content, I’m certain plenty of people would tell me to knock it off.<p>So sure, it’s alright for A to be annoyed by it. That’s definitely not a unique feature of the fediverse, though.')
