It can cause big problems if persons from outside engineering wander in and communicate with an engineer. Typically, this is a problem when the engineer happens to want to be helpful and winds up spending time on a matter unrelated to the task they have committed to delivering. We&#x27;ve seen hours, days and even weeks of time consumed by such side-tracking.<p>We&#x27;ve had to smack it down pretty hard in a couple of cases, and pretty strictly enforce the triangle when communicating with non-engineering departments.')
