If a world leader claims that he won an election with 99% of the vote, we assume it was a fraudulent election.<p>The thing is, in American capitalism, bosses want their underlings to think they have input and think decisions are made by consensus when, in reality, the &quot;right answer&quot; was preselected, and the politically savvy know what it is. Corporates don&#x27;t actually want workers to have say. They just want the workers to work as hard, and buy in as much, as they would if they actually had a say.<p>This is also why venture funded companies give employees token stock option allocations even though the percentages are actually a joke. In exchange for options that might be worth $5,000 per year by fair market value, the workers work 50% harder because enough of them are young and inexperienced enough to think they &quot;own the company&quot; in a meaningful way.')
