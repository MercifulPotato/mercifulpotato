Usually after pondering the issue a bit I get an idea of what a good solution would be, but often I can get valuable input from my coworkers.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ve missed an important corner case. Maybe my coworker has worked on something similar or relevant and has some code or technique I could use. Maybe I&#x27;ve been overthinking it and a stop-gap is better until we can make a more informed decision.<p>Sometimes just a tweak can make a significant difference, other times I end up going a completely different route.<p>I&#x27;ll also email or phone customers if I sense a X&#x2F;Y problem, or if I don&#x27;t fully get their feature request or bug description. I&#x27;m not a domain expert and it&#x27;s good to have context.<p>All in all, indeed it&#x27;s usually a good idea to not jump straight into it. Mull it over, talk a bit with someone.')
