When you see a list of twenty tweets holding the same viewpoint, the main question is whether they are representative (and of whom are they representative). Whether you say &quot;70%&quot; or just &quot;most people,&quot; it&#x27;s the same value that&#x27;s missing usually. The quantification doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>It&#x27;s the difference between a music critic choosing the 100 best songs (fine, because it&#x27;s a person&#x27;s own opinion presented honestly) versus a music critic saying they&#x27;re just going with the popular consensus while cherry picking tweets that happen to pick the 100 they would have chosen (bad, because the tweets aren&#x27;t put into context). Or like a traditional paper looking for a scientist who will say something exciting&#x2F;sensational in a particular direction, then presenting it as scientific consensus.<p>You can find a group saying anything on twitter. That means that the fact that some particular thing exists on it is useless.')
