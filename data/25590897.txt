Rather, it is the idea that a an application - presented through a web browser - can use additional features provided by browser _if_available_. The term is based on the concept of &quot;Progressive Enhancement&quot;.<p>Everyone&#x27;s pet feature - service workers, single site browsers, offline mode, push notifications, video codec support - gets branded &quot;PWA&quot; in their rant that such and such browser is not keeping up. However, writing your web application to require a feature that not all of the common browsers support means fundamentally your application is _not_ written for progressive enhancement.<p>The reality is that the term &quot;Progressive Web Apps&quot; was coined by Google as they started pushing harder for web apps to perform like native apps - but at the time they had a strategic initiative to have web apps instead of native apps (ChromeOS and the ChromeBooks, pre Android support). None of the other browser or OS platform vendors have that level of strategic investment in supporting web apps as a new &#x27;native&#x27; format - especially considering the security model is usually different than that of the native platform.')
