This is my 3rd tour in DC&#x2F;Va. It has been a fantastic three years, especially w&#x2F;r&#x2F;t life, friends, family, society. I bike to work, and every day has been wonderful.<p>That said -- and I hear pushback on this from other threads -- my job opportunities here for any senior level roles are next to nil. This could be because I do not have a security clearance (a local favorite), or it could be because the job pyramid here in DC&#x2F;NoVa really is differently shaped than SF&#x2F;SV, or it could be that i&#x27;m an outsider w&#x2F;o a deep social network, or perhaps I&#x27;m not looking at the area correctly.<p>As an anecdote, I get tons of Linked In messages for opportunities in California. CTO positions, VP positions at venture backed growth startups, all across the board. I get almost no in-bounds from companies in DC except for consulting firms (been there, done that when i was 20-25, not sure if that is a good fit at my current stage in life.)<p>I&#x27;m sure part of it is my profile. I have lots of real-time systems, model, quant, Computer Vision, and tech leadership background. I&#x27;m just not sure how much of a market there is for that -- though I&#x27;m positive having a security clearance would change things dramatically.<p>This presents a serious concern for me, and a balancing act for continued happiness in DC&#x2F;VA.')
