Item(by='ProofMe5GIsSafe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606705928, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25244412, text='Fact: WHO claimed that flights from China should not be banned, because China has it under control, and a travel ban would do <i>nothing</i> against spread.<p>Fact: Flights from China, including tourism, contributed to the spread of the coronavirus world-wide.<p>Fact: Instead of acknowledging this fact, the media blamed Trump for being a racist, for banning flights early on, despite what the WHO said.<p>Fact: WHO downplayed the role, responsibility, and severity, and their level of access&#x2F;transparency of China. Since there is no health reason for doing that, that reason was economic (WHO decision makers being bought or hired), or political (WHO decision makers bowing to China&#x27;s one-country policy).<p>So we have facts establishing: WHO lied, China lied and is in damage control, media lied and invoked racism over a lie, WHO can&#x27;t be fully trusted to act in the public&#x27;s health best interest, and can&#x27;t be depended on for individual health best practices (&quot;Don&#x27;t wear mask, unless you are sick.&quot;).<p>Some may call those facts conspiracy theories. And if it is a fact that the media did not paint Trump as a racist for making a sane decision, then this just does not support my theory, that the media is biased against Trump, or being played by Trump to become emotional and make bad decisions. I can find other evidence that does support it. Just because the media behaves one time, disproofs nothing, unless my theory is &quot;The Media is 100% anti-Trump&quot;. Which would be a poor straw-man theory, easily debunked.')
