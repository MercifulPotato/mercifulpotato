There was meeting at the contested location, which both sides argued that it belongs to them, and apparently India used to petrol that area. In the meet they had agreed to pull back troops, whilst the Indian side retracted the troops, the chinese did not move an inch. This was observed by Indian troops, when they(about 2-3 initially) went back to enquire this, the Chinese counterpart attack the Indian side with weapons (wire-barbed woods etc) even when weapons were forbidden in that region according to previous agreements. This was clear violation from the Chinese side. Soon the Indian troops got a information about this and they rushed to save their men. And during this clash, most of troops from both sides either died in hand to hand combat or fell down deep into the valley.<p>The point is that China keeps on extended their claim of what border looks like for them, showing centuries old maps and treaties. Its not just limited to India. They captured few villages from neighboring country Nepal, last year their was a similar issue at doklam in bhutan where India had to step in. They have territorial disputes with All countries, even the region where China doesn&#x27;t even share border by creating artificial Islands.<p>It&#x27;s not about losing small region, but about future consequences, they&#x27;ll proclaim more land. In fact, No body understand&#x27;s how they could proclaim and ENTIRE STATE of India (Arunachal Pradesh), which has Its own Democratically elected Govt, since country&#x27;s independence.<p>The Chinese Land Grab needs to stop. It&#x27;s straight up Bullying.')
