It doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve had very humid -25C air in Alaska<p>You haven&#x27;t had very humid -25C air, in an absolute sense.  Take a look at a vapour pressure calculator (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.omnicalculator.com&#x2F;chemistry&#x2F;vapour-pressure-of-water" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.omnicalculator.com&#x2F;chemistry&#x2F;vapour-pressure-of-...</a>): the vapour pressure of water at -25C is about 63 Pa, but about 13 Pascals at -40C.  The difference of 50 Pa is trivial compared to the ~100,000 Pa pressure of air at sea level.  Once you&#x27;re below 0C, there just isn&#x27;t enough water around in a vapour (or suspended) phase to have much impact.<p>A Globe and Mail article from 2016 discussed this phenomenon (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theglobeandmail.com&#x2F;life&#x2F;health-and-fitness&#x2F;fitness&#x2F;is-damp-cold-really-the-worst&#x2F;article28346087&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theglobeandmail.com&#x2F;life&#x2F;health-and-fitness&#x2F;fitn...</a>).  Its conclusions were still tentative, but the strongest correlate of the effect seemed to be cloud cover, where bright sunlight felt warmer despite colder air temperatures.')
