Item(by='analognoise', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610348995, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25721326, text='100%, all the recommendations to &quot;start&quot; with the FOSS toolchain are totally bogus.<p>&quot;You want to learn FPGAs! Let&#x27;s simulate with Verilator. No, it can&#x27;t simulate delays, or your vendor&#x27;s IP library. No, it&#x27;s not mixed language - hope all your IP is Verilog! And you&#x27;ll need to know C or C++ to write your test bench, but that&#x27;s ok right? The examples online involve templates (ZipCPU), so you&#x27;re OK with Makefiles, and templated C++, obviously. Now, you have the FOSS P&amp;R tools! They use a primitive simulated annealing placement algorithm that&#x27;s like what we did in the 90&#x27;s. Yeah, that&#x27;s terrible, but don&#x27;t worry, it works fine because the only parts you can target are really, really tiny Lattice parts! No, you can&#x27;t even use all the hard blocks on the 7 series Xilinx parts - you can fit ONE whole RISC-V superscalar OoO core on the $3500 VC707 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;csail-csg&#x2F;riscy-OOO" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;csail-csg&#x2F;riscy-OOO</a>), running at ~120MHz - but I&#x27;ll bet you&#x27;ll do some primitive microcontroller RISC-V instead, something that fits on these really, really, REALLY tiny parts. Then you&#x27;ll obviously want to augment that with Migen - don&#x27;t you also know Python? Or Chisel! How great is Scala right? Yeah, it couldn&#x27;t simulate a simple tri-state until version 2, but you&#x27;re OK with the concept of domain specific languages already, right? You love the first-class functions and code as data concept! I know, I know. No, nobody in industry cares about any of this stuff, they&#x27;re too busy using actual FPGA knowledge to like build real systems and circuits. Yeah, a microcontroller-level RISC-V style processor is a handful of undergraduate labs, but RISC-V IS OPEN! Anyway, back to FPGAs...hey where are you going?!&quot;')
