Also, I’m paid $0 for the pleasure. It costed both of us.<p>So, no, free labor really isn’t the right way to see it. It’s more complex than that.<p>When I don’t keep up with PRs and issues, I’m deciding the pay off isn’t worth it in that moment. <i>None</i> of it is free. I have all sorts of projects on Github that you’d have to pay me $1000 to even clone again. I wrote them in one stage of my life that I’m not in anymore. That’s just life.<p>Feel free to fork(tm).')
