My Ubuntu laptop accidentally doubled-down on 16gb RAM because I forgot to give it a swap partition (whoops). It hangs maybe once a month under a VS Code, PostgreSQL, FastAPI&#x2F;Python, React workload. Basically, not annoyingly frequently enough for a lazy person like me to change the partition table. The same workload on my 7 year old Ubuntu desktop with a swap partition on a fast SSD very rarely ever hangs.<p>Certainly some devs need more than 16gb, but they know who they are. And you know who they are because, well, they love telling you :).')
