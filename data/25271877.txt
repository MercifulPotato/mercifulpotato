With no price increase either. Using s3 as a makeshift database is possible in a lot more scenarios now.<p>I especially like using s3 as a db when dealing with ETLs, where the state of some data is stored in its key prefix. This means that the etl can stop &#x2F; resume at any point with a single source of truth as the database.<p>The potential drawback is cost of course; moving (renaming) is free but copying is not. S3&#x27;s biggest price pain is always its PUTs. In many ETLs this is usually a non-issue because you have to do those PUTs regardless, as you probably want the data to be saved at the various stages for future debugging and recovery.')
