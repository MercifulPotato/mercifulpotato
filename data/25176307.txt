Rails integrated Webpack a long time ago in it&#x27;s basic installation so if you do `rails new my_cool_app` you have Webpack ready(and preconfigured with React&#x2F;Vue&#x2F;Elm etc.) right out of the box. Also it moved away from Coffeescript and jQuery.<p>And for the full page reloads, which you think is weird, there are Turbolinks(again preconfigured in the basic install) since like 2012. I&#x27;m not sure React or other reactivity foos already existed at this time. And now we have things like Stimulus and Stimulus Reflex and others so the development ain&#x27;t stoping now either.<p>So the feeling that Rails are stuck or out of date is really only a feeling.')
