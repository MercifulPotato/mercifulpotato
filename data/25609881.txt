Item(by='mlyle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609556036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25609797, text='&gt; This seems very circular to me. If they don&#x27;t build very effective antibodies, they shouldn&#x27;t be putting much selective pressure on the virus, because if they did, they&#x27;d be more effective in the first place.<p>Just to follow up &#x2F; argue from another angle.  It&#x27;s believed to be likely that the &quot;new&quot; UK variant likely emerged in an immunocompromised individual.  This results in A) -some- immune response, and B) prolonged infection where the virus is under evolutionary pressure to escape that immune response &#x2F; original antibodies.<p>Someone who doesn&#x27;t mount a strong response to the vaccine is a very similar case.')
