What do they write? You get 15 engineers, 3 DBAs, 5 sys admins + their managers. While that&#x27;s spinning up, you get a bunch of business analyists to write the requirements. A first version gets written, it doesn&#x27;t do what people want and the data it works from is really crappy, so you have to write a bunch of custom edge logic to deal with the crappy data. Repeat several times, including massive changes in scope.<p>Like is there bloat on these projects? 100%, and a lot of it, but saying &quot;just get 73 solid engineers in a room&quot; doesn&#x27;t really get you very far when the requirements are really really unknown.')
