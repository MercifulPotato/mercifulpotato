Floating point implicitly &quot;solves&quot; this problem by truncating the implicit interval onto a member of a fixed discrete set. It does so quite cleverly, but ultimately it still silently loses information; sometimes (admittedly rarely) you might want the correct result &quot;I was unable to compute an answer due to lack of input precision&quot; that happens when you try and work out whether [0,2] is less than [1,3].')
