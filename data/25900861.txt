It was a desktop instant messaging app, because that was before the smartphone era.<p>They based it on the decentralized protocol Jabber (or XMPP) and even open their servers to others. Meaning you could discuss with people using other servers than GTalk, just like email.<p>Google closed their servers to federalization, rebranded GTalk to Hangout and made bad decision after bad decision (but always in the direction of closing up instead of supporting open standards), lost the fight for messaging despite controlling the dominant mobile OS.<p>tl;dr I have no faith in Google to (1) do the right thing for open standards and (2) manage to get any sort of market share on messaging')
