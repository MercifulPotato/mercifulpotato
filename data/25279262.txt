Google Cloud is their single largest non-ad revenue stream, at $3.4B in Q3 (or 7.4% of total revenue). The rest of their non-advertising revenue ($5.5B, or 11.8% of total revenue) is lumped into the &quot;other&quot; category, which implies that they have a lot of smaller revenue streams that add up to a larger figureâ€”not a single hose. So I guess you could maybe call Google Cloud a &quot;hose&quot; at ~$14B per year, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t print money like their advertising business, and is a relatively small source of revenue for such a large company.')
