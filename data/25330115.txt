It approaches WebRTC from the protocol. I also try to give credit&#x2F;real history at the end!<p>I played around with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Sean-Der&#x2F;webrtc-uri" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Sean-Der&#x2F;webrtc-uri</a> but I don&#x27;t have any experience&#x2F;friends in the IETF&#x2F;W3C so it is never going to happen. I agree it would be really amazing. It would be great if a company that had influence picked it up!<p>Yea I work on Pion! Thanks for using it :) I get a real sense of purpose trying to make WebRTC more accessible&#x2F;easier to use. I love seeing what people build. Also really feel in love with teaching because of it. It sure has taken up a lot of my time, but 100% worth it.')
