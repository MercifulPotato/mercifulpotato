It had 2GB of RAM, and dmidecode assured me it would support 4GB. Although dmidecode said that both slots would support 2GB, it turned out only one of them does.<p>I searched around a bit more and I now suspect the 2GB slot might actually support 4GB, but I don&#x27;t want to spend money on this bet (it&#x27;s an old machine with a Core 2 Duo processor).<p>So now I&#x27;m left wondering how dmidecode can be so wrong.')
