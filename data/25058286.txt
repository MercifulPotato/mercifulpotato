Any higher graduate course and a decent score on their test usually suffices and they give you a PR from the outset. Same for Canada.<p>If anything, the immigration equation is far more relevant to the US than it is to other countries. A top PhD used to be able to fetch you an eb1 Green Card which is a lot faster than the eb2. However, &#x27;eb&#x27; GCs have to be filed by your employer, which means leaving Academia or having a decent enough post-graduation industry outlook. With eb-1 requirements only getting more stringent, this perk is also becoming less relevant.')
