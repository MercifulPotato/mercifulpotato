I&#x27;m sorry this happened. We have one bot&#x2F;automated reponse, which is our first reply to say, &quot;we&#x27;ve received your message and we&#x27;ll get back to you soon.&quot; Beyond that, every interaction with Stripe Support is with a human. We&#x27;ve invested quite a lot in support this yearâ€”the team itself is larger, and each week, we now survey tens of thousands of Stripe users who&#x27;ve talked with our support team recently, and 4&#x2F;5 say they&#x27;re satisified. But it sounds like we&#x27;ve dropped the ball in your case, and I&#x27;d love to learn why. Would you be able to forward those emails to me at edwin@stripe.com? (And if anyone else reading this had a similar time with us, please email me. I&#x27;d really like to help dig into each one and see what went wrong.)')
