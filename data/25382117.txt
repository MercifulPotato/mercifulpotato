(Maybe unless the person you&#x27;re referring to indicates a preference otherwise.)<p>Like, maybe this is inconsistent with some set of standard SJW rules that you have in mind. But even if so, I don&#x27;t see any reason in this conversation to assume that the person you&#x27;re criticizing is attached to that standard set. (I also don&#x27;t think there <i>is</i> a standard set at this point.)')
