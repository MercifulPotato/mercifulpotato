Your counterpart is being paid to form that connection with you, and you are in a specific position of power over them in that situation.<p>It&#x27;s nice, in the moment, to be given service - by someone working in a service industry (this is certainly not unique to the suburbs) - but I find it odd that you seem to describe this as a satisfying personal relationship. You will likely never see that person again, whenever they stop doing that job. Your connection and their connection is to the transaction, which includes a personal element at your behest.<p>If you had said: and I often see them outside of work, then I would consider that slightly differently.')
