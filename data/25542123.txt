Item(by='CinematicStudio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608970521, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25538565, text='&gt; Some features, such as support for some external libraries (libx264 and libx265 for example) and various filters, are covered by the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 or later (see commercial x264 license exception below). If those parts get used the GPL applies to all of FFmpeg. See LICENSE.md in the source to see a list of GPL parts of FFmpeg and which external libraries require GPL<p>So basically where it counts (x264 and x265), I can&#x27;t.<p>LATER EDIT:<p>I remember looking into this a while ago in quite a bit of detail: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engadget.com&#x2F;2010-05-04-know-your-rights-h-264-p" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engadget.com&#x2F;2010-05-04-know-your-rights-h-264-p</a>... (there&#x27;s plenty of other links to this).<p>Long story short, MPEG LA owns some patents that relate to h264&#x2F;h265, and you need to pay them A LOT of $ in order to use these codecs. Using ffmpeg will not devoid you of that.<p>Also, even somewhere on the ffmpeg page, when I last read it, it will say something more in the lines of &quot;we&#x27;re not lawyers, so take this with a grain of salt&quot;.<p>----------<p>So all in all, after doing quite a bit of research, seeing how vague the licensing from MPEGLA is and all that, I started looking for alternatives. I found one (from Microsoft), and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using. At this point, it satisfies most of my needs (even though I had to do lot of optimizations on top of it) -- in case this won&#x27;t hold true in the future, I may revisit the whole ffmpeg mambo-jambo :D')
