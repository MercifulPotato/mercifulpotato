In my small-sized city in a small country there are maybe 25 car clubs I could be part of, specialist garages for just about every brand of car - even really niche shops that just do custom re-upholstery only for certain brands etc. Whereas for computers there&#x27;s just a handful of people using the local auction and classified sites.<p>I think the reason you cite for the mismatch is the strongest one. If you&#x27;re into collecting 80&#x27;s BMWs you can still easily drive with a club including newer cars every weekend on the same roads, use the same petrol, easily get plugs, belts other parts etc. But an 80&#x27;s PC is much more &quot;stuck in time&quot; and you need to be quite knowledgeable to maintain and enjoy in the same way.')
