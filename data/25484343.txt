They almost are in fact.<p>But consider that we may be optimising for different things. Most new developers I hire can be thrown a MacBook and they’ll know what to do, Linux on the other hand doesn’t have that guarantee especially towards the junior and front-end market segments of where I work. It’s a (real) broad strokes opinion, but I’m of the belief that macOS and by extension MacBooks offer us fewer overheads in terms of setup, maintenance, onboarding, tooling suitability for the median developer. So that leaves us using macOS.<p>This is the factor we’re optimising for more than deployment portability - we optimise for vendor lock-in in less than the developer experience for the median of our developers. For many of us on this forum we may be best with Linux on a bleeding edge distro, but for our preferences we deploy MacBooks for portability. Whether it helps things overall, this is in Manila where a net monthly salary is often less than the cost of a laptop, so we deploy one device that can be transported between home and work as required for those that don’t have a personal device.<p>With that, I see this as Apple locking us into that ecosystem rather than a choice we’re making on our side, so I’d rather lean into this and explore it further than doing nothing. If it comes out positive then we’ll be ready to make the switch before Apple forces us into it, and if not we’ll deploy something thinkpad-esque and keep our production instances x86.')
