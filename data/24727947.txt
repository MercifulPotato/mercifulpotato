Nextcloud, Mailserver with DNS, gitea, drone&#x2F;jenkins, piwik, etc.<p>Sounds counterproductive, to pay someone to host something that is meant to be hosted by yourself, but most often, I just need the <i>option</i> to move to selfhosted when time arrives.<p>Sure, I can host my own piwik, or gitea, or nexcloud (I do) and even (painfully) manage my mailserver and DNS with mailinabox. Out of principle. But the TCO of that is mountainhigh, if I&#x27;m honest. Tucking someone â‚¬9.99 a month to deal with one of these for me, would save me a lot, in the grand scheme.<p>Edit: what I&#x27;m trying to say: I&#x27;m convinced there is a businesscase there. There&#x27;s money to be made in this area of FLOSS, which can trickle down into the upstream projects or be a businesscase as funding for the projects themselves even.')
