Consent is a meme. People who work in warehouses don&#x27;t get to shop among a dozen different employers like software engineers in the valley.<p>&gt;Also bag-searches seem more invasive than video.<p>Then don&#x27;t do either. Or only do some random searches or when you&#x27;re suspecting someone of having stolen something. Treating employees like thieves by default is nuts. We don&#x27;t accept petty theft as a justification for mass surveillance outside the workplace so we shouldn&#x27;t accept it inside the workplace either.')
