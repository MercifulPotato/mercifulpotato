The ions in my device have a thermal energy profile. The coordinated motion is a result of their rapid expansion and cooling in a very weak magnetic field.<p>The instant ions leave the hot thermal focus, each one flys off on its own independent cyclotron trajectory. Their collective motion results in another dense, hot, thermal focus one period later.')
