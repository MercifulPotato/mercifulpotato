Most of the time Earth is closer to the Voyager spacecraft than Pluto (or Saturn or...) is! In addition, we can build and maintain <i>much</i> better equipment here on Earth than we can ship to Pluto.<p>If you wanted to do this &quot;for real&quot;, the better option is to send a train of repeaters after the Voyager spacecraft in roughly the same flightpath. More effective, and vastly easier.')
