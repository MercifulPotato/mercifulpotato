The original Merlin engines were modern iterations of proven technology and vertical landing rockets were already proven technology dating back many decades to the DC-X [1] and Apollo lunar lander.  What SpaceX did was cut all the bullshit out of the space launch industry that had grown incredibly lazy due to lack of competitors and revolving doors with the government, and then modernize everything with iterative development.  In comparison, commercially viable fusion has never been shown to work in the real world at all.  The Raptor engine, however, really is a massive achievement and is somewhat comparable to developing fusion power.  But if SpaceX had started with it, they probably would have failed due to how much time, money, and expertise it took to get working.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;McDonnell_Douglas_DC-X" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;McDonnell_Douglas_DC-X</a>')
