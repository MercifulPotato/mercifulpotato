Even though I could take the train if I wanted to (after driving to the station), it still got old and I wouldn&#x27;t have wanted to do it long term. I&#x27;m about the same to go into my company&#x27;s Boston office now--I&#x27;m technically out of our suburban office and in practice I&#x27;ve been remote for a few years--and it makes for a long day but one day a week would be pretty doable.')
