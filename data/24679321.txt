This puts a rainbow-coloured bow on it.<p>Facts are events.  Narrative <i>is the relationships between those events</i>.  Unconnected data vs. an interconnected graph, individual nodes vs. integrated network.<p>It&#x27;s possible to take the same facts (or a small sample of them, as here) and create an entirely different story.<p>Or at least the appearance of one.  A recut trailer <i>might</i> be sustained by recutting the film as a whole, or not.  The Maverick-Iceman romance ... probably ... wouldn&#x27;t be sustained without a fair bit of extra (or previously cut) footage, but there&#x27;s definitely enough to cast a trailer-length spell.<p>Good narratives address more of the facts, concisely and with few contradictions, loose ends, or holes  Something often missing even in officially released films.')
