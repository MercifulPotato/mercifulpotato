The article is talking about basic income being needed as a safety-net for events like losing your job so that you can continue to feed your family. I suspect that absent a car, mortgage and credit card payment coming due every month most people would actually be able to weather this sort of event. The reality of these monthly liabilities doesn&#x27;t change all that much regardless of your equity situation.')
