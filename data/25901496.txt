The dives were all recoverable if the pilots had:<p>1. trimmed the stabilizer back to normal with the thumb switches<p>2. then turned off the stab trim system<p>&gt; creating a tug of war between the aircraft and its crew<p>Which is the reason for step 2.<p>See Boeing&#x27;s Emergency Airworthiness Directive:<p>&quot;Initially, higher control forces may be needed to overcome any stabilizer nose down trim already applied. Electric stabilizer trim can be used to neutralize control column pitch forces before moving the STAB TRIM CUTOUT switches to CUTOUT. Manual stabilizer trim can be used before and after the STAB TRIM CUTOUT switches are moved to CUTOUT.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theaircurrent.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;B737-MAX-AD-1107.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theaircurrent.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;B737-MA...</a>')
