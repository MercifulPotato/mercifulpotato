Rarely I&#x27;ve come across memory issues with the wrappers provided by Vanara and PInvoke.net, where they&#x27;ve forgotten to return a buffer - these kind of problems are absolute bastards to track down, and the root cause is of course manually building wrapper code. Having an automated means to do this will be a huge boon.<p>I wonder though - quite often if I&#x27;m digging into Win32 stuff, it means I&#x27;m working on performance sensitive code, where I want to keep allocations low - I haven&#x27;t looked I to it yet, but I hope C#&#x2F;Win32 has an option to generate wrappers that take pointers instead of only using managed types!')
