Yet, the PlumpJack entity Villa Encinal Partners LP - that according to SBA data also retained 14 employees - received more than seven times that amount at $918,720.<p>&gt; ABC7&#x27;s analysis found the only other California winery that received close to the same loan amount as Villa Encinal Partners LP is Oak Knoll Farming Corp, which retained 79 employees - more than five times as many as Villa.<p>&gt; The average number of employees retained for every California winery that received more than $900,000 worth of PPP funding is 148.<p>&gt; Another company affiliated with the PlumpJack Group is Balboa Cafe Partners LP that received a $506,799 loan on April 29, 2020. A commercial data firm estimated in June 2020 that Balboa Caf√© Partners employed seven individuals, but SBA data associated with their loan application states they retained 55 employees.<p>Pretty interesting. Also of note is how many of PlumpJack&#x27;s businesses received PPP Loans when thousands of other small businesses couldn&#x27;t even get a response on their applications...')
