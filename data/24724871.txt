Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[24725291], score=None, time=1602198080, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24724825, text='&gt; You can’t copyright a single recipe that contains components of other recipes, but if you had written a book titled “My grandmas chocolate chip cookies from scratch”, where the first recipe is for homemade chocolate chips, the second is for how to grind your own flour for dough, and the third is for combining the previous two into a cookie, then yeah you can copyright that particular set of recipes.<p>Suppose I want to compile the big book of all known recipes. Then it will contain every recipe in your book, in its entirety, as well as every recipe in every other book. But if I can put the entire contents of your book in my book then what is it that you&#x27;re really claiming to protect? The order the recipes appear in the book, i.e. the order the classes appear in the file? Which isn&#x27;t generally regarded as part of the API.')
