First they chew up the styrofoam, and then they provide an environment (pH, nutrients, enzymes) for the bacteria to be effective. Mealworms are also fairly easy to breed.<p>If you isolated the bacteria, you might need to provide those other functions in an alternative way that&#x27;s more cost effective than putting some worms in a bucket.')
