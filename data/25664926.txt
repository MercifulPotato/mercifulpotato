You&#x27;re following a graph structure of cross-references, in both directions (though it&#x27;s less obvious here how to open panes for back references). It&#x27;s not a tree.<p>&gt; <i>If I delete a pane from a column, its descendants stay open, making it even more confusing why I had them open in the first place.</i><p>Again, not a tree. Deleting panes opened from the pane you&#x27;re deleting would be a bad thing, because some panes may be just intermediaries you used to find the semantic units you were interested in.<p>The GUI here is similar to Miller columns, but it&#x27;s not actually Miller columns - it doesn&#x27;t represent a tree.')
