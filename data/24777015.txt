For my viewing there are basically two types of shows.  The first is relatively mindless entertainment.  I enjoy an episode here or there but I&#x27;m not invested in the plot.  I&#x27;m not watching YouTube recaps and &quot;explainers&quot; after the episodes, and I&#x27;m not engaged in a community where we discuss the plot and predict where things are going.  Barry is a good example of that.  Ted Lasso is another good example.<p>Then there are the shows where I get invested in the plot and story.  Shows where I am theorizing with my wife, watching YouTube videos on it, and discussing it online.  Shows such as Westworld or Game of Thrones.<p>There are some shows that straddle the line well, but you usually know ahead of time.  Watchmen falls into that category.  Single season, compelling drama, had me engaged the whole time, and it was a single season.  But I knew it was going to be a single season from the start.<p>This is the same reason I typically try not to read unfinished trilogies.  Patrick Rothfuss and GRRM have ruined me.')
