Most websites aren&#x27;t exposed to the world directly - they sit behind a load balancer because a single app can&#x27;t take the entire load.<p>Most companies I know have workloads that don&#x27;t just span one virtual machine - they span tens or hundreds or thousands or in the case of the hyperscalers hundreds of thousands. Most of the container users out there live on virtual machines! I can&#x27;t keep emphasizing this point enough.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing for the hobbyist at home. I&#x27;m arguing for the companies that on the low end spend tens of thousands of dollars a month on cloud infrastructure. Just as a case point - Lyft alone was spending something like $80M a <i>year</i> on cloud infrastructure.<p>One of the key unikernel questions is that we don&#x27;t live in the 1990s anymore - Zeus the database server doesn&#x27;t live on the same server as Mars the webserver anymore. Multi-process&#x2F;single-server architecture makes absolutely no sense in the 2020s.<p>It&#x27;s almost 2021. Things have changed. Our operating systems much change too.')
