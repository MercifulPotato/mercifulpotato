Yes, you can loose your job but you get to stick around until your visa expires, which in my experience is tied to the visa term rather than the employment.<p>When you loose employment you’re also allowed to collect unemployment.<p>My visa class (basically the equivalent of an H1B) also allowed me to work as a contractor in my field.<p>Finally, getting the visa transferred to another employer just requires you to show up at the immigration office with an employment contract. Your employer doesn’t have to do anything.<p>There is also an assumption here that you’re a guest who is trying to do the right thing rather than someone who is trying to game the system or steal a job from Germans.<p>So, the reality is that it’s hugely different from the experience I’ve heard of people having with the American immigration system.')
