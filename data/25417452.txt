Maybe 3 hours each.<p>If you interrupt one of those blocks, you can&#x27;t do &quot;difficult coding work&quot;, but you can communicate with people, document your code, and organize. The easy work can take up a lot longer, it&#x27;s just not part of the block, and interrupting the block means you don&#x27;t have that block.<p>Organizing means simple stuff like moving pieces around to where it makes sense to have them, simplifying well understood issues, and automating parts of the build.<p>By difficult work, I mainly mean exploratory coding work, where you write new code, see if it compiles, and whether it does what you expected. Or you are debugging something that&#x27;s broken and following various hypotheses about what might be wrong.<p>Once you&#x27;ve either written the new piece or discovered the bug, you can spend time doing &quot;organizing&quot;, where you know the answer, but you just need to spend the time moving stuff around.<p>I&#x27;d be lucky to have a block each day.')
