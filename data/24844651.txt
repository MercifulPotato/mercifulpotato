I actually find it somewhat jarring to take a call in the presence of other people.<p>I&#x27;m used to real life where you talk and see people, and the people you see are the people who can hear and talk to you.<p>With phone calls the existence of people around me that can hear half the conversation, aren&#x27;t part of the conversation, and can&#x27;t reply to the conversation, is utterly jarring and unnatural to me and I avoid it at all costs. I can&#x27;t for the life of me answer the phone and be at ease when there is anyone else in the room.<p>I also find it really hard to comprehend everything someone is saying without body language. That is also super unnatural to me. I read faces a lot. I&#x27;m just used to real life I guess.')
