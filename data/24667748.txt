Item(by='ilitirit', descendants=None, kids=[24668866], score=None, time=1601678248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24666685, text='This is misleading in some ways. Even people who are not overweight &quot;lose weight&quot; through exhaling and sweat&#x2F;urination. It&#x27;s not really an &quot;interesting&quot; concept. I think the more interesting discussion is around how many people still believe that exercise is a better way to lose weight than simply eating less. Basically, the perspective is entirely wrong. It&#x27;s not about &quot;losing weight&quot;, it&#x27;s about not putting into your body in the first place.<p>A simplification of a tangential - did you ever hear that when you first start your lifestyle change (diet&#x2F;exercise) that it&#x27;s very easy to lose weight at the start because you&#x27;re &quot;losing water&quot;? Well, now you know where that water comes from.<p>edit: I should just also say that another interesting discussion is around the best ways to get people to eat less. And part of that involves lots of interesting (at least to me) biochemistry.')
