Item(by='danShumway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611933583, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25957945, text='&gt; Up until now a lot of it was justified by many many people as protecting protected classes<p><i>Some</i> of it was justified that way. Steam&#x27;s war on adult games wasn&#x27;t. The use of lawsuits&#x2F;libel laws to shut down critics isn&#x27;t justified that way. FOSTA-SESTA wasn&#x27;t (reasonably) justified that way. The &quot;cancel-culture&quot; debate has always been an extremely narrow part of the free speech debate, and has always been a little bit problematic because it attracts people who don&#x27;t understand how freedom of association works and how to balance that with more general (but still valid) concerns about cultural censorship and othering. Most real free speech debate and advocacy happens outside of the framing of Conservatives vs Liberals.<p>People should be thinking about free speech more broadly, and they should be considering not just the censorship they see in service of protecting marginalized communities&#x2F;classes, but also the less publicized censorship that directly affects those communities.<p>I&#x27;m trying to walk a line, because I don&#x27;t want to discourage people from waking up, but do I do want people who are incensed about WSB to realize is that WSB is in an enormously privileged position right now, and compared to the history of many other communities, their censorship is mild and temporary.')
