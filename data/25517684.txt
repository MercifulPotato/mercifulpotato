If I&#x27;m hiking I look around at all the trees and leaves as if I&#x27;m seeing it for the first time. If I&#x27;m in the city I look at all the big buildings and pretty lights. The goal is to recapture some of that magic of being a kid.<p>I&#x27;m a little younger than you, but I feel the same way. I think it&#x27;s an easy thing to fall into when you live a pragmatic life. Part of it is societal pressure and part of it is we stop exploring. Luckily, there are examples like Richard Feynman, who are smart, hardworking, and still know how to have a good time.')
