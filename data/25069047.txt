(I find it hard to imagine you would read a text of any notable length and not agree with any of its ideas to some degree.)<p>Something that rings very true for me: Sharing is amazingly underutilized (unfortunately I feel it&#x27;s a deeply cultural problem right now, but oh well, over time things change): I have absolutely no inherent need to own a car. I don&#x27;t need to own a Hammer. I don&#x27;t need to own a bicycle pump. Actually, it&#x27;s intensely inefficient how many things I <i>do</i> have to own and store right now, to be able to only use 5 Minutes every other week or maybe even only half a year.<p>What I instead need is convenient <i>access</i> to these things. If you can show me a model where I can have that without the burden and cost of solo-owning it – something the author is implying will be a solved problem – I am all for that.')
