It doesn&#x27;t even have my last name for instance. And that&#x27;s a western name.<p>Then there&#x27;s also the following issues:<p>- The list contains mostly names in basic latin script, which already excludes most of the world population.<p>- It&#x27;s also pretty bold of the author to assume that everyone even <i>has</i> a &quot;first&quot; and a &quot;last&quot; name. Not all names work like that.<p>- The list contains a bunch of extraneous stuff like &quot;�&quot; and &quot;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;&lt;&#x2F;body&gt;&lt;&#x2F;html&gt;\x08 \x1d(&gt;\\k����\x01 \x01 \x04\x01&quot; and &quot;रामकिशो&amp;amp;&quot;<p>- The list is converted to lowercase. You can&#x27;t just change the capitalization of names and expect them to be the same. Not all scripts work like that.<p>- In some languages&#x2F;cultures a first&#x2F;last name could be pretty much any word you can find in a dictionary, or a combination of them. You&#x27;d pretty much need to add that language&#x27;s entire dictionary.<p>I could go on but instead I&#x27;ll just link to this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kalzumeus.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;06&#x2F;17&#x2F;falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kalzumeus.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;06&#x2F;17&#x2F;falsehoods-programmers-...</a>')
