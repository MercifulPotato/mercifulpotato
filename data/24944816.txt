That is to say, generally only indie- or genre- enthusiasts know where to find the &quot;good stuff&quot; for any given category good, because the small studios don&#x27;t have the marketing dollars to compete with the larger players or to cut through from &quot;sleeper genre hit&quot; to &quot;genre hit,&quot; let alone from &quot;genre hit&quot; to &quot;mainstream hit.&quot;<p>The genre games that <i>do</i> make it to mainstream are typically backed by distasteful in-app purchase schemes.<p>Many people have heard about &quot;Dwarf Fortress&quot; at this point since it&#x27;s been around so long, but mostly only the &quot;traditional roguelike&quot; fanbase is even aware of games like &quot;Cogmind&quot; (an ascii game with incredible attention to detail that extends beyond being just a great game to things like thoughtfully implemented accessibility features and lovely crafted ascii graphics using its own open sourced ascii engine, RexPaint). Within that enthusiast crowd, though, it&#x27;s one of those obvious &#x27;oh yeah I know that game&#x27; games.<p>(Okay so my reply started out in good faith but then I couldn&#x27;t help but use it as an excuse to gush about Cogmind[0] and the work of its author.)<p>But anyway, as a genre- enthusiast I don&#x27;t really know what the best forums are for finding other hits in other genres. But occasionally I watch YouTube videos reviewing games similar execution to, say, King&#x27;s Quest 6, and I really do think there&#x27;s a rich library of high quality new games coming out in that genre.<p>Steam&#x27;s recommendation engine has gotten better at helping you find what you&#x27;re looking for, fwiw, but you still have to go looking.<p>A bookstore is probably a good analogy for the experience today. If you only looked at the books in the front of a bookstore, or only read the &quot;popular&quot; books, you might come to the conclusion that most books being written are crap. It helps to go into a bookstore armed with knowledge of what genres you like and which authors are respected for quality before you even get to the browsing stage.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gridsagegames.com&#x2F;cogmind&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gridsagegames.com&#x2F;cogmind&#x2F;</a>')
