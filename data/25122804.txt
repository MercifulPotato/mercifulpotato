Once that happened, every one jumped on board<p>The second fact is treating Financial Fraud as ID Theft,  no one steals a persons ID, If someone fraudulently represents themselves to a bank as me and the bank falls for that well that should be on the bank,  it should not be on me to prove my &quot;identity was stolen&quot;,  this reversal of liability is what prevent the problem of Financial Fraud from being fixed')
