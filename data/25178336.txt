It is simply the modern equivalent to a handshake.<p>Sadly, precedent around Eula’s mean that signatures are no longer necessary to execute contracts.<p>If anything, society would be better served by making it more difficult to enter into binding agreements than to make it less difficult.<p>Imagine if, by law, for a EULA to be binding, the end user had to scroll through the entire document, and initial each separate section.  Eula’s would be much shorter, and much less common.<p>In a digital equivalent of “no trespassing” or “cameras in use” signs a few standard clauses could be made enforceable by displaying them prominently on each page.  For instance, there could be a clauses such as “you are purchasing a transferrable non-exclusive license to this software”, or “your subscription to this service is at-will with a fixed rate of $N&#x2F;time-unit.”')
