One of the things that made the series <i>so good</i> was the 15-minute a day reading guide.<p>This site has .pdf copies of the books for free. You can sign up and pay for more content if you&#x27;d like, but the gist of it is free anyway. Here is page for the daily reading guide: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.myharvardclassics.com&#x2F;categories&#x2F;20120612_1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.myharvardclassics.com&#x2F;categories&#x2F;20120612_1</a><p>I&#x27;ll caution that the book collection was published in 1909, so you&#x27;ll be missing out on the last 111 years of history.
