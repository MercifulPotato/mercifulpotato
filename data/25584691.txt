It depends on what you rent, of course. If you rent a house that was purchased a long time ago, it can be less. But a lot of rentals are in apartment complexes, and are newer and more expensive per square foot than equivalent purchases. I also think typically rental units are smaller than houses for most people, so I wonder whether you&#x27;re really comparing apples to apples. Consider that for any given house, rent must cover the owner&#x27;s mortgage, so it cannot be less than the purchase costs.<p>&gt; if you&#x27;re renting you have an extra $X&#x2F;mo to invest in the stock market.<p>People usually use the down payment as the capital opportunity cost that you can invest as an alternative to buying a house. My question is this: statistically, how many people actually do it and make better returns than buying a house? It&#x27;s one thing to talk about it being possible, and another to actually do it. I don&#x27;t know how to consistently make better returns investing than I&#x27;ve made on my houses, and I&#x27;m not sure I have the energy to stay on top of it every month. Note your suggestion to invest instead of rent involves monthly adjustments of your investments.')
