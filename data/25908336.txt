But since COVID I&#x27;ve been looking for an alternative I can do independently, either outdoors or at home.<p>Last spring I bought a barbell and some weights, and that helps.  But I&#x27;d really like the same kind of interval workout for my upper-body as swimming provides.<p>I started looking into rowing machines recently and came to same conclusion as you - works most of your muscles, and provides both interval and resistance workouts.  Seems perfect for the Corona Era.')
