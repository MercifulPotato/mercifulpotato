Item(by='danans', descendants=None, kids=[24735134], score=None, time=1602275487, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24733434, text='&gt; Give America back the monopoly it had in the fifties and sixties and minimum wage would be $24 an hour.<p>It would take a lot more than that.  Remember that the gains labor made after world war II were built upon decades of struggle by labor, including frequently being targets of violence by armed militia hired by corporations [1].   Despite that, America desperately needed labor for world war II (where the alternative was defeat at the hands of the Nazis), so for that moment in history capital and labor found themselves in a obvious win-win scenario.  Most of the gains made by labor in America were made during this period.<p>The minimum wage does not naturally rise - it is a policy decision, one implemented under pressure from labor. And as labor&#x27;s political power has waned and capital&#x27;s political power has increased, minimum wage has stagnated.<p>Under our current system that heavily favors returning productivity gains to capital instead of labor, returning America to that global monopoly  (which would require the highly improbable destruction the industrial capacity of the rest of the world while leaving America&#x27;s untouched) would just turn the hypothetical gains of that monopoly over to the owners of capital.<p>Realistically, any attempt to return to the prior American monopoly would result in a massive regression in the American standard of living, through the destruction of purchasing power abroad for American goods and services (remember, we have a lot more people today than we did back then, and many of them - especially farmers - work in occupations that sell to other countries).<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anti-union_violence_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anti-union_violence_in_the_Uni...</a>')
