I am concerned though that burning CPU cycles on the proof-of-work uses battery life if the end-user is on mobile, without getting their getting any choice in the matter. What if, given an informed choice, they would have preferred an image CAPTCHA? (On the other hand, that could use more cellular data. Might be good to run the numbers on this too.)<p><i>even with a million users on one IP there won&#x27;t be tens of users signing up to some forum per minute</i><p>I think this is a bad choice of threat model. &quot;Some forum&quot; would likely be better off with simpler measures, like a hidden honeypot textbox: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;felipperegazio&#x2F;how-to-create-a-simple-honeypot-to-protect-your-web-forms-from-spammers--25n8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;felipperegazio&#x2F;how-to-create-a-simple-honeypo...</a>')
