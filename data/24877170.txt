Everything from work &#x2F; life balance to Ivy League schools, etc.<p>Everyone from an early age is fed a lot of information regarding all this stuff. Your parents, the ZIP code you grew up in, to the public or private places you were educated or dropped out from.<p>The truth is, it takes all kinds and success is defined 8 billion ways by 8 billion different people on this planet.<p>I think one thing that is interesting about tech (I don&#x27;t work in tech, and I&#x27;m not a programmer) is the entrepreneur &#x2F; start up culture. Maybe it has something to do with the cap nature of the beast (all you have to do is code and rent a server) that makes everyone bananas to be &quot;successful&quot; or a &quot;CEO,&quot; but I just don&#x27;t see this in other industries. Sure, other industries have entrepreneurs and people who start their own thing. But is it SO much different in this tech world. It&#x27;s a cultural phenomena. It&#x27;s more or less a function of time. No matter how hard I worked, I could never start a chemical refinery or build a car company. A new app? Function of time and sweat.')
