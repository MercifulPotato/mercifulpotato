Everyone at Gumroad is paid very well and should be able to afford the same.<p>This might be true for <i>everyone at Gumroad</i>, but I wouldn&#x27;t be so sure. You also seem dismissive (probably unintentionally) of one of the biggest problems we have in the US right now: health care and insurance is ridiculously expensiveâ€“especially for people with families who want to be self-employed or contractors.<p>A family of 4 who doesn&#x27;t qualify for ACA subsidies is going to pay $1,400&#x2F;month or more out-of-pocket for health insurance. And it goes up every year. Imagine paying 10%+ of your salary just for health insurance.')
