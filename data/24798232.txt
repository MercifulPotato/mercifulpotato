You temporarily reset the weights in your neural network, so you get a chance to &quot;jump out of the groove you&#x27;re in&quot;.  Whether that leads to a permanent change probably depends on what your patterns were before, and what new ways of thinking you come across during your trip. Basically were you in a local optimum before, and did you happen across a better (maybe even global) optimum during the trip instead?')
