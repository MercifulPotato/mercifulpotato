It&#x27;s putting profits over people. There are plenty of resources, but we don&#x27;t want to share, corporations want to capitalize, and enough of us don&#x27;t have the balls to stand up to our governments to demand better.<p>We as a society have decided that even though there is a enough for everyone, we should still apply capitalism to things necessary for survival leaving those who are poor barely able to survive.<p>No overpopulation argument works if you take poverty out of the equation.<p>You could argue that we pollute too much and that if population increased the earth would be devastated. This is true, but it&#x27;s not about the number of people, it&#x27;s about the damage per person. It stems from our failure to demand from our governments that all products created are biodegradable or recyclable.<p>Not enough housing? I disagree.\nHere is a quote from a fact checking website.\n&quot;Based on currently available numbers, there are about 31 vacant housing units for every homeless person in the U.S&quot;\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;checkyourfact.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;24&#x2F;fact-check-633000-homeless-million-vacant-homes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;checkyourfact.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;24&#x2F;fact-check-633000-homel...</a>')
