However I had to use the i915kms driver from ports as I could get the video working as it was with the previous version of FreeBSD that I was using (I can&#x27;t recall the version). These are the steps that I had to do after trying many i915kms drivers (both the basic one included and also the ones available from pkg):<p>1. Get the ports.<p>2. cd &#x2F;usr&#x2F;ports&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;drm-kmod; make install<p>3. Add: kld_list=&quot;${kld_list} &#x2F;boot&#x2F;modules&#x2F;i915kms.ko&quot; in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;rc.conf<p>4. Optionally install the `mesa-demos` package and run `glx-gears` to test acceleration.<p>I think there were some changes to the i915kms driver because the previous version I was using (non-stable) the driver was working absolutely fine. Hope that helps if you&#x27;re experiencing the same issue!<p>Edit: Blank lines between instructions.')
