As if people aren’t motivated enough and not doing overtime already, giving the best they can to make it work.<p>Yes, it’s the DEVs that write the bugs, but it’s hard to not get sloppy from time to time when there’s constant pressure to make progress and meet deadlines for the sake of meeting them.\nIt’s not DEV’s fault the intermediate deadlines apparently were just green coloured cells on an Excel sheet and did not include actual quality checks, or planning &#x2F; priority reviews to prevent quality issues and excessive overtime.')
