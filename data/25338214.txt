They matter immensely because of what they communicate. That&#x27;s my point. It seems plainly evident at this point that neither word is aiding communication, because we&#x27;re arguing about what the words mean, rather than the facts of the situation. A sentence saying she was fired and a sentence saying she resigned both miss too much of the situation to be called clear, honest communication, which matters.')
