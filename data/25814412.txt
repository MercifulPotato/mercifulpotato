They are separate on exactly the grounds you indicate — the author spends paragraphs supporting how Prop 22 is not turning out positively and then says welp, people have been bamboozled.<p>The bamboozling is the conclusion, not a premise of the article.  Such a conclusion is done out of kindness for the voters who passed this proposition as the actual ramifications are now becoming clear.  They either didn’t realize or didn’t care that we’d see incidents such as the recent firing of Von employees.<p>Easiest way to check if someone understood what they were voting in support of is to ask if they thought workers would be fired to be replaced with this new class of employee.  That’s why I voted no.  I didn’t understand how it would end up being rolled out reality and correcting ballot propositions is much more involved than an ordinary bill.')
