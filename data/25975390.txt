Despite being a regular advocate for dark skies in casual conversation, politics such as LED street lamp replacement, business decisions such as replacing low pressures sodium vapour floods in the company parking lot I have come to the conclusion that most people just don&#x27;t care or don&#x27;t get why it matters. I&#x27;ve heard responses like &quot;so close your curtains&quot; or &quot;it is safer with more light&quot; or &quot;the lights aren&#x27;t that bright&quot;.<p>You can see the distinctive cool white LED &quot;O&quot; of Apple Park from 20 miles away in a plane. Why? Just vanity? The huge amount of light bleed serves no functional purpose. Lights, lights everywhere lights. Lighting up nothing. You can buy an intensely bright fixture at Home Depot and just mount it up making any location bright as day, but 24 hours a day. LEDs may have actually made things worse because of their low cost per lumen and long operating lives that encourages more and brighter lighting.<p>I am out of step in wanting a world with less human noise and light. If I complain about how noisy I find the bay area and how I would love to punch the Harley rider who lives a block away in the throat the most common answer I get is &#x27;Wow, India and China are way louder&#x27; like that should make me feel better or unjustified in my complaint. In truth all it does is make me want to avoid visiting those places.')
