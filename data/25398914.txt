(Heck, these days on IPv4 even anything different than HTTPS can be problematic...)<p>-reliance on router firewalls is bad because they incentivize sloppy device security - the manufacturers should be instead liable when they are at fault for screwing it up (also, how many of these &quot;insecure IoT devices running ancient software&quot; are even able to run IPv6 ?)<p>source : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lafibre.info&#x2F;ipv6&#x2F;ipv6-le-firewall&#x2F;msg704095&#x2F;#msg704095" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lafibre.info&#x2F;ipv6&#x2F;ipv6-le-firewall&#x2F;msg704095&#x2F;#msg704...</a> (fr)<p>Incidentally, one of the &quot;big 4&quot; French ISPs &quot;Free&quot; didn&#x27;t even <i>have</i> an IPv6 firewall on its customers routers between 2008 and 2019, and it&#x27;s probably still opt-in :  \n4 months ago : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.answers.yahoo.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;index?qid=20200812110733AA8WakU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.answers.yahoo.com&#x2F;question&#x2F;index?qid=202008121107...</a> (fr)<p>So I guess that we&#x27;re going to see in practice the problems that having no IPv6 firewall causes (most customers not having any idea about what even <i>is</i> a firewall) as it gets more popular... and since Free this summer boasted about reaching 99% IPv6 coverage, and is enabled by default, and can NOT be disabled...')
