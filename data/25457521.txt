Also &#x27;air pollution&#x27; isn&#x27;t the listed cause of death so people have to make the extra step to link the huge number of knock on effects back to the cause. Even when you do there&#x27;s a lot of push back from well paid lawyers to argue that there&#x27;s no direct link between the pollution of their clients and the fact that communities near their factories die 5 years sooner than anyone else.<p>&gt; covid-19 hasn&#x27;t caused yet as many deaths but we quickly intervened ... Why can&#x27;t we, as a society, react with the same effectiveness to air pollution?<p>COVID is acute and new which means we haven&#x27;t grown systematically numb to it&#x27;s effects yet so there&#x27;s the chance for a very pointed response. Even now though there&#x27;s people arguing the same line as polluting industries, that the numbers are skewed and people with other conditions didn&#x27;t die because of COVID but should be listed as dying because of their heart disease&#x2F;respiratory problems&#x2F;etc.<p>It also helps that no one is in the business of COVID and in theory once the vaccine is widely available and COVID is just another occasional background illness things will largely go back to normal. To address pollution on the other hand you have to permanently make whole swaths of industry either vastly more expensive (and therefor less profitable) or practically eliminate them. Those get a lot of push back of course.')
