CentOS Stream will never get any major fundamental changes to the system like Rawhide does on a regular basis.<p>It&#x27;s technically rolling release compared to RHEL, but the window of acceptable changes is very small. It&#x27;s not like Arch and Rawhide and Debian Testing where major OS components can be swapped out under your feet.
