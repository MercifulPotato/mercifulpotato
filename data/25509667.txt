This is made worse because even though you may have a physical cartridge game, the actual save files are <i>on the machine</i>.<p>Personally I had a run in with this when I upgraded to a 3DS XL, and I didn&#x27;t check for dead pixels until after I transferred all my data. They <i>locked</i> the transfer feature for a week+ so I couldn&#x27;t go and get my device replaced for a week, and my data was held hostage on a machine with stuck&#x2F;dead pixels dead center on what is already a low resolution display.')
