They have to follow specific rules and laws to participate.  They cannot talk to workers. They can only ask questions to supervisors and inspectors only.  They cannot be disruptive.  I mean how would you like to be trying to count things and get interrupted by &quot;poll monitors&quot;?<p>That is what happened here.  The GOP poll monitors kept on breaking the rules and acting like asses.  And they were eventually kicked out, totally legally and according to the rules they signed up for.  And the Democratic poll watchers clapped, which may be &#x27;unseemly&#x27; but isn&#x27;t proof of &quot;elections irregularities&quot;.<p>The president, with the 1&#x2F;4 billion he raised, the full support of the GOP and their allies and supporters _at every level of every government_ and with the backing of the federal government were unable to raise a lawsuit that could convince even judges appointed by Trump.  If there was evidence of fraud that could sway the election they would have found it, period.  They didn&#x27;t, ergo it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>The reason people didn&#x27;t have confidence in the most basic aspect of democracy is because they have been lied to endlessly.  Without ANY knowledge of how the system works, they took these lies at their face value.  Many things were done to assuage those concerns, and they dismissed the evidence out of hand.<p>For example, Georgia.... does paper ballots counted by optical tabulators.  They did a by-hand recount.  The hand-counted totals matched the machine tabulation.  This totally rules out any computer or machine problems.  But people STILL bring up the &#x27;dominion changed the votes&#x27; lies.<p>And you are encouraging it with your irresponsible comment.  You&#x27;re feeding the lies, by encouraging a sense of &#x27;uncertantity&#x27; when there is NOT uncertantity. The GOP Secretary of State in Georgia just presided over 2 elections which delivered major Democratic wins.  Suggesting that he is &#x27;on the take&#x27; just illustrates the sheer desperation of the losers of this election will take to cast any shadow of doubt on anyone if it comforts the sting of their loss, even as they know that their wild accusations will never have an end, and now resembles a literal witch hunt.  When your cast of enemies has to grow to include the GOP leaders in the Senate, and the VP, both of who have endlessly protected Trump, then you really don&#x27;t have reality on your side.')
