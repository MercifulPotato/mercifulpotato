In the US, those things are pay on use.  In Europe, they&#x27;re done through taxes that everyone pays.<p>If you don&#x27;t have kids, that can be a substantial difference.  I do not, so I don&#x27;t have to pay into a college fund, or pay for healthcare for kids, or private school, etc, etc.<p>I think once you take it as a given that you pay for those things one way or another, it evens out a bit.  Probably slanted a little bit towards more pay in the US, but not by nearly the gap between a single 20-something SWE in the US vs the EU.')
