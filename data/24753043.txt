And that a generation had to avoid open playground for some time.<p>That is a huge impact from just one accident 34 years ago. Which happened far away from us. And also one of the reasons, why nuclear power is not liked very much in germany. Nobody wants a radioactive cloud on a bigger scale.<p>So I am not for turning all nuclear power plants off now, but as soon as they can be replaced by regenerative energy.')
