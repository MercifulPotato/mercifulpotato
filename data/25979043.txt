Item(by='bumby', descendants=None, kids=[25983876], score=None, time=1612103340, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25977891, text='&gt;<i>It&#x27;s also important to point out that men being (on average) physically stronger doesn&#x27;t equate to women being &quot;weak&quot;.</i><p>I’m not necessarily disagreeing with your overall point, but when you say “weak” are you still speaking in the physical sense? If so I can’t follow the above statement. Weak&#x2F;strong are relative terms. If you’re willing to say one is statistically stronger than the other, you are implying the other is statistically weaker. To not seems to be the type of wordsmithing used to avoid precise use of language. The reason I specifically put the “individual rights” piece in my previous comment was because I was hoping there was a basis outside the aggregate “average” argument that seems oblivious to individual rights.<p>I think the BJJ argument can actually be dangerous. Yes, it’s good for anyone to know self defense. But the vast majority of women won’t become skillful enough to overcome the (statistical) innate size&#x2F;strength disadvantage, particularly any man with training. They can if dedicated enough, but if they don’t it can lead to false confidence.<p>I think the real issue with the argument is that it only plays well because it’s using terms that are currently socially en vogue. Consider how it would come across instead of saying “men are statistically more likely to rape” you instead advocated for a double standard based on “people of X race are more likely to commit Y crime”. It can be statistically correct and still morally wrong to advocate for such policy because it lacks a nuanced view of the problem.')
