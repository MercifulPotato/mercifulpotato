Indoor anything is “unsafe”, as aerosolized transmission has been proven. Anything under a properly worn N95 doesn’t stop aerosols, and if anything will promote aerosols.<p>The idea that wearing a mask from the time you walk in the door to the time you sit down is somehow affecting outcomes is insane. People should know that walking into a restaurant carries some risk of infection and a mask isn’t going to change that.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.acpjournals.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.7326&#x2F;M20-5008" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.acpjournals.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.7326&#x2F;M20-5008</a>')
