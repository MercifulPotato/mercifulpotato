Work in a restaurant kitchen, on a fishing boat, as a logger, etc. If you don&#x27;t want to go that far, work on a similar project at home: build a house, grow a garden, learn to weld, and so on.<p>The physicality of such jobs will make you appreciate and regain a sense of &quot;real&quot; work using your body, without all the information economy knowledge work stuff crammed in. People aren&#x27;t just heads with bodies attached. Recommended books along this line of thought:<p>- Shop Class as Soulcraft<p>- Anything by Kerouac (he worked various odd jobs)<p>- Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance')
