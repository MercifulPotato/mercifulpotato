So do you think CNN is going to help &#x27;fan the flames&#x27; of the movement? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>&#x27;Anti Trust&#x27; is also a complicated word, almost a little to complicated for MSM cable news. It&#x27;s possible for watchers to understand &#x27;Privacy and Facebook&#x27; but it&#x27;s a struggle to get the plebes to try to think about such an abstraction as &#x27;anti trust&#x27;.<p>Those entities spend a fortune lobbying both sides of congress.<p>Without some popular focus and the press latching onto it like they did BLM, it&#x27;s going to be hard to get some kind of movement going there.<p>Even politicians that &#x27;care&#x27; about the issue are going to want to &#x27;pick their battles&#x27; and it might not be a while before someone starts knocking on that door.')
