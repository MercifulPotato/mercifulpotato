Generally if the mass is &lt; 2.5 solar masses it has to be a neutron star, and if it’s &gt; 5 it must be a black hole. Keep in mind this isn’t rigorous! The theoretical maximum for neutron stars is a little less than 3 solar masses, and the estimated minimum for a stellar black hole is much more empirical - I think the smallest known is about 3.5. There’s a lot of interesting physics between 2.5 and 5 solar masses - perhaps this is how we’ll discover “quark stars.”<p>I believe our detectors are not sensitive enough to detect the acceleration of normal stars in any physically plausible scenario - I think they would have to be accelerating way too fast to generate waves that are indistinguishable from noise.')
