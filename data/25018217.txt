Combined with the script being served from you own domain, blockers will think it&#x27;s a regular request and won&#x27;t block it. They usually use a blacklist to filter unwanted traffic (like to GA). As we are still working on Pirsch, we don&#x27;t have a documentation to explain the setup in more detail yet, but you should be able to find instructions somewhere.<p>[Edit] Okay, so it seems like blockers will catch that, see  \niamacyborgs comment. But we will provide a nice and simple backend integration which basically will do the same as the script, but is unblockable.<p>[Edit #2] Looks like it will only block cookies using this technique, so it should work as described.')
