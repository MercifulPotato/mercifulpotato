There is no question. Congress has a duty to #ProtectOurDemocracy &amp; #FollowTheFacts.&quot; [0]<p>Now I&#x27;m sure that is an out of context tweet and she probably didn&#x27;t literally mean &quot;Our elections [were] hijacked&quot;, but that would get Trump booted from Twitter.<p>It isn&#x27;t a serious argument to say that Trump is bad because his opponents can deduce he means to do secret evil so it is OK to out-of-context quote him or purposefully choose the least charitable interpretation but Pelosi can say that and get the opposite treatment. The current situation is not that unusual for losers of a US presidential elections.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;speakerpelosi&#x2F;status&#x2F;864522009048494080?lang=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;speakerpelosi&#x2F;status&#x2F;864522009048494080?...</a>')
