It’s been on pretty much continuously all this winter and last. The filter only needs replaced every couple months and I’ve only had to wash the base once. And it keeps our 900 sq ft NYC apartment at a comfortable 40-50% humidity. I think the OPs main issues could be fixed by just keeping a cleaner house.')
