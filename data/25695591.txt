Just look at how long it took Intel to scale up their 14nm capacity when it became clear the 10nm process wasn&#x27;t going to start working any time soon.<p>On the other hand, the added revenue would further cement TSMC&#x27;s position as leader in the process race.  Given the resources of so many customers pushing the leading edge, I don&#x27;t see how Intel could recover anytime soon.  Unless TSMC grows to become fat and complacent like Intel did.')
