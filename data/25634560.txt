The bed is a great place to train yourself to decompress and unwind.<p>- Absolutely destroyed my back. I&#x27;d build pillow forts around myself to compensate for increasing weak muscles.<p>- Hindered the ability to notice shifts in my mood&#x2F;difficulties in my routine.  Eg: I struggle to get out of bed these days.')
