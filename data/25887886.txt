The topic is very sensitive, so i need to ensure myself that this chat wont stored on any 3rd party server and it should be deleted after the recipients have read it.<p>Technical Details : Go server and Javascript client, communicating using websocket. The server wont store anything, it just acts as &quot;router&quot; to redistribute any message that it received to the rest of current online user. The client has heartbeat mechanism to tell the server that it is still active. Based on that heartbeat signal, the server will count current number of concurrent user.<p>You can launch your own instance simply by running the go executable. You can use it for personal use on home server or deploy it on VPS, making your own &quot;secret base&quot; on the Internet.')
