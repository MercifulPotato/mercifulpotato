The easy path would be to remain agnostic on which way is best. But that often, at least for me, results in design paralysis as I try to figure out that magic <i>best</i> way to organize a project or accomplish some task.<p>Instead, if I start with an opinion, I&#x27;m able to make immediate progress even if I end up refactoring down the road for some reason or another.<p><i>Of course</i> there&#x27;s no single write way to organize projects and write software.
