It&#x27;d be nice if there was a nice way to make this adaptive and use NNs only when throughput is low, but the nonlinearity of the distortions makes me think this would be really hard. [1] I know what I <i>don&#x27;t</i> want is for a normal conversation in an <i>uncongested</i> network to look unnatural or for facial expressions to get distorted unnecessarily.<p>Edit: [1] I meant to say doing a <i>mixture</i> of these (with the NN image as the &quot;base&quot;, with H.264 to improve accuracy) seems really hard. On the other hand, just a hard switch from H.264 to NN when quality degrades is probably quite practical?')
