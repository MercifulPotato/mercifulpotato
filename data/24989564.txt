Given Pi 4 has reasonable CPU and up to 8GB of RAM, the former is a shame. The full size HDMI port on Pi 3 was compatible with cables virtually everyone already owned.<p>A model in the range with 32 or 64gb fast storage on board would be great - The Pi is useless for many without purchasing an additional SD card for a boot volume anyway!')
