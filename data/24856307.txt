Back of the envelope, over 200 days in the last 3-ish years.<p>If your salt intake is higher than normal, and you don’t fast for extended periods of time, it’s not applicable.<p>In general everything about fasting becomes difficult when your electrolytes get outta whack. It’s been my experience that almost everyone who’s otherwise healthy, with ample access to food, and no experience fasting will confuse their body screaming ‘I need salt’ with ‘I’m thirsty’ —- In the developed world we almost never experience the former.<p>Too much water is just as bad as not enough.')
