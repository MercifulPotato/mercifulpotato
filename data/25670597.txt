You can&#x27;t use Signal without a cellphone... and cellphones are a privacy nightmare. I activated Telegram with a burner phone number, and I don&#x27;t have to keep the phone on to use Telegram on desktop or online. I never shared any contact with Telegram, and I added everybody manually. You don&#x27;t have to give your number to be added on telegram, you can use an @handle. A a lot of people among my friends are organically switching to telegram.')
