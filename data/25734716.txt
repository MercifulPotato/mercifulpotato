(I suppose there are some corporate filters which try to prevent accidental sending of sensitive information to unauthorised recipients, but that&#x27;s not the &quot;feature&quot; we are talking about here).<p>It is perfectly reasonable for a user to want to DM someone on an instance that has different moderation policies from their own, and it is equally reasonable to want to receive replies to those DMs.<p>If the specifications or implementations don&#x27;t allow that, then I suppose it has to be justified by saying that the DMs could be used for sharing copyright infringing material (or worse), and admins don&#x27;t want to run the legal risk of hosting that on their servers.  Legally, though, that doesn&#x27;t seem any different to operating a mail server, which don&#x27;t typically have Content ID matching systems on them.  Perhaps the implementation of end-to-end encrypted DMs would assuage some of these concerns a little.')
