A good part of climate science is not just mapping the statistics of a system, but analyzing those in terms of physics and chemistry to figure out what causes dynamism in the climate system.<p>The driving mechanic behind climate change theories is that we are changing the chemistry of the atmosphere, which is making the climate unstable. If you just look at the statistics through the lens of data science, it&#x27;s easy to write off effects as &quot;not enough data&quot;, but this is a simplistic view, stemming from not spending huge amounts of time learning and studying climate science.')
