It probably wouldn&#x27;t need much of a resistor to simulate minimal charging rates.<p>EV parking isn&#x27;t that premium or common where this would be valuable. Also, this kind of anti-social behavior is a good way to get your car keyed when someone rolls up and needs 10 miles of power to get home and sees a jerk in a non EV in the only charging spot.')
