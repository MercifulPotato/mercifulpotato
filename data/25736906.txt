The halting problem applies only to deterministic systems with infinite state. If you have finite state and determinism, you have to eventually repeat a state, or halt. Note that &quot;very large&quot; and &quot;infinite&quot; are not the same thing here.<p>Not being able to predict something for combinatorial or noise reasons is a more credible argument.')
