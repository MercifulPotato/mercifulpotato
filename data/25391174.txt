Item(by='hiram112', descendants=None, kids=[25391906], score=None, time=1607721680, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390593, text='&gt; Unfortunately many of these people vote against their own financial interests...<p>I get so tired of this poorly reasoned idea that continues to be spouted from the left as if it is gospel, and that the &quot;rubes&quot; are just not as enlightened as some journalist in New York or a javascript dev in Mountain View.<p>How exactly would voting for someone like Biden help the average working class voter in middle America?<p>* Tons more quota &#x2F; diversity based help that will re-distribute the already small amount of aid to people who are NOT them.<p>* Medicare for all and similar schemas: Ask them how Obamacare has worked out. It&#x27;s likely they now can&#x27;t even use any health services since they&#x27;re still paying premiums, but now have a $7K deductible for their family of four.<p>* Shoveling money from the right&#x27;s corporate masters to the left&#x27;s friends in the public unions, legal industry, big tech, etc. is not a net gain for these voters.<p>* Increased immigration and globalization that may very well increase the economy as a whole, but certainly won&#x27;t be trickling the wealth down to them.<p>* changes in the tax code that may raise or lower rates by a few points here and there, but have absolutely no effect on average working class voters who don&#x27;t pay much in federal taxes anyway.<p>* Green energy initiatives that will allow rich people who can afford it to virtue signal, but will raise the prices of gas, heating, electricity, etc. for everyone else.<p>Please let me know which actual policy changes that Biden and Co. can and will implement that would help these voters, but who are just too dumb to realize?')
