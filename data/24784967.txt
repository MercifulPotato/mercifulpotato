Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[24785262], score=None, time=1602736476, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24784912, text='Ok, I&#x27;ll give you a detailed breakdown. You said that three things were happening which in reality are not:<p>(1) that we &quot;realize the exact opposite [of what we say]&quot; — in reality, I tell the truth as far as I know it, because I respect this community (also, on what basis can you claim to read minds like that?);<p>(2) that we&#x27;re &quot;terrified what will happen if the public finds out how common it is&quot; — in reality, I&#x27;m confident that the community would be bowled over by how diligently we work on this, and my only woe is that half the commenters don&#x27;t want to hear me when I tell them how common it is (namely, that it&#x27;s <i>uncommon</i> relative to the insinuations that they love to fill the threads with, and that such insinuations are the harder problem to solve and place a much heavier burden on moderators);<p>(3) that &quot;the percentage of this stuff is absolutely massive&quot; — in reality, unless I&#x27;m wildly ignorant of my job, it&#x27;s tiny relative to the quantity of imaginary things people make up about it. The latter is the greater threat to HN. With real astroturfing and other forms of abuse, it&#x27;s possible to find evidence and take action. But how do you persuade the internet not to hurl shit-covered spaghetti everywhere? (Sorry for the unhinged metaphors, but it&#x27;s demoralizing to argue about this in HN comments, because none of the users making grand insinuations want to hear about that side of the problem, and when I raise it they say things like &quot;dang says astroturfing doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;.)<p>We have a rule that says you can&#x27;t manipulate voting or submissions on HN (because some people do that and shouldn&#x27;t). We have another rule that says you can&#x27;t smear others with insinuations of abuse without evidence (because some people do <i>that</i> and shouldn&#x27;t). There&#x27;s zero contradiction there. That doesn&#x27;t seem hard to understand.')
