It&#x27;s because you need factories to build those, and you can&#x27;t exactly own a factory in secret.<p>Piracy boxes are a thing. There are Android TV set top boxes loaded with all kinds of piracy software being sold at a premium, and they manage to do so without factories.<p>Similarly, you donâ€™t need a factory to build a Bitcoin wallet if (hypothetically) you can no longer use a general purpose computer for that - a microcontroller and hobbyist-level tooling is enough to build one.')
