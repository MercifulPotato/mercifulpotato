If I know I’m processing 100 items very rarely,[a] does it matter if my quick and dirty sorting (no pun intended) algorithm is bubble or quick sort? They both complete in a fraction of a second, and the user (generally) isn’t going to notice a difference between a single frame update delta or two.<p>[a] Key words are <i>100 items very rarely:</i> if you’re sorting many times a second (for whatever reason) or (relatively) large datasets, using a quicker sorting algorithm than bubble or insertion would make sense.')
