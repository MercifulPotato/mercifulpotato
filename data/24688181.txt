Item(by='justwanttolearn', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1601908962, title='Ask HN: Is Operational Excellence a thing of the past?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ve been recently asked to go work for a team that pursues in operational excellence. This means finding metrics for a balanced score card (modified to the company&#x27;s use), KPIs, etc. These metrics are super hard to determine and the data is always a dirty pull. The team also wanted to using MSFT&#x27;s workplace analytics to drive better insights to change culture but they&#x27;ve hit a political snag where we have a company culture that fears being measured. I want to drive change behavioural changes in our company (less hierarchy, less fear, more automation, more agile, etc). I love data and I want to actually have a measure in place that measures how well we execute our strategy (we do a poor job since IT&#x27;s always firefighting) but is this the wrong place or wrong thing to be focusing on? I could really make this team whatever I want it to be and I don&#x27;t know what the latest &quot;thing&quot; for this is. We&#x27;re a large, non IT company.')
