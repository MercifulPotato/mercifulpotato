A letter was sent around, I guess up and down the street of flats (I don&#x27;t know how far) which explained they were planning to have a blowout party for some significant reason and that things were likely to get very loud. There was contact info in case someone want to discuss the matter beforehand.<p>The party went off and it most certainly was very very loud. The place was one or two buildings down from me and I could hear it till ... rather late.  The meaningful thing, how ever, was they _had_ sent out a letter beforehand ... which was pretty courteous in my view. I guess no one complained (or the English are just so very polite...) and the party did not get shut down.<p>The parent comment did not state anything like this... so I think his response was quite reasonable. A one off thing that gets out of hand...ok, you can let that slide in the interests of getting along. But to do it again without any sort of heads-up or something of the sort is definitely a motivator for setting some boundaries. Perhaps people complained and the party thrower got defensive and so did it again out of spite. I infer from the language used they&#x27;re in America, so &#x27;freedom!&#x27; and all that crap....<p>So the reason your comment is getting downvoted is quite understandable; I suggest you try to really place yourself in the actual &#x27;shoes&#x27; of the parent poster and try to think of what they might have left unstated. The passive aggressive nature of the response is certainly something to point out, but then again, America is awash in guns.  And if I am right about America, then areas in America are quite varied (I am American) and so social&#x2F;cultural norms are different as well as urban&#x2F;suburban&#x2F;rural settings from place to place. There are lots of variables here to consider that have been left out, it seems.')
