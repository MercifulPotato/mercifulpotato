If you want to build your own in-house systems this way knock yourself out, but for anything published this is not at all safe as I explain in the linked LWN comments.<p>If anybody other than the subscriber has the private key they can (and should) revoke the certificate. With Let&#x27;s Encrypt you can even trivially automate this, fetch the new build, extract the private key, do the ACME revocation call with the signature from that key as proof and the certificate is revoked.<p>This is also a violation of the subscriber agreement for any public CA, it&#x27;s unlikely they&#x27;ll do anything about that beyond revoking the certificate, but they might, especially if you keep doing this after being told not to.')
