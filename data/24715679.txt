The type of diamine used is CO2-responsive, meaning that the substance’s behaviour can be controlled when it comes into contact with CO2. The diamine binds with the added CO2 and thereafter acts as a sponge to absorb the salt, which can then be separated. The entire process takes 1-10 minutes. Once the CO2 is removed, the salt is released again – allowing for the chemicals to be reused for several more rounds of desalination.<p>This article leaves a lot to be desired.<p>There is no compound called &quot;diamine.&quot; Diamines are a class of compounds. Without knowing which one is being used, there&#x27;s not much of a discussion to be had. We can say nothing about practicality or environmental impact, not to mention a host of other issues.<p>What may be happening here is the formation of a dicarboxamide, which then does something. That carboxamide formation is not likely to be reversible at room temperature.<p>The article has no link to the primary paper, where issues like this could readily be addressed, and there is absolutely no excuse to ever neglect to do so in 2020.')
