I&#x27;m mostly stating what I&#x27;ve observed.  Resources consumption clearly correlates with available resources, particularly in the government world of &quot;use it or lose it&quot; budgets.  The people who stick it out to teach in poorly funded school districts to seem to be the kind of teachers who care greatly about the kids.  You see this kind of &quot;we can&#x27;t do it all so we&#x27;ll do what matters&quot; even more strongly in police departments (well, the ones that don&#x27;t devolve into revenue policing that is).<p>Obviously (i.e. it should be obvious but based on the conversation thus far I have to cover my but) you can&#x27;t just skimp everywhere.  You need to give employees the resources they need to do their jobs (so that they can actually do them and the job isn&#x27;t soul crushing) without giving them so much that those resources get wasted.  It&#x27;s a really fine line to walk and I can&#x27;t think of any organization, pubic or private, for profit or nonprofit that has let itself become a resource wasting gravy train that has managed to stop the train without crashing and burning.  A business can go bankrupt.  For obvious reasons you don&#x27;t want your school district or water department to have a financial crisis that upsets things for a few years.<p>We live in a country where money that could buy school supplies is wasted on reupholstering auditorium chairs and administrator salaries because of people thinking you can blindly shovel money at problems.')
