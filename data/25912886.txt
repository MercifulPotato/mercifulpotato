Fundamentally the issue here is that Trump and his hangers on are absolutely willing to just lie their heads off, and his fans don’t seem to care one bit. If their fans will believe obvious bullshit such as the theory that the dead Hugo Chavez rigged an election for Biden with the help of Dominion, why would they believe what the states have to say about the election?<p>Heck, several counties have had to point out that <i>they don’t use Dominion machines</i>. If such basic facts can’t dissuade those who think this election was stolen, it’s not clear what would do it.')
