In no world can you be working 5 hours a day and be giving a shit, and so the conclusion is that very little meaningful work gets done at Google.<p>When I was a poker player, I learned that playing less meant earning more (per hour). Focus can only be sustained on the top-level for so long. When I played poker, I cared a lot.<p>When I started working later, I noticed the same thing. The quality of focus is simply less. It&#x27;s still valuable enough to produce something, but not to produce something top of line. Simply test yourself on the first hour with a difficult problem and on the eighth hour. Your first hour self will run circles around you.<p>So I can imagine that there are very attuned HR professionals that know this and see this and want to take advantage of this. Rare they may be, I&#x27;d be one of them if I&#x27;d work in the field.')
