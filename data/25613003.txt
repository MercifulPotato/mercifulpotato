The mud physics are quite good,m and you&#x27;ll certainly end up needing both all-wheel drive, diff locks and a healthy amount of winching to get around. The physics model isn&#x27;t perfect for on-road driving and the diff locks are not super realistic on hard surfaces, but it&#x27;s certainly the best off road simulation I&#x27;ve tried.<p>Taking an old truck on road tires slowly through mud and fording a river with water up to the windshield, while towing a garage trailer to unlock a remote service station is an odd kind of excitement, completely different from the high speed shenanigans in most driving games.<p>A controller is an absolute must, you have to be surprisingly delicate when feathering the throttle to navigate sticky mud. Full throttle just spins the tires and gets you hopelessly stuck.')
