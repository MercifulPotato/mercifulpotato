It&#x27;s the question of our days.<p>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that a well functioning authoritarian government (like China&#x27;s) has many <i>short term</i> advantages:<p>- very efficient in redirecting resources as needed<p>- the top concerns of the state (e.g. beat COVID, create a domestic semiconductor industry out of thin air) are addressed very efficently<p>- no politics or stupid &quot;check and balances&quot; to stall momentum (e.g compare to how many of Trump&#x27;s orders, even for Tiktok, were at least temporarily halted by federal judges)<p>HOWEVER- to have a well functioning authoritarian government you need a strongman at the top (Xi, Putin etc). This is my own anecdotal estimate, but I&#x27;d say there is at least a 25% change you get someone that wants to hold on to power and willing to sacrifice their people&#x27;s well being in order to do that (e.g. see China&#x27;s Great Leap forward and resulting famine [1])<p>So you get 1, 2 3 leadership successions that work out and prosperity keeps growing... but how far will your luck take you? Even if 3&#x2F;4 leaders are &#x27;good&#x27; chances of having 5 leaders all good are 23%, and to have 10 successful successions your chances are .75^10=5%.<p>In the long run, the authoritarian regime will collapse under its own weight. In the short term it&#x27;s kicking ass. Your call which one you want to pick.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Leap_Forward" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Leap_Forward</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Chinese_Famine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Chinese_Famine</a>')
