I believe it&#x27;s too early for that, but sincerely wish them success achieving those goals in the future and having multiple implementations is certainly going to help here.<p>&gt; eg “oh this problem comes up with GCC so use the LLVM backend “<p>The point of having multiple implementations is making the language independent of the underlying system. A programming language is an abstraction. The only way to test whether an abstraction is a good one is trying out how well it abstracts away various underlying systems. That&#x27;s why Rust needs ports to various architectures, OSes and compiler backends. Having GCC as a backend counts double here, because you get a few new target architectures for free with the port not just a new backend.<p>It&#x27;s of course much different with Python but I can still clearly see how having an implementation defining a standard hurts the language.')
