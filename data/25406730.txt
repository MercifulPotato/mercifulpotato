But that&#x27;s more our failure to set up a political system where only the best, skilled, most ethical, least selfish people can rise to the top. We are nowhere close.<p>Propaganda: I wasn&#x27;t putting words in your mouth intentionally, I see your point though. It was a description of how your words felt to someone making a critism of capitalism, that for me to dare criticise I must be propaganda-ised.<p>I don&#x27;t watch movies. I don&#x27;t have a TV. I don&#x27;t read newspapers. I read a lot but a broad spectrum of works from a variety of times.<p>I like your distinction between capitalism and corporatism, it&#x27;s a great point. I wonder though: Corporations exist inside of capitalism, so isn&#x27;t it a failure of capitalism to bring outrageous cooperations to heel?<p>I dislike your &quot;fermeted&quot; comment, you literally followed an accusation of fallacy from me to you, with a whole bunch of actually intentioned fallacy of your own?<p>Anyway, have a great day!')
