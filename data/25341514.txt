TLS can&#x27;t know the difference between a bad guy tampering with data and your crappy Internet mangling the data in transit, in either case the TLS protocol design says to &quot;alert&quot; bad_record_mac which your browser or similar software will probably treat as a failed connection, even if it happens mid-way through an HTTP transaction.<p>Because TLS guarantees integrity even if your fiber is a complete shit show, any TLSPlaintext records which do get from one end to the other are guaranteed to be as intended.')
