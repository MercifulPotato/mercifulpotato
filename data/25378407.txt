There&#x27;s more to it, but that&#x27;s the primary view I have of them. Gmail was good once, then got bloated and slow. Search was good once, but is now Search for Stuff to Buy. All sorts of other things were good once, and now don&#x27;t exist.<p>So when you said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what this is and <i>I don&#x27;t want to know</i>&quot;, I&#x27;m right there with you. I feel like I already know the part that will make me ignore it, so I&#x27;m not going to spend another minute on it. (Other than to trash it here, of course :)')
