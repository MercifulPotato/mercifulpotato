I’m sure there are other problems but Safari has generally improved with every release.<p>RE: extensions, I run Adguard for Safari and that’s pretty much it; it’s free and it catches most ads. Safari also has built in tracker blocking now, which is nice to have but more or less ignorable.<p>The nice thing about having Safari be your main browser is that you can reserve Chrome for development, and having a vanilla Chrome browser where content scripts don’t haphazardly log things to the console or block requests is really nice.')
