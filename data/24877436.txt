Item(by='daly', descendants=1, kids=[24877609], score=2, time=1603522050, title='Missing Element in EU Open Source Strategy', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='The EU published its Open Source Strategy<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;info&#x2F;sites&#x2F;info&#x2F;files&#x2F;en_ec_open_source_strategy_2020-2023.pdf<p>I have been doing free and open source software since 1997.<p>I read the EU OSS document. It is all very nice. I wish it would come true. But it misses a couple vital points.<p>The first point is that FOSS is generally led and developed by a very small number of people. These people have a focus on their particular problem. Most FOSS projects would be destroyed if all of the EU countries suddenly depended on a &quot;hobby&quot; project. They need to identify key projects that every country needs.<p>The second point is they missed the &quot;money question&quot;. I have contacted businesses, governments, charities, universities, and philanthropists to ask for funding. I have tried the &quot;patronage&quot; model and even asked developers to contribute. So far I have raised $0 dollars.<p>FOSS development is not free. I estimate that I have spent about $3000 (US) dollars every year for the last 20 years. I have to buy hardware, pay for a net connection, attend conferences, and pay for a website. My time spent on fixing things or adding features for other people accounts for $0 of that.<p>After 50 years I have the benefit of meeting and getting advice from world-class experts. For one project, an email exchange is reasonable. For a whole EU project, this does not scale. You need to find a funding model.<p>The EU does have some funding efforts, like the NSF in the U.S. Of course, the NSF has rules like: &quot;We will not give grants to projects that compete with existing proprietary products&quot; and &quot;We require a fiduciary organization (i.e. a university office to take 50% of the grant as &#x27;overhead&#x27;&quot;.<p>I tried to get companies to create a &quot;free accounting organization&quot; that would receive and manage grant money at minimal overhead. Even that failed.<p>So this document is pretty. But it is obvious that it is just a daydream.')
