Here in Germany, most homeless people could not even start to work because you need a legal residence to get a bank account (getting paid in cash or via check is illegal in Germany), so they cannot accept the Arbeitslosengeld (Hartz IV).<p>There are some initiatives in larger cities though where they provide shelters so that homeless people can have a legal postal address to get back on their feet.')
