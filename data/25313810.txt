You can be a brilliant jerk and still get along with some people. In a team environment however, there is no place for this.  Her exchange with Lecun, her threatening words and many of the way she puts forward her arguments. Even if she was in the right here, she can easily deal with it without doing what she did here.<p>So yes, there is more evidence for her toxic behavior than there is for her ability deal with disagreements professionally and work in a team environment.<p>TBH, I think this whole review things is just a reason for google letting her go. They were probably looking for a reason and she using her threatening (aka toxic) nature was just what google needed.')
