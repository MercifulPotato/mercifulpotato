She was terrified.  There easily could have been a large escalation.  After my intervention it hasn&#x27;t happened again, but the sort of judgement that leads to the stupidity in the first place, in my experience, cannot resist the lure to offend again, especially if the bad judger has been drinking.<p>I read the blithe attitude in comments like these, and I am sure there will be large escalations in the future.  FWIW, in AZ, this behaviour appears to be legal.')
