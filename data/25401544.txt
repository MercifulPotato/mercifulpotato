However, it&#x27;s understandable too - some material may not only be too unsavory for the content carrier&#x2F;publisher, but it may even be illegal in where the content is sold. A scholar working in Japanese Studies on the topic of media and sex was stopped at the Canadian border and interrogated when a search threw up documents containing the word &#x27;rape&#x27; on his laptop.<p>Activists, however, may have more leeway. Documentaries on animal cruelty and slideshows from anti-porn activists (to name two examples I&#x27;m familiar with) are much less hesitant - their goal is to rouse emotions and face-value judgements, so long as the viewer is primed to interpret the materials in the desired way.')
