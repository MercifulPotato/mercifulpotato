Spacemacs is a Vim for Emacs or inside Emacs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spacemacs.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spacemacs.org&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s quite powerful. And it can be argued that Emacs is highly extensible - because it&#x27;s written in a Lisp. Looking under the hood and hacking on the editor is a lot of fun and very informative. And also horrible and bad. But in a good way!<p>And almost completely unrelated: I very much enjoy the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs book and online lectures: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocw.mit.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;electrical-engineering-and-computer-science&#x2F;6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocw.mit.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;electrical-engineering-and-compu...</a><p>The video lectures were recorded in 1986!: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocw.mit.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;electrical-engineering-and-computer-science&#x2F;6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005&#x2F;video-lectures&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocw.mit.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;electrical-engineering-and-compu...</a><p>And they&#x27;re still amazing.<p>(But people all think very differently and what works for me may not be your cup of tea!)')
