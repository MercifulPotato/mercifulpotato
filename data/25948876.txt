Nothing is happening to the sources themselves.  It&#x27;s the work of taking those sources, stripping trademarks, building artifacts and distributing them as a near identical-clone of RHEL which is ending. Or at least, Red Hat doing that work at their own expense is ending.<p>&quot;Rocky&quot; and &quot;Alma&quot; linux are picking up that work themselves, nothing prevents that from happening.')
