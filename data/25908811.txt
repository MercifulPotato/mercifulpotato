They&#x27;re two very different categories, even if they are both subsets of &quot;words that can get you in trouble.&quot; As you acknowledge, the app in question was blocked for profanity, not slurs.<p>As parent comment says, profanity seems to be mostly a religious issue. I can say &quot;fuck&quot; on TV, or in my novel, or even in my Hacker News comment. But I doubt I&#x27;d get away with such language in church, or a show I wanted to sell to a Puritanical USA audience.<p>None of that has anything to do with slurs, which are much more widely agreed as &quot;wrong.&quot; You can reasonably expect a service or file extension that turned out to accidentally be a slur would get a lot more attention, unlike &quot;ASS&quot;')
