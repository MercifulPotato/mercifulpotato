In light mode additions are green and deletes are red - they&#x27;re obviously different. In dark mode additions are dark greenish grey and deletes are dark reddish grey - they&#x27;re really similar. That, for me, means I&#x27;ve lost a huge amount of information. It&#x27;s bad enough to keep me in light mode.')
