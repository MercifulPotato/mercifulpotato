We moved nearly 1000 customers over to Azure and in the end we are saving money due to simple things like reservations and being cost conscious. We also took over a company that used AWS and they were over spending on their hosting by almost 10-20x what they needed. Not because AWS is inherently expensive but because it was so mismanaged. I don&#x27;t think self hosting is worth it, when I can freely scale up or down machines in seconds on Azure and my price goes down, we have no fixed costs or maintenance worries. I think it&#x27;s a fair trade off.')
