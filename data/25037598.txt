But articles like these don’t provide any insight into those efforts, which are kept private.<p>Game development at large-scale is a mix of systems programming of the kind that Rust excels at and gameplay logic programming which has loose performance requirements and may be written by people who are not primarily coders. So you see a lot of codebases split between two languages, like a C++ core with Lua bindings or something like that.<p>If we see Rust adoption here I’m expecting it to be from a kind of skunkworks inside the company replacing specific, carefully-chosen systems with Rust code. At my company, that’s how it’s done, and it’s a very slow process. (I don’t work in the game industry, so all I hear is rumors from people that used to work in the game industry.)')
