So if you buy a cryptocurrency, you are automatically &quot;investing&quot; in that &quot;business&quot;. You don&#x27;t need Transferwise.<p>Bitcoin is the canonical example. The value investment argument for Bitcoin is that you think Bitcoin is (or will become) a good way to move money. You&#x27;re buying a scarce piece of that utility.<p>===<p>Some cryptocurrencies additionally have other utilities. Example, ethereum can be used to write very slow, shitty software that runs on the blockchain. So far nobody has come up with a super amazing use case for this, but theoretically, if somebody did this would dramatically increase the demand for ethereum tokens - (b) above.<p>A better example would be something like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;handshake.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;handshake.org&#x2F;</a> - a cryptocurrency that is trying to power a decentralized replacement for dns. Remains to be seen whether this can be done and will have adoption. These systems have all the problems of traditional startups, plus all the problems of low level protocol development, plus standardization problems, <i>plus novel math</i>.<p>However, I hope it&#x27;s easy to see the value investment argument for something like handshake: dns is valuable, dns has problems, handshake is trying to solve those problems, by buying hns tokens I&#x27;m buying a part of this network, and if they succeed demand for those tokens goes up.<p>Hope this helps.')
