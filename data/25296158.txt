You interview as many Americans as you can, and find 1 who can do the job. You fill 1 position with that American, and now start interviewing non-Americans and find 2 who you hire for the other two positions. This seems entirely within the intention of the H1B program.<p>Now suppose instead of 3 employees, you need 3000. You find 1000 Americans able to do the role, and hire 2000 non-Americans for the remaining roles. This still seems consistent with the intention.')
