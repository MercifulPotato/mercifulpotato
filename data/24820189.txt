Item(by='gumby', descendants=None, kids=[24820284], score=None, time=1603047193, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24819294, text='I am glad people are comfortable moving around -- that helps the economy balance and is one of the advantages for the US economy over, say, Europe&#x27;s.<p>That being said, I wonder if the impacts will be as described in the article.  Having lived in MA, NY, TX before moving to California (and having lived in Europe): the people who live in hyper conservative counties in CA are still used to conveniences and government services that don&#x27;t exist in places like Texas, Utah or Idaho.  I suspect they will change their new home states as much as they will relish the new environment.<p>(and statistically, as I mentioned in another comment: 100K net is about a quarter of a percent of California&#x27;s population -- hardly a significant number overall).')
