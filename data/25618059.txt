Not FOSS (Hard requirement *)\n  2.  Basic&#x2F;Free version doesn&#x27;t claim Firefox connector\n</code></pre>\n* I insist all my businesses use only FOSS for core functionality and we have on-premise capability (no &#x27;cloud&#x27;). As well as putting us in control of our own destiny (we have the talent) we can add specific functionality at-will and do contribute that back to projects as well as buying support contracts or making regular donations.')
