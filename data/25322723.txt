They launched around 2015. You would tell them about a customer service dispute you were having, and they would call the business on your behalf and recover the money you were owed. I used them several times, and they were able to recover money for me without me having to do much except give them the details.<p>It looked like they had a few million in VC money to blow through because it was free, and there were no minimums on the dispute amount, so it definitely couldn&#x27;t last. In Feb 2017, they added a 30% commission on recovered money,[0] and then later that year, they pivoted to focus exclusively on disputes with airlines,[1] which it looks like they&#x27;re still doing.[2]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us11.campaign-archive.com&#x2F;?u=8cdf4d62d0219f237ed96d7fb&amp;id=671af1130d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us11.campaign-archive.com&#x2F;?u=8cdf4d62d0219f237ed96d7...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailchi.mp&#x2F;dcc5d15901c4&#x2F;meet-service-20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailchi.mp&#x2F;dcc5d15901c4&#x2F;meet-service-20</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getservice.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getservice.com&#x2F;</a>')
