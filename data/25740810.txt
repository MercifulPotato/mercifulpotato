I passed my exam with 92% while also sitting four other university exams.<p>During that time, I realised that existing study tools and exam prep websites were using inferior learning techniques, and that&#x27;s why Zorbi was born.<p>We have a lot of stuff on our roadmap now including:<p>- Study Schedule Generation (do a quick knowledge quiz and tell us your exam date, we&#x27;ll tell you what to study and when to study)<p>- More question formats (MCQ, short answer)<p>- Analytics<p>- The ability to buy study kits directly from a marketplace (e.g. get Azure certified, Learn the most common chess openings, Learn basic Japanese)<p>- Integrations with Notion and Chrome<p>- Lots of stuff in the works to mitigate the demotivating factors that tools like Anki have :)<p>Our mission is to build a full-featured study tool that people ACTUALLY want to use (Combining the power of Anki with the simplicity and flexibility of Notion)<p>Let me know if you&#x27;re pursuing an AWS certificate - happy to help in any way possible.')
