So, pardon I should have been more clear.<p>If you choose to believe what your side tells is truth that&#x27;s fine.  I just have a different view and if i have money and want power i am going to use it either solo(ly) or collectively to get what I want.  Look at what Peter Thiel did with his money cause of the axe he had to grind with Gawker.  He paid for Hulk Hogan&#x27;s legal defense to annihilate Gawker.  I&#x27;m sure other money&#x2F;power bags do similarly and lots in politics.  So and for me that is why I believe all politics is mumbo jumbo spun up by billionaires to win; whatever it takes!')
