It can respond quickly, has a huge weapons load, and combined with targeting pods, can just sit above a fight plinking targets. It&#x27;s loiter time is much better than 90% of the fighters over Afghanistan.<p>The idea of getting down in the weeds (below 1K AGL) is not how CAS is done anymore. It&#x27;s extremely rare to get that close. It&#x27;s not how the A-10 is typically used.')
