IMO, that community is still learning how to incorporate Python&#x27;s best practices to cater their very specific needs.<p>For example, if you&#x27;re writing a plotting library geared towards data scientists, you&#x27;re almost forced to pick brevity over verbosity even if that means violating some of Python&#x27;s core philosophies. Data scientists usually come from non-compsci backgrounds and almost 90% of the codes they write, don&#x27;t go to production. So, they usually prefer tools that help them get the job done quickly and they write tools following the same philosophy.')
