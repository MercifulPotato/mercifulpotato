Can you confirm the general workings of the Network Load Balancer?<p>It seems like it&#x27;s basically doing NAT to take client:port &lt;-&gt; server:port to client:port &lt;-&gt; instance:port, including adjusting instance NAT mappings so the outgoing traffic gets NATed back?<p>Sort of like direct server return load balancing, but weird because the instance doesnt see the service IP and NAT takes care of it, somehow?<p>In that case, yeah, you either need to have a rfc1918 service address mapped for each public service address or just use the public address.<p>Elsewhere in thread, it sounds like it&#x27;s possible to set this up using the public address but kubernetes doesn&#x27;t like that; in which case, it seems appropriate to fix kubernetes.')
