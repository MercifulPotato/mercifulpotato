(with intel offerings)<p>They need to stop ceding the desktop game market to windows&#x2F;amd&#x2F;intel. When Catalina dropped it remove a lot of software,  productivity, utility, and games, had many examples where they no longer ran. Worse some developers just wrote off the platform.<p>Even Apple&#x27;s M1 debut could not line up more than two or three known developers. Most of it was from developers people had to resort to google for and even then some didn&#x27;t show up in search lists.<p>No, Apple&#x27;s problem with the Windows platform is and has always been software. Apple never seemed keen on pushing the Mac as a platform with iPhone and iPad being the focus on so many levels. Now that they have a truly impressive offering we have to hope they go recruiting developers to the platform because Rosetta won&#x27;t be here forever and it doesn&#x27;t solve the availability issue.')
