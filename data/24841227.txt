I&#x27;m not talking about genius 10x engineer controversy or anything like that.<p>I&#x27;m talking about the difference between someone transitioning fields fresh out of a 12 week boot camp and someone with a computer science degree, full stack experience, and knowledge of what&#x27;s going on under the hood. Even when you see many years of experience on somebody&#x27;s resume, it&#x27;s really really hard to tell what that means.<p>It&#x27;s the combination of a really wide range of skill and a really big difficulty assessing that skill from just the resume. So the interview really has to do heavy lifting in this field.<p>Compare that to my partners field, where there&#x27;s a licensing board, the job duties are pretty much the same anywhere, and all you really need is quick check of is this person sane, is their license and training up-to-date, and do their references check out. Even in that field, you can imagine the interviews being way more extensive if there wasn&#x27;t a license requirement and mandatory regular training. It would be like a lawyer having to pass the bar exam at every interview, instead of being able to say that they&#x27;ve passed the bar exam.<p>(This is all coming from somebody without a CS degree who transitioned into the field, so I&#x27;m really really not proposing we do gatekeeping. I&#x27;m just acknowledging that without gatekeeping, we effectively have to pass the bar exam at every interview.)')
