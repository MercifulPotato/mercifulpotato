Horrors of war are exactly what makes people shoot first and think second.<p>I think that the core reason people are opposed to this is because it just feels unfair. It is. The side of war that has the drones is much stronger than the opposition. But historically, mercy has always been the business of those who&#x27;re so strong that they&#x27;re sure in their victory and don&#x27;t feel threatened. People who are afraid and desperate are inevitably much more cruel.')
