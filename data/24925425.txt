For the vast majority of the world where legacy (or at least not-programmed-using-super-modern-standards) systems are still in play, clarity is the most important factor in software.  What happens when a legacy system is actually returning the number of <i>seconds</i> since epoch versus <i>milliseconds</i>?  What if they&#x27;re returning ticks (looking at you .NET...) because nobody realized ticks are inconsistent across different systems at the time the system was written?<p>I don&#x27;t think you can get any more clear than an ISO timestamp (WITH time zone).  Unix timestamps are great and efficient, but I personally value the absolute clarity of ISO above all else.')
