Item(by='chrisdalke', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601856688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24681698, text='Yeah, this is the source code: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;URSolarSplash&#x2F;Telemetry-Server" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;URSolarSplash&#x2F;Telemetry-Server</a>. The version uploaded there is transmitting at ~4hz but we cranked it up to a much faster transmit loop when necessary. A few interesting files:<p>The main server loop: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;URSolarSplash&#x2F;Telemetry-Server&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;main.py" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;URSolarSplash&#x2F;Telemetry-Server&#x2F;blob&#x2F;maste...</a>\nThe device implementation for our hand-rolled serial protocol: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;URSolarSplash&#x2F;Telemetry-Server&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;server&#x2F;devices&#x2F;StatelessTelemetryNodeDevice.py" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;URSolarSplash&#x2F;Telemetry-Server&#x2F;blob&#x2F;maste...</a><p>In classic &quot;college engineering project&quot; fashion, the project is rather disorganized and very specialized to the technology we used on our boat at the time. Our telemetry server had an in-memory cache of latest data points which were relayed over serial with all the telemetry nodes. We used the telemetry system to carry throttle and all other control signals for the boat. We replicated all the data points to a secondary server running on a shore computer, so we had two separate sources of data logs.<p>I will note that since building that system, my philosophy has changed several times -- Today, I would likely not roll our own telemetry protocol, instead using something like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;msgpack.org&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;msgpack.org&#x2F;index.html</a> or going all-in and using ROS on a larger project.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in chatting more, feel free to send me an email (my username @ gmail). It&#x27;s always great to see others go through the same experimental process with telemetry and data collection systems! (Also, check out bps.space on youtube, who has done a lot with telemetry on model rockets.)')
