The upshot of this change as a DM is that you can plan out encounters differently. Feel like your first-level characters aren&#x27;t getting enough of a workout? Throw a CR 3 or 4 encounter at them. I ran Curse of Strahd as my very first 5th Edition campaign, and there was an encounter at the end of the early section where I&#x27;m like, they already lost one character earlier in the dungeon, this is a straight-up TPK. But they handled it fine, although they used about a day&#x27;s worth of abilities&#x2F;spells that recharge with a long rest in a single encounter. That&#x27;s where I started to get a much better feel for how encounter balance works in 5e.')
