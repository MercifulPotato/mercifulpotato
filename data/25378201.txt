Being tracked by advertisers is just part of the problem, the other is ads are a horrible business model.<p>The best case for content creators is that they have to worry about upsetting their advertisers and them pulling their ads.<p>The worst case is that content creators turn into traffic farms with click bait titles and shallow content.<p>The worst case for society is the use of AI to pull people into spending more and more time on websites and redicalising them into conspiracy theorists or worse.<p>This is all due to the advertisement model as opposed to paying directly for the content we consume. Most bad incentives would disappear and creators would focus on the quality of their content.<p>So Brave &#x27;removing&#x27; adverisements that track you, if that is even truly possible with regards to fingerprinting, just fixes a small piece of the problem and in a way that thinks like uBlock Origin are already doing anyway. And something that would already be fixed by not having the ad model in the first place.')
