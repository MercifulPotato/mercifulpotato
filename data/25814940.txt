Item(by='dgudkov', descendants=None, kids=[25815035], score=None, time=1610917457, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810245, text='They author makes a few good points, but I find the author&#x27;s critique of Yubikey weak:<p>&gt;Cost. The average YubiKey is £50...<p>If that&#x27;s too expensive for ensuring your internet security, then either you underestimate the risks, or undervalue your information. If a Yubikey cost 10 times more it would still be a bargain.<p>&gt;Usability. Buy a device, register it, install the app, configure it, find the setting in the website, enable it, hope your machine has the right sort of USB ports, press the button at the right time.<p>Pressing the button at the right tight was a joke, right? Although, I admit it may be challenging for people with disabilities. Websites making it hard to find 2FA settings is not a Yubikey&#x27;s problem, it&#x27;s a website problem. Setting up a Yubikey is rather straight forward too. The main issue is the inability to clone a Yubikey programmatically, but that&#x27;s the price of security.<p>&gt;Convenience. My YubiKey is on my keyring. My keys are in my coat...<p>That&#x27;s can&#x27;t be serious too. I won&#x27;t even elaborate on this.<p>&gt;Risk. YubiKeys have no password lock of their own. At least my crumby Android has a fingerprint lock to prevent people getting my 2FA tokens. But if you’ve stolen my laptop and the YubiKey is plugged in, then you’ve got the keys to my kingdom.<p>That&#x27;s actually the only valid point I somewhat agree with. Again, this is largely mitigated by developing the right habits. You don&#x27;t leave your car keys hanging in your car&#x27;s lock after leaving the car in a parking lot, right? Then why do it with Yubikey? If developing a new <i>minor</i> habit represents a problem, then either you underestimate the risks, or undervalue your information.<p>An additional password&#x2F;fingerprint protection would be nice though. I agree on that.<p>&gt;Support. WebAuthn is a great standard – but only a few sites support it...<p>Again, this is not a Yubikey&#x27;s problem. It&#x27;s a website problem.')
