There are many places that aren&#x27;t walkable simply because they are frozen for most of the year.<p>Which places are you thinking about? I&#x27;m from a place that&#x27;s quite cold during the winter (-15C some days) plus can have quite a bit of snow.<p>I don&#x27;t find cold places to be as unwalkable as hot ones.
