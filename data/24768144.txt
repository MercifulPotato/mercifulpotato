Item(by='eitland', descendants=None, kids=[24771858], score=None, time=1602612692, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24765751, text='&gt; Sorry for the snarky comment but that you can clearly see the promoted KRunner search box flickering and reflowing in the promotional video is exemplary for the quality differences between mac, windows and linux desktop environments.<p>You don&#x27;t need to be sorry, just give me slme freedom when I answer, I&#x27;m not tryingnto be snarky but to explain something extremely important :-)<p>I used Mac for three years. In my opinion it had some extremely weird behavior by default (CMD-tab couldn&#x27;t switch between instances and to make matters worse there is no configuration option or tool you can use to get sane behaviour.) And bugs:<p>- opening a dialog in one browser window would lock all windows from that browser. Good luck looking up the documentation for where the files you are supposed to upload are without either closing the upload dialog or opening a different browser.<p>- keyboard shortcuts vary wildly between apps: In one app CMD - Shift - leftarrow selects tobthe start of the line. In Safari however it meant go back. Guess how I still know after 8 years. Yes, filling out forms and losing everything because I wanted to select a lkne of text.<p>Windows also often used to drive me mad. It is better now but the performance tax when compiling is still 30%! And even their own dotnet applications use 3 seconds to start on their OS vs 127 ms or something in a virtual Linux machine on top if that Windows box.<p>Crazy bad performance and latency issues and insane keyboard shortcuts are UX problems just as  well as flickering and reflowing.<p>KDE isn&#x27;t worse. Just different. For some of us it has already been the least annoying option for years already.')
