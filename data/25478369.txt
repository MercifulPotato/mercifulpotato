If we assume that people&#x27;s compensation is based on the value they generate for an organization, then what you are asking is basically &quot;can a million warehouse workers together in a collective be as effective as Jeff Bezos at producing value for Amazon?&quot; Alternatively, you could ask &quot;can a given warehouse worker given one million times his current compensation add as much value to Amazon as Jeff Bezos can?&quot; It&#x27;s quite possible that the answer to both of those questions is no, and if Jeff Bezos is generating a million times more value than the average warehouse worker for Amazon with his decision making and actions then it is not an issue that he is being paid a million times more than a warehouse worker.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that what warehouse workers are being paid now is &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;reasonable&quot;, but I do think that trying to establish some fixed ratio between what a warehouse worker makes and what Jeff Bezos makes is sort of a silly exercise. Additionally, if you think that comp shouldn&#x27;t reflect value added to an organization, then I would be interested in hearing what you think it should be based on.')
