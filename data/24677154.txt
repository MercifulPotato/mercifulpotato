I also had significant success by permanently alleviating the major symptoms of ADHD (like bumping into walls, not cleaning room, not being able to pay bills on time) with 1 trip of LSD about 8 years ago. I don&#x27;t even drink coffee, and I&#x27;m getting by with the occasional bouts of anxiety which I can deal with separately. I also occasionally do Ayahuasca for trauma&#x2F;childhood healing work - which I suspect many people with ADHD have.<p>I found it weird that people can get banned for talking about their anecdotal experiences with psychedelics on the ADHD subreddit too. Seems like some people are more comfortable being with the ADHD community and sticking with the status quo regimens, than actually doing something completely new.')
