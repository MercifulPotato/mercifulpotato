The 90+% of non-dangerous individuals being detained should be thankful that we&#x27;re able to keep the &lt;10% off the streets.<p>Actually, that probably doesn&#x27;t go far enough. We could probably get away with 95-99% collateral damage if we knew we were keeping a single extra dangerous person safely behind bars. It&#x27;s just people&#x27;s lives we&#x27;re throwing away after all. What we need is to start arresting people sooner. As soon as they&#x27;re suspected of a crime just throw them in jail so that they can&#x27;t escape while we finish the investigation. We&#x27;d probably have better than anticipated performance because with the bolstered confidence in our police force more people would be willing to call in suspects and trust that something would be done about their perceived misdeeds.')
