Downvotes mean that someone doesn&#x27;t know how to respond verbally&#x2F;textually, or they feel the comment detracts from the discussion. Or both.<p>Frankly some of my best comments have been downvoted. If there&#x27;s nothing obviously deficient and no one offers a correction, I consider it possible that it was because it threatened someone&#x27;s worldview. People will go to great lengths to protect their worldview, downvoting is nothing on that scale.')
