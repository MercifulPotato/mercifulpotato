Setting up Chrome Remote Desktop requires installing a separate package which Chrome downloads for you.  When it&#x27;s enabled, there are indeed two always-running processes located under &#x2F;Library&#x2F;PrivilegedHelperTools&#x2F;ChromeRemoteDesktopHost.app, which are apparently launched thanks to &#x2F;Library&#x2F;LaunchAgents&#x2F;org.chromium.chromoting.plist.  But those weren&#x27;t running before I set up Remote Desktop; I imagine they were installed as part of the package and didn&#x27;t exist before.<p>If I disable Remote Desktop againâ€¦ well, it doesn&#x27;t actually delete the LaunchAgents plist or ChromeRemoteDesktopHost.app.  That&#x27;s rude.  But it does make the processes stop running.<p>(To be totally clear, Chrome&#x27;s updater <i>does</i> run in the background, though not all the time.)')
