This is why most companies look for a culture fit more than a skill fit, because it&#x27;s easier to beef up a good hire&#x27;s skills than it is to get someone to have healthy communication, empathy, and team working skills towards their employees.<p>(Technically, team working skills are optional.  Not all projects need it as unusual as that sounds.  If they have good communication skills, then they can work well with other teams, which is what specialists need to know as they&#x27;re often a team of one or two.  Eg, I&#x27;m a data scientist and most of my career I&#x27;ve been a team of one.)')
