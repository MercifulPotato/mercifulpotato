As a non-American, when reading news from the US, I use a few different sources with different political leanings. To say there are 2 realities in America is putting it lightly. It&#x27;s like watching two unrelated movies about the same theme&#x2F;place, but with vastly different histories that resulted in each reality. Almost like having two cultures, two countries. I don&#x27;t know what point I&#x27;m trying to make but it is really unnerving to watch. It seems that the media in America has zero integrity and face zero consequences.<p>Maybe it is social media&#x27;s fault. Maybe, just maybe, social media and information overload (which reduces critical thought in that moment) is the problem. Nevermind propaganda &amp; conspiracies - just the bubble effects + overloaded conflicting information causes some kind of mental disorder but on a national scale. Too much nonsense being internalize and associated with, on a weekly basis, at some point America will have to ask itself if it is all worth it (social media, 24&#x2F;7 news &amp; streaming (and not to mention porn and the warping of minds)).<p>Maybe it is just a result of your political system, that this was always the outcome, because you only have 2 sides. Our world and human life&#x2F;culture cannot just be boiled down to 2 options. There are so much complexity, nuance and scope context that gets ignored if you are forced to pick 1 of 2 options.<p>Maybe it is just a result of your economic system &amp; regulations and related social structure &amp; social programs. Maybe, just maybe your people are so badly squeezed to live decent lives (esp when it comes to wages&#x2F;labour vs the cost of living and your bizarre take on healthcare). Maybe it is the greed and tax system favouring &quot;the already rich&quot;. Maybe it is because your political system has too much money flowing through it (much of your political practices are illegal elsewhere).<p>How can you convince a group of people that they are wrong or doing the wrong thing? When the battlefield is rooted in idealogical is very difficult to convince people otherwise (see religions). Trying to convince the people that invaded your capitol will be fruitless. Punishing them will be fruitless too. Nothing you do will change their minds, cause their minds have been warped to believe in a different reality to what the  rest of the world sees.<p>All I know is that America has a lot of reflecting to do to find&#x2F;re-find your national identity and to decide if the dragon you&#x27;ve been chasing is the right thing. I truly hope you can find a way without thousands of people dying in civil wars etc (nevermind covid).')
