It&#x27;s the city that approves zoning for a huge number of offices and then refuses to allow more homes. The homeowners reaping these massive rewards are who vote in favor of the housing shortage.<p>There&#x27;s easy ways to deal with the down sides of increasing property values. Delay the payment to sale or even tax the value from some number of years ago.<p>&gt; Moving is hugely disruptive to people&#x27;s life<p>The housing shortages in CA are doing this to renters and anyone else that&#x27;s forced to move. Older couple that can&#x27;t handle stairs, growing family, etc.<p>Prop 13 is a horrible way to address any of these problems.')
