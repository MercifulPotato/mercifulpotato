Lit fundamentally targets templates with HTML output. Which is great for what it is. But the thing JSX offers that nothing else does is:<p>- return values are a data structure, so they’re render-target&#x2F;render-implementation agnostic<p>- it’s compile time only&#x2F;effectively a macro, so the compiler can choose how to render subtrees<p>I love the “it’s actually part of the language not a build tool” part of lit, but it can’t satisfy those other goals without giving up its core selling points.')
