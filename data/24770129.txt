Things that haven&#x27;t been seen as &quot;scarce&quot; in the past are becoming more and more likely to be forced into scarcity.  We&#x27;re not worried about superfluous goods (concerts), but goods like housing &#x2F; food are not superfluous (one could even argue the same thing about certain electronics).<p>Other commenters have gone into it, but this is about forced scarcity vs need.  Incidentally, it&#x27;s also similar to why workers have trouble negotiating individually vs as a group.<p>The gist of it is that those in power &#x2F; wealth have the ability to outlast any single poor individual.  You don&#x27;t want to buy a house, toilet paper, or a nintendo switch right now?  That&#x27;s fine, I&#x27;ll keep buying them till you or some other chump gives up.  I have so much money that it doesn&#x27;t really matter how long you decide to be frugal and wait.  You want to strike?  That&#x27;s fine, you&#x27;ll be back soon enough when you need to pay for something or keep your family alive.  I have enough to outlast you.<p>Had we pumped this money into the actual working class economy I wouldn&#x27;t be worried.  But instead we siphoned off more working class dollars under the guise that inflation isn&#x27;t real.  It is, and future generations are going to pay dearly for our naivety.')
