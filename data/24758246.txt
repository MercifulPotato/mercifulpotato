I thought at least the optimistic take on masks was that much of the COVID virus that an infected person sheds isn&#x27;t loose individual particles, but inside respiratory droplets that are <i>much</i> larger than the virus itself. Like if I&#x27;m spilling lemonade, the sugar molecules in the lemonade are extremely small, but most of them are in solution in the liquid and not very much sugar would tend to pass through something that didn&#x27;t allow much liquid to pass through.<p>So I thought that while the masks can&#x27;t block the virus particles, they can often block liquids in which most of the virus particles are present.')
