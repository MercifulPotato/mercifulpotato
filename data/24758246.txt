I thought at least the optimistic take on masks was that much of the COVID virus that an infected person sheds isn&#x27;t loose individual particles, but inside respiratory droplets that are <i>much</i> larger than the virus itself. Like if I&#x27;m spilling lemonade, the sugar molecules in the lemonade are extremely small, but most of them are in solution in the liquid and not very much sugar would tend to pass through something that didn&#x27;t allow much liquid to pass through.<p>So I thought that while the masks can&#x27;t block the virus particles, they can often block liquids in which most of the virus particles are present.<p>edit: the USA Today article that someone else posted in this thread suggests this is broadly right, e.g.<p>&gt; The virus attaches to water droplets or aerosols (i.e. really small droplets) that are generated by breathing, talking, coughing, etc. These consist of water, mucus protein and other biological material and are all larger than 1 micron.<p>&gt; “Breathing and talking generate particles around 1 micron in size, which will be collected by N95 respirator filters with very high efficiency,” said Lisa Brosseau, a retired professor of environmental and occupational health sciences who spent her career researching respiratory protection.')
