When I do, I&#x27;ll jump on the computer, chat a bit, and then remind them &quot;I don&#x27;t use FB on my phone, so if I&#x27;m not near a computer reach me @ XXX-XXX-XXXX or name@example.com&quot;.  Everyone I&#x27;m in contact with has at least a phone number or email address.<p>Now, I&#x27;m 35 so not really in the age group that has 10 group chats, each with 10 people, that have all been going on for many years.  You might be in a demographic where that happens more often.<p>Even so, consider this even though it&#x27;s not exactly what WhatsApp gives you; it might be useful&#x2F;healthy to reject the FOMO and half-disconnect (still keeping yourself available, but on fewer services).')
