Thefts got waay worst after lost of security then Covid lockdown. They had a security guard on a some sort of tricycle Segway before. Felt safer, seniors shopping no problem. Then security left and things worst. I remember the complaints from the long time long haired POC clerk BUT shelves were full. Then Covid. The last time I was there, I was shocked at the empty barren shelves. Franklin store also hit hard. And the poor clerk this time new face, probably temp, had the same sad, what can we do? Absolute impunity. Seniors and poor shoppers suffer; people discarded because they don&#x27;t make the headlines. People who run the show or like to talk or shout BS, don&#x27;t even visit the Tenderloin except probably for a PR shoot. As for the addicted, mentally ill and homeless, we see them suffer too, everyday. Well at least they can ride MUNI for free. Suffering all around, unless you&#x27;re in a gated community or outer districts. Money won&#x27;t solve the problem. Back in the day, we had 5150 at least. Can you imagine running a business now in this environment? Raising children? So much for the &quot;radical change to how we envision justice&quot; Gee I wonder why businesses board their shops with all this overflowing peace, love and compassion in the city? Well, at least not the tall multi million luxury condo skyscraper where the former Goodwill stood.')
