Although you think you are arguing against me, I think you are supporting my point.<p>When you design and it works - that is what I am calling applying the scientific method personally.  When you test other&#x27;s papers you should have a 100% confirmation rate, unless you are making an error in methodology.  It seem to me that you did not find that.<p>I&#x27;m not raising my standards high.  When I have not personally verified something, I would say - that I haven&#x27;t verified something.  I just wouldn&#x27;t say &#x27;I know&#x27;.  This a statement of reality - it is not a standards thing.  There is no faith involved.<p>But most people, it seems to me, would take it all on trust and step out to say &#x27;they know&#x27;.  I would say their standard are too low.  That they are acting on faith - they are believers.<p>Thanks again for your comment.')
