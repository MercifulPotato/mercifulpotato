To be honest, I find the second one out of context (and a bit robotic&#x2F;pedantic). Reasons:<p>- sure, 27% may look like a decent increase, but what was the metric you guys used? How many users you have? One cannot put all of this info in a resume of course (because it&#x27;s a resume!) so please don&#x27;t just drop a 27% there as if it means a lot<p>- I can imagine that the goal of the team&#x2F;company was to &quot;increase the user engagement&quot;, even perhaps &quot;increase the user engagement by X%&quot; and the product team thought &quot;alright, let&#x27;s refactor our front-end in React; no idea if it will bring an increase of X% or X&#x2F;2%, but let&#x27;s do it&quot;. But it&#x27;s impossible to say that React (or any other tech) will bring you an increase of engagement in %X exactly. You just don&#x27;t know that number, the number comes after; you may have some hypothesis but that&#x27;s all. So, what you are actually telling me is this: &quot;hey, we wanted to increase our user engagement by some percentage and so we refactored our front-end in React. Later on, our analytics tool told us that the user engagement increased by 27%.&quot; Again, you weren&#x27;t aiming for that number, it just happened.<p>- you are not going to get hired for that 27%. Imagine there&#x27;s another candidate that says &quot;Increased user engagement 89% by refactoring our front-end experience in React&quot;. What now? Is him better than you? Again, context is king, but you cannot put that much context in a resume.')
