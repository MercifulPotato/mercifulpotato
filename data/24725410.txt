From a developer perspective, it was a lot more miserable to work with than Stripe. Other projects I’ve worked on have had a similar motivation for not using Stripe.<p>Annoyingly, the cost of implementing the replacement and getting it working with React Native (which involved creating native modules for iOS and Android) ended up costing them as much as several years of fees. Also the client was a startup that went bust, so they never really got the value out of it that they hoped.')
