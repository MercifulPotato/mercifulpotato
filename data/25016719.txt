The API is tiny, but powerful, and will give you the tools you need to create reactive views that update to state changes.<p>The major downside to using highly unopinionated frameworks like Mithril is that the burden of project organization is on you. But since this is a personal project that you can use to learn FE development, I think it would be a good fit.')
