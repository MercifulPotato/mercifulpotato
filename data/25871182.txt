That estimate skyrockets when you include the other 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe.<p>So for us to be near the first, near enough not to trip on Fermi&#x27;s paradox, and allowing a short 5 billions years for these planets to have existed on average;  we are (1000 billion X 5 billion) to 1.  Which still needs one hell of a filter to explain.')
