Make the GPU do the DRM internally.  This is actually relatively feasible since most DRM&#x27;d video content has hardware acceleration support and GPUs already support HDCP.<p>Full DRM in hardware would require a much larger coordination across manufacturers than any DRM to date (HDCP), and with AACS&#x27;s key distribution problems greatly magnified.  Specifically, preventing any software fallback would be required to avoid AACS&#x27;s player key leaks.')
