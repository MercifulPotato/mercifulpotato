It&#x27;s not like, with food, where you can go to an area where some kind of food is actually better and experience it (or not as easily). Even giving someone who&#x27;s been on a poor information diet better quality content they may not recognize it or even accept it (in contrast to the extreme difference between a well-ripened pear and a still hard one).<p>Culturally, an emphasis needs to be placed on better education with a focus on critical thinking. Individually, reading broadly and interacting with people of opposing views and differing cultures helps a lot. If you grow up in an insular community and are told, &quot;The others are heathens&quot;, you will internalize it and find it difficult to appreciate their statements (whether fact or opinion or somewhere in between) and consider them. It also helps to become somewhat detached and critical of your own views, self-questioning (not self-doubt) and introspection allow you to start separating your <i>beliefs</i> (opinions and interpretations of facts) from your <i>knowledge</i> (the actual factual basis for beliefs, if it exists). Then you can start reforming your beliefs and better reflect on the beliefs and statements of others.')
