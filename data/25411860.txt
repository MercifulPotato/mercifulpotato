And I live in what&#x27;s supposedly the bike and ped friendly core.<p>Just this weekend in my neighborhood, and elderly woman was murdered by a driver hooking a left turn while she was in a crosswalk. Same neighborhood, a homeowner had a driver crash into her home for the second time in three months!<p>Driving culture in the US is undisciplined and low-skilled.
