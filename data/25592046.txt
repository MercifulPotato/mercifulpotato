But the bug tracker of your distro is a good indicator if some of the most recent updates created a bunch of new tickets, especially those that are considered to be critical. In case of Arch Linux it is strongly recommended to read the latest update news on archlinux.org, before update.<p>In addition to that you get some experience over time which of your package updates caused most trouble in the past and you can take additional care.
