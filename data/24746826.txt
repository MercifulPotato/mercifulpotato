There are so many PEPs that are up to the reader to interpret. There are so many PEPs that contradict each other (just read some of the early PEPs). The whole thing feels basically meaningless, and toothless at this point.<p>I think Go&#x27;s proposal process nails balancing formalities and discussion&#x2F;bikeshedding.
