My prime requisite is to deliver actual value, not dubious internal metrics.<p>What items mentioned in the linked post do you consider meta-work? Unit tests (TDD), types (type systems) or formal methods (to prove hard to replicate edge cases like race condition perform as expected, for example)?<p>The rest of your reply seems to be directed at points the post never made. Nothing was written about universality of application or that trade-offs didn&#x27;t matter. The bulk of the post was how the inability of these methodologies &#x2F; tools to gain traction may be because they&#x27;re inconvenient... which from what I can tell you seem to agree with.')
