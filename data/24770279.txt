For example, you often want allocators with some predictable characteristic. Eg; constant time allocation for a given request size. Or you might want an allocator that keeps certain items contiguous so they&#x27;ll tend to already be in cache. Custom allocators tend to be used when you have a particular requirement that a general purpose allocator isn&#x27;t optimal for.<p>For tiny platforms often it&#x27;s bare-metal so there&#x27;s only one running &quot;process&quot; and so something like &quot;malloc&quot; that needs to be aware of memory usage across the system isn&#x27;t relevant. Moreover, embedded systems tend to care about deterministic performance so an allocator specific to the application can be a better match.')
