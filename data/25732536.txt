Parler was literally designed with suppression of political viewpoints they disagree with in mind from the start. It should be <i>crystal clear</i> which of those networks &quot;values free speech&quot; to a higher degree.<p>So, no, your implicit claim that it&#x27;s sad that top talent wouldn&#x27;t work for Parler because that would demonstrate their commitment to free speech is silly at best and disingenuous at worst. Parler has demonstrably less commitment to free speech than Twitter does.<p>I&#x27;ll be blunt: <i>my</i> sincere conviction is that &quot;if you moderate anything it means you are not for free speech&quot; is not a viable operational principle. It&#x27;s a rhetorical device. Trolls -- alt-right or otherwise -- have <i>always</i> claimed that moderation suppresses their free speech. If you listen to them, you are running a forum for trolls, whether or not that is your intent. It is not Parler&#x27;s publicly claimed intent to be doing so, but -- even based on the content on their site, let alone their ideologically-driven moderation which, again, goes far beyond anything Twitter, Facebook, et. al, have actually done -- it is painfully obvious it is their actual intent.')
