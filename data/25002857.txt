Yes, they&#x27;ve got deep pockets, but they are bean counters and notoriously cheap -- startups and tech cos are way, way better about everything from decent coffee to healthcare benefits.<p>They&#x27;re buried in deep strata of horrible legacy tech, they have huge middle-manager bureaucracies and politics, ridiculous and ineffective security that slows IT processes to a crawl, and the whole thing bleeds money to maintain -- so in the end they are kind of tech-hostile and will do anything to keep programmer salaries down, avoid promotions, etc.')
