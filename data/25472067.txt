The fairings also cost $6m ($3m per half fairing) and are pretty tricky to recover. No part of Starship will be expended every time, it’s all reusable. The only marginal cost per flight is the fuel and operations costs. They’re not going to reach 1&#x2F;28x with the early models, maybe only 1&#x2F;10, but eventually they’ve got a reasonable chance.')
