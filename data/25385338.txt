Item(by='Zhyl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607692478, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25385096, text='b) is an oversimplification, but I&#x27;d consider it to be a thought experiment whenever a story about Google or Duckduckgo comes up.<p>You will always find:<p>&gt;&lt;Search Engine&gt; is &lt;bad&#x2F;good&gt; and the results are way &lt;worse&#x2F;better&gt; than &lt;Another search engine&gt;.<p>&gt;&lt;Search Engine&gt; is only a frontend for &lt;Parent search engine&gt; &lt;but&#x2F;and&gt; does(n&#x27;t) do their own indexing.<p>&gt;Results for &lt;Topic (usually technical)&gt; (in &lt;country&gt;)? on &lt;search engine&gt; are garbage. Search results for &lt;purpose&gt; are poor.<p>What you will see as a response:<p>&gt;You should use &lt;search engine&gt; instead! It uses &lt;different parent search&gt; instead so the results are better!<p>&gt;I agree, I didn&#x27;t like &lt;search engine&gt; so I had to go back to Google.<p>What you won&#x27;t see:<p>&gt;Nowadays I only use &lt;search engine&gt; for some search, most of the time I use &lt;specific source(s)&gt;.<p>&gt;Maybe you should use specific searches for specific purposes?<p>The two that you cited are very valid, and I&#x27;m sure many people use specific sources for specific things (most doing it unknowingly via apps). The main thing seems to be that (on especially desktop) the single purpose all-encompassing web portal seems to be <i>the</i> way to find something. The phrase &quot;Google it&quot; is a catch all for &#x27;do your research&#x27;.')
