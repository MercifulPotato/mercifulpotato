This is such a huge misconception it&#x27;s concerning that people still need to be this concerned. You don&#x27;t have to hold back on the mRNA vaccine.<p>There is no such thing as long term issues that *suddenly appear after months or years&quot;. It simply can&#x27;t happen because they don&#x27;t have pharmacodynamics and you don&#x27;t take them that regularly. They are not the same thing as medication.<p>Long term side effects like after the polio vaccine in the 70s always occur IMMEDIATELY after vaccination. Hours to days, maybe a week. These vaccines are in your body for a short period of time before they produce the spike protein from the mRNA instruction. All effects happen very fast. If you get vaccinated you might feel ill within the day.<p>So why did we only notice some effects of vaccines much later, for example narcolepsy in swine flu? Answer: it&#x27;s all statistics. Some side effects have a chance of only 1:60.000 or even much less. Do you know how long it usually takes to vaccinate enough people to find something that occurs only in one out of 60.000 times? The answer is months or years.<p>But for COVID we have already vaccinated millions of people in multiple countries with multiple political systems and ideologies in power. No serious issues whatsoever. I know people who did get pretty sick for 2-3 days (basically bad cold) from the mRNA vaccine but that&#x27;s GOOD. They are not infected, it&#x27;s just a short term immune reaction that will disperse without causing serious harm and it shows the vaccine does what it is designed for: invoke an immune response.<p>And 2 days of symptoms are much better than 3 weeks with symptoms including hospitalization and long term effects due to an active virus in your body.')
