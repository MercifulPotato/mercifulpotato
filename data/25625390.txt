The Roman empire was not really &quot;anti-barbarian&quot; (except in its final throes): the\nRoman Emperorl considered himself to be the ruler of the whole world and all people in it, so the &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality was weaker than we may think.\n For instance, whenever Rome conquered some province, it usually granted citizenship to the local ruling class, so as to foster assimilation. Also, for a really long time barbarians were accepted at the &quot;frontier&quot; (limes) and sent to provinces that needed manpower, or to the army (which allowed them to become citizens, once discharged). Things only started to get out of hand after the battle of Adrianopolis (378), when the limes became unguarded and basically all Goths, displaced by the Huns, swarmed across the empire.')
