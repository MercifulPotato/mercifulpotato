Item(by='wombatmobile', descendants=None, kids=[25734717, 25747794, 25742854, 25731679, 25731051], score=None, time=1610379540, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25728453, text='I strongly prefer to repair devices and am reluctant to throw any broken manufactured good out, even when I have poor prospects of repairing them.  Instead, I just hold on to them.  Phones, stereos, vacuum cleaners, clocks, computers.  My shelves are full of broken items, and good intentions, frozen in amber.<p>Why do I think like this?<p>I think it is a psychological condition.<p>It isn&#x27;t a rational choice.  If I apply my educated, articulate self to analysis, I can tell you it&#x27;s an expression of how I want the world to be, not a realistic evaluation of how modern manufacturing commerce works.<p>A stereo or an espresso machine that is non-serviceable costs 1&#x2F;10th as much to buy and performs twice as well as an equivalent device from 50 years ago.  The price we pay for that bounty is that 5% of the manufactured items fail early.  It costs more to provide repair infrastructure than to run a warranty program, so the dead stuff ends up as waste.  I get it.<p>Still, I don&#x27;t like waste, and I love repair.  My feelings are not economics, they are emotions.  And so so they persist.  And that&#x27;s perfectly OK.')
