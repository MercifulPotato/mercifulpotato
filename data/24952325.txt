If you buy a salvage car then the package does not follow it as the car is officially junk (it also loses warranty, etc). If you buy a used car from Tesla they will remove the package before sale.<p>There&#x27;s one case where Tesla apparently messed up and didn&#x27;t remove the package from a car they re-sold until after sale. I can&#x27;t find any other cases of that or removing packages during private sales.<p>edit: This seems to be about Tesla discouraging salvage cars rather than private sales of non-salvage cars.')
