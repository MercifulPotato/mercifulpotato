You&#x27;ll get corrupt career politicians and the occasional retired billionaire. Lots of people are more than willing to pretend they don&#x27;t care about money, if that&#x27;s your qualification, so that their children and siblings can collect foreign &quot;investment&quot; and &quot;work&quot; as board members for companies wanting influence.<p>The USA is literally at the bottom in terms of salary divided by GDP. At first I thought we beat a few countries, but they have a head of state that is a distinct job from head of government. I&#x27;m also leaving out Pope Francis and a few countries for which GDP data isn&#x27;t available. Singapore pays $3,052,000 yearly, about half to the president and half to the prime minister.<p>In dollars for one individual, unadjusted for GDP difference, the USA pays less than: Switzerland, Singapore, Austria, and Ireland. Would you say that those countries are attracting the wrong kind of people as leaders? Counting the sum of head of state and head of government, these also pay more: Iceland, Hong Kong, Australia, Canada, Germany, and numerous kingdoms.<p>Anyway, do you like what you&#x27;re getting for politicians? Without change, you&#x27;ll get more of it. You can wish for the most fantastic altruistic leader with no family to support, and just hope that people will recognize that despite the underfunded campaign, or you can recognize that there is no escape from the money issue.')
