This is non-optimal as it is work in and of itself, it is also hard to correctly simulate things like the network, or various AWS services being down&#x2F;unreachable.<p>If you run the agent&#x2F;daemon on your production stack, then it&#x27;s a potential vector for misconfiguration or attack. But if you don&#x27;t run the agent&#x2F;daemon in production, then it&#x27;s another way in which your test stack diverges from production!<p>I saw various PR&#x2F;FAQs related to Chaos engineering while I worked in both EC2 and the AWS developer tools org. I&#x27;ve been gone over a year now, but I would bet that FIS does something at the EC2 Network level so that you don&#x27;t have to install stuff on your instances or containers.')
