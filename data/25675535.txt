This enables them to either buy up or destroy any kind of competition before it becomes noteworthy, cementing their positions for many decades. Not to speak of the political bargaining&#x2F;lobbying power.<p>Regulators need to stop allowing corporations to expand into ever-more domains and become so dominant through shear measure of size and capital they can throw around.<p>Gaming is an interesting space here. Microsoft has become one of three major players. They are buying up big studios like Bethesda, and are pushing hard for a future where you don&#x27;t own any games and can only rent them for playing on Windows, Xbox or via streaming.<p>Right now GamePass is an incredible deal, but things would look quite different if Xbox wasn&#x27;t the underdog.')
