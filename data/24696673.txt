The field team has an app which helps them focus on what to do next - so that they can cover a maximum number of locations in minimum time.<p>We have beta clients across multiple use cases include field sales - where they use it as a CRM (similar to salesforce) or for field servicing appointments (similar to servicetitan) or for assigning deliveries to their field teams<p>Would love to hear your feedback and answer any queries.')
