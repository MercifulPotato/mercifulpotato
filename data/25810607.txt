I&#x27;m educated to degree level (1st class, FWIW), and very well read (including the venerable Pratchett, though I don&#x27;t think I have read Jingo yet).<p>I think I heard the word &quot;jingoism&quot; for the first time ever around 5 years ago. It is <i>not</i> a word one hears very often, and it certainly didn&#x27;t come to mind from &quot;JingOS&quot;.<p>If you often read high-brow political publications you may come across &quot;jingoism&quot; on the daily, but that is obviously not a huge cross-section of the public.<p>TBH, kind of bizarre how strongly this jingoism thing is being pushed in this thread.')
