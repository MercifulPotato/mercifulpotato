For that reason, employees are also expected to stay longer.<p>It also looks like recruiting criteria are less technical. Your degree, years of experience, companies you worked for, certifications, etc... play a more important role than showing off your skills. Wages also tend to be defined more by your experience and position than how much money the company can expect to make out of your work.<p>So if you are not working in France, keep that in mind when reading such advise.')
