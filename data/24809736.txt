It’s akin to forced context-switching, which programmers hate because that also interrupts flow and concentration.<p>But it does take practice to master enough Vim commands to be able to use it without referring to help docs (which also interrupts flow).  You won’t really understand this flow advantage until you’ve done that.<p>Fwiw, Wall Street culture has something similar around Excel.  The best, most proficient Excel masters can use Excel with keyboard only, no mouse, b&#x2F;c they’ve mastered all the keyboard shortcuts for navigation, data entry, and calculation.
