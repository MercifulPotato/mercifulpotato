You will either do something about that in any way you can or you will lose your income.<p>There is no &quot;rational&quot; way fighting against someone like that. The person who is attacking already is irattational. Thus neither logic, nor common sense nor good will counter arguments will help you.<p>That person is like a rabid dog, once it sees you backing down it will only go in for the kill.<p>Stop thinking that you can &quot;logic&quot; or &quot;talk&quot; your way out.<p>An offense from your end, regardless if its rational or irrational is your only way of keeping your job.<p>Would you try to reason your way out when attacked by a mentally ill person? Obviously not, you&#x27;d know that there is no way of reasoning with someone whose world view is so warped and who is full of irrational hatred for someone who hasn&#x27;t directly harmed him.<p>Stop thinking about logic and arguments, they will be your doom.<p>Going on a severe counterattack against them is your only option. The bully will only attack you harder if he sees you backing down.<p>But show the bully that you will punch back and he will lose his power. This might sound like a cliche but people severely underestimate the wisdom of this statement.<p>Also note that there is no &quot;moral high ground&quot; here.\nThe person who is trying to make a stranger jobless obviously doesn&#x27;t care if you or your family will starve.\nSo the cancel culture proponent already ignored any an all morals since he obviously doesn&#x27;t know your life situtation and is trying to cancel you anyway.<p>So really the only &quot;moral&quot; thing to do here is to destroy them back.')
