And I didn&#x27;t like the 4k resolution. They offered me a choice: repair the screen (they pay shipping) or return for a refund so that I could buy the Darter (I pay shipping). I chose the latter, and I&#x27;ve been very happy. So while there is the occasional lemon, they stand behind their machines.<p>And software support has been great, supporting me across obscure Linux problems, not-quite-baked OS upgrades, and pilot error.')
