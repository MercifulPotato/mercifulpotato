The same is true for just about any company or organisation, so why should we be at all surprised that it also holds true for an illegal enterprise?<p>Now, the question of <i>why</i> a drug gang pays low-level members less than (say) McDonald&#x27;s, is more interesting. Is it because gang members have a higher expectation of future wealth than McDonald&#x27;s staff, i.e. McDonald&#x27;s has worse career mobility than drug trading?<p>Your chance of rising from a burger flipper to McDonald&#x27;s board or C-suite is effectively zero, whereas you might rise high in a drug gang (promotions might be faster if your bosses have a tendency to get shot or imprisoned!) So you could say that McDonald&#x27;s has to pay its workers more to offset the smaller future wealth expectations.')
