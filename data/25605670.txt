So as long as each step you take to advance your skill is achievable, and the feedback loop is good enough, you&#x27;ll keep going.  But as soon as you realize that you&#x27;ve only scratched maybe 1% of what is needed for mastery (when prior to that realization you felt like you were 90% there), it can be difficult to keep going.<p>As you get older and more experienced you get exposed to many things that appear to be &quot;easy&quot; but you then find out how much work it is (after you&#x27;ve sunk a bunch of time and effort into it).  After enough of this exposure you realize that any skill that isn&#x27;t realized by a majority of the population takes an immense amount of dedication and opportunity cost.  So after a while you tend to stick with what you already know (sunk cost).<p>Of course your life satisfaction can improve with more skills you have, especially if they are skills that don&#x27;t become too obsolete.  For example being able to do some maintenance on your car (brake job, oil change, tire rotations, radiator flush...) can save money at a mechanic.  And being able to take apart a sewer trap under a sink to clean out the hair clog is better than pouring a strong alkaline solution down the drain and hoping it works.<p>So it is really important to learn enough life skills while you are young to help build up a health and satisfying life later.')
