Like it or not, that&#x27;s how political parties work. Sanders is not a Democrat. By all rights, he should&#x27;ve run as an Independent. If he had been able to successfully execute control over the party by appealing to the rank and file, good for him. But it is unreasonable to have expected the DNC lifers to have actively lent support to what was effectively a hostile takeover attempt. I don&#x27;t see that as fuck Bernie, just as self-preservation.')
