Furthermore it uses a key  exchange. This means:<p>- The attacker needs a valid certificate for the applications login domain, which wrt. web security is normally assumed to not be possible but tbh. might be possible in case of an state actor or similar.<p>- The attack needs to be live in the sense that password and 2FA auth needs to be directly forwarded to the attacked web-application and there it needs to trick any bot detection to make it believe it&#x27;s not a bot. This also means even if they phish your authentication they only can use it once at the moment they phished you. But to e.g. then to disable U2F they often need to enter another password, so they need to phish you twice in a row, which is harder, but only slightly harder, tbh.<p>- Alternatively they might hack the service and get their hands on the private webcertificate and clients private key if the service doesn&#x27;t use a HSM for that. But that is normally much harder and for many attacks unfeasible (and there is normally little reason to phish if you can hack a server that deeply).')
