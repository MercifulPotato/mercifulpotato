I&#x27;ve been &#x27;hit&#x27; by a car that made a left turn into their driveway across the bike lane.  If there is a small animal or another pedestrian that isn&#x27;t the biker&#x27;s fault - the car is still liable at that point.  Blocking orthogonal lanes of traffic is not a driver&#x27;s &#x27;right&#x27;.')
