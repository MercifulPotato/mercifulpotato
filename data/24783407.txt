A fact can be stated in a variety of different ways with different implications. A fact is also a fairly confined data point, and excludes any extrapolation, modeling, hypothesis, root cause analysis or policy prescription. Pretty much nothing worthy of discussion is a fact.<p>Debating facts is pointless. People debate opinions, interpretations, implications. You cannot declare an implication from a fact as itself a fact. Nor can you claim people disagreeing with an implication are lying about facts.<p>As an aside - right wing platforms as you put it generally include a variety of popular proposals with the lower and middle class. These include immigration protectionism, lowering consumption taxes like gas taxes, taking a conservative stance on societally expensive government policies, and lowering unemployment rate through encouraging business growth. You may not agree with these policies, but to claim they are disinformation and thus not worthy of consideration is blatant biased censorship.')
