Massive container ships output much more, and what did everybody? Switch even more to internet deliveries, be it food or everything else. Unless its produced locally it comes from far.<p>Bigger effect would be shutting of factories, but then again we&#x27;re talking about millions of blue collar workers getting potentially into serious financial problems with little help - hardly something to cheer up for.<p>To have any visible effect from transport on environment we would have to be stuck at home for maybe 20 years.')
