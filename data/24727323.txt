This makes it an invention. Inventions cannot be copyrighted per <i>Baker</i>; they can however be patented.<p>&gt; They were able to tap into a developer resource who was familiar with the style, naming and conventions of Java<p>The <i>Baker</i> case specifically addresses this point by saying embodied practices cannot be copyrighted. Java isn&#x27;t a book, it&#x27;s an invention so the proper avenue for protection is a patent and not copyright.<p>&gt; The API is the interface between the human and the code, and so copying a familiar interface design can be an advantage when building a platform<p>Again this would be arguable as a patent infringement, but here we are discussing copyright and not patents. What you&#x27;re describing applies to design patents IMO. [IANAL]')
