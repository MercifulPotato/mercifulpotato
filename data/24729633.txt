It is absolutely wider than science.<p>The problem more widely, is that we trust others.  Bear with me - I know this sounds bad.  The fact is that we trust too much.  We should be verifying all the claims that are made to us.  We would soon learn discernment over what sources are trustworthy (friend&#x27;s personal experiences - ie anecdotal evidence) versus evidence presented by those that govern us on the media (politicians + their megaphone the mainstream media).<p>This in itself is jarring - we know politicians are not trustworthy, but we think they are trying to do their best.  But really what we have is a dog and pony show to distract us, and the governance is going on anyway.<p>The answer, in my opinion, is something like stepping up individually.  We should test and present our results to those around.  We would soon learn the difference between knowing and believing.  And we would also learn to accept that we do not know - and that that&#x27;s ok.  If we don&#x27;t know, that doesn&#x27;t mean we have to accept any old story that&#x27;s presented.  We can defer acceptance as and when we have the data, without kidding ourselves.  This is skepticism.')
