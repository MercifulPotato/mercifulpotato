Loosely, market manipulation happens when you artificially influence the price of a stock, resulting in a personal gain. Buying stock with the intention of causing a short squeeze can be interpreted to fit that definition. I believe that WSB is creating artificial demand to try to &quot;screw over&quot; certain institutional investors. I am not a lawyer; this is not a legal interpretation.<p>&gt; Apparently, the sort of crappy market manipulation that led to the 2008 Volkswagen &quot;short squeeze&quot; or the 2010 &quot;flash crash&quot; is absolutely fine because it was driven by traders.<p>How were they &quot;absolutely fine?&quot; You do know that regulators attempted to prosecute the traders&#x2F;executives responsible for the 2008 VW short squeeze [1], and successfully prosecuted a trader for the 2010 flash crash [2]? For the VW short squeeze, regulators were not able to find evidence that the traders involved <i>intended</i> to cause a short squeeze or engaged in any artificial demand; they actually demanded the stock because they sought to take over VW. This is also evidenced by the fact the Porsche sold stock on the open market once they released that a squeeze was happening [3].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;ad782326-ed02-11e5-888e-2eadd5fbc4a4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;ad782326-ed02-11e5-888e-2eadd5fbc...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2010_flash_crash" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2010_flash_crash</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39...</a>')
