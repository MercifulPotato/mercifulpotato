There is a way to leave the country you have chosen to occupy and it&#x27;s not as simple as saying you will withdraw and then withdrawing all presence in the region. The absurd power vacuum left behind causes massive geopolitical instability in the region that often spills over into neighboring countries which themselves have existing relationships with other parts of the world.<p>Doing that is exactly how you alienate all allies in some manner as well as disregard the several lives who&#x27;ll likely perish as a result of the instability. For better or worse, the US got itself into this mess and getting out of war is often much harder than entering it. This is exactly why people advocate for diplomacy over war.')
