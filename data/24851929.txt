If they just serve you content that you agree with, that&#x27;s influencing your political leaning by reinforcing your beliefs (IMO this is what Youtube already does). If they serve you any other content, unless it&#x27;s random and therefore useless, then anyone can claim they are influencing political leanings. In fact, any company whose business model includes providing information can be claimed to &quot;influence political leanings&quot; since that&#x27;s as well-defined as saying &quot;adds information&quot;. So a library also falls under this, as does Netflix, and Spotify, etc.')
