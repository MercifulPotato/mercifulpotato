Empirical data on this also shows, perhaps counter-intuitively, that a &quot;minimum wage can sometimes lead to higher rather than lower employment&quot;.<p>Entry-level jobs <i>are</i> important but so is human dignity and freedom. I don&#x27;t think you need to sacrifice one for the other here - we can (eventually) have both.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;schools-brief&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;13&#x2F;what-harm-do-minimum-wages-do" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;schools-brief&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;13&#x2F;what-harm...</a>')
