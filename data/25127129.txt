My 2014 Mac Mini is on High Sierra and my 2015 MacBook Air is on Mojave. No updates even to Catalina for them.<p>Incidentally, because of lots of music, pictures, and videos, I boot the Mini from an external 4TB ssd. I have to hold down option. It doesn&#x27;t even ask about the internal drive.<p>Another example of my motto of &quot;good enough is good enough&quot; is that my photo handler of choice is Picasa. Works fine on High Sierra. On Mojave, it complains five times with a popup before it starts, then runs OK. Weird.')
