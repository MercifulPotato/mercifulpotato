If you want to call the violent arsonists &quot;domestic terrorists&quot; that&#x27;s one thing, but the protests as a whole do not have violence as their purpose, nor most of their members, so labelling the protests as a whole &quot;domestic terrorism&quot; is an over reach of the term. A few dozen criminals with lighter fluid and matches don&#x27;t turn the other few thousand people into terrorists.')
