But I&#x27;m afraid it would be a position that would be a &quot;glorified IT-support&#x2F;sysadmin&quot; with some paper proof-reading... which is a point I&#x27;m about to ask on upcoming meeting.<p>As the other comment pointed out, if I have no say in direction&#x2F;approach I&#x27;m skeptical how much I would enjoy working for it (with a reduced salary nonetheless)')
