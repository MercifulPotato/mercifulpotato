I use it for a project documentation tool, for every customer&#x2F;project one db, i write howtos&#x2F;documentation into the wiki, code or patches to the repo and tickets too, at the end of the project i send that one db file and that&#x27;s it. I just love it, because tickets and documentation belongs to code+comments. And whats always important, the tooling is good, change to git and md&#x27;s...no problem.')
