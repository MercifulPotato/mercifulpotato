I guess it depends on which group is larger.</i><p>The frustrating thing with us geeks is that we overestimate our market segment. At Apple&#x27;s scale, we are insignificant.<p>As a publicly-traded company, Apple publishes a fair amount of operating info, such as their sales for their various product lines:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;investor.apple.com&#x2F;investor-relations&#x2F;default.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;investor.apple.com&#x2F;investor-relations&#x2F;default.aspx</a><p>From there, looking at the 2020 Q4 &quot;Financial Statements&quot; PDF, we can find the &quot;sales by category&quot; and see that in the &quot;12-month ending Sept 26 2020&quot; they sold $28,622M worth of Mathe previous year. Alternatively, they sold $9,032M in Q4 2020 (July-Sept) vs $6,991M in Q4 2019.<p>Of course we&#x27;ll have to wait another quarter to get a glimpse of how well the new M1-based macs sell (while considering that they&#x27;re only <i>part</i> of Apple&#x27;s Mac lineup.)')
