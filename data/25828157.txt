However, because the orbit does not follow the terminator exactly, PROBA2 will experience brief periods of several weeks when eclipses of the sun by the earth do occur, specifically around December each year. During approximately 80 days (from November until January), visible eclipses occur every orbit with a duration ranging from a few minutes in November up to a maximum of 18 minutes and back to 0.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proba2.sidc.be&#x2F;about&#x2F;launch" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proba2.sidc.be&#x2F;about&#x2F;launch</a>')
