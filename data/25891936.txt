Because in many places, zoning excludes mix of houses and businesses. You have to have houses only place and then businesses place. That is pretty much opposite of what you claim. Maybe in some later step they someone would try to make suburbs illegal, but right not, the issue is &quot;make walkable pleasant city legal&quot;.<p>Second, your claims about price are purely theoretical. As of now, suburbs require more money and dont have all that many solar panels.')
