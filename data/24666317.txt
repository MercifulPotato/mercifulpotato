Many times I just browse Wikipedia because I want to learn about weird animals or off-the-beaten-path places on Earth or culture or something like that.<p>(By the way, primary sources also sometimes have their drawbacks as well; they can often be politically motivated, biased and not tell you the full story, and Wikipedia is effectively peer-reviewed for a lot of articles.)')
