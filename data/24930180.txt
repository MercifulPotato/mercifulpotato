In the &#x27;search terms&#x27; on the sales site I used, I included &#x27;scrabble&#x27;.<p>Got a cease-and-desist letter from hasbro(?) demanding I remove the trademarked name &#x27;scrabble&#x27; from my &#x27;marketing literature&#x27;.<p>Now, it wasn&#x27;t in my &#x27;marketing literature&#x27;. It wasn&#x27;t in anything user-visible at all. The search terms were invisible. Unless either Hasbro got the website to release them (in which case they would simply have asked the website to remove them), <i>OR</i> they noticed when they searched for &#x27;Scrabble&#x27; that my game came up first. Before the licensed game. Which was a lame app.<p>I felt annoyed they would stoop to this, and was going to hang fast. But my partner buckled, and removed the search term. Sigh.<p>Anyway, haven&#x27;t played Scrabble since.')
