If I could add some suggestions to the author&#x27;s at the end:<p>* First, if you have the option of using one or the other, do so.  Like, you can use red, blue, yellow, purple, and black for lines on a graph before you even need to find an additional color like green.<p>* Second, highly saturated (&quot;computer&quot; red&#x2F;green) are easy to distinguish (for me, anyway, and it sounds like the author as well).  So they&#x27;re preferable to less saturated versions of red and green, if you need to use both.<p>For me, the most difficult reds and greens to distinguish are in the pastel range.<p>* Additionally, if you&#x27;re designing UI for a program (game or whatever) with colorblindness options, PLEASE do not label the options with the medical names only (&quot;deuteranopia&quot;, &quot;protanopia&quot;, &quot;tritanopia&quot;).  I don&#x27;t know what the latin word for the medical condition of red-green colorblind is, I just know I have the relatively common kind of red-green colorblindness.  I&#x27;d guess most people who aren&#x27;t doctors are in a similar boat.  Labels that include the color-distinction difficulty and relative commonality would be most useful to me, e.g., &quot;red-green (MOST COMMON \xad— deuteranopia)&quot;, &quot;red-green (LESS COMMON — protanopia)&quot;, and &quot;blue-yellow (EXTREMELY RARE — tritanopia)&quot;.')
