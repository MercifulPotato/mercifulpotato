I got my degree in Software Engineering instead, and I find myself far more prepared than many CS colleagues. In my degree we had classes on project management, requirements gathering, structuring and managing databases, heck one class was just about getting your A+ so you could know how to diagnose and repair misbehaving machines and understand things a little bit more holistically.<p>If you want to be an aeronautics engineer, or a civil engineer we don&#x27;t require you to go get a degree in physics, sure you&#x27;ll have a lot of classes that deal with physics and you&#x27;re expected to be familiar with the basics, but you aren&#x27;t going to have physics as your major. So why the heck do we keep pushing people to CS when their going into Software Engineering?<p>If you think as CS education is still necessary and valuable in your work as an SWE please tell me why, I am curious to understand why if people feel it was useful I want to know why.<p>EDIT: I appreciate the answers I&#x27;ve gotten, as clarification I have noticed several people cite how their degree helped them get a job, or move positions, and I agree that it does that; however I feel a degree in Software Engineering would be just as valid, in these situations. My question is more about is a does a CS degree or an SE degree help make one a better engineer?')
