Now do we need &#x27;em? Know what I mean? We&#x27;re living in that era now where we have invented most of the stuff that we need and now we&#x27;re just messing about.<p>Ricky Gervais: They said that in 1900. Someone actually said everything that&#x27;s to be invented has already been invented, they said that in 1900 and how wrong were they?<p>Karl Pilkington: No but what came out, what was invented in that year where they went, &quot;Right that&#x27;s it now.&quot;<p>Ricky Gervais: The 20th century.
