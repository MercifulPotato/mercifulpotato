There is literally no other benefit I gain from being on Twitter. Also, people only ever respond to me if I tweet against Trump&#x27;s policies. If I say anything about science or tech or humanity or art or say some interesting ideas, nobody listens to me. Nobody retweets me. Nobody follows me. It&#x27;s like talking to a wall.<p>His term is over, and my reason to be on Twitter is over.<p>So from Twitter&#x27;s standpoint they don&#x27;t have much to lose by doing the right thing and banning him with only a little more than a week left.<p>If they had banned him 2 years ago they&#x27;d have lost 2 years of my ad revenue.')
