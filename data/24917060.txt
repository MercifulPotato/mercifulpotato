I don&#x27;t get why Pine64 would look at this, and not let&#x27;s say mt76 based devicesâ€¦<p>MT76 firmwares are pretty small (of the order of 100kB), while Intel Iwlwifi firmwares are like 1MB, and ath10k-ct is like 200kB big, so it means reversing MT76 firmware is probably a bit easier.<p>Oh, yeah, it&#x27;s probably not RISCV so no hype.<p>Good luck to them anyway, more &quot;open&quot; firmware, the better.')
