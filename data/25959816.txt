Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611941102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25959663, text='People have been predicting Exxon&#x27;s demise for at least 4 years now.<p>But look: it&#x27;s not my claim that Exxon is a good investment. In fact: Exxon&#x27;s stock seems to have tracked the prevailing grim sentiment about the oil business. Rather, what I&#x27;m pointing out is that it doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable to suggest that Exxon is &quot;functionally dead&quot;, a &quot;phony-baloney&quot; company propped up by paymasters in the rigged financial services industry. Exxon is, as a company... kind of important? Like, it does a bunch of stuff?<p>Another example: Boeing. We&#x27;re all aware of a big reason for Boeing&#x27;s predicament. But Boeing didn&#x27;t get there by being a &quot;zombie&quot; that wasn&#x27;t doing real business; in fact, we can probably ruefully say Boeing did <i>too much</i> business on the 737 Max product. So there&#x27;s another reason you can be on the &quot;zombie&quot; list: your company made a huge mistake that will take years to climb out from.<p>Moderna was also on the list Taibbi linked to. Because it was an R&amp;D company that wasn&#x27;t meaningfully shipping product. I don&#x27;t know that we even need to talk about Moderna&#x27;s financial prospects (I genuinely have no idea what they are) to dispose of the idea that it&#x27;s a &quot;functionally dead&quot; &quot;phony-baloney&quot; company; it&#x27;s a key, effective component of a strategy to rescue the world from a global pandemic. So there&#x27;s yet another way to get bucketed as a zombie: you can be a startup.<p>My point --- I was too lazy to type it last night and am too lazy to come up with a way to say it succinctly now, sorry --- is that Taibbi is either taken in by or preying on a layman&#x27;s understanding of the word &quot;zombie&quot; to drive a column about how 1&#x2F;3rd of the market is kayfabe. There is probably a way to make that point, maybe without even having to argue that Ford Motors is a fake company. But Taibbi tried to make it by linking to an article that calls out Tesla and Moderna as examples of the &quot;zombie&quot; phenomenon; he either hasn&#x27;t read his link, which basically <i>refutes</i> his argument, or he&#x27;s assuming you won&#x27;t. Because after he writes that link, he goes on to imply that &quot;zombie&quot; means here what a normal person thinks it means. And it does not.')
