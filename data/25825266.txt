Every one of them!   One of the people says most people leave when they turn 26 because they can&#x27;t stay on their parents&#x27; health insurance.  What?!<p><pre><code>  &gt; And like other dream jobs I learned about, it’s not enough to survive on: During \n  &gt; off-seasons, Krumbholz also works as a substitute teacher and an aquarium dolphin \n  &gt; tank cleaner; since being on university health insurance would mean she’d constantly\n  &gt; lose it during the off-season, Krumbholz decided to stay on the state exchange\n  &gt; instead.\n</code></pre>\nThe idea that health care is tied to your employer, and your employment status, is so unacceptably broken.  I&#x27;ve never heard of anything so broken in terms of the obvious social and economic harm a bad policy is creating.
