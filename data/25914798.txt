Item(by='LordNight', descendants=None, kids=[25915721], score=None, time=1611662272, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25914128, text='I am a casual internet user and have no connection to IT industry, but i&#x27;ve been using Firefox practically since the very beginning - I installed v. 1.0.0 back in 2004. It&#x27;s main selling points for me were: 1) it wasn&#x27;t IE; 2) easy customizability of the UI layout - FF had as many great themes as Winamp; 3) lots and lots of different plugins and extensions for even more customizability: from AdBlack and Smooth Scrolling to various video downloaders and paywall skips.<p>And it was great! More importantly it was already a more or less finished product. The updates were slow, sparse in time and didn&#x27;t change much (it took 3 years to get from v. 1 to v. 3).<p>Then something changed in 2011 and updates started showering almost every week for no apparent reason. It was annoying and I&#x27;ve completly stopped installing updates after v. 13(everything worked perfectly anyway). Then after 4 or 5 years I started to have a problem with playing youtube and twitch videos, so I decided to finally update my FF. It was already v. 57 (Quantum) and it made me absolutely livid. 2&#x2F;3 of my extensions weren&#x27;t working (and still aren&#x27;t) and the ability to change UI theme was completely gone (and so I am now stuck with that bland default theme). And all that for no visible benefit on my part whatsoever.<p>I&#x27;ve immediately installed Chrome, Opera and Safari to see if they were any better, but ... they all are almost identical to the new Firefox (although I am now using Opera on mobile). There is almost no incentive to change from one browser to another now.<p>Well, it&#x27;s year 2021 now, but somehow my user experience is worse than it was fifteen years ago. How is that possible I do not know.')
