Item(by='cltby', descendants=None, kids=[24849973], score=None, time=1603293824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24848191, text='&gt; IQ is somewhat effective as a diagnostic tool for significant impairment and not much else<p>This places exactly zero constraints on the utility of IQ tests. Instead of asking why group A scores higher than group B, I can simply ask why group B is impaired relative to group A. Apparently that should be enough to convince you of the validity of the comparison.<p>&gt; The variance of measured IQ for the same individual over time is very high.<p>The test-retest correlations of IQ batteries are typically in the 0.8-0.9 range. For example, the Wechsler test [1]. This makes IQ probably the single most reliable measure in the social sciences. Perhaps you&#x27;re referring to the Wilson effect, but that&#x27;s not at issue here.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.pearsonclinical.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;wisciv&#x2F;WISCIVTechReport2.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.pearsonclinical.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;wisciv&#x2F;WISCIVT...</a>')
