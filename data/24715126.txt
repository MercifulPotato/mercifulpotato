Ironically, in setting out to solve institutional racism, you merely reinforce it.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t know how to change the fallout of centuries of race-based slavery and the immediate drop into generational poverty,<p>Provide learning opportunities to the economically underprivileged before important events like college admissions.<p>&gt; If you don&#x27;t value diversity, maybe just say so,<p>I value diversity.
