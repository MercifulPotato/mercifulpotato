It&#x27;s hard to see even in 8 dimensional space!<p>In terms of drawing graphs of the U.S. states or data like that, it should be possible to, say, create a point at the centroid of every region, then connect the adjacent regions to form a mesh, then feed the mesh to neato with some options to relax the layout but retain the mesh. This is what the overlap removal algorithm does anyway. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphviz.org&#x2F;Documentation&#x2F;GH10.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphviz.org&#x2F;Documentation&#x2F;GH10.pdf</a>, at least the figures.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of recent work that improves on some of the graphviz algorithms. It&#x27;s a pity that without a convenient way to incorporate such inventions in a larger system, it tends to languish and not have as much impact or isn&#x27;t easily available to people that could use it.  Nocaj&#x2F;Ortmann&#x2F;Brandes work on untangling hairballs is another example: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jgaa.info&#x2F;accepted&#x2F;recent&#x2F;NocajOrtmannBrandes.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jgaa.info&#x2F;accepted&#x2F;recent&#x2F;NocajOrtmannBrandes.pdf</a>  We even have this prototyped in a directory somewhere but it would be more work to merge it into the release.')
