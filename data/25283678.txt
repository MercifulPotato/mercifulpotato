The company does not use your money to build out its infrastructure; generally they don&#x27;t see a dime of it. There are a few exceptions like with Tesla who issue new shares to cash in on their inflated stock price, but this is generally rare. Most companies are doing the opposite: buying more of their stock, not selling it.')
