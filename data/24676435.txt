Instead I try to chunk work down into tiny goals. As well as turn off Slack &#x2F; email &#x2F; anything else that can notify etc. If I really do work deep for an hour I normally feel like I need a tiny rest of 5 minutes or less. I see that need for a rest (not a distraction but a guanine need) as a good sign I went in deep!<p>Also there is probably a limit to the deep work per big rest too. Doing a straight 8 hrs is the anthesis of deep work for me.')
