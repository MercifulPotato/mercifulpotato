The result was that downtown Montevideo was drenched in the smell of smoke, sometimes enough to make a passerby start coughing. Generally the smell of cannabis products doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I know that many people find it rank and would prefer to avoid it.<p>I did think it was odd that while some countries are gradually attempting to wipe out tobacco smoking in public – you can smoke somewhere theoretically, but not in the park, on your balcony in a block of flats, or (if children could be present) in your own home or car – a change had been made in Uruguay that only increased the amount of public smoking.')
