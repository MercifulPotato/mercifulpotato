Swingers aren&#x27;t cheating (assuming they&#x27;re respecting any agreed upon boundary) when they&#x27;re having an orgy for example.<p>A bi man with a wife and a family could very well be having sexual encounters with men once in a while with the agreement of his wife (who could well have her own stuff going on too) and it could be a very healthy thing in what is a fulfilling relationship for both parties.')
