And with a monolithic kernel, the TCP stack needs the kernel for port allocation and load balancing the demands on the network interface.<p>Okay, that makes sense, but why can&#x27;t most of the processing be offloaded to userspace, with the kernel just doing those specific tasks? Port allocation should happen very rarely, and throttling should only ever happen when the network interface is saturated. Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to limit the kernel to just those tasks, and offload the rest to userspace?')
