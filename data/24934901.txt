Item(by='crazygringo', descendants=None, kids=[24938128], score=None, time=1604001193, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934282, text='&gt; <i>i think nobody is arguing that you want the best bang for your buck</i><p>Bizarrely, the article and several commenters here are saying <i>precisely</i> that money launders <i>don&#x27;t</i> want the best bang for their buck.<p>&gt; <i>but there&#x27;s a reason why someone will just flat out offer 20% over asking</i><p>But <i>nobody is doing that</i>. The article seems to be assuming that, commenters are assuming that, but where&#x27;s a single piece of evidence? If offering the <i>asking</i> price guarantees you the deal, offering 20% more is insanity. Nobody would do that.<p>You seem to be claiming that, somehow, overpaying for real estate... diminishes your chances of getting caught? (And several commenters here are assuming that too.) But <i>it doesn&#x27;t</i>. Why would it? What would the mechanism even be?<p>I swear I don&#x27;t understand where this idea is coming from, that overpaying for real estate does a better job at laundering money or something than simply paying market rate. It <i>doesn&#x27;t make any sense.</i>')
