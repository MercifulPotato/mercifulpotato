I find it&#x27;s harder to write non idiomatic code that pretends to be another language than to just spend the time learning that other language.<p>But I get why people might feel it&#x27;s worth a try, cpp probably looks more daunting than any other language to a novice. There&#x27;s a lot of concepts to be mastered before you can write decent cpp, where in a lot of languages you can get started and discover things later. With cpp the abstraction gets very detailed. You might not even care what the difference between stack and heap, value or reference passing is in other languages.<p>Eg you can write python pretty intuitively and get a hash table as part of the language. If you&#x27;re writing cpp you need to know how types work, how templates work, and how the STL containers work (allocators, traits, constness etc) just to save a simple hash table.')
