Events become provocation draws provocation draws backlash, etc etc.<p>I&#x27;m a fairly liberal person, but it doesn&#x27;t take an inhuman amount of mental gymnastics to look at riots, anti-police sentiment, etc, and see a coordinated hostile agenda. I am lucky that I get to talk to both hardcore right and hardcore left people regularly, and they both tend to follow logical interpretations to inevitably polarizing and unhealthy conclusions. Both are not living in current reality, they are projecting their beliefs about the other side&#x27;s agenda based on what they see on the news, and saying &quot;I don&#x27;t want to live in that world&quot;.')
