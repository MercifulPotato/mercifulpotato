I&#x27;m a frugal man saving for his first home, every purchase feels like a step backwards. In instances like this another feeling dominates, I feel unworthy of possessing such a device because I can&#x27;t use it to understand anything, I can merely gaze into the multicellular world as one would use a telescope to look at the moon. I understand my place in the world marginally better but at the end of day I get no concrete understanding. Certainly nothing novel.<p>I feel like this thought cheapens and spoils joy. I&#x27;ve been infected with it and I don&#x27;t know from where.')
