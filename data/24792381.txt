I don&#x27;t think &quot;hack&quot; means literal network intrusion. If the article&#x27;s own description of the provenance of the information is taken at face value, cloning a hard drive at a repair shop without authorization still qualifies as &quot;hacked&quot;, and in violation of Twitter terms.')
