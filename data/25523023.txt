In the New International Version (NIV) it says in 2 Samuel 21:19 that someone other than David killed the giant Goliath. Anyone knows this is not true, except the &#x27;scholars&#x27; who translated it. According to Hebrews 3:16 in the NIV all the children of Israel rebelled in the wilderness and none made it into the promised land; however, we know that Joshua and Caleb did not rebel, and God promised them each a place in the promised land (just read Numbers 13 &amp; 14). Another mistake is found in Mark 1:2, 3 where according to the NIV the writer of Malachi was Isaiah! Just check out Isaiah 40:3 and Malachi 3:1 - the KJV has it right and the NIV has it wrong.<p>For comparison of the verse this comment parodies, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;biblehub.com&#x2F;isaiah&#x2F;11-6.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;biblehub.com&#x2F;isaiah&#x2F;11-6.htm</a>')
