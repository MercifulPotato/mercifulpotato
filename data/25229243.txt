In my view, most conspiracy theorists actually deeply investigate if the conspiracy is true, they just don&#x27;t have the tools, knowledge or intelligence necessary to rebuke the arguments themselves so they believe the conspiracy is true. This is more work than most people do when faced with any kind of claim from an authoritative source.<p>The main reason some conspiracies get more &quot;believers&quot; than others, in my opinion, is because they&#x27;re contrarian signals, so they&#x27;ll attract contrarian people, and like with anything, most people will only explore the surface level stuff because that&#x27;s enough for their contrarian itches.')
