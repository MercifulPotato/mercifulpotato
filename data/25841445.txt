Item(by='fakedang', descendants=None, kids=[25841599], score=None, time=1611105981, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25839004, text='Thousands of data points suggest GP&#x27;s claim, and you counter it with one example?<p>&#x2F;r&#x2F;AskHistorians is one of the more unique subreddits, in that it has evolved to become what reddit envisioned a subreddit to be. But running counter to that are a thousand other country subreddits, where if you don&#x27;t hold a hard line (lefty) view to politics, you will get banned. I have seen Labour shills with premium reddit accounts allowed to post content on r&#x2F;uk that&#x27;s downright against the rules, but hey, apparently agreeable to the majority of redditors, so it stays. Likewise I just assume that all of the country subreddits are internally influenced directly by political parties themselves. I have seen fake news being spread by all who have a vested interest (such as Armenians during Nagorno Kharabakh on r&#x2F;Europe) and mods not even lifting a finger. We all know how r&#x2F;Conservative and r&#x2F;The_Donald mods just kicked out people who put forward views that were marginal to the rest of the sub. And why do subs like r&#x2F;Sino, which openly peddle fake news, even exist? IMO reddit site moderators are largely sleeping and only wake up if something hits the newsstands.<p>Moderators should be empowered with the ability to censor and delete&#x2F;flag comments, and to ban people with repeated infractions. But to ban somebody from a country sub and&#x2F;or letting mods ban people with one or no infractions, while selectively applying the rules? No way. They should not even get filters imo. If it makes their job harder, then so be it.<p>That being said, one sub that I&#x27;ve found really nicely monitored is the r&#x2F;casualuk sub. Politics is a strict no no, and they have some sort of bot to filter out such content based on keywords. The mods aren&#x27;t some silent grandstanding keyboard warriors but people actively involved in the community who actually go so far as to organize real world events.')
