You can take it OR leave it.<p>What RedHat seems to have forgotten was 2 things, which I&#x27;m sure they knew very well at some point:<p>- Even non-paying users are more valuable to you as non-paying members of your ecosystem than members of any of your competitors. They are actually what keeps your ecosystem a defacto standard. It is incalculable how valuable it is to be a defacto standard for anything.<p>- Those non-paying users were never and are never going to be paying customers no matter what else you do. Their use is not &quot;lost revenue&quot; because you were never going to get any revenue from them anyway. If they couldn&#x27;t use your product for free, they&#x27;d just use someone else&#x27;s product for free. There is no &quot;convert them into paying customers&quot;.<p>And there is also no &quot;convert them into development version users&quot; either because of see above re GPL.<p>All it is is annoying for everyone, even bystanders, that they keep trying.')
