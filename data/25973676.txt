And the whole scheme of property rights with regard to ordinary physical property only makes sense <i>because</i> ordinary physical property can&#x27;t be copied. If I steal your car, you are deprived of the car; that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a crime for me to do it. But if I make a digital copy of some computer file you have, I&#x27;m not depriving you of it; you still have your copy and can still use it exactly as you did before. So why should it be a crime for me to make the copy?<p>The corporations that are pushing &quot;intellectual property&quot; rights over digital &quot;property&quot; would <i>like</i> it to be a crime, of course, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we, the people, should agree.')
