The hiring manager got tired of waiting for us to find a good candidate, so he just picked one that he had screened and seemed best on paper.<p>It was an unmitigated disaster. Constantly had to double check his work and redirect him from doing things bad ways (like using mutable objects with changing hash codes as dictionary keys kind of bad).<p>Eventually I quit the job (for other reasons). On the last day he cornered me in the elevator and offered me $100&#x2F;hr to do his work for him under the table so that he could claim it was his.<p>&gt; Did you ever verify that they actually had the experience they claimed?<p>Employer would only verify employment dates and eligibility for re-hire.<p>&gt; Did you follow up with their references?<p>Yeah, but when you ask someone for references they&#x27;re not likely to give you people who wouldn&#x27;t speak well of them.<p>&gt; Were they able to walk you through projects they worked, or discuss solutions implemented?<p>Yeah.
