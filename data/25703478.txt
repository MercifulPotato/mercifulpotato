It takes a few cycles to start up the ERMS feature, so it&#x27;s only used on longer arrays.<p>That isn&#x27;t true anymore either, on sufficiently recent processors with &quot;Fast Short REP MOVSB (FSRM)&quot;. If the FSRM bit is set (which it is on Ice Lake and newer), you can just always use REP MOVSB.')
