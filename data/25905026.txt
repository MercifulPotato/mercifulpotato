Basically they boil down to a web app offering subscription service to make some menial task slightly more comfortable.<p>1. How did you come up with this idea? Is it something you actually care about or found out it would make cash? Personally if I am to make something similar it rather be about something I care about and would use, sadly I don&#x27;t care about many things.<p>2. How do you actually find the time&#x2F;motivation to start some side hustle when you spend 8+ hours in work (even if it&#x27;s from home). Last thing I feel like doing after work is more work.')
