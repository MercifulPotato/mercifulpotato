I’ve used Servant (Haskell) for other prototypes. For this particular demo, there were more JSON REST endpoints than “pages”, so both Servant and Http4s (Scala) felt more natural here to me.<p>Installing it was easy, even though this was my first time using Nix. I think shipping things with Nix, especially when what you ship is integrated, can be superior in Haskell to using stack or cabal. (Stack is easier, cabal is more flexible, neither handle dependencies outside of Haskell.)<p>I’ll definitely come back and check it out for another prototype soon. :)')
