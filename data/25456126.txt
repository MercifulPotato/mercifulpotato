It&#x27;s basically designed to give trolls an outsized platform.&quot;<p>It really, really depends on the community the streamer creates. I spent a lot of time watching a transwoman who is a high-level MOBA player. She had a very active mod base who banned toxic or wanna-be edgy people.<p>She had automatic notifications that would post user-submitted messages across the screen. They were almost uniformly positive. Because of the community she fostered.<p>On the otherhand, there was a streamer of the same game who had a toxic community who would abuse text-to-speech. What was the difference? He himself was a toxic player, which attracted a toxic community trying to out-meme one another.')
