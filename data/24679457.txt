Real world ethics, starting by ethical assumptions will be 1000 times as full of holes and inconsistencies.<p>Just because a mathematical system like set theory is incomplete (can&#x27;t prove its own consistency), that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s &quot;full of holes and inconsistencies&quot;. And just because a system cannot prove itself consistent, doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be proven consistent in some larger system (for instance how we can use ZFC to prove that Peano arithmetic is consistent).')
