Any of the cloud-provided orchestration tools (Cloudformation, Openstack Heat etc.) are great only for the most basic tasks; using them to provision complex infrastructure is just begging for a world of hurt.<p>I disagree- I can&#x27;t speak to OpenStack Heat (and I have <i>no</i> idea what you&#x27;re referring to by &#x27;cloud-provided orchestration tools&#x27; beyond these two specifically), but my own experience using CloudFormation to provision complex infrastructure is that it is in fact great for <i>all but</i> the most basic tasks (where any orchestration tool would just add unnecessary overhead).')
