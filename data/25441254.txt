Depending on the TWM there&#x27;s a specific layout or you have to arrange the windows yourself. (i3 is the latter kind. Allowing for very flexible layouts, but more complicated than TWMs who follow a preset patter) TWMs are not built to minimise windows though. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s also a heavy focus on using multiple workspaces. (i3s tab-mode is also useful where you&#x27;ll have windows arranged similar to browser tabs)')
