Maybe some old stock but at this point I doubt it...<p>You will see &quot;UltraStar&quot; branding but it will be &quot;Western Digital UltraStar&quot; not HGST UltraStar.<p>Some retailers may even still put HGST in the listing (i.e Amazon still has several listing for new Drives that refer to HGST) but the Packaging, offical documents, and everything that comes out of WD will not have any HGST branding on it, it will not say HGST on the drive etc')
