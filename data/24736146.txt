His side of the story was that he walked into the bank (unarmed, by the way) and simply demanded money; they gave it to him and he walked out. He said he was astonished at how smoothly the whole thing went. Upon exiting the bank he just continued to walk away, turned a couple of corners, and was never caught. His take was about 80 dollars.<p>Later on, he got clean and sober and told his sponsor about the episode. Part of recovery is that you&#x27;re supposed to be willing to make amends for the damage you&#x27;ve done. His sponsor thought about that one, and said, &quot;You know what? I think we&#x27;re going to let that one pass.&quot; Probably a good decision.')
