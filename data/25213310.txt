It&#x27;s not the least bit surprising that they are low profit. Several members of my extended family farm at and above that acreage and a majority of my grandfather&#x27;s farmland is leased out to a larger family operation since he&#x27;s retired. Those family members mostly have regular 40&#x2F;week jobs, since they&#x27;re just hobby farms.')
