So you might buy specialised indices for particular fields, or general ones like what Google has. The size of Google&#x27;s index is measured in petabytes, so a normal person would still not have the capability to run something like that locally.<p>Edit: In another thread, ddorian43 has pointed out the existence of Common Crawl,[2] which provides Web crawl data for free. I have no idea if it can be integrated with YaCy, but it is there.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yacy.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yacy.net&#x2F;</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commoncrawl.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commoncrawl.org&#x2F;</a>')
