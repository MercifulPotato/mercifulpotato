It should be trivial (it was trivial) to rebut.<p>The problem is not that there was no evidence Obama was Kenyan, it&#x27;s that there were plenty of people who wanted to believe it.  Because they did not want a Black president, or because their mental model is so far away from reality that they think it&#x27;s possible for someone to cheat that huge.<p>Then the issue is not everyone having same facts in front of them - it&#x27;s everyone being willing to accept facts, and so change their own mental models.  And then we are back to politics.<p>Look, I fully support some system of global rebuttal.  It will mean no politician can open their mouths without opposition rebuttal - but that&#x27;s pretty much where we are now in mainstream media.  (it&#x27;s an argument that this is an attraction of online social media - there was no rebuttal (at least no rebuttal that appeared in the same timeline)<p>I am less happy about the idea of FAANG <i>deleting</i> posts - deleting criminal posts is a tough call (which crinalmlaw to use etc), deleting <i>minsinformation</i> - that&#x27;s a huge open wound<p>But the issue is not misinformation - the issue is fertile ground these posts find.  And that is about mental models and that is about changing peoples internal mental models of the world - that is getting others to agree with you and that is human politics - and there is no tech fix for that.

Don&#x27;t be.<p>Worried about politicians who are always facing rebuttal - just imagine a world where politicians have to treat their statements like scientific publications - we might start getting somewhere !')
