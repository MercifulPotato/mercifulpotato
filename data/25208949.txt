No one is stopping you from pulling the Beowulf maneuver. I.e., duct-taping a couple together. Via UART&#x2F;USB&#x2F;I2C&#x2F;Ethernet.<p>It isn&#x27;t as sexy or prone to looking cool, but technically it is possible. I&#x27;m actually planning on trying to tinker a traditionally networked cluster that I?m going to evolve to an attempt at an SSI&#x27;d cluster.<p>That&#x27;s really all what most Integrated Circuits are going to mowadays. Just take a few ALU&#x27;s, clock circuits, register files, Memory, some caches, a few MMU&#x27;s, connect it all with buses, fab x gang bustahs and you&#x27;ve got a new system. The toughest part seems to be getting someone to be frank with you and just giving you an accurate datasheet&#x2F;not screwing you with locked down firmware and rent extractiom arramgements.')
