They&#x27;ve done everything from threaten to sue to showing up with armed mobs and harassing vote counters to spreading conspiracy theories about black sharpies[0] and Democrats burning Trump ballots[1] to now calling on state legislatures to override the election through faithless electors[2]. This <i>after</i> all of the vote suppression efforts they&#x27;ve been undertaking prior to the election[3], implicating massive Democratic voter fraud and condemning mail-in ballots (I wonder why so many of them seem to be for Biden...), implicating Biden as a pedophile, the whole thing with his son&#x27;s laptop, and of course the states doing their typical voter suppression regime.<p>This is not a societal issue, people in general have not lost trust in the system. This election has seen more engagement than any election in recent history. <i>One political party</i> has been trying to undermine the system and sow mistrust within its own ranks in order to maintain political power.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;05&#x2F;sharpie-ballots-trump-strategy-arizona-434372" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;05&#x2F;sharpie-ballots-tru...</a><p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;business&#x2F;ballot-burning-fake-video&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;business&#x2F;ballot-burning-fake-...</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;donald-trump-jr-just-promoted-a-brazen-plan-to-steal-the-election&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;donald-trump-jr...</a><p>[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;02&#x2F;politics&#x2F;ben-ginsberg-voter-suppression-voter-fraud-2020-election&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;02&#x2F;politics&#x2F;ben-ginsberg-voter-s...</a>')
