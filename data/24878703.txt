I would recommend diving in and seeing if it works for you.<p>For informational purposes, this is what I still find difficult:<p>- The module system. It constantly catches me out.<p>- I think that I understand traits but struggle using libraries that have a lot of traits in the public interface.<p>- Error handling is nice but there are error handling libraries going in and out of fashion every few months. Which one do I use?<p>- Callbacks combined with the borrow checker.<p>- Complexity of idiomatic code such as state machines [1].<p>- The strict string handling. What about strings that should be UTF-8 but come over a network protocol?<p>- Combining async code with non-async code. Also, how do you write a library that does I&#x2F;O and supports both sync and async?<p>- Iterators. I have some functional programming experience but I hit problems with iterators combined with the borrow checker.<p>[1] This example has just 3 states and is much simpler than most real world examples: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hoverbear.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;rust-state-machine-pattern&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hoverbear.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;rust-state-machine-pattern&#x2F;</a>')
