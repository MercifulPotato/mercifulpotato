I have much better hardware in my house than any VPS can offer at a competitive price. This is particularly important for storage. Object storage like S3 is relatively cheap, but I just want a file system I can slap a static server (or whatever else I want) in front of. If you go for full block storage the price is way higher, and performance still isn&#x27;t as good as a local SSD.<p>2. I hope the future of the internet involves more people self hosting over IPv6. I see tunneling solutions as an intermediate step to that world. If we make it easy for people to self host, it might even be able to help drive IPv6 adoption.')
