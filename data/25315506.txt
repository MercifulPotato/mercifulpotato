You forget &gt;90% of what you read</i><p>That&#x27;s when you read normally. When you read 10x as fast you forget closer to 100% of what you read.<p>First because you don&#x27;t read the repeated arguments but skim them (so instead of reading a prolonged passage about X and have X suggested in 10 different ways, you just read a smaller paragraph&#x2F;phrase with just X -- foregoing the repetition and different ways of expressing the same thing which would have helped your memory).<p>Second because you combine this X with tons more skimmed information coming in (since you now read &quot;10x more stuff&quot;), so it all become a jumbled mess, which you didn&#x27;t take tame to absorb&#x2F;study individually, and of which you just have a proverb-like conclusion&#x2F;summary of, and not the whole context.<p>&gt;<i>2. Most written material can be tldr&#x27;ed down to a fraction of their length</i><p>They can be tldr&#x27;d down if you read them carefully to identify the tldr points, and be able to express them nicely and succintly (which is a difficult art in itself). If you read&#x2F;skim them at 10x you can&#x27;t properly tldr them. You&#x27;re better off reading the tldr made by someone who actually took the time and read the book.')
