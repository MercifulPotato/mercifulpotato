Item(by='titzer', descendants=None, kids=[24696284, 24695698], score=None, time=1601966903, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24695173, text='An intuition about the &quot;appearing trillions of times in a family tree&quot; is to realize that family trees are actually a binary tree extending <i>backwards in time</i>--i.e. each person has exactly two parents, who have exactly two parents, and so on. So N generations back, there are 2^N individuals. Obviously, there weren&#x27;t 2^100 people on Earth at any point in time, so this backwards tree starts folding back on itself, containing duplications. Go back far enough and there is a set of individuals who were alive at a particular point in time that completely cover that forward tree.<p>It helps to visualize this more as a mesh than a tree, or as a flowing river. The river divides around rocks and obstructions (those are points of temporary divergent evolution) but ultimately all flows together (convergent ancestry). We are truly one body of genetic material, and yet each is a unique combination of backwards traces.<p>It&#x27;s really very cool IMHO.')
