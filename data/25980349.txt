Item(by='MayeulC', descendants=None, kids=[25982584], score=None, time=1612113029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25980160, text='&gt; I can&#x27;t imagine it would be fun to install anything on a pinephone.<p>It&#x27;s actually fun to do &quot;apk add audacity&quot; (yeah, there&#x27;s also multiple gui frontends...) and have it installed and working as well as on desktop. OK, that one uses a traditional desktop interface, but it is still usable. Plug it into a docking station and use a mouse and keyboard + screen if you prefer.<p>Okay, that&#x27;s not really sideloading, especially as each distro has its packaging format. You can use flatpaks for this (and they are sandboxes), some CIs provide builds as flatpaks (KDE does this).<p>One issue is that Linux executables are still very much architecture-dependent.')
