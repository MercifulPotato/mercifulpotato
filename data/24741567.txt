There&#x27;s plenty of Youtube video talking about it. There&#x27;s even a shop near I live that even clearly advertise that they sell returns from Amazon.<p>It&#x27;s way scarier the stuff they send directly to landfill. I know someone that works in chemical waste disposal and they had a deal with Walmart to take care of it all (I&#x27;m pretty sure they still do). She was taking back some pretty nice stuff that could easily be sold pretty easily.')
