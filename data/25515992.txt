The lack of an IP rating might prevent you from then installing the appliance in, say, a bathroom (depends presumably on country-specific regulation). This in turn might limit your sales.<p>Even if that&#x27;s the case, the appliances should be easy to repair for a competent person and if necessary allow the cable be replaced.')
