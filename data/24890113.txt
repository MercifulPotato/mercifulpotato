In that context a strict security model makes sense.<p>Trouble is, that security model makes no sense on today&#x27;s desktop. In 2020, people aren&#x27;t downloading and running native applications on desktops, not even (especially?) on Linux. The desktop is now solely a manager of browser windows. Everything that normal folks do is done through the browser, from email to office collaboration. Maybe a few Electron apps sprinkled in (mostly targeted for developers, ironically). Maybe the calculator? That&#x27;s pretty much it.<p>The most important desktop apps today? Chrome and Zoom. Both which barely work in Wayland. But at least all that non-existent native desktop software can&#x27;t now spy on my web mail? Too bad screen sharing is now a complete shitshow.<p>Actually worthwhile problems to solve on the desktop are for example high DPI and fractional scaling, rock-solid multi-monitor support, dynamically plugging in and removing displays, mixing displays of varying DPIs, high refresh rates and variable sync etc. The desktop will increasingly become a niche for high-end developer setups.')
