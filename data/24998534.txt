I got my very first Apple Watch last month, and it has &#x2F;drastically&#x2F; decreased my phone usage. Sometimes I go out to run errands without my phone, paying for things with Apple Pay on the watch. It&#x27;s liberating.<p>I do still bring my phone around though, mostly for the camera.<p>There are some things that are infuriating about the watch though, when it feels as if what I want to do is artificially constrained by the software. Why can&#x27;t I copy and paste a link to send in a message? Why can&#x27;t I simply read a podcast description? Why do podcasts refresh seemingly at random?<p>Other than a few niggling frustrations, I&#x27;m extremely happy with the watch.')
