For example in 2020 we patched a couple security issues, while Yubico, Google Titan and Feitian all recalled keys. Specs and thus firmware are getting bigger and more complex, so we believe that updates are the only way to maintain security in the long run.<p>We do not use a secure element, unlike other keys. This is not a statement, it’s just a fact. If you want an open product, there’s no “secure element” available that doesn’t require an nda. We hope that our work (we’re not alone in this) will motivate manufacturer to release secure elements with less obscurity around them.')
