Some packages are not even .NET packages.<p>The default search scoring could also benefit from some work as old, unmaintained, packages often show up on the first page.<p>I wish there was a way to filter by license, open-source, and&#x2F;or source-code-package.<p>I&#x27;ve been a .net guy ever since C# was called COOL and I even went to Redmond back in the days as part of the early adopter program. I&#x27;m worried about the adoption and I think it&#x27;s mainly because of the perceived low quality when it comes to browsing NuGet.org<p>Compared to npmjs.org, NuGet.org could be soooo much better.')
