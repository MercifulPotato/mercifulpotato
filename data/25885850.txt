So I think that at least 241 persons played the game. (The actual number of players is probably way higher.)<p>If you assume that players have no knowledge, With 241 the expected to number of persons with 8&#x2F;10 in 10, and with 10&#x2F;10 is 0.2. (The actual number of players is probably way higher, so these expected values are way higher, but we must not count lurkers.)<p>Last time I counted, I found 6 comments that say 8&#x2F;10, so even if only 241 persons played and none of them have any insight, it would be underreported. This is not unexpected, not everyone is posting the result.<p>Last time I counted, I found 3 comments that say 10&#x2F;10, that&#x27;s much more than the expected value if only 241 persons played and none of them have any insight. So that&#x27;s slightly interesting. (Did a lot of people get 10&#x2F;10 and didn&#x27;t upvote? The people that say 10&#x2F;10 is lying or cheating? Do they recognize a few of the photos and were lucky in the others? Do they have a sixth sense to recognize serial killers?...)')
