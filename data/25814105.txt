Saying browsers won&#x27;t support JS in 10 years is an idiotic claim. Even more so considering it was written 5 years ago.<p>Beyond that, I don&#x27;t know why people think that the web should just be either simple pages for serving content or massive desktop-class applications. There is an entire world between these two that is perfectly valid. Yes I want to host a blog but I also want it full of widgets and other fancy JS. I want to use new frameworks and rewrite it every few months. It may be messy, it may be sometimes inaccessible, and yes it may not be available a few years from now. But the web is and always has been about creativity and expressing yourself in any way you want. Heck my personal site ran on Flash once upon a time.<p>People here are the kind who would complain about geocities or myspace pages back in the day (&quot;why is it all so flashy? Why can&#x27;t it just be a simple page of text?&quot;)')
