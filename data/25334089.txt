I burn a crap-ton of wood... I have literally no allergies nor asthma, breathing problems - I have a gas stove and a gas heater in my house...<p>I will burn a bitch at any chance I get! I literally broke my brick hearth last week chopping wood.<p>I was one grounded for a week when my dad came home (general contractor) and I was staying home from school with the flu, fever, and I was pumping wood into that wood-burning stove like I was trying to drive a train... it was like 110 degrees in the house.... my dad was furious,<p>Now, I have an endless supply of wood and a really nice fireplace - ive been going NUTs burning everything I can!')
