Item(by='DoingIsLearning', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604474300, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24986664, text='I have to agree with the comment from bsder, unless you are doing heavy-duty video, RADAR, or RF comms the large majority of chips are never fully utilized, these business are really quite dependent on sales pitches&#x2F;push. For the large majority of clients they just need to implement a small&#x2F;medium time critical task.<p>&gt; At least Vivado (on Linux) is actually quite painless once you get the hang of it. If you&#x27;re an important enough customer, you can complain to your FAE and they&#x27;ll get you access to unreleased versions with a specific problem fixed.<p>I disagree, I haven&#x27;t touched Vivado in about 1 year but I doubt it revolutionized itself in 2020.X . I am going to politely ignore the shear volume of files that get auto-generated, duplicated, cached etc. and make it near impossible to version control. I also won&#x27;t enumerate the GUI bugs that are only resolved with TCL scripting. However, as of 2019, Vivado was still unable to support VHDL-2008 standard simulations, same thing for packaging IP in VHDL-2008, that is literally 11 years behind in VHDL standard support. In any other industry people would be flipping the table.<p>The problem is they don&#x27;t make money out of the software they make money selling chips, and that is the wrong incentive to improve the toolchain. I would much rather they charge for the toolchain but actually support it with adequate resources and a sane development roadmap, OR they just accept the lack of budget, capacity, profit in software and open-source it.')
