I&#x27;ve traveled pretty extensively. I can assure you I know how toilets, showers, sinks, washing machines, and dishwashers work. As someone with a breadth of life experience and full control of my faculties, I cannot say I&#x27;ve experienced any of the issues you describe. Do not make assumptions about my life experience.<p>If _anything_ the worst issue I&#x27;ve experienced in some parts of SF is low water pressure, which has nothing to do with fixtures or appliances and everything to do with infrastructure.')
