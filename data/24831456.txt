Can you charge military personnel with a crime like this when they are acting in accordance with their orders?<p>It feels like this is a cop out: the US knows that it is the Russian government that’s responsible but charges individual officers so as to not cause any kind of international stir.<p>Even if these six were tried and convicted and sent to prison, nothing would change since I’m sure there are others who could take their place. The directive won’t change, just the people carrying it out.')
