Item(by='roryrjb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612080038, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25969409, text='Just want to say that if anyone is looking for a GUI editor on Linux and wants something lighter than Visual Studio Code, Kate now has a LSP client built-in (I only discovered this recently so not sure how long it has been there) but with this alongside the other features, such as the one mentioned in the post it really is an attractive alternative. The only reason I&#x27;m not using it daily is because I just can&#x27;t move away from Vim at this point, but whenever I use Kate I very much enjoy it.')
