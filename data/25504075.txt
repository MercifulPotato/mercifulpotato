Doxxing, organized harassment, racism and similar nastiness have certainly been issues with some regularity in most of the subforums.<p>The only reason why it has been kept down is a relatively large team of admins and moderators, and they have been far from infallible, there has been tons of drama in that regard, including at least one mod who literally doxxed other forums users to white supremacists.<p>On the whole though, the discussions there are a lot more civilized than on sites like Reddit. I think the small entry fee is part of it, but also thanks to an active moderation team and the standard policy being to put people in timeout first, instead of insta-banning for any offence.<p>Obviously there are differing views on how well it actually works, leading to various spin-off forums, with different policies and philosophies.')
