I mean, it&#x27;s a similar problem to what Google faces with people trying to game search results, or get spam through filters. And while they obviously struggle and it takes serious resources, they are mostly successful. Really seems like Amazon just doesn&#x27;t care since they don&#x27;t have enough competition to give them sufficient motive.')
