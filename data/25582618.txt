Is it going to be a problem? We do not know.<p>This professor doesn&#x27;t know about how much of the sequence is copied. He doesn&#x27;t know the widespread affect of mRNA vaccines because we&#x27;re in new territory here and it&#x27;s possible that the risk of autoimmune responses is higher with such vaccines. He should know better than to equate mRNA vaccines with more traditional vaccines.<p>With <i>every</i> vaccine, a small percentage of people suffer adverse and autoimmune effects.<p>As that professor well knows, we&#x27;re NOT discussing possibility (with that billions of people lined up, it&#x27;s all but inevitable). Instead, we&#x27;re discussing PROBABILITY that it will happen and how many people will be adversely affected.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the vaccine is bad or that people should freak out and not get vaccinated (even some vaccines with high complication rates have historically been much more helpful than harmful). I&#x27;m pointing out that while the intentions of the professor may be good, they&#x27;re definitely not speaking the absolute truth and aren&#x27;t actually in a position to know all the actual details about the vaccine.')
