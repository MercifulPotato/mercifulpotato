The people hired were sales people and they just increased the faucet of requests to the product managers who treated everyone like slaves anyways.<p>Despite having the funds to slow down just a tad and do things the right way, you&#x27;ll find the overfunded startups use their funds to put into hiring salespeople marketing and people on the business side who have been successful selling companies or preparing then for an IPO, and the number of engineers hired during this time is logarithmic in proportion to the exponential growth elsewhere. A recipe for disaster when the PMs are slave drivers all the same but everyone is asking for more all of the time.<p>I&#x27;ve personally never worked under a PM who cared about the team, and I&#x27;m my opinion who cared about the product. I think they cared about their ego and seeming important and the idea of taking input from someone they perceived should be providing then requested output perhaps subconsciously threatened their idea of how everyone else might perceive them as being critical to the team. They were critical to the team. They just screwed it up by being so caught up in their egos about maintaining being in control and being right they lost sight of very objectively how their behavior could be putting the technical development and business development of the product at risk.<p>For whatever reason people with massive egos who can control people is often valued more than the value of whatever output is produced by that. It must be deeply psychological, and for me of course as a woman, I could never be successful as a PM because if I acted the way the men I&#x27;ve worked for did I would be called a raging bitch, because that&#x27;s exactly what they were in my opinion. For whatever reason in makes this behavior is rewarded. Very bizarre indeed.')
