To make a sacrifice implies giving up something one wants <i>voluntarily</i>. If I rob you that&#x27;s not a sacrifice, you had no choice.<p>There are clearly a ton of people who are unwilling to &quot;voluntarily give up&quot; <i>anything,</i> and they&#x27;ve given things up only when forced to, i.e. by restaurant or school closures. There are many more who make vague gestures towards responsible behavior but refuse to do anything that would incur any actual inconvenience.<p>I wish it were true that everyone has made sacrifices, but I&#x27;m afraid we haven&#x27;t achieved that level of civic responsibility, not by a mile.')
