Compete?<p>I mean just looking at the aerospace sector and the CSeries saga, Trudeau immediately bowed down to Trump when tariffs were imposed, despite later being thrown out in courts. All he did was to basically threaten to not buy Boeing fighter jets and instead get f35 from Lockheed (which he was contractually obligated to anyways). No support for the industry, nothing. And that was for a flagship prestige technological project.<p>I still don&#x27;t understand why he reacted so submissively to Trump. Having the CSeries sold to Airbus at a huge discount was foolish: The plane already had a profitable amount of orders. Now Europeans are reaping the benefits.<p>Canadian politicians even pitched Vancouver as an ideal HQ2 location since tech workers are worth ~50K less than in America[0]. I mean I&#x27;m all for it, my comp being stock-based I&#x27;m pocketing the difference.<p>Is that something the Canadian public... approves of?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vancouvereconomic.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;Vancouver-Amazon-HQ2-Proposal-Feb-2018.pdf?utm_source=Website&amp;utm_medium=Button&amp;utm_campaign=AmazonHQ2Download&amp;utm_content=ViewPDF" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vancouvereconomic.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02...</a>')
