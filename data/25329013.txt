Item(by='neogodless', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607310844, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25328914, text='I certainly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to <i>be</i> a competitor to Apple. (I&#x27;m a consumer, instead.) Of course, the landscape has changed, and the iPhone absolutely disrupted the industry. These days, I believe the only big Android options are Google, Samsung, and a handful of smaller players such as (the new) Motorola, LG, OnePlus, etc. As a consumer, I don&#x27;t really care (for now) who profits or doesn&#x27;t - I&#x27;m still deciding between all these phones. (Others only consider Apple or <i>not</i> Apple.)<p>The discussion above was specifically about how the advance in performance of the A7[0] in 2013 changed things. Honestly I don&#x27;t know the numbers for market or profit share in 2013 to compare to now, but for <i>consumers</i> the decisions are not wildly different, except for someone specifically comparing phones on CPU performance alone, and ignoring the other differences. Of course, some will also be affected by Apple&#x27;s marketing of &quot;the fastest smartphones&quot; and that helps with selling phones.<p>To apply this to laptops is, in my opinion, much trickier. Now I can&#x27;t speak for all consumers considering purchasing a laptop, but as technical as I am, performance&#x2F;watt is not my number one consideration. It kind of is, indirectly, an important one. I don&#x27;t want a hot, loud laptop, and I want <i>some</i> battery life. But things like playing demanding games, or compiling code with as many cores as I can throw at it are more important to me. That and price, being able to upgrade RAM and SSDs when the need arises, etc.<p>So I have a $950 laptop with a dedicated GPU, 8 cores, 16GB RAM, 1TB NVME SSD, and I can add RAM and another NVME SSD when the need arises. Of course, I only get about 4 hours of battery life, and I&#x27;d love more, but it isn&#x27;t going to change my life much either way (it&#x27;s freezing outside, I am almost always within range of an outlet!), and I can&#x27;t give up all the other things that this laptop has that an M1 Macbook lacks, even if the performance&#x2F;watt is much better.')
