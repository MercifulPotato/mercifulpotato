Under the hood the TS compiler in incremental multi-project builds still essentially builds the equivalent of minimal DTS information for projects, but it caches it in a build file that&#x27;s more compiler-internal oriented than the externally shareable DTS.<p>A developer with clean&#x2F;fresh clones would still notice a big performance difference, but amortized over a number of builds it might not matter in general practice. In theory at least, as Bloomberg notes projects and incremental builds are still newish and don&#x27;t yet always have the performance characteristics they should have in the wild. That said, the impression is that a lot driving projects&#x2F;incremental compiles is monorepos in Microsoft (at the very least) that have moved to&#x2F;are moving to monorepos that are entirely TS only builds with few&#x2F;no DTS intermediaries. (That&#x27;s just me reading between the lines, of course, I could be mistaken.) The drive behind projects&#x2F;incremental compiles sounds like it is attempts at massive scales of TS files.')
