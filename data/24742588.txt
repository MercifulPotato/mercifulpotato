During a fillup the turbulent flow of the fuel causes quite a build-up of vapours that need to be redirected.<p>Persistent fuel overfilling causes fuel to flow into the vent valve, and over time, it clogs. Once clogged, the vapour has no outlet and bubbles up through the main opening, causing the overflow you see on your Mustangs. It’s not the pump’s fault, although the problem is exacerbated when the nozzle does not fit fully into the tank. Car manufacturers always tell people to stop filling after the first click, but most people tend to overfill their tanks regardless. I’m guilty of this too.<p>Source: Prior stint as a gas jockey and station manager')
