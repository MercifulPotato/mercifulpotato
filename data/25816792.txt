It&#x27;s how you end up with these blackhole gov programs in the first place.<p>Extremely wasteful space programs at least typically get justified as also a) &#x27;inspiring&#x27; kids into STEM + b) providing national pride. But when all you get in return is decades of doing nothing interesting I doubt many kids will be inspired. And after so many years and getting blown by competitively by private industry turns it into a national embarrassment (even things exploding is more interesting than what they&#x27;ve produced the last few decades with this program).<p>When you factor in the opportunity cost, aka the alternative ares NOT getting &quot;jobs programs&quot;, or rather the capital investment, like infrastructure or healthcare or a hundred other possibilities. Things which can employ plenty of blue collar rust-belt workers into jobs that directly support the needs of modern industry who funds these tax paid adventures (ie, transit&#x2F;railways, electric grid, broadband, etc). Stuff that supports and underpins the new &#x27;knowledge based economy&#x27; instead of drawing resources away from it.<p>Not to mention providing a stopgap to a &#x27;lost generation&#x27; of former typically-unionized industrial workers who couldn&#x27;t compete globally after the 1980s  when they could have been provided some critical time while their kids adapt and get education&#x2F;skills needed for the new self-sustaining, productive, and heavily automated&#x2F;software driven industries that the developed world has transitioned too.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;o&#x2F;opportunitycost.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;o&#x2F;opportunitycost.asp</a>')
