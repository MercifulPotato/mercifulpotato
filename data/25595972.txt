Their call to me was silenced even though I had called the same number minutes earlier to check in.<p>So now I’ve moved to aggressively adding numbers to my contacts for any business I interact with (auto dealership, vet, pet groomer, etc). Which isn’t terrible but it feels like this could get smarter at some point.')
