You normally flip with your right hand, but when it comes up tails you try again with your left. About half the time, your left succeeds where your right fails, therefore your left hand is better at flipping coins. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a name for that bias? (Notice that you could do it in reverse and draw the reverse conclusion - the same goes for Google and DDG.)<p>To actually compare them, you&#x27;d need to do the same searches on both, not just the ones where DDG did poorly.')
