Item(by='scythe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607438838, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25343057, text='&gt;The result of this is a flexible, stretchable battery with an areal capacity of 50 milliamps per square centimeter, which the team says is 10 to 20 times greater than that of a typical lithium-ion battery. All up, the team says the device can provide five to 10 times more <i>power</i> than a typical lithium-ion battery of the same size.<p>Inaccurate title: the Zn&#x2F;AgO battery has up to ten times the spatial <i>power</i> density of lithium-ion, which is useful but hardly new, being exceeded by most supercapacitors. It does not, however, have ten times the <i>energy</i> density, which is a much more difficult bar to reach.<p>It probably has a good energy density, as do all silver-zinc batteries, but there&#x27;s no indication here that the energy density is dramatically higher than when these batteries were used on the Apollo missions in the &#x27;60s. They&#x27;re just flexible now (which is nice).')
