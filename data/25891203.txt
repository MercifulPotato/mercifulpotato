The usual justification given is how much simpler each individual entity now is, glossing over the extra complexity introduced by integrating all of those separate entities.<p>Microservice architectures seem to be a recurring example of this phenomenon. Separating medium to long functions into shorter ones based on arbitrary metrics like line count or nesting depth is another.')
