Make something cool and release it under any license which I feel like. <i>Ruthlessly</i> limit the project scope so I can finish it while still having fun and learning interesting things. (This means <i>completely</i> finished; documented, optimized for performance, and exhaustively tested with close to zero bugs remaining.) Then:<p>- Be very clear on the project page about what people can expect in terms of support and timely bugfixes. Let people make their decision to use the project or not, with knowledge of how much time and energy I am ready to give. Politely refuse to go beyond what has been stated.<p>- Make whatever amount of money I need through other means.<p>- Use the knowledge I gained from making said &quot;cool thing&quot; to make other cool things (whether for fun or for money).<p>- With a glint in my eye, reminisce about the great times spent hacking on computer code and all the fascinating discoveries made.')
