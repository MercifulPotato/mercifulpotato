I wasn&#x27;t really trying to be accurate, I think we&#x27;d need to look at an exponential as the R value drops as the already infected rate goes up? Not sure... :)<p>Isn&#x27;t the R0 for &quot;no restrictions&quot; something like 15? So I&#x27;d guess we&#x27;d need 93%? But I also have seen figures from 50 to 95% quoted for herd immunity so who knows?')
