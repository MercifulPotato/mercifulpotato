I don&#x27;t know what happened prior to that date to make the Bytecode Alliance members want to &quot;veto&quot; you as you put it, and maybe you&#x27;re entirely blameless for that. As you point out, your trademark shenanigans hadn&#x27;t taken place yet. But saying the &quot;veto of Wasmer happened the same day it was announced&quot; is misleading at best.</i><p>I think you misunderstood. I meant that Wasmer itself was vetoed from joining the Bytecode Alliance the same day that the Bytecode Alliance was announced. Wasmer was founded way before (as a company and a open-source project).<p><i>&gt; But you appear to be quite bad at getting along with people.</i><p>It&#x27;s curious this is the impression caused. I&#x27;m definitely not someone with low social skills.<p>EDIT: added an extra response')
