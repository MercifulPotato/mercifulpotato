You obviously can live on peanuts and be happy if your expenses are low.<p>At a different stage of life with more responsibilities and a family, you need more to be happy but it&#x27;s still within reach of a household income in the low six figures if you&#x27;re smart about where you live and not upgrading your lifestyle beyond what&#x27;s easily sustainable.
