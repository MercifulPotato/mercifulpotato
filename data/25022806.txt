His motivation was to see Canada. He also shipped all his stuff by bus, but we had to pick it up later. I remember losing my rental car keys in the mountains and talking the agency into shipping them to Lk. Louise where I retrieved the parcel and boarded the bus back to West Louise. The driver dropped me off at the turn-off.<p>Sadly Greyhound dropped their Western Canada services and none of this is now possible. Saskatchewan dropped their rural bus service not long ago; so granny has to hitchhike to see the doctor.')
