Item(by='robotresearcher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607554862, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25366295, text='&gt; with unique and futuristic products<p>... that hasn&#x27;t found a scalable business model in 28 years of operation. Hence the low valuation despite great tech.<p>I seriously admire their work and it&#x27;s great that they&#x27;ve been able to fund it in various ways when almost all the robot businesses come and go quickly. They&#x27;ve been able to grind away at very hard problems. But so far no scalable product.<p>I hope they (and the mobile robot business in general) finds some more killer apps after weapons, vacuums, warehousing and (almost) cars. They seem to come along pretty slowly.')
