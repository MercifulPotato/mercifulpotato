I mean, look at Philadelphia right now. There&#x27;s a convention center where they&#x27;re counting <i>hundreds of thousands of ballots</i>. That&#x27;s not only insane but idiotic. There are 66 wards in the city[0], those are further divided into a total of 1,703 voting districts. The city population is around 1.5 million - that&#x27;s less than 940 ballots per district, which you can count in a day. There&#x27;s no reason the same people watching the polls couldn&#x27;t have been counting the mail in ballots on Wednesday and Thursday.<p>The fact that everybody is cheering Philadelphia for only taking 4 days to count a couple hundred thousand ballots is just silly.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;files7.philadelphiavotes.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;ward-maps&#x2F;Wards_Streets.pdf#_ga=2.163338428.101029362.1604684944-514526226.1604684944" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;files7.philadelphiavotes.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;ward-maps&#x2F;Wards_St...</a>')
