Item(by='mikem170', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609972589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25654614, text='I didn&#x27;t mean to disparage the people in Florida, or the quality of life in general. But I do think it would be a lot better if so many people didn&#x27;t have to deal with so much traffic.<p>I think it&#x27;s a problem the way that cities have grown via sprawl over the past few decades, and a lot of southern cities have grown a lot during that time. Apparently it&#x27;s more profitable to build further out instead of infilling, and build housing developments instead of integrated neighbourhoods. It&#x27;s depressing to see apartment complexes with sidewalks to nowhere and nothing to do but drive a couple&#x2F;few miles to the nearest applebees or whatever.<p>I think the problem with crazy drivers comes with the amount and density of traffic, the long commutes, the divided highways with people driving well over the already fast speed limits while people are pulling in and out of plazas, etc. This can be brutal for the people who need to deal with that every day.<p>The neighborhoods in older cities, or older parts of cities, tend to be grids of various sized roads dispersing traffic as opposed to cul-de-sacs funnelling everyone in and out of their complexes and developments onto a couple of congested main roads.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in a northern city, much of it built before the automobile, but not anywhere as crowded as Chicago or NYC.<p>I&#x27;m not personally bitter, except for maybe zoning laws that don&#x27;t allow for more density. I&#x27;ve had a work form home job for quite a while, and haven&#x27;t had to deal much with bad traffic. I do feel sad for the people I know who have to commute more than an hour in bad traffic, I feel sad for the working poor who struggle to keep a car on the road, I feel sad for the kids in some of these places who need a ride to see any of their friends, the teenagers with nowhere to hang out besides the Waffle House parking lot, etc.')
