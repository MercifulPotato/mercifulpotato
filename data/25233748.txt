Consider that urban areas are entirely designed around the fact that fossil fuel transportation creates a lot of poisonous emissions.  Once fossil fuel transportation is removed from city centers streets can be covered in poor weather, parking can be enclosed, street capacity can be multiplied by several times if e-bikes are popular.  There are a lot of wins under this scenario.')
