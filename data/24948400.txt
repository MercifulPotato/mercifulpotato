There&#x27;s an etcd client for node which doesn&#x27;t seem to be actively maintained, and I only needed a few things out of etcd, so I figured I&#x27;d just generate a gRPC client and build my own library [0] to do what I needed.  This was not fun.  I got all kinds of crazy errors about missing definitions, and I ended up having to copy paste .proto files from a bunch of random google projects into my repo to make this all work.  Maybe I&#x27;m just doing it completely wrong?  :P<p>[0](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jwalton&#x2F;etcd3-ts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jwalton&#x2F;etcd3-ts</a>)')
