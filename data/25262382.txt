It didn&#x27;t work and my ego made me not admit it wasn&#x27;t working far longer than I wish I had spent on it.<p>It was all a very humbling experience.<p>In the future<p>1) recruiting at least 1 other person to work on anything like a startup with me. The bar for me is can I get at least 1 other person to work on this and do I have a plan to get to the first 5? If not I&#x27;m not doing it.<p>Worse case you build a great team and have a good time with them making something and hopefully get acqihired or better. If you&#x27;re by yourself and it doesn&#x27;t work out you&#x27;re likely just getting another job...<p>2) Recognize what your strengths are and recruit to fill in the gaps. You only have 24 hours in a day 6 to 8 of which you are sleeping if you want to be effective for the rest at all... So even if you were a super hero at all the things you need to be to make a business successful (hint: you wont be) you will run out of time in the day if you can&#x27;t get other people to help.<p>If you can&#x27;t get ^ in your own project join other people&#x27;s projects until you can.')
