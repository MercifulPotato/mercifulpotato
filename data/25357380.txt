Item(by='NieDzejkob', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607511768, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25346456, text='I haven&#x27;t exactly read many this year, but I really liked &quot;An Answer to the Bose-Nelson Sorting Problem for 11 and 12 Channels&quot; [1]. It describes many interesting algorithmic tricks to establish a lower bound for an easy to understand problem. Not exactly immediately practical, but still very interesting.<p>Note that it has been published on arXiv just yesterday; I helped review an earlier draft.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2012.04400" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2012.04400</a>')
