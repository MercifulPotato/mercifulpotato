At that point though, one would probably have to worry about other attacks, like physical intrusion and kidnapping as well.<p>This isn&#x27;t uncommon for Bitcoin hardware wallets, fwiw.<p>But the problem is that the short what you know challenge isn&#x27;t very secure if the edge device is compromised and can&#x27;t impose rate limiting or maximum-try limits.<p>I think for auth I&#x27;d rather have yubi&#x2F;fingerprint + password. Yes, the host could still the password, but even if the yubi is completely backdoored you still have a credible amount of security.<p>It would be better still if the fingerprint mechanism were cryptographic. But it&#x27;s probably pretty hard to fit a lot of fancy code in such a small device,  -- and security is something of a lemon market (see also zoom&#x27;s &quot;end to end&quot;).<p>I think people should be extremely wary of efforts to turn U2f devices into single factor authentication.  If intelligence agencies haven&#x27;t compromised yubico or at least developed a good program to substitute devices in the mail-- then they ought to be fired.')
