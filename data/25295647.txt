It&#x27;s enough to get a house at $1m but you&#x27;ll be somewhat house poor. You have to assume they haven&#x27;t been saving at $180+$80k that entire time unless you&#x27;re assuming they&#x27;re late 30&#x27;s.<p>9% down isn&#x27;t common for Bay Area btw. 30-45% of all homes are bought with cash (higher value the property - higher the all cash offer %). Do you think those numbers are like that in other parts of the country? Do you think you can get by with &lt;10% down for a jumbo loan? The people I know who bought here have either paid all cash or had to put down even more than 20%.<p>We haven&#x27;t even discussed what a $1m home gets you here. I wouldn&#x27;t buy a $1m home here. You will not get a nice home or neighborhood. Minimum $1.5m to break into the decent neighborhoods. Want something resembling what the rest of the professional middle class has? At least $2m+.')
