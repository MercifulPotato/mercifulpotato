Don&#x27;t worry about my daughter, she gets ten hours a week of private art instruction.<p>That&#x27;s unrelated to her fifth-grade art class, though. During a pandemic, it seems wise that her school is mostly eschewing requiring paper, and especially not counting on every student&#x27;s home having a printer.')
