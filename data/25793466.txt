A screen, a keyboard, there&#x27;s not a ton of headroom for adding widgets or decreasing sizes in the physical domain. Plus, there is such a thing as &quot;timeless design&quot;, and you can see that Apple has already achieved it by the fact that most other laptop vendors are converging on their MacBook designs that are a few years old now. Apple itself took inspiration from timeless, modern and functional industrial design found in things like Braun appliances from the 1960s which, by the way, still look modern today.')
