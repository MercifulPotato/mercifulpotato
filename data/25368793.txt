Your post doesn&#x27;t make sense. She didn&#x27;t fly the plane into people by her own hands. She didn&#x27;t order her pilot to murder people in a failed bid to take-off.<p>You reject the very concept of the religion you criticize. If you have a problem with magic soap labels then I can agree, I don&#x27;t believe magic soap labes matter too. That&#x27;s not what religion is.<p>I fail to see how attending a religious appointment is a crime. Did she skip out on handing out food? Did she miss her chance to pass out medicine? What concrete thing could she have done to save her people?<p>Your post is way over the line of sanity. Being angry that religion exists in the face of suffering isn&#x27;t a valid criticism of theresa. Criticize the lack of solutions to the problem, by the people who were responsible. The rest is insane bleatings.')
