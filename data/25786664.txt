Just not as a build system.<p>If you have a project where you need to do a thing, you can instead make a Makefile to do the thing:<p><pre><code>    thing:\n        some shell command\n</code></pre>\nthat&#x27;s it, now you get to type `make thing`.<p>The power is the generality: it can wrap any command, from jq to curl to whatever. It&#x27;s perfect for small, weird workflows which don&#x27;t naturally fit into other build systems.<p>But don&#x27;t use it for C++!')
