I found their online prescription renewal system allowed me to access other people’s prescriptions. I warned them  about this and they threatened to report me to the police. I found this out because I couldn’t click the link in my mail client on my phone at the time so I typed the URL in incorrectly on my desktop PC.<p>So I moved doctors and reported them to the ICO. Never heard anything back but their web site disappeared for a month after a couple of weeks. I’d like to think they were fined but I don’t think that actually happened.<p>This was some piece of shit they had paid a local web design company, the lowest bidder, to put together. It was PHP, hosted in the USA on a shared server and didn’t even have TLS enabled.')
