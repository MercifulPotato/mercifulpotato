In college I worked at the Humane Society and helped with the dogs. Very hard work. After working there I realized how most &quot;breeders&quot; are just random blokes with an AKC pure bread who get some dogs together. Some real breeders who monitor trace genetics and try to make the breed better exist, but these dogs usually cost a lot of money, and have specific purposes and customers. Sometimes I wonder if dog ownership should require a license and semi hefty fee (make it more a kin to adoption). But I am not sure...<p>Disclaimer: I have a dog.')
