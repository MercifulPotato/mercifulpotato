Item(by='klmadfejno', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610372859, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25725639, text='NPS stands for Net Promoter Score. It&#x27;s supposed to get a sense of % favorable - % unfavorable and leaving out the middle.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this at many companies and its one of my biggest pet peeves. Almost nobody uses it correctly. They don&#x27;t net anything. They take the average. It&#x27;s not clear at all why it&#x27;s any different from any other score. I think most people think its some sort of collection or measurement thing rather than a calculation on the data. I hate it. Reeks of innumeracy.<p>Not that it really matters if you use average vs. nps...')
