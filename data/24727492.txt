Taylor fears a decision that would result in no longer being married to their spouse, which would lead to problems with medical insurance, child custody, finances, etc. Taylor doesn&#x27;t feel safe working with someone who actively wishes to destroy a meaningful part of their life.<p>Taylor asks the company to make a statement supporting their right to have married their partner.<p>Blake says that Taylor is creating a hostile and toxic work environment.<p>Is Blake right? Or is Taylor acting in self defensive, in response to an already-hostile and already-toxic work environment? Is the discomfort felt by Blake acceptable &quot;collateral damage&quot;?<p>Do your answers change if the hypothetical scenario is not about a same-sex couple in 2020 following Obergefell, but an interracial couple in California in 1950 following the ruling of anti-miscegenation laws as unconstitutional?')
