We were all bigging this up in 2011 when protestors in Tahrir Square overthrew the military government of Egypt demanding a less repressive one.<p>Unfortunately fewer people paid attention to the followup: the subsequent (apparently free and fair) elections were won by the Islamist party, who immediately tried to impose an Islamist constitution that was in many ways even more repressive. That led to a coup <i>again</i>, effectively going back to a military dictatorship. How it&#x27;s going now: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hrw.org&#x2F;world-report&#x2F;2020&#x2F;country-chapters&#x2F;egypt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hrw.org&#x2F;world-report&#x2F;2020&#x2F;country-chapters&#x2F;egypt</a><p>Merely having free speech and free elections is not enough to ensure that people don&#x27;t elect a repressive government. The liberal values need to be more widely embedded in the society, and more work needs to be done to counter propaganda and the inevitable racism and religious bigotry and supremacism that leads to unfree governments.<p>It has also been very convenient for the West to not pay attention to Turkey during the Syria crisis, while they engage in what look like proxy actions on our behalf against Syrian and Russian (and unfortunately Kurdish) forces. And host something like <i>three million</i> refugees.')
