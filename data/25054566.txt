I imagine if that were the case most of these people would realize what they&#x27;re paying for doesn&#x27;t even approach being a shadow of the real thing. This is a group that would benefit a lot from some sort of self love&#x2F;self care messaging but I don&#x27;t even know what that would look like if it were tailored to this group.<p>I also kind of feel for all the people who signed up to sell nudes on onlyfans thinking they&#x27;d make a quick buck and ended up playing therapist for a bunch of lonely maladjusted dudes.')
