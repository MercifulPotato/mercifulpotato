I can also absolutely recognize that most people complaining about them don&#x27;t seem to articulate their reasoning well or in some cases at all.<p>In the article, Matt claims<p>&gt;There&#x27;s a lot more that you have to do than just break them up. But the answer is, it would improve things dramatically if they were broken up, and you don&#x27;t have to imagine it.<p>Facebook has been doing their practices that deserve criticism before they became a &quot;financial conglomerate&quot;. If they are broken up, they will not stop poisoning people&#x27;s news feed overnight. Things will NOT dramatically improve.<p>In fact I believe if Facebook is forced to break off instagram and other companies, things may get worse. They would need to try harder to make more revenue using less users &#x2F; screen time.<p>Breaking up Facebook would most likely be a good thing, but I personally believe as long the news feed exists, the negatives that Facebook brings will be there.')
