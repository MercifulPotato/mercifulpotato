Somehow homeschooling creates Lake Wobegone, a place where every child manages to be above average.<p>The reality is more homeschooling is completely unregulated in the majority of states, so people can do almost anything.<p>Most states require no formal education from the parents at all to teach. Many don&#x27;t require any form of assessment or to keep a portfolio or records of education. Some have required subjects but no real enforcement of them being taught. Any form of standardized testing or auditing may not even be required. If you wanted to keep your kid at home and not educate them at all, you could easily do it in most states.<p>Would you really bet a system like we have now would provide better outcomes overall?')
