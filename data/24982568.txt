I&#x27;m on the fence about if this is a good idea or not. I feel like when you are starting at zero, you need more e2e tests, before writing more unit&#x2F;service tests as your product is solidified.<p>I wish e2e tests were faster. I feel like this should be achievable, but it&#x27;s a problem way out of my depths. I feel like you could run a browser within a docker container at 2x or 5x speed with enough virtualization. I&#x27;ve been told this would not work in practice.')
