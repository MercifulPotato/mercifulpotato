This in itself is not so bad, but coupled with the lack of any guarantees around API stability means that it can be a very tricky dependency to work with. This problem is compounded by it only being possible to link one version of Ring in to the same program.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t depend on Ring directly, Ring could appear as a dependency of many of your dependencies. This forces you into upgrading all of your Ring-depending dependencies in lockstep. You cannot upgrade any until <i>all</i> of these dependencies support the same latest version of Ring.<p>This is a real shame because Ring otherwise looks fantastic. The API is misuse resistant and looks quite pleasant, and the documentation is thorough. Its current versioning and stability policy however is a massive liability for any project that relies on it. I hope this changes eventually.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;briansmith&#x2F;ring#versioning--stability" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;briansmith&#x2F;ring#versioning--stability</a>')
