They&#x27;re effective, even when benzodiazepines haven&#x27;t been, but the side-effects are concerning. On multiple occasions, I&#x27;ve woken up and the room appears to bathed in a yellow light (even though no lights were on and it was still dark outside), and on a few occasions I&#x27;ve been looking at the time on my phone, blinked, and it&#x27;s suddenly four hours later. I&#x27;ve no idea whether I just fell back asleep and checked the time again, four hours passed and I did _something_, or it just made me misremember the first time. They&#x27;re not drugs I would use lightly.<p>Benzodiazepines on the other hand I&#x27;ve had no issues with (no desire&#x2F;need to increase the dose, no withdrawal even when I&#x27;ve been taking them for prolonged periods, no side effects), but I don&#x27;t find them as effective. I have seen the destructive effects they can have though - a family member had to taper off them over six months, and at the end she was cutting the smallest dose tablets into quarters as she still couldn&#x27;t quite get off them.')
