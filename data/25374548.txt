I asked the director -- in the snarky way that certain entitled junior employees have -- what he actually did in his job. He laughed and explained that his job was to make sure senior management understood what we were doing and were onboard with why we were doing it. Nobody gave me any talking points and I was too green to worry about the political ramifications of my snark... and there weren&#x27;t any. It was just a half hour opportunity to talk to someone I didn&#x27;t usually get a chance to talk to. I now realize that this company, or maybe just that department, was a particularly healthy place to work.')
