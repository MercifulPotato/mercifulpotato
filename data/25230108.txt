It allows the user to modify the page as they see fit. For example, ad blockers or &quot;dark mode&quot; extensions would have a much more difficult job if websites were delivered as optimized binaries.<p>I specify &quot;on the web&quot; because almost all browsers execute the content retrieved from the website with no user interaction besides navigating to a url. Contrast that with operating systems, which all require separate download + run steps (and often a bit flip in between, to mark the file as executable). That&#x27;s a lot more friction &#x2F; time for the user to notice if something is not as they expect or want.')
