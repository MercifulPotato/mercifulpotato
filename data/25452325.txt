He had to set up a room just right, and the space had to be completely empty or you&#x27;d smack into things. I even smacked into a wall where some sensor wasn&#x27;t calibrated right.<p>Even the economics of dedicating a large, empty space for VR means it&#x27;s mostly for &quot;rich&quot; people. You could be middle class in the &#x27;burbs and pull the car out of the garage to do VR... But what if you live in a tiny SF or NYC apartment? What about even denser living conditions outside of the US?')
