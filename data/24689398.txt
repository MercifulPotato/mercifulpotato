The term changes historically post success.  It becomes revisionism.<p>Going from 0 to 1 requires a ton of luck, but really the it&#x27;s the belief that outsiders are wrong about the statistical odds from going from 0 to 1 and sticking with it till it works or you break.  It takes an unreasonable personality to get there and then that unreasonable personality has to adapt to a more measured one to protect the turf. Its ironic but the sword that gets most startups early success kills it eventually.<p>Innovation in general is hard to do without outlier personalties in this realm.<p>I dont have a great solution, but I can confidently say that unreasonable people both change the world and torture loved ones.')
