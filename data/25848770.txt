I have quite a few others, Pentax, Minolta, and Yashica that I like.<p>For digital, I have a Google Pixel phone and the camera takes good quality photos.<p>For a dedicated digital camera, I really like a lot of the compact mirrorless cameras out there. I like the Nikons and have some experience with the Sony Alpha cameras and have few complaints. Usually complaints boil down to how a person relates to the interface and whether or not the camera has the features a person wants.')
