And the more I think about how much of a bodge the way we communicate is, the more impressed I am we can have conversations at all. All those layers of indirection, wtf?<p>But of course for almost every layer of indirection there is a safety net, that assures the meaning of what is said is passed on: If I mumble, my body language will help you figure out what I&#x27;m trying to say. If write gbbrsh sntce, context make you understand. And if you can&#x27;t hear me, you can probably make out what I&#x27;m saying by lip reading.')
