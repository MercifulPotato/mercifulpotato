In two field studies in New York City, we make critical information salient by redesigning the summons form and providing text message reminders. These interventions reduce failures to appear by 13-21% and lead to 30,000 fewer arrest warrants over a 3-year period.<p>Holy shit! Sending TEXTS causes the police to issue 30,000 less arrests?<p>From the article:<p>&gt; Over 10 million people are arrested each year in the United States, and millions more are issued summonses that draw them into the criminal justice system and require court appearances.<p>Let&#x27;s move that from passive to active tense:<p>Law enforcement agencies arrest 10 million people every year in the United States.<p>Has Google arrested even 1% of that number? Why or why not?')
