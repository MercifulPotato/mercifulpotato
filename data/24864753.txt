How on earth can you call that merely &quot;unethical, arguably evil&quot;? How can not call that a freaking crisis? Millions of addicts that you can&#x27;t get off their substance without terrible suffering? Sure, more things have to go wrong to let it get THIS bad, but once you get that many people hooked, you&#x27;re at least 90% there, because I really don&#x27;t think there is a way out that doesn&#x27;t imply immense suffering. This is a crime against humanity, not just an &quot;unethical&quot; business move.')
