You deploy a runner and configure it to use SSH. Then it won’t use containers at all and instead use SSH.<p>The same is true for configuring the runner in a shell capacity. You can then reuse the same environments over and over just like Jenkins does.<p>As for Maven and NodeJS if you’re using containers, you simply build a dockerimage with those baked in, and use it for your builds. GitLab also has container storage that allows your images to work seem less and quickly with the runners.<p>For independent tasks without commits. You can easily configure a gitlab job to trigger only if a pipeline variable is present. Then trigger the pipeline via HTTP POST Request, via the UI or vi an event.<p>I talk about and demonstrate all of these topics on my blog www.lackastack.com - Shameless plug, but I hope it helps.')
