I&#x27;ve also reinstalled windows 10 and reset my pixel 3a android phone. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping. The malware still seems to be there. I think I need a malware removal or malware analyst service that can remove really bad malware. Places like geek squad and micro center would probably not be of any help, I&#x27;ve tried scanning with a lot of popular anti-virus software and it doesn&#x27;t detect anything, I might have something called FUD (fully undetectable) malware but I&#x27;m not sure if this is the right terminology.<p>Bitdefender and malwarebytes have also thrown notifications about suspicious connection being blocked when I went to popular websites (like google or flipboard.com) that should be safe. It feels like the attacker is triggering the notifications as a way to intimidate me, as if the attacker has access to my computer and phone and is violating my privacy and this is a way of reminding me of that.<p>Also Google looked really different a while ago like a 90s version of Google, and text on Google showed up in other languages, and asian (chinese, japanese, or similar) profiles show up on dating sites and apps often, these are not profiles of normal asian people. Thank you.')
