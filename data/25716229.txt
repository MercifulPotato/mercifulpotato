That’s never damaged the seasoning, but removes any caked on burned bits of food that dull the pan. I read on &#x2F;r&#x2F;castiron that the idea of soap being damaging is a hold over from when lye based soap was commonly used for dishes. Modern dish <i>detergent</i> isn’t going to cause the same damage. The other thing that helped was getting a straight metal spatula to really scrape the pan which has resulted in a smoother surface over time.')
