It&#x27;s mostly about which asset can capture most of the newly printed fiat money now and in the future.<p>New fiat currency is constantly being created and all assets are competing for the biggest possible chunk of that new money.<p>The reason why crypto is doing well comes down to a contrast between monetary abundance and scarcity. Some people in this world have access to an essentially infinite supply of fiat currency at 0 risk... So fiat currency is not worth anything to these people; so if these people start buying some scarce resource, they will quickly realize that it will drive up the price of that resource ad infinitum. The only other variable is how hard people HODL the asset.<p>If enough of these people buy up the same scarce resource, the growth of that scarce resource will outpace that of all other scarce resources.')
