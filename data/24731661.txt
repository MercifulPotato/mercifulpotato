And that was well after clap had already become the popular &quot;go to&quot; solution.<p>Some parts of the ecosystem are more stable than others. That&#x27;s true. And it takes work to know which things are stable and which aren&#x27;t.<p>And yet, some things just take a longer time to improve. lazy_static has been stable and unchanged for a very long time and it works just fine. You don&#x27;t need to switch to once_cell if you don&#x27;t want to. lazy_static isn&#x27;t going anywhere. The real change here, I think, is that we&#x27;re hoping to get a portion of once_cell into std so that you don&#x27;t need a dependency at all for it.<p>The async ecosystem is definitely moving more quickly because it just hasn&#x27;t had that much time to stabilize. If you&#x27;re using async in Rust right now then you&#x27;re probably an early adopter and you&#x27;ll want to make sure you&#x27;re okay with the costs that come with that.')
