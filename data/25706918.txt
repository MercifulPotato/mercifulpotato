The US can&#x27;t stop China from taking Taiwan. 20 or 30 years ago it would have been very difficult to stop that, today it&#x27;s impossible. The US isn&#x27;t even ready yet for that confrontation, it needs to deploy a massive number of ballistic missiles along the island chain off the coast to have a chance to at least make it a costly annexation (targeting their navy, as the US navy won&#x27;t be able to get close enough).<p>China&#x27;s Deng Xiaoping strategy of hide your strength and bide your time, that&#x27;s a stall tactic to buy time (in that case the time between when something is actual and something is publicly known, a knowledge-time gap). The US placating China is also a stall tactic, hoping to buy time for a better scenario favoring the US and Taiwan more than China (for example a liberalized China, which was still a naive hope as recently as 10 years ago; that was always unlikely but it was better than driving China toward forced annexation sooner).')
