Also, racial slurs? You&#x27;re the first I&#x27;ve heard of racist slurs - I had only heard of people calling themselves&#x2F;the group retards and autists - meant in an endearing, self-deprecating humour kind of way. I&#x27;ve seen no instances of racism on &#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets - I really doubt on  their Discord they&#x27;d be allowing racism though.')
