The shaded part is the 80% confidence interval of each prediction. This is the historical graph form of the &quot;every outcome in our simulations&quot; chart underneath the dot chart. It should be noted that the dot chart at the top of the page does <i>kind of</i> outline the confidence interval (giving a realistic example of what kinds of outcomes might happen) but is obviously geared towards lay-people who don&#x27;t know what a confidence interval is.<p>&gt; We simulate the election 40,000 times to see who wins most often. The sample of 100 outcomes below gives you a good idea of the range of scenarios our model thinks is possible.<p>I think it would be better if the confidence intervals were better signposted, but it&#x27;s possible that only the electoral college win margins have solid confidence intervals (I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t know enough statistics to know if you could trivially transform the confidence intervals of the electoral college votes to win percentage). The senate and house predictions explicitly show the confidence interval in their main graphs.')
