When you see the title &quot;centering in CSS&quot; you know exactly what it means. It&#x27;s the same old problem everyone has been solving repeatedly for 20 years. It&#x27;s not about edge cases. It&#x27;s not about exceptions to rules self imposed by your specific needs. It&#x27;s just centering inside a box. And the author of the article knows this, and solves it again for us for the nth time with updated techniques.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t how complicated a layout is or needs to be. If you were to look at how horizontal center is implemented under the hood, it&#x27;s going to be complicated, yet that complexity is abstracted away.<p>It boils down to the simple fact that intuitively when we&#x27;ve had &lt;center&gt; forever, why couldn&#x27;t there have been a &lt;vcenter&gt; from the beginning? Not even broken, it never existed. It&#x27;s as if we&#x27;re being told, &quot;horizontal centering we&#x27;ll handle, but vertical centering is for you to figure out&quot;. Err, why? And figure out based on the tags and attributes provided. Like, they implemented the puzzle but not the solution.<p>Similarly, why can&#x27;t &quot;vertical-align: center&quot; just work more often? The fact that a div needs to be a table-cell or a grid, or having the option of using &lt;td&gt; that still works should all be redundant. There is nothing ambiguous about wanting to vertically center.<p>We&#x27;re always reverse engineering from a need. Complex needs justify complex code. Simple needs should be simple declarations.')
