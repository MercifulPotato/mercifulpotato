While there&#x27;s environmental destruction of this area, it&#x27;s the size of half of SF proper. The possibility is that a megopolis can be erected on top of it, with the density and height of downtown SF. This would be a clean slate to house 5m+ people, a new New York, and completely unwind the supply-side issues of housing in the US, effectively lowering house prices and rent across the entire country.\nBack to the net-effect on the environment; while the local wildlife would suffer, the benefits of reduced emissions and sprawl elsewhere on the globe would be immense. Imagine the de-carbonization that would occur elsewhere with plentiful, dense, and cheap housing and jobs in this area.')
