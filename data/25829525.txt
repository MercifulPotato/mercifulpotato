Item(by='Pxtl', descendants=None, kids=[25829873], score=None, time=1611025476, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25823290, text='I&#x27;ve reconciled my newfound disinterest in the principle of freedom of expression like this:<p>Lies and threats are already illegal if you lie about a person who has the power and standing to use the court system to enforce that.<p>If harmfully you lie in the legal system, it&#x27;s perjury or filing a false report.<p>If you lie to trick somebody into giving you money (and they can show damages and standing), it&#x27;s fraud or false advertising.<p>If you lie to hurt somebody, it&#x27;s \ndefamation... again, if they can show damages and standing and they have the money for lawyers<p>And threats of violence are theoretically illegal but basically you need a good lawyer to get that enforced.<p>But now, we have vicious rumors about objective facts.  Threats against reality itself.  Global Warming can&#x27;t sue for defamation.  BLM and Antifa activists aren&#x27;t even members of a real organization - could they even sue about the vicious lies about them, if they had the money to do so?<p>If a thousand loosely affiliated people push information about a vague cabal of vampiric pedophiles and one of them snaps and &quot;heroically&quot; kills somebody, who is liable for speeding the defamatory information that led to that death?  If it was one, clear person, it would be a clear crime with a clear defendant.... But if it&#x27;s thousands of anonymous trolls, does that make it legal, or does it simply make the laws judging it illegal impractical to enforce?<p>I think Dominion Voting Systems is one of the few orgs trapped in this web of deception that is actually a clear legal entity that has standing to sue and can show real damages from all the slander about them.<p>Basically, harmful lies are theoretically illegal but defacto legal.  So I&#x27;m okay with finding alternate means to close the gap between theory and practice, in the absence of a proper legal framework.')
