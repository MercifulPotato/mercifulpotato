And it&#x27;s likely that 1 of those ten things is much better than the others.<p>However, the gap between what you are doing right now and the worst of those ten things is almost certainly much greater than the gap between the worst of the ten things and the best.<p>IOW, just go ahead and implement one of the potentially contradictory improvements that people on HN, for example, have suggested. You will already be way better off than before.<p>And once you start doing this often enough you will get to the point where you&#x27;re able to identify the best 2 or 3 of the 10 options presented almost immediately. And the gap then between #3 and #1 is small enough to possibly not even matter.')
