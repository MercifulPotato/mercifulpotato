For example my brother and I easily averaged more than an hour a day outside on a half acre lot growing up. And it&#x27;s very nice to be able to sit on a patio and not worry that the neighbors can hear everything.<p>I also find that in the modern world it&#x27;s often cheaper to buy low quality stuff and treat it as disposable ish. For example I bought a very cheap electric chainsaw with the intention of destroying it (very sandy environment) because it was less expensive than renting the right tool for a job, and now I still have it if I need to cut a small branch or something.')
