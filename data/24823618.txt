Google very often <i>does</i> penalize sites by kicking them out of the index entirely. For example, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.searchenginewatch.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;08&#x2F;01&#x2F;what-is-pure-spam-10-examples-from-google&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.searchenginewatch.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;08&#x2F;01&#x2F;what-is-pure-sp...</a> .<p>For the queries I linked, I gave a specific example of oneboxes because this is a user interface that&#x27;s specifically promoting a result as good. If there&#x27;s any sort of penalty on a site, it&#x27;s unlikely to be placed in such a UI.<p>At the end of the day, it isn&#x27;t entirely visible to us what the Google algorithm is doing. Google <i>does</i> manually blacklist pages that Google considers to be spam - see that searchenginewatch article for some more information. But it doesn&#x27;t appear that this is happening here.<p>The Online Slang Dictionary is not being unfairly penalized by Google. It&#x27;s just not that great of a website.')
