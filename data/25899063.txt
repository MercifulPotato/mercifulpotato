Item(by='cormacrelf', descendants=None, kids=[25900686], score=None, time=1611548381, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25890895, text='Wikipedia is actually talking about real laws there. If I have a basketball, and you complain to the court you have a better proprietary right to the basketball than me and then I stole it, then they can order me to give it back (specifically, award a constructive trust over the ball in your favour, so if I sold the ball I have to give you the proceeds etc), but it’s hard to argue that without evidence of your own possession of the ball. Fortunately contracts cases literally all have that evidence, because being owed something under a contract IS a better right than possession, and lack of evidence of possession is never the problem. This is why it is silly to be talking about possession dominating these disputes — your point about multi-jurisdiction FOSS arrangements would be better if you identified conflict of laws and other jurisdictional issues as preventing people making claims at all. It is merely coincidental that the people who currently have it retain it, it is not an instance of the possession dominating phenomenon.<p>Edit: to be clear, people don’t shy away from prosecuting a valid contract claim simply because the other party currently possesses the item in question. “The other party has my stuff” is on the contrary very motivating to a lot of potential litigants. It is not a “barrier”.')
