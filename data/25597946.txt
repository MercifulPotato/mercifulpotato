And it took years to get beyond how I had learned to think about the world and to stop reinforcing my habitual patterns of forcing my way.<p>I think journaling works for me by externalizing my thoughts in concrete form. Immutability sucks in the short term but dealing with it is beneficial for me in the long term. Rereading a cringe inducing past entry from time to time is Pavlovian conditioning against doing so again.<p>Journaling creates a linear narrative from my thoughts. It is the opposite of mulling it over in my head in circles and spirals. It runs beside me not around.<p>Of course for a long time there was much more ruminating than today. And there has always been  a meditative dimension to writing.<p>But for me meditative behaviors are about reminding myself I have access to an inner state of calm. Not a road to trivial insight (enlightenment I heard is a much bigger deal).<p>Journaling because writing is thinking with meeting minutes.')
