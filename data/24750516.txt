I think that&#x27;s utter folly.<p>Then it just becomes the DSA agenda under a cape labeled &quot;renewable energy&quot; and it&#x27;s a political non-starter. There&#x27;s no way.<p>The advocates show that each of the issues separately have broad support so they think that by putting it all together you&#x27;ll get the union as a coalition.<p>I think they&#x27;ll more likely get somewhere from the intersection to practically nobody.<p>It&#x27;d be as if Republicans were trying to overturn Roe v. Wade, end obamacare, and ban gay marriage as a single package. Good luck!<p>I&#x27;d almost cynically claim it&#x27;s <i>only</i> political theater to be leveraged in their reelection campaign. The DSA has a pretty solid ground game but you need to toss them red meat to get them to come out for you.<p>People like say, hamburgers and ice cream, but not on the same plate. I don&#x27;t think the AOC GND is good politics. And as we&#x27;ve seen, the support seems to be leveling out.<p>That&#x27;s why I side on the mostly-libertarian GND camp which was closer to what Jill Stein was advocating for 8 years ago. Remove all protections, remove all subsidies, open up a market, give consumers choice.<p>Then they can fight for a living wage if they please, but separately, not together.<p>I think it&#x27;s far more politically feasible and achievable.')
