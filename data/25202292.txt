Hope they help (non-exhaustive):<p>* This is generic human communications failure, not an engineer&#x2F;non-engineer comms failure, i.e. you have incompatible communication styles. They like meetings, you like async reports. Do what is necessary to align this in future. Action item: &quot;Hey, guys, I think I&#x27;m better able to express this in a report. I&#x27;ll send you one every day&#x2F;week&#x2F;month&quot;. Alternative: &quot;Hey, guys, I need continuous blocks of time to work. Can we schedule our sync at the beginning of my day&quot;.<p>* Explicit communication is superior to all else. Requesting ACKs is superior to all else. Action item: Set calendar event to 24 h after weekly report (send on Thursday or Monday), 2 h after daily report, subject: &quot;Ask team if they read report, post abstract in team chat channel&quot;<p>* Rapid feedback is key in early companies. The rest of your team may believe that the product does not deserve firming up (say the TAM is lower than projected, you&#x27;re not getting traction, etc.). Assuming &quot;maintainable and certified&quot; may be misunderstanding objectives. Action item: Prioritize understanding where people stand. Default prioritize order: Make it work, make it right, make it good.<p>In any case, team failure is usually team failure not individual failure. Presumably your friends will provide validation of your self-worth so I have provided no indictment of the rest of your team. Still, it is expected of those with executive authority (your CEO) to communicate these things to you.')
