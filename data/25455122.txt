That constraint is mental energy.<p>Your job in tech has constraints that mean if you&#x27;re doing it right and are working in a role that&#x27;s pushing you to your full potential, you won&#x27;t have enough mental energy at the end of the day to work on your side projects. While that might be disappointing, it&#x27;s often a lot better than the alternative: if you select for a cushy job which has great WLB, you may experience a level of disillusionment from stasis that can also make it hard to want to work on things outside of work.<p>I wish I had an easy answer to this stuff but I don&#x27;t. Long-term, if you have a stable career in tech, it makes it a lot easier to take time off for sabbaticals or periods of startup work (yours or others) because you can return to a well-compensated career that&#x27;s pleasant and will give you enormous surplus lifetime earnings -- a perfect match for scientific work on the side, as you put it! But it&#x27;s still a career.<p>To get growth you&#x27;ll be happy with, it will take the lion&#x27;s share of your mental energy and strategic planning, over a long period of time. Good fortune aside, there&#x27;s often no way around that.')
