I use it both on an ec2 vm for development and on the client (my thinkpad) that connects to it. Both are zero maintenance after being set up and I get the latest kernels and dev tools without the need for a PPA or dpkg dark arts.<p>I’ve been running the same arch install on my thinkpad and moving it to newer models for over a decade! Compare that to Ubuntu or fedora where I’d have to upgrade every six months to get support for this or that and it would be a nightmare.<p>One thing that is frustrating about the project is that I’ve donated to it several times and still don’t know if that money ever made it to the people running the project or was put to good use.')
