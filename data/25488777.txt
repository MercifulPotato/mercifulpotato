These important questions themselves are also matters of opinion and will differ based on who you ask.<p>There have also been mystics in Islam apart from the Sufis:  Avicenna, the Ismailis, and Alawites spring to mind.<p>Also, as a non-Muslim, see the members of these sects disagree with one another as to who is a &quot;true Muslim&quot; or what is or isn&#x27;t Islam, what reason do I have for believing any one of them over the others?<p>Their appeals to scripture, lineage, famous commentators and the like are not very convincing both because as a non-Muslim I have no reason to believe in any of them and because you can easily find other people who claim to be Muslims making pretty much the same appeals in support of completely different conclusions.<p>At this point in my life, anyone who considers the Koran their primary scripture is a Muslim in my eyes.<p>If you have a better definition that doesn&#x27;t rely on appeals to the Koran itself, to lineage, nor to the authority of some person, I&#x27;d love to hear it.')
