Item(by='CRConrad', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612189881, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25965728, text='&gt; My original reply was to a post where someone accused RH of being predatory.<p>The great(-great?)-grandparent post, by 0_gravitas, had clearly generalised from that (&quot;companies and other big players&quot;, or words to that effect). He was talking about the wider (ab-)use of &quot;Hanlon&#x27;s razor&quot; as an excuse when &quot;Entity X&quot; (IIRC) just happens to benefit from something they then claim was unintentional.<p>I tend to agree; seems to me the stupidity lies with all those falling over themselves to rush and absolve these entities (&lt;-- N.B: Not just RH) from culpability.<p>Hard to tell if you&#x27;re failing or refusing to follow the change in the discussion... From the general tone and number of your comments it feels intentional. If so, why?')
