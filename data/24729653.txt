Item(by='thorakites', descendants=None, kids=[24730685], score=None, time=1602249837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24721868, text='Julia is definitely a fair counterpoint to my comment about C, but I don&#x27;t think it really has comparable ubiquity to numpy + Python and C&#x2F;C++ in the computational science&#x2F;numerical computing communities. What is nice about ubiquity is that if I need to use a rather esoteric numerical technique for research, odds are there are at least prototypes for it already made in numpy + Python or C&#x2F;C++, if not a fully-fledged, well tested package for it.<p>Julia might be catching up there. I hope so, because I do think my area of computational science would benefit from not only relying on 1 or 2 programming language ecosystems for 99% of all work.')
