My main experience with the H-1B system is that tech companies play an awful game of locking in workers who may be happier working for a different employer. Others have compared it to indentured servitude, which seems apt. I don&#x27;t know enough about the system to see how it should be reformed, but I heartily agreed it shouldn&#x27;t be used to restrict immigration. I usually hate to draw from personal experiences in these conversations, but a debate primarily using emotional appeals drawn from anecdata can only be responded in kind.<p>I understand that there is an undercurrent of right-wing reaction in Silicon Valley. TechCrunch was breaking the news on neoreactionaries as early as in 2013, and recent political developments have only accelerated right-wing radicalism since then.<p>That said, by refusing to do something to advance worker power in the fear that it <i>might</i> be used by xenophobes seems like a fundamentally defeatist attitude to take, and rather ignorant of who&#x27;s who. Xenophobes are not the ones pushing for tech workers to organize.')
