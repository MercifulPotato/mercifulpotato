Sudo&#x27;s just &quot;the way to use linux&quot; for a lot of people I know.<p>I don&#x27;t think the sudo contributors should be labelled as irresponsible, because everything they&#x27;ve added to the project is available for the public to see and scrutinise. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve ever mislead people; rather that people have assumed things.<p>Maybe people who care about security will notice now that sudo doesn&#x27;t have comprehensive testing, and will make their own alternative.')
