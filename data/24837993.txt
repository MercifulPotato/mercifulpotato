Thank you for working on it.<p>Allow me to suggest a feature for your roadmap that might be particularly helpful to people like myself that take this rather seriously: Support users that are in a habit of creating and using a unique email address per service that they subscribe to. (perhaps this is a bit niche for MVP, I realize)<p>For instance, I own a domain that I use solely for email. I have a configuration that allows me to type &lt;any-thing-here&gt;@&lt;my-domain&gt;.&lt;TLD&gt;, after which that email address will automatically route to my main inbox. Therefore, I have probably 100+ email addresses that have been used for various accounts and services like Netflix, Amazon, Foobar Business LLC, etc. It would be great to be able to use your service with my many &#x27;primary keys&#x27; rather than just one. Perhaps you plan to support this already, but if not hopefully this comment leads to a discussion&#x2F;consideration in your team.')
