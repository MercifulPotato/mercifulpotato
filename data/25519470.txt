After getting rid of cable, I&#x27;ll often want to put something on in the background while I&#x27;m browsing the web or playing switch or something.  I feel like almost everyone has a completely different thing they are looking for in active vs passive consumption and being able to tailor it would be very nice.  Very straightforward example:  I really don&#x27;t need subtitled shows when I will be half paying attention at best.  I also don&#x27;t want to watch something that is new to me and also &quot;good&quot; when I won&#x27;t really be paying attention.')
