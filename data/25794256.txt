That happens only when people send dollars to Coinbase and change them to USDC.<p>&gt; If it were legitimate flows, you would actually expect USDC to far outpace USDT given the much greater ease of conversion and trust in the sponsors.<p>No, USDT has been around for a lot longer and lots of very liquid trading pairs are based on it. So if you need to buy lots of crypto currency you might need tethers so you can buy on an exchange with a liquid trading pair (BTC&#x2F;USDT on Binance being the most liquid trading pair).')
