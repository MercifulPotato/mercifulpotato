I saw lots of my friends lose their houses in the 00s. I entered a job market that treats just about everyone as disposable; unworthy of training, investment, benefits, time off, bathroom breaks, ppe, or a livable wage.<p>Wall sts focus on the short term has been like napalm on these issues and made fixing them political suicide. I don&#x27;t say this lightly; wall st has enslaved America for profit.<p>&gt;The Top 1% of Americans Have Taken $50 Trillion From the Bottom 90% [1]<p>The proletariat is showing their heads and nipping at the ankles of everyone. Some are misguided, but beating a hedge fund at their own game, trying to convince boomers that black lives matter enough to not be executed by police, or Medicare for All or forgiving student loan debt are all extremely well studied solutions to systemic issues in America that will not be meaningfully addressed until the root problems are addressed: money in politics, trickle down economics, class inequality, asset inflation, health care, employee rights, war on drugs, etc, etc, etc.<p>This specific incident was a fluke of luck that required ridiculously overpaid bros in cushy hedge fund jobs to count past 100% while shorting gme&#x2F;nok&#x2F;AMC which is playing with the lives and livelihood of the people that work in each of those companies. Needless to say, but watching billionaires repeat &#x27;08 with gamestop, amc, and Nokia ruffled a lot of feathers. Gme especially brought out some whales with money to burn in the chase of infinite gains.<p>Maybe this was an elaborate psyop to manipulate people into doing things they wouldn&#x27;t. If so, great job, if not, well maybe the fat cats on wall st and in Congress should come around my hood and experience the hopelessness for themselves.<p>Hopefully this incident spurs some change in wall st and the culture there. Congress certainly doesn&#x27;t have the courage to.<p>[0] \n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.darklyrics.com&#x2F;lyrics&#x2F;bloodforblood&#x2F;outlawanthems.html#5" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.darklyrics.com&#x2F;lyrics&#x2F;bloodforblood&#x2F;outlawanthems...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5888024&#x2F;50-trillion-income-inequality-america&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5888024&#x2F;50-trillion-income-inequality-ameri...</a>')
