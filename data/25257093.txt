I can buy a Mac mini and use it as a primary desktop&#x2F; dev system until Apple drops support for it. By that time, we should have working Linux drivers and support for keeping it running until it rusts out. Since it&#x27;s sitting on my desk and the only moving part is the fan and the slowly degrading SSD, I could see getting 10-15 years out of it.<p>Obviously it would be better&#x2F; ideal if Apple financed this or better, made a full OSS Darwin install. I see dropping $3&#x2F; month for a couple years is cheap insurance.')
