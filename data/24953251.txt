Simultaneously move your jaw down forcing it as much down as possible slowly, while not losing roof-tongue contact.<p>Hold the stretch, repeat the same for a couple of minutes and your muscles <i>will</i> ache. This also unclogs your sinus, so don&#x27;t be surprised if you need to swallow or clear your nose. Also, don&#x27;t do the full stretch at the first try. Warm up a bit first.<p>There are several others, but take too much time to describe here. You can research online. This is not obscure information. My doctor gave me a writeup. Please note they take a few days to take effect. Personally, I found them effective within a week, but YMMV.<p>Singing also helps - less effective but more fun (well, for you, if not others who will wince).')
