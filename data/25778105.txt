So that means a lower Bitcoin price does force miners out of the market, but after at most 14 days, the difficulty would adjust to stabilize at 10 minutes&#x2F;block.<p>That might still create a period of instability where the network lacks hashing power, but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as I thought. And since the same number of transactions would be achieved with less hashing power, I guess the environment would gladly see Tether collapse :P')
