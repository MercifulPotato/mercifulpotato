The claim is &quot;The reason behind it is that EFI variables are stored on UFS, while firmware and OS cannot share the UFS device.&quot;<p>Ok, but why can&#x27;t it use the EFI runtime services to write to the efi vars, like Windows&#x27; bcdedit does? After all, bypassing the firmware to write the vars should actually be riskier, as to my knowledge UEFI does not mandate any specific format for them in NVRAM, so a vendor very much could use a custom format if they wanted, even though almost everybody just uses a modified version of the reference implementation.')
