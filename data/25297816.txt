They were called &quot;Cinema Grill&quot; and served a wide array of food, alcohol and assorted drinks during movies.<p>They kind of went the way of the Dodo when ticket prices started going up and theaters started converting to the lazy boy seats and offering similar experiences. Although the bar was usually outside of the theater and more of a &quot;pre-gamne&quot; type of experience than what the Cinema Grill offered.<p>We had around 8-10 of them where I lived, but AFAIK they&#x27;re all gone now.')
