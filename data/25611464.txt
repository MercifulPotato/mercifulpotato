I&#x27;ve rebuilt this project from scratch and added some new features to it. It is a basic counter that doesn&#x27;t use javascript or cookies. It uses an image to keep track of visitors and reveals additional data in the Pro version. You can customize the counter to your liking including the verbiage and colors. The size of the image is usually less than 2 KB and loads in less than a second. You can use it to track visitors to your website, on a blog, or even in an email. After 30 days of inactivity, where there is no traffic, the counter will automatically delete itself and all of its data. Every page refresh reveals a new counter so you can use it on multiple websites and if you run different campaigns through email and other places, you can get an accurate tracking metric.<p>The Free version keeps count of the visitors to your website. The Pro version allows you to view all geo-tracking data of your visitors, with an added option to upgrade to the Pro version. Here is a few customized JustCount counters: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justcounts.com&#x2F;customize" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justcounts.com&#x2F;customize</a>')
