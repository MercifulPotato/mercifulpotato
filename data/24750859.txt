Item(by='Natsu', descendants=None, kids=[24751078], score=None, time=1602469331, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24750824, text='As someone who managed to be a class member to multiple state-level anti-trust actions against Microsoft, I&#x27;m still disgusted how one of the class representatives sold us out.<p>I remember trying to figure out how to intervene as a non-lawyer and eventually giving up without filing anything.  After giving a pitiful offer of a few dollars per class member, they had it such that the rest would be donated to the schools (Apple&#x27;s last stronghold at the time) and could only be used for new, whole computers, not peripherals or other stuff.  This was such a bogus restriction to put on the money that it made my jaw drop.  But not being a lawyer, all I knew was that a pro se filing was likely to be ignored.<p>If I had to do it over again, I would love to have argued about how the settlement was calculated to create a new anti-trust injury and would have requested relief by having a guardian ad litem for the class, after rejecting the current offer.  Still not sure it would&#x27;ve gone anywhere, but maybe it would&#x27;ve at least pushed back at the nonsense.')
