I&#x27;m glad you find it interesting!<p>I won&#x27;t reiterate what my advisor has already said, but like mentioned in the README of the linked repository, if you just want to try it, you can clone the emulator here, which includes a RISC-V image: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;solbjorg&#x2F;oberon-riscv-emu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;solbjorg&#x2F;oberon-riscv-emu</a><p>The port should also be quite easy to hack on, if you so wish. :) I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions as well.')
