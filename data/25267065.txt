Since our launch in January 2020 our community has created &gt;8,000 projects, collected &gt;4 million data samples from real sensors, and we ran almost 200,000 compute jobs. To keep up with that scale we&#x27;re hiring an infrastructure engineer that can help us run thousands of parallel jobs, keep our infrastructure up and running, and help us design for the thousands of new users we expect in 2021. If you know how to deal with a Kubernetes cluster, know how to manage cloud infra, and want to learn about applying Machine Learning to real usecases, I&#x27;d love to talk to you!<p>About us: We&#x27;re a remote-equal, well funded startup with significant revenue and founders who care about work-life balance, open source and our community. If that all sounds interesting, let me know at jan@edgeimpulse.com !')
