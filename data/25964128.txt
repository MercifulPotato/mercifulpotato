I already made a kind of graph neural network thingy that works similarly for the AICrowd Learning to Smell competition that was kind of similar :) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aicrowd.com&#x2F;challenges&#x2F;learning-to-smell" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aicrowd.com&#x2F;challenges&#x2F;learning-to-smell</a>')
