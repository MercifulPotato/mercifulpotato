I was going to before but Tasmota was so dead simple and i had all the logic offboard anyway.  But I like some of the points you mentioned that would help with automation of building out new ones.  Thanks!<p>BTW I canâ€™t say enough good stuff about node-red for automation.  It has been great.  I tie it into into influxdb for telemetry and it has a nice little dashboard feature for process monitoring.  All with almost zero code.')
