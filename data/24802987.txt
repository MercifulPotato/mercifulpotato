I know an angel investor living in a rent controlled apartment in the most desirable neighbourhood in SF. Put a cap on income for rent control. Allow market to function.<p>Any property that follows planning rules, is in the right zone and follows rules for low income&#x2F;below market rate housing, allow it to be built without delay.<p>Fix stupid zoning laws that make building anything over two stories illegal in a huge swath of the city.<p>(An example is using tradeable  floor space index to regulate zones instead of fixed height based codes)<p>You can do all of this and build public transit options to keep the quality of life stable. Itâ€™s possible. It requires will to execute and a multi year or even multi decade plan.')
