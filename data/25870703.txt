I searched for nextcloud audit but haven&#x27;t found the reports, just docs about the &quot;monitoring and audit&quot; and the &quot;security scan&quot; feature. (I still can&#x27;t, but maybe that&#x27;s because these audits&#x2F;reports are not public, I don&#x27;t doubt your word.)<p>The bug bounty is very reassuring!')
