From what I know, Facebook makes some real euros there, so adoption rate is quite high, but still, democracy is not &quot;under attack&quot; in these countries because of &quot;automated newsfeed&quot;.<p>Yes it is. Polarization is increasing in a lot of countries, and there is heavy criticism. But while US news are exposed to the rest of the world, news from EU countries aren&#x27;t as much. That&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t see &quot;Facebook is damaging democracy&quot; takes from EU countries. At least from what I see in Spain (I can&#x27;t speak for other countries because I don&#x27;t read french or german or dutch news) the debate on Facebook (and other social media platforms) effect on democracy is growing bigger each day, specially now with the COVID pandemic.')
