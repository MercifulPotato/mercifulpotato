I built LinkAce [0] for me to have a self-curated archive of articles, websites and videos found online. But this is just the tip of the iceberg and despite having my own tool that does exactly what I want, I find it most difficult to find content.<p>You have like 50 sources in your RSS reader, 300 people you follow on social media sites and like a dozen of other possible sources for interesting content. But what I noticed: once you add a new source to your feed, chances are high that a) it doesn&#x27;t really fit your interests and becomes noise, or b) it becomes a &quot;famous&quot; source and quality of the content stagnates over time as more and more low-quality content gets pushed into it.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t see any chance that this will be solved in the near future, because the current state of the web with walled gardens, propietary content formats and the unbelievable push for monetarization of content leads to more and more problems.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Kovah&#x2F;LinkAce" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Kovah&#x2F;LinkAce</a>')
