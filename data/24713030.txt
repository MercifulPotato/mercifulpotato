Move your current home page to an About page.<p>The home page is the product so it should have a big search box, a list of categories, and then some top items.  Ideally, all three of these will fit above the fold on mobile and desktop.  Don&#x27;t do infinite scroll.  At the bottom, have a bigger category list, another search box, and a site map footer.  Later, you can use session recording to see how strangers use your landing page and then make it really good.  Make your call-to-action button &quot;Add Review&quot; bold.<p>Show ownership costs in meaningful units: $&#x2F;100-washes for clothing, $&#x2F;100-miles for footwear&#x2F;socks&#x2F;cycling gear, $&#x2F;year for business equipment, $&#x2F;100-meals for kitchen equipment.  Put the ownership cost on the search results page and product page, not the item cost.  When receiving a review, ask how many times&#x2F;miles&#x2F;washes the person used the item every month, when they bought it, and when did it break.  When showing the review to others, show the calculated ownership cost as a single number.<p>Some products are so good that they take many years to wear out.  Reviews for products that haven&#x27;t broken can be misleading.  For these kinds of products, your review submission page can explicitly ask if the product wore out or not.<p>Another problem to solve later: Companies sometimes change a product without changing its name or version number.  Usually they make it cheaper.  The cheaper version is a different product.  The review site should list it as a different product and separate the ratings &amp; reviews.  You could use year numbers, eg. &quot;DrTung&#x27;s Smart Floss (2006)&quot; and &quot;DrTung&#x27;s Smart Floss (2019)&quot;.<p>People give wildly different responses when asked for star ratings.  So don&#x27;t do that.  Instead, ask a concrete question and use that to calculate a rating.  Examples: &quot;Will you buy this again when it wears out?&quot; &quot;Would you recommend that your family&#x2F;friends buy this?&quot; &quot;Do you use other products that do the same thing as this?&quot;<p>Most folks can&#x27;t keep track of their purchases &amp; uses so here&#x27;s your paid product idea: Make an app that lets me record when I bought something, how often I use it, and how much it&#x27;s costing me.  Give me the option of sharing my anonymized usage data with others.  Make it super easy to add an item, for example, let me forward order confirmation emails to your service or copy&#x2F;paste chunks from an email or a product page.  Sell the app super cheap: $5&#x2F;year, $1&#x2F;month.<p>It&#x27;ll be a crowd-sourced Consumer Reports.  I pay for Consumer Reports now because I think they really help society.  They just need to modernize.  Now is your chance!')
