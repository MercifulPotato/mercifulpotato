I&#x27;ve always envied folks with lots of public code to show and share. I had created an F# starter-kit repo (somewhere between hackathonstarter and bullet-train saas kit) along with some blog posts, but I just haven&#x27;t had free time to wrap it up and publish the repo&#x2F;blog posts.<p>I see questions frequently about data access and serialization&#x2F;validation in F# web apps, which I had specific sections about. Hopefully I&#x27;ll have some time in the near future to continue the work.<p>In the mean time feel free to DM me any questions. There&#x27;s nothing too fancy about the code. If you looked at other production code, and swapped out what your best guess for the F# translation would be, you&#x27;re probably most of the way there.')
