It hasn&#x27;t been that bad for me.<p>I&#x27;ve been using:<p>1. Dells<p>2. HP Elite books<p>3. Clevos (Branded by sager)<p>4. Asus Zenbooks<p>About 16 years ago, the suspend and hibernate was a bit of work to get right. Now it just works right out of the gate. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.. but that&#x27;s the same for Windows and Macs.<p>--<p>&quot;Normal apps&quot;<p>There is no Netflix app for linux. Flash is mostly gone away, firefox and chrome fixed that 9 years ago at least.  Spotify works.<p>---<p>Monitor support, most of the X problems are resolved. Intel graphics support is great.<p>Nvidia Optimus is still a dumpster fire.<p>---<p>WIFI- what cards are you using? the intel cards work without an issue.<p>--<p>Sound<p>Yea I don&#x27;t know what is the deal with alsa vs pulse etc. But most of the time they work out of the gate.. I&#x27;ve had minor issues mostly. Bluetooth audio is annoying. Haven&#x27;t had complete stopages issues in a very long time.<p>---<p>Anti-aliasing&#x2F;font-support- this is more of your desktop environment than anything. KDE tends to correct those issues.<p>------<p>macOS often times has issues with their own software and makes it difficult to troubleshoot when things go wrong.')
