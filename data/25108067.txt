Item(by='newscracker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605501427, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25102026, text='I know that every release of Mac OS X&#x2F;OS X&#x2F;macOS has had issues, but the last decade or so seems to be a huge downturn on the Mac hardware and the Mac OS by Apple. The Mac OS has truly become like Windows of the past, where upgrading to a new version is recommended only after SP1 (or even SP2).<p>There are comments elsewhere that are just victim blaming and victim shaming the people who upgraded on seeing the prompt that comes up. Apple will, in its usual style, never admit to the issue nor offer free repair to the affected (bricking the HDMI chip seems to be the cause, as per some threads on Apple’s discussion forums). Apple has once again dropped the ball, and neither Tim Cook nor Craig Federighi seem eager on solving these problems, and during the current COVID-19 period, this is just unforgivable.<p>For once, I’d like to see some senior executive in Apple publicly state “We’re sorry we messed up, we will make it right” and then do the right thing. That couldn’t even happen in a dream I suppose.')
