The marketing was always shit, but the 2 big differences between LTE and 5G are latency and cell size.<p>Cell size matters because there is a ceiling for how many devices an LTE cell can support in a certain range. Thats why you get crappy speeds&#x2F;connectivityâ€™s  at concerts&#x2F;events&#x2F;crowded areas. As I understand it, 5g can support more devices per cell, and also can have smaller cells for more connection density.  With latency, LTE has a baked in 300ms min latency that 5g does not, so 5g can be used for latency sensitive applications.')
