You&#x27;re basically betting that the volatility will subside within 1 year.<p>If you&#x27;re right, your ROI will be (320-240-X)&#x2F;240 where X is the share price 1 year from now.  If X is 30, ROI is 20%.  Even if you&#x27;re wildly wrong, and the share price is still $100 1 year from now, your ROI is only -9%.')
