As far as I can tell from my mum&#x27;s Android phone, Facebook has a lucrative business of advertising absolute garbage borderline-malware apps through their Android apps to people who don&#x27;t know any better. It might be that Apple don&#x27;t expose the APIs you need to make an iOS device a terrible experience for a user who installs your app at all. But if there are any holes in that walled garden once you drop the app store and review, a lot of iPhones will be a lot worse because Facebook will push horrible stuff at their less savvy users.')
