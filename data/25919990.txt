I&#x27;m totally serious, if something is going &quot;the same as always or getting better&quot; it just isn&#x27;t going to get much of any attention.<p>You have to understand that with these stats, we&#x27;re just reporting on what happened in our datacenter - the outcome of our operations.  We don&#x27;t really have much time to do more research and there isn&#x27;t much more info than what you have.  And if we stumbled upon something useful we would most likely blog about it.  :-)<p>So we read all of YOUR comments looking for the insightful gems.
