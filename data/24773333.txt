Us (Gen-Xrs) have had a rough time of it; The boomers rode the financial booms and mostly did well, and the millennials are pandered to everywhere you look, whereas we had to suffer more than one financial crash, and the media and retail pretend like we don&#x27;t exist, so nothing is aligned to our values or desires.<p>Even worse, there&#x27;s a large chunk of millenials who don&#x27;t even believe that Gen-X exists, and think that the generation above them are all boomers.')
