I took it my freshman year, not having the required math. I remember realizing my sub-par math book was out on my desk in front of the teacher, then quickly hiding it. I think he pretended he didn&#x27;t notice.<p>Of the 35 students (total) that took the class, 8 completed it. There was no second year class but the teacher (one of the few whose name I remember) asked me to come back next year and be his assistant and receive training one on one.<p>The next year, the school canceled the class. I checked out of schooling from there on.')
