The article also didn&#x27;t mention this, but a random-number generator is used. The older physical draw used to be audited, but I&#x27;m not sure if what happens now.<p>There are a lot of shady things being done with the profits of the lottery, like non-existent charities being funded, it&#x27;s basically a fund that gets looted.<p>Even with that, the probability of this combination is 1&#x2F;42 million. The draw has 5&#x2F;50 and 1&#x2F;20 powerballs.<p>The best thing about this happening is that 99 people got the 5-9 numbers correct, so this was a good redistribution of funds.\nThe prize was huge (114m), so each winner for a sizeable chunk.<p>Was it rigged? I doubt it, but I welcome the probe, as there is corruption in the SA lottery (even down to the awarding of the contract to run it).<p>I&#x27;m on mobile, so I didn&#x27;t share links, of one would like them, I can add them.')
