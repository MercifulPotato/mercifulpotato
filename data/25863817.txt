Item(by='benlivengood', descendants=None, kids=[25870526], score=None, time=1611261054, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25862756, text='&gt; So 0.210603 &#x2F; 285,418 = 0.000000737874765 which is 737.874765 kWh per transaction. Assuming a price of $0.10 and an average 475g CO2 emitted per kWh, the real cost of a single transaction is $73 and 350kg of CO2. But I suppose that&#x27;s a price worth paying...<p>From the same site, mean transaction value is 2.67 BTC ($86,672 USD), so about .1% transaction fee.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blockchain.com&#x2F;charts&#x2F;cost-per-transaction-percent" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blockchain.com&#x2F;charts&#x2F;cost-per-transaction-perce...</a> computes it at closer to 1%.  My guess for the difference is comparing total volume vs. approximate real value transfer (subtracting the change going back to the same address).<p>Comparable to the cost of the card networks but an order of magnitude more expensive than ACH transfers and maybe double the cost of wire transfers.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m assuming that the profit margin is scarce on average so most miner fees go directly to hardware+electricity. Given the volatile price in USD I don&#x27;t know a better assumption to make.')
