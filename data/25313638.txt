I had managed to keep it hidden for maybe 18 months but eventually it become obvious and my mother started organising help.<p>I think it&#x27;s incredibly brave for you to share this, I appreciate you for your honesty and authenticity.<p>It&#x27;s very beautiful to me when the universe helps people who&#x27;ve gone through incredibly difficult times to speak their truths out loud, and become advocates for change. I believe this act can help to shine a light in the darkness for others going through similar challenges (for the first time).<p>&gt; On a global level we need to stop treating addiction as a crime but as a health problem.<p>100% agree. I believe society would benefit from an expanded definition of the word &#x27;addiction&#x27; too:<p><i>&quot;Addiction is manifested in any behavior that a person craves, finds temporary relief or pleasure in but suffers negative consequences as a result of, and yet has difficulty giving up. In brief: craving, relief, pleasure, suffering, impaired control. Note that this definition is not restricted to drugs but could encompass almost any human behavior, from sex to eating to shopping to gambling to extreme sports to TV to compulsive internet use: the list is endless.<p>“I’m not going to ask you what you were addicted to,” I often say to people, “nor when, nor for how long. Only, whatever your addictive focus, what did it offer you? What did you like about it? What, in the short term, did it give you that you craved or liked so much?” And universally, the answers are: “It helped me escape emotional pain… helped me deal with stress… gave me peace of mind… a sense of connection with others… a sense of control.”<p>Such answers illuminate that the addiction is neither a choice nor a disease, but originates in a human being’s desperate attempt to solve a problem: the problem of emotional pain, of overwhelming stress, of lost connection, of loss of control, of a deep discomfort with the self. In short, it is a forlorn attempt to solve the problem of human pain. Hence my mantra: “The question is not why the addiction, but why the pain.”<p>And the source of pain is always and invariably to be found in a person’s lived experience, beginning with childhood. Childhood trauma is the template for addiction—any addiction. All addictions are attempts to escape the deep pain of the hurt child, attempts temporarily soothing but ultimately futile. This is no less true of the socially successful workaholic, such as I have been, than of the inveterate shopper, sexual rover, gambler, abject street-bound substance user or stay-at-home mom and user of opioids.&quot;</i> [1]<p>Also I love this talk about alienation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TIjvXtZRerY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TIjvXtZRerY</a> &#x2F; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Hs39tNLQss8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Hs39tNLQss8</a><p>[1] Gabor Maté, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drgabormate.com&#x2F;opioids-universal-experience-addiction&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drgabormate.com&#x2F;opioids-universal-experience-addicti...</a>')
