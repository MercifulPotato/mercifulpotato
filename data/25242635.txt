I&#x27;m curious though if the number of public colleges we have today existed to the extent in which they do because of the loans or because of the government funding.<p>Also, in a way of looking at it, the loans are essentially pre-emptive taxation. So theoretically the people who we&#x27;re going to fund these things are taxed directly instead of everybody, even those who don&#x27;t go to college and get the benefit from it.')
