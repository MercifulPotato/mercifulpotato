So it makes sense to compare <i>those</i> against GA (General Aviation, ie not commercial) accidents.<p>The accidents are much more similar, both in frequency (they happen all the time, with little public interest) and causes.<p>People fly their planes while drunk or ill, they fly planes that haven&#x27;t been properly maintained, they fly when the weather is awful and it&#x27;s recommended not to, they don&#x27;t have good plans for what they&#x27;ll do if anything goes wrong, they haven&#x27;t practised skills they know they might need... and most of the time they came back down safe. But not always.<p>When people say &quot;Plane crash&quot; they&#x27;re normally thinking about Scheduled Aviation, at the far end of the safety categories from GA. If you bought tickets to go from one place to another at a particular time, that&#x27;s scheduled aviation, the aeroplanes used, the crews flying them, even the company operating them is far more closely regulated and as you&#x27;d expect the result is far greater safety.<p>I&#x27;d suggest comparing these accidents to <i>bus crashes</i>. A crash in which a greyhound smashes into a gorge and everybody dies would make the TV news, just as a crashed jetliner would. Like the plane, that bus was required to be properly maintained, its driver underwent training including periodic refreshers, and the company operating it is under much more scrutiny than some random guy in a pick-up.')
