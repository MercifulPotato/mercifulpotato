I know exactly why too - I&#x27;ve frequently come across libraries in the UK that are selling off their technical books, because they&#x27;re not receiving much attention. I&#x27;ve had multiple occasions where I&#x27;ve managed to buy dozens of books for the value of just one of them.<p>It&#x27;s not easy to even ask for a book. I&#x27;ve asked librarians for books before, and I even have a friend currently working in a fairly large library request a book for me (with evidence from me of interest in it), and the request was refused.<p>The real books worth reading are those that make you a greater expert than the majority of the population. Libraries don&#x27;t benefit much from storing books that will only be read by one or two people.')
