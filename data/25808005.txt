It can be extended as needed depending on your use case. This is how most things Golang work. You start with the basics and add what you need on a case by case basis.<p>If you want something with every bell and whistle out of the box, Golang is going to be a disappointment generally as that is not the Golang mentality.<p>There are of course sufficient frameworks in Golang these days to provide such things though. Hence the article clearly says &quot;standard library&quot; to indicate that it isn&#x27;t the last word on how to setup a REST service in Go.')
