External recruiter sends my resume to a firm, internal recruiter then does a casual chat with me, and assuming I don&#x27;t throw any red flags, I proceed to the coding phone screen.<p>Multiple external recruiters have attempted to submit me to Citadel and Two Sigma over the course of the past five years. I always tell the recruiter I&#x27;ve never heard back from them in the past, but they&#x27;re always confident that they can vouch for me and get me an interview. Of course, I never hear back and the recruiter is puzzled.')
