It seems like this problem widespread and nobody wants to say &quot;we don&#x27;t need this data&quot;, so yes this should come from the top. However, I fear that if a company starts to suffer, the shareholders would want to know answers and data. Would any exec have dared to say &quot;sorry we don&#x27;t have any metrics about individual employee performance&quot;?')
