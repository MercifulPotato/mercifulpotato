But that was one of the cases dismissed over procedure.<p>That PA case was a real shitshow, and actually involved several claims from several parties in the same case:<p>* Act 77 was PA-state unconstitutional (despite the PA Supreme Court refusing to agree), and that makes it federal unconstitutional.<p>* Relatedly, state courts enforcing changes to state law under state constitutions are (federal) unconstitutional modifications to election procedures, because only state legislatures can change election procedures [this was a <i>really</i> daft argument].<p>* Some counties didn&#x27;t give their residents a chance to cure their ballots<p>* Observers weren&#x27;t permitted to stand as closely as the Republicans wanted to the ballot counting tables<p>While the constitutionality of Act 77 would have been their strongest argument <i>had they challenged it in state court</i>, they didn&#x27;t in the case in the question (because they already <i>lost</i> that case), and they combined it with several other cases to argue over every nitpick they could find in PA. If Giuliani seriously believed that the machine counts were wrong in PA, I suspect he would have tacked that on to the case, as they were already claiming everything else.')
