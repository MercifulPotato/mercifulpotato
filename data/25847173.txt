Microsoft bestrode the software world like a colossus, and was using its power anticompetitively. The internet was a long way from being mainstream and was in any case extremely slow; a lot of Free Software was being distributed on tapes and floppy disks circulating among user  groups.<p>I don&#x27;t think FLOSS really started significant levels of commercial use until the &quot;LAMP&quot; stack of the late 90s. Early internet companies picked up on Linux as a cheap alternative to Solaris or HPUX to run Apache. (I&#x27;m not sure there were massive commercial competitors on the server side? IIS? ZWS? WebSphere?)<p>Possibly not until 2010ish that we started to believe that Microsoft&#x27;s total domination of the software world might be cracking. And of course Microsoft <i>never</i> touched OSS back then.')
