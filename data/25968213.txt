No matter how much I train, I cannot break 100WPM while typing effortlessly. And this goes to other activities that require hands to be agile and precise like playing instruments, which I never was able to do well regardless of how much effort I put into it.<p>So I understand that there is a lot of people who are much more naturally agile with their hands.<p>But I still think learning to type properly has huge advantages. Even if you dismiss every other advantage (say you decide you don&#x27;t need to type fast), I think it just feels extremely satisfying to be able to focus on anything you want while your hands just produce constant stream of characters on the screen in a flowing, effortless motion.')
