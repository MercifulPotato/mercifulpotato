This phenomena surely was observed thousands of years ago in various cultures. There is a reason all occult spiritual paths require a “Master”, “Guru”, “Pir”, “Guide”. Nearly all such collectives subject members to ritual <i>humbling</i> until a degree of “spiritual maturity” is detected. Occult literature (and here I include the esoterica of various established religions) is rife with warnings as to the dangers of spiritual seeking without guidance.<p>A wonderful self-test of one’s spiritual maturity is precisely the inner struggle of the novice with “accepting another as superior”.
