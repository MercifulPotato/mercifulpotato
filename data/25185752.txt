It&#x27;s human nature that enforces inequality, which doesn&#x27;t necessarily lead to crime and violence either because again - human nature does.<p>Every social animal displays hierarchical structures, that&#x27;s just biology. I don&#x27;t know why so many people hold the belief that humans are special somehow and above biology.<p>Every economical, political, and social system will result in some form of inequality, if only because education, training, and skill need to be rewarded unless of course, you are willing to trade fairness for equality.<p>Finally, crime and violence aren&#x27;t the result of (economical) inequality. They are correlated, sure, but crime isn&#x27;t limited to property crimes and most of the other crimes don&#x27;t need inequality.<p>A crime after all is nothing more than an action, which is defined as being against the law. You can in principle get rid of all crime by abolishing the law...<p>A similar story applies to violence.')
