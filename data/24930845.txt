It allows one to record content from services they are subscribed to in a DVR-like fashion. The interface is kinda jank but it works just fine. I recorded a bunch of shows i wanted to watch before i moved house and lost internet for a week.<p>On the implementation front, i believe they run a headless chrome instance and record the media as it streams in real time. So they aren&#x27;t downloading the source files, just recording. This has the unfortunate side effect of baking in subtitles or if the chrome instance is asking for you to accept cookies it shows up over the top of the recording.<p>Apologies if this is a bit incoherant, whenever the owning of media comes up, it always reminds me i have the software installed')
