It&#x27;s so awfully wrong about my tastes.<p>Despite the fact that your Google Play Music &quot;like&quot; data is migrated into YT music, it doesn&#x27;t seem to properly incorporate it in the algorithmically generated playlists.<p>What I&#x27;ve found is that I basically need to treat YT music as a clean slate, and specifically start playing and re-liking things (i.e., I&#x27;d re-play my favorite albums, thumb-down and thumb-up again the songs in them).<p>Now that I&#x27;ve done this, it&#x27;s doing well enough - in some ways better than GPM was (multiple &quot;mixes&quot; presented as options with different clusters of artists in the summaries).<p>I can&#x27;t say whether re-thumbing was what did the trick, or simply re-listening, though. And it&#x27;s incredibly stupid that I should have to do this to make it work correctly.')
