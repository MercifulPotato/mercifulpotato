Each area has it&#x27;s own holdout because the sales process and channel are different.  Channel partners also run their own advertizing which gets looked at.<p>For example: The digital services are an ingredient brand and can only really be sold to core product owners so they&#x27;ll have a differnt holdout as their target population is different.  Also that area has a short measurable path and thus different metrics and measurements.<p>There are some B2B areas that may not have holdouts, they functionally don&#x27;t do any targeted marketing.')
