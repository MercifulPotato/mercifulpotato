The medication is part of a treatment regimen, but it shouldn&#x27;t be the entirety of one&#x27;s treatment regimen.<p>No, no, no, no. As someone who suffered remarkable mental turmoil over my inability to focus, despite reading books about it, asking everyone for help with my problems, just no, I hate this kind of puritanical thinking, it&#x27;s exactly this kind of thinking which adds to the stigma of ADHD medication. The very first _day_ I took the medication I knew I&#x27;d stumbled upon something monumental. And then I realized that all those years of struggle in school and college, they were all for naught.<p>The only right answer is: see a psychologist if you think you have a problem, and get medicated if you and your psychologist feels you do have a problem.<p>&gt; In reality, you may have benefited greatly by spending your formative years teaching yourself coping mechanisms and learning good study habits before introducing ADHD medication.<p>Nope. It just shit on my self-esteem and resulted in depression because I thought I was just not cut out for the things I wanted to be able to do.')
