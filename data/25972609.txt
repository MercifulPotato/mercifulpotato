Item(by='lisper', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612038150, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25971998, text='&gt; the fundamental approach to problem-solving is evolution itself<p>Not quite.  The fundamental approach to problem solving is search, and evolution is a kind of search.  It&#x27;s not a particularly efficient search algorithm, but it has the interesting property that it is able to invent new search algorithms that are more efficient than it is.  We have a pretty good handle on search.  What we do not yet have is the foggiest clue about this sort of &quot;meta-search&quot;, the search for new kinds of searching mechanisms.  We&#x27;ve invented one: the Turing machine, and everything we&#x27;ve done since then has been a riff off that one idea.  Even so called &quot;neural networks&quot; are really just a fairly uninteresting algorithm that happens to bear a superficial resemblance to our brains and happens to produce some interesting results.  But, as you very correctly observe, they are nowhere near the Right Answer.')
