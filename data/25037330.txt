No, &quot;the markets&quot; are not simply a handful of rich people, banks and large corporations. The markets are also more than just &quot;stocks.&quot;<p>In fact, the majority of &quot;the markets&quot; is actually bonds, and most of those bonds are debt issued by nearly all the countries of the world (sovereign bonds). I think roughly 80 Trillion dollars, but don&#x27;t quote me.<p>If you live in a country with roads, infrastructure, buildings, etc.--then the markets are responsible for everything around you.<p>But you seem to be complaining about stocks since they get the most media attention, so let&#x27;s look at those.<p>You may not realize it, but the future of every single country with a socialized pension system, sovereign wealth fund, etc. depends on the returns of global stocks. They make up only a portion of most pension portfolios, but deliver nearly all of the returns. Everybody has a stake in them even if they don&#x27;t realize it.<p>Are the markets all-knowing or perfectly efficient? Of course not. But it&#x27;s literally the only place where you can measure how a global herd of humans are feeling about the state of the world at any given time with a single number. This makes it a default reference for journalists to cite, ie. &quot;thing happened, this is what the humans and their algorithms collectively think about it.&quot;<p>The journalists are often wrong and don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s happening, but this case seems to be pretty straightforward.')
