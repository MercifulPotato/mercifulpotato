This is very likely the steel you&#x27;re thinking of, and the owner of knifesteelnerds.com rated it as his favorite budget steel[0]. It has extremely high toughness (resistance to chipping&#x2F;breaking) and a fine grain structure that allows it to take a very sharp edge without microscopic rolling&#x2F;chipping. Some other steels are used, including 420HC on low-end models, CPM154 on automatics, and several steels commonly found on more expensive knives in special editions.<p>Chinese Kershaws usually use 8Cr13MoV, and don&#x27;t put much effort into heat treatment. Some use D2, which is semi-stainless, somewhat hard to sharpen, and low-toughness (it chips easily), but high in wear resistance. Some low-end models use even cheaper steels.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knifesteelnerds.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;15&#x2F;what-is-the-best-budget-knife-steel&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knifesteelnerds.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;15&#x2F;what-is-the-best-budg...</a>')
