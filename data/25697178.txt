Through this event and what happened last year I can see how incredibly bias the media is when portraying protests and riots. During BLM, there&#x27;s barely any coverage on the looting and destruction caused by &quot;protesters&quot; on mainstream media. There was a very clear attempt to downplay the severity of these actions.')
