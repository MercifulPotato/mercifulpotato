These questions have been keeping me awake at night for the last 30 years or so, and after one big false start that I sadly realized was just a complicated method that was identical to QM, I have come to something pretty similar to this as the next approach to check out. It&#x27;s pretty cool to see that others are looking in this direction too.<p>I&#x27;m nowhere as smart as Wolfram, nor is my new approach anywhere near as developed, but the dimensionality is the thing that has been bugging me since the beginning for my own thing as well. Why three dimensions? Seems like if we can show a reason for that without too much hackery then we may be on the path to enlightenment.')
