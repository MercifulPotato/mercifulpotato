Even if you&#x27;re passionate about something, job stability and good pay are going to be the primary drivers in decisions about jobs. I doubt that most people choose, say, Java jobs because they&#x27;re passionate about Java, or even software in general, for example.<p>From what I gather, most people leave the &quot;passion&quot; part of their work to part-time hobby work, allowing them to do both. If it then translates into money, good, but the few successes that have been put on blast have blinded people to the reality that passion != money.')
