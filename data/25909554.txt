I had the same issue at first but now I can ease off and do a straight 30 minutes. I assumed it was mental but it sounds like it&#x27;s technique.<p>Fwiw I have the Oartec DX, and it&#x27;s very solidly built.<p>On dynamic rowers like this, the seat stays pretty much in one place and it&#x27;s mainly the footpad that moves. Supposedly it puts less stress on the lower back and knees, and more closely simulates rowing on the water, so some elite rowing teams use them.<p>I don&#x27;t know about all that but I have a knee that gives me trouble sometimes, and with the Oartec I can put that foot on the ground and row with the other leg.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oartec.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oartec.com&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rp3rowing.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rp3rowing.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;</a><p>Concept2 makes one now too:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.concept2.com&#x2F;indoor-rowers&#x2F;dynamic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.concept2.com&#x2F;indoor-rowers&#x2F;dynamic</a><p>(I guess a drawback is it doesn&#x27;t really lend itself to a nice big screen like OP&#x27;s project.)')
