They started doing this when the middle class could be homeowners. After several decades of this sort of housing market, all those &quot;middle class&quot; homeowners from the last century are now asset capitalists worth millions. And they pretend that they didn&#x27;t cause all the homelessness when they insisted on regulations to keep new people out, let only super wealthy people in, and maximize the growth of their housing assets.<p>This is exactly how markets behave. Incumbents collude to maximize their profit, unless regulations hold them back from doing that. It&#x27;s a tale as old as time, and it doesn&#x27;t get any more &quot;real&quot; than that.')
