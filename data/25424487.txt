Where if you build an abstraction even if not needed or plain wrong there is a high chance that no one will have any comments, because reviewers will go with low hanging fruit and point out DRY violations. It will be more work to find out how abstraction work and point out its weakness, and don&#x27;t ever even try to propose that code duplication might be a better solution than broken abstraction.<p>Whenever I can, I try to push rule of 3 for dealing with duplicated code. Unless something is used 3 times it still is not a duplication.')
