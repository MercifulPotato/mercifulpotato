It could generate programs in the syntax of an arbitrary programming language (with enough pretraining examples) as well. What powers it is a tree-to-tree transducer, which is a kind of recursive neural network (not recurrent, which is what LSTMs are).<p>It&#x27;s been 5 years and I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot on this. This is a product with no good market fit. If you break it down by &quot;kind&quot; of sales, your basic branches are B2B and B2C.<p>B2C is mostly out because the person on the omnibus have no general need for a programming language, SQL or not (plus, outside of emacs, nothing consumers use are inherently &quot;programmable&quot;). So this program simply becomes a utility program that you reach out to occasionally like `cut` or `sed`.<p>We mostly targeted businesses and other startups. We wanted to empower the common employee to be able to query data on their own. That itself came with a huge amount of challenge. Turns out most employers don&#x27;t like the idea of any Tom Dick and Harry having query access to databases. So we branched out, tried to allow querying spreadsheets and presentations (yes, the advertising arm of one big media corporation stored their data in tables in a .pptx file on a sharepoint server). The integrations are finnicky and break often.<p>Maybe we&#x27;re not smart enough to figure this out. But one day, one day I shall be back.<p>But in the meantime, the failure of the startup spawned the Gorgonia family of deep learning libraries (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gorgonia&#x2F;gorgonia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gorgonia&#x2F;gorgonia</a>).
