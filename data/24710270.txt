An interior designer was to expensive and even if I had a design I&#x27;ll be limited to just the products in my locar area or in what the designer knows.<p>Have any of you had the same problem before?<p>So that&#x27;s why I&#x27; m building this. You can try what I&#x27;ve already done here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketio.ai&#x2F;assistant<p>Also, if you are a coffee drinker, you can take a picture to your coffee (coffee cup, mug, coffee machine, etc) and see what products it will suggest you.<p>I&#x27;m open to any feedback from you.\nThanks.')
