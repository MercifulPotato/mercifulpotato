Mutexes, semaphores, atomic counts etc... those are true primitives in multithreading and they have been around forever (since the 70s at least).<p>I feel the Swift lang. design is like amateur hour at its best,  trying to reinvent the wheel, but still end up where it started, but at worse overrall usability.  Just re-arranging chairs. 8 years later, and still Objective-c + GCD combo is better at multithreading.<p>In comparison:  Java had decent multithreading support since version 1.1,(one year later after its release) and it had NIO by JDK 1.4 and full modern multithreading by JDK 1.5.<p>Swift is a couple of years behind because it is trying too hard to be cool and different.')
