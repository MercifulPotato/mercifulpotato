Most obviously, Zeihan ignites the reader&#x27;s imagination of apocalyptic futures without ever explicitly predicting or detailing them.<p>The future will far more likely turn out to be mundanely unpleasant rather than captivatingly apocalyptic. But that wouldn&#x27;t keep the audience that Zeihan has on the edge of it&#x27;s seat and so while many others in his field think that way, they&#x27;re not garnering the same kind of views.<p>I find his stuff very engaging and there&#x27;s a lot to be taken from it, but it should be taken with a skeptical mindset of &#x27;what&#x27;s the most boring way this might play out&#x27; to approach some kind of truth.')
