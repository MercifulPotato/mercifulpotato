Initial versions of the operating systems on the Rainbow did not allow for low-level formatting, requiring users to purchase RX50 media from Digital Equipment Corporation. The high cost of media ($5 per disk) led to accusations of vendor &quot;lock-in&quot; against Digital. However, later versions of MS-DOS and CP&#x2F;M allowed formatting of diskettes.<p>Of note was the single motor used to drive both disk drives via a common spindle, which were arranged one on top of the other. That meant that one disk went underneath the first but inserted upside-down. This earned the diskette drive the nickname &quot;toaster&quot;. The unusual orientation confused many first-time users, who would complain that the machine would not read the disk.')
