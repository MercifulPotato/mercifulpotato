It&#x27;s probably not a big threat in practice but if someone were to intercept your DNS traffic, they could redirect your internet connections to a different server. TLS (or other forms of authentication) should handle authenticity issues but (probably) not everything on your system mandates TLS.<p>If I&#x27;m not mistaken you can use DNSSEC to authenticate, but not encrypt, your DNS requests. For me however, the simpler way was to just use DoT&#x2F;DoH. I haven&#x27;t noticed any slowdowns.<p>If you care about performance, you could check if your system caches DNS responses and configure that cache accordingly.')
