It means sellers must charge 20% on top of any sale, and give it to the government.  Very small companies are exempt.<p>Uber was arguing that they were just a platform like EBay, and that every individual driver was a small enough business that they didn&#x27;t have to pay the tax.  Uber paid the tax, but only on Ubers fee, not the total journey amount.<p>This ruling is the government deciding that the tax was due on the entire journey.')
