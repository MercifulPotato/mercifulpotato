I&#x27;m sympathetic to people who want to bring their animals with them, but pretending that your animal is needed to support you emotionally isn&#x27;t the answer. If you want to create a movement to allow animals at every venue, then start it and society can have that debate. But fibs about medical necessity, and sending away to get a certificate from a random website, isn&#x27;t the answer.')
