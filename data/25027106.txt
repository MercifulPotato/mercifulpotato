With other editing programs I often feel like the UI is waiting for editing operations to complete in the background, but with Resolve it feels like the UI updates instantly so I can continue working. It sounds like a small change, but it can make a huge difference for productivity since you are no longer waiting for UI confirmation after every action.')
