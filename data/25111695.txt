The Russian vaccine has 92%? And is available for months already. WTF is happening actually? Did the governments around the world smeared Russian one on previous months mocking it and ridicule it in order to allow a Western company to achieve the same protection for the love of money? If that&#x27;s the case I hope people with deaths in their families will sue their governments&#x2F;health organizations to hell and back. This screams of greed for money not on back of ordinary citizen, but literally on their life.')
