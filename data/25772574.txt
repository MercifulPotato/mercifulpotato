I can&#x27;t find a way to add files&#x2F;images&#x2F;make commits in the UI at all.  I can make wiki pages or tickets in there (honestly, the wiki probably covers 99% of what I want, aside from it not being very streamlined to say the least), but I haven&#x27;t found a way to add files except via `fossil add` on the CLI.  Have I just missed it?<p>Otherwise, the main things keeping me from being more interested is that it&#x27;s a large blob -&gt; harder to sync, and there don&#x27;t seem to be any mobile-friendly implementations (e.g. no app that just runs it).  A folder of markdown files and images&#x2F;etc to embed via `![](filename)` is <i>dramatically</i> easier and more flexible on both of those fronts... but I do miss having a history.')
