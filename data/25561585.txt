Recently, one asked, &quot;I know the answer is obvious&quot; and then asked me if I&#x27;d rather die or have a bunch of dogs die. And I was like, &quot;I&#x27;d rather live and let the dogs die&quot; and she and her sister were appalled. They were like, &quot;obviously you die and save the dogs&quot;.')
