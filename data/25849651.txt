The M1 fits those needs but then blows the perfromance well beyond what we could call an i7 in this segment. (All in the comparable wattage i7 had 30% max less single-core perfromance and 1&#x2F;3rd the multicore perfromance)<p>Intel sells chips like this on a sliding scale from i3 to i9.<p>If Intel made an i3 that compares favorably to the M1, it would be faster and cooler than any other CPU Intel makes, ruining i7 and i9 sales. It would pretty rapidly piss-off their vendors who seek to upsell expensive skus.<p>I could see a TSMC i3 core in a different name possibly, like Intel Evo Next or something like that and then them selling it as a premium chip for a high profit.')
