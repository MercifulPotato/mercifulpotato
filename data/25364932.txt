By your standards, Bill Clinton was &quot;far right&quot;.<p>Excellent example.<p>For the record, I support civil rights protections for all humans, including gays on the basis on sexual orientation. I disagreed then with most of Bill Clinton&#x27;s policies toward gay rights (I also strongly supported making marriage a uniquely civil institution vis-a-vis government recognition available to all citizens, like France).<p>By the way, you know who else had that <i>exact</i> same views on gay rights as Bill Clinton when he entered office?<p>Barack Obama.<p>Was he &quot;far right&quot; in 2008?')
