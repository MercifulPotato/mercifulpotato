The 1st two words, &quot;our handling&quot;, were already expansive enough to cover all their actions, and all the admissions of miscommunication acknowledge that he&#x27;d previously been told the wrong things about the actual progress.<p>(You could ungenerously call those prior &amp; now-admitted misstatements &quot;lies&quot;. But when you&#x27;re trying to return to a friendly mutual resolution, with redress for wrongs, it&#x27;s helpful to let people characterize earlier errors as mistakes rather than intentionally-hurtful deceptions. And, as bad as the bad communications were, they&#x27;re more likely overzealous young inquisitors who <i>thought</i> they were doing right, and needed more coaching&#x2F;practice, than consciously mean &amp; deceptive people. So let them apologize!)')
