Bought a house in 2009 when everyone said it was stupid because of the great recession, avoided partying, drinking or doing any kind of drugs, or &quot;having fun&quot; all throughout high school and university, and instead of using all the newest and greatest popular technologies I made my own libraries.<p>That house is now worth 3 times more today than when I bought it, almost all popular technologies from 10 years ago are dead and unmaintained today whereas the technology I made for myself forms the basis of my software company, and frankly I don&#x27;t know many people in their 30s who still continue to maintain the same kind of friendship with their party buddies.<p>All this to say that it&#x27;s irrelevant whether you do things everyone else does or do things no one else does. It&#x27;s just a very poor way of reasoning about anything in life.')
