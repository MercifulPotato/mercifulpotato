Go doesn&#x27;t want to include the kitchen sink or even confine you to having a kitchen at all and I respect that.<p>But I&#x27;m saying that other languages that include more in the way of <i>affordances</i> can help one be more productive, and I believe combining a language that includes more, with the <i>mindset</i> of not abusing the buffet is a winning combination.<p>Ymmv, I&#x27;m not an oracle, I just expect  people to read things in a <i>reasonably</i> charitable way which usually works fine as long as they&#x27;re not being defensive.')
