What if you listened to no songs, but didn&#x27;t cancel?<p>In any case, I imagine there&#x27;s an aggregate effect where the whole pool of spotify listeners habits ends up being something that approximates a normal distribution and paying per-user vs paying per-stream would end up basically the same. You listen to 40 niche artists one month, 10000 other people listen to 40 popular ones, the popular ones get 10000x the revenue... There are bands with thousands of monthly listeners, and then ones with tens of millions of monthly listeners. The few in the latter bucket are gonna dominate the payouts.')
