Most of my friends aren&#x27;t aware that I do this intentionally (with balance of course, sometimes I did go off the rails but rarely) and it pays off socially bigger than I anticipated for. I didn&#x27;t start doing that knowing that it would pay off though, it was just who I am. I think Paris Hilton&#x2F;Trump&#x2F;etc also probably discovered it unintentionally.')
