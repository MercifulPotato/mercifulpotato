Any sexual assault counselor should know that survivors most often do not want to be re-traumatized through being physically manipulated by another individual. If COVID-19 has shown us anything, it is that remote options ARE feasible. Self-use kits were used in Monterey and Marin counties in California out of necessity (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ksbw.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;monterey-county-das-office-allowing-victims-self-administer-rape-kits-at-home&#x2F;32165425" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ksbw.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;monterey-county-das-office-allo...</a>), and necessity breeds widely used innovation. It would make sense to die on this hill if the current system was survivor-centric. But it is not. Youâ€™re putting far too much faith in a system built to reflect and serve the interests of law enforcement and hospitals, not the needs of survivors. Moreover, further research will show you that the startup explicitly encourages survivors to visit a hospital or contact law enforcement if at all possible. Not only is your information outdated, but it is also misleading. Try keeping your personal value statements (and your baseless interpretation of criminal law?) out of the conversation. Ask sexual assault survivors what they would like to see instead.')
