I am suggesting that a 1440p monitor at 27-inch is a better choice than a 6k monitor, for people in general, taking cost into account.<p>- You could get five 1440p monitors for 1&#x2F;6 the price of this 6k.<p>- As resolution increases you get diminishing returns.<p>- 1440p, 27-inch is a sweet spot, imo.')
