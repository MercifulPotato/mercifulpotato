Instead of specifying xxx&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash in their script, they use xxx&#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh (and they don&#x27;t run any check about which kind of shell is running to ensure that bash is running and fail gracefully otherwise, and they don&#x27;t either document that the script must be run from bash).<p>There&#x27;s no problem about writing in a specific language, <i>if you clearly say you did</i>. If I stretch the example a bit, I wouldn&#x27;t like a Python script to start with xxx&#x2F;bin&#x2F;ruby.')
