What matters is whether they&#x27;re covered calls or not. I don&#x27;t know if that info is available. If it&#x27;s a covered call the seller of the option has the shares, so they essentially sell them to whoever bought the option and decided to exercise the option. If they&#x27;re not covered, then they have to go out and buy them.')
