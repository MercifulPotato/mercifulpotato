When you sign up to work for somebody else, the board and the executives have every right to make these decisions.  Upset that you can&#x27;t lobby for the rights of pink haired people in the office?  Go start your own company and put murals featuring oppressed pink-haired people all over the walls.  Until then, recognize that companies aren&#x27;t set up as democracies, because no investor would be dumb enough to throw their money down a toilet where any muppet who can run a QA job or write a few lines of JS has equal input with someone who co-founded the enterprise.')
