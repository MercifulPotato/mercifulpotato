And no ramblings about privacy here on HN will ever change my mind.</i><p>That&#x27;s why the left constantly describe anyone who isn&#x27;t on the left as Nazis, even though they clearly aren&#x27;t. Free speech requires absolutism - the moment you make an exception of the form, &quot;well ... but not for <i>them</i>&quot; suddenly the term is redefined and huge swathes of people are being dumped in that bucket regardless of reason or evidence.<p><i>I&#x27;d be happy to sacrifice my own privacy if we can root out the evil of racism, nazism, terrorism, and other things that absolutely everybody agrees are bad.</i><p>The people who talk about racism the most are by far the most racist people in society. They manage to be racist whilst claiming to hate racism by redefining it to not be about race, but perceived &quot;power&quot; where &quot;power&quot; is entirely subjective. Hence they can hate on white people whilst claiming to be fighting racism.<p>Again, the lesson is simple. <i>All free speech must be protected to the absolute end</i>. The moment you make an exception, leftists will en-masse attempt to redefine the word used to delimit the exception to encompass anyone who isn&#x27;t on their side.<p>The right isn&#x27;t above this sort of behaviour either, see the abuse of &quot;terrorist&quot; to mean random people in Afghanistan in the first years of the millenium. But I haven&#x27;t seen much of that lately. As of 2021 this behaviour is definitely more common on the other side of the hall.')
