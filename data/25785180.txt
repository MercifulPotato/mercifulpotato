Your infrastructure costs are basically zero because they&#x27;re baked into the cost of using the contract, which is paid on every transaction. You also get interoperability for free without having to build out any sort of API layer.<p>Smart contracts are not the solution to all problems but I think they have some really interesting use cases.')
