I dabbled in electronic voting for a bit, and the open source folks were struggling with this quality. Being able to disavow an act is called &#x27;repudiation&#x27;, and many crypto systems have <i>non</i>repudiation as a feature. But you also need to prevent ballot box stuffing, so you need a way to assert that John Smith voted, but not who he voted for.<p>But keeping this feature means that anyone with an IQ above 80 can&#x27;t be coerced or bribed into voting for a particular person. You give me $200, blackmail, extort, or otherwise encourage me very strongly to vote for Hitler, but I can just vote Ficus and tell you I voted Hitler.<p>Some rando walking up to you after voting, or worse, before, how do I know they&#x27;re asking in earnest instead of with some agenda? I&#x27;ll say anything I can think of to get away from them as fast as possible.')
