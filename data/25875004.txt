Stop being such an obtuse sob story.<p>When spy agencies do their jobs right, you don&#x27;t hear about them. There are probably countless assasinations that went off that we will never know about.<p>This is one of those times they didn&#x27;t, and we know about it.<p>&gt; Russians (except Navalny) are stupid and cannot do any shit right<p>Nice sob story, nobody cares. The US has failed assassinations, so has the UK.<p>You&#x27;re not special (as in nobody is specifically making fun of Russians, relax).<p>You&#x27;re not making salient points or contributing to the discussion beyond a thinly veiled pro-Putin attitude.<p>Let it go, nobody cares')
