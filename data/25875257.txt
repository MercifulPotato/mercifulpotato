I just don&#x27;t want to reflexively throw it out; sufficient energy production from clean sources would make electrolysis quite reasonable, even if it&#x27;s not ideal, and there are approaches to handling the storage, too, if that ends up being the last bit. I <i>suspect</i>, based on current trends and sciences, that we&#x27;ll see better batteries instead, but I don&#x27;t see harm in continuing to look at hydrogen for now.')
