And it&#x27;s fine.  But next I want to really move to a &quot;huge&quot; cluster, say 100+ nodes.<p>The reason is that with 7 nodes I find I&#x27;m still logging into each Raspberry Pi and configuring it by hand.  It&#x27;s a bad habit for sure.  With 100 nodes, there&#x27;s no way I could possibly do that, forcing me to write software to control the nodes automatically.')
