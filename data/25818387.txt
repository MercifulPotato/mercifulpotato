Don&#x27;t let it stress you out. Context switching is something we all have to do from time to time. You can&#x27;t decide to sit down and review all of the code you&#x27;ll ever be sent to review in your life. It would be nice to block off a month and knock that task out with great temporal locality. But, much of the code you need to review won&#x27;t be sent until a few years from now, so you just can&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t make an infinitely large batch.<p>Context switching makes sense when the cost of the switch is less than the time saved by doing the switch. For a beginner cook or someone whose knife skills aren&#x27;t that great, maybe the cost of the switch is very high or the benefit is relatively low. Or maybe the window of idle time is not sufficient to accomplish the critical work. In this case, you just have to move the critical work earlier into the process and accept some down time.<p>That being said, one thing I have found is that if I&#x27;m really FOCUSING on cooking, sometimes the idle moments are larger and the context switching costs are less than I had though, and maybe I can mix some prep in with cooking. The problem comes in when you&#x27;re constantly checking your phone or chatting or whatever in between the cooking steps. That can really slow you down.')
