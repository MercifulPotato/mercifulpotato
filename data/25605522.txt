If you think about it, the employees doing it aren&#x27;t zombies, as soon as they leave the company they&#x27;ve got no reason stay loyal. News organisations are all over stories like that. The resulting bad press can be catastrophic for a company, far worse than any conceivable benefit from the behaviour itself.<p>For governments in democracies it&#x27;s even worse, this is why most government conspiracy theories don&#x27;t make sense. Why would government employees or even soldiers criminalise themselves to benefit a political party or president they might not even personally support? Once  particular president is out of office, there&#x27;s no reason to stay personally loyal to them so leaders can only rely on people&#x27;s loyalty to the nation as a whole.<p>Conversely the CCP simply suppresses all discussion about the suppression, and disappears anyone who becomes too problematic. There are no divided political loyalties and no other political faction or press to go to. What&#x27;s anyone going to do?')
