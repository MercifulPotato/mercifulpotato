That&#x27;s what will be the &quot;next&quot; kernel releases and is where all of the developer&#x2F;maintainer trees are merged together before they are sent to Linus.<p>Both of those should be very easy to do, and any problems found there should be easy to fix and resolve before they get to a &quot;real&quot; release.')
