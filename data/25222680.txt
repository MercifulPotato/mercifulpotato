It&#x27;s not clear how much gain the M1 is getting from 5nm, but I&#x27;d be _extremely_ skeptical that it&#x27;s the whole story, especially given limited improvements between the directly comparable A13 (7nm) and A14 (5nm, some microarch changes).<p>&gt; Plus there is the deeper integration with Apple&#x27;s software.<p>This is relevant to some OS niceties (eg the disconcertingly instant wakeup and resolution shifts) but should have no bearing on, say, SPECInt2017.')
