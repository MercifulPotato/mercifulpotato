He&#x27;s in jail for <i>misrepresenting facts to the court</i>. The entire case against Prenda was that they represented to the court that they were agents of the copyright owner, when in fact they were the copyright owner themselves. There was nothing, legally, wrong with their suit.<p>And yet everyone seems to think of the Prenda case as a victory against copyright trolling. It is no such thing! Why would Hansmeier lose rights to own copyrights, when he didn&#x27;t do anything wrong with the copyrights he had?')
