I wish more people were as passionate about spaceflight as you.<p>Raptor shares the pintle-type injector, which was designed for the LEM and was part of the technology transfer to SpaceX as a part of their participation in the overarching COTS&#x2F;CRS programs. The engine&#x27;s design was partly funded by the USAF, and is a part of a rich history of alternate engine designs that all learn&#x2F;share from one another.<p>SpaceX in general has leveraged NASA&#x27;s rich history and high open-ness to integrate this history into their work, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov&#x2F;JSCHistoryPortal&#x2F;history&#x2F;oral_histories&#x2F;C3PO&#x2F;GigerD&#x2F;GigerD_1-15-13.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov&#x2F;JSCHistoryPortal&#x2F;hist...</a><p>Raptor is one of the few advanced engine concepts that have gone from the test stand to near-use, and that&#x27;s an amazing achievement.<p>I would be remiss if I didn&#x27;t point out that Raptor wasn&#x27;t the first full flowed staged combustion engine. Being the first doesn&#x27;t change what Raptor has done, taken several technologies from the test-stand phase to flight testing.<p>Autoland was de-emphasized due to demands for greater control by the astronaut corps. There was also the incident with STS-3. However, the Shuttle was designed from the ground up with GNC that was meant for full-scale autopilot, including landing. They were hoping for long-term space habitation and to send vehicles uncrewed and then return with crews from the Moon, Mars, and perhaps beyond. It was felt that the astronauts would be rusty and weak after continued microgravity exposure so autoland was emphasized during the design process. For its time, the STS had extremely advanced GNC and displayed mission capabilities that hadn&#x27;t been displayed before. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ntrs.nasa.gov&#x2F;citations&#x2F;19760024058" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ntrs.nasa.gov&#x2F;citations&#x2F;19760024058</a><p>One of the RS-25 engines was used 22 times. This was engine SN-2012. Another was used 19 times, SN-2019. They were designed to be flown and re-flown 50+ times, each. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;226730434_Reusability_aspects_for_space_transportation_rocket_engines_Programmatic_status_and_outlook" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;226730434_Reusabili...</a><p>BO has performed multiple suborbital flights using the same booster, and have taken scientific payloads for these flights.<p>Steel is heavier than Al and most other aerospace materials. It was chosen for Starship as a part of a novel Thermal Protection System, without that mission role, it is mass inefficient.<p>I am happy to hear your palpable excitement. I hope this comment helps you adjust your mental model to a better picture of the industry.')
