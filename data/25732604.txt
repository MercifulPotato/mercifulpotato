Meanwhile, contemporary code won’t be so different from, say, Rust.<p>Languages will be cross-compatible (perhaps over something like WASM), and the amount of software dependencies will grow exponentially.<p>There will be vastly more software than can be effectively maintained. Dependency hell will be given a new meaning. As a result, the industry will suffer from severe security incidents that shake the public’s faith in software.<p>Meanwhile, global state actors will pollute the hardware supply chain with hardware that contains critical and hard-to-detect vulnerabilities. This will shake the public’s faith in hardware.<p>In response to these trends, there will be a push for programmer-hackers who can solve business problems using minimal dependencies and hardware. Low level code will be king in this new era, and, to remain competitive, developers will need deep integrated knowledge of hardware design and electrical engineering. Salaries will remain very high :)')
