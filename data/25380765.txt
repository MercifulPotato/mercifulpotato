There are dozens of reasons to dismiss cases without considering evidence.<p>There is a bucket load of evidence that shows election irregularities and failures of election staff to follow laws, but that does not mean there is enough evidence to prove the Trump campaign&#x27;s allegations in court.<p>Also, a lot of the cases getting bounced are seeking emergency relief which often requires a higher standard of proof&#x2F;evidence which is usually hard to come up with before discovery.<p>Also, even if the allegations are proven, there may not be a legal remedy that a court is willing to offer -- this can be grounds for early dismissal too. If you ask for something the court thinks it cannot offer, case dismissed no matter what the evidence is. Often if legal remedy is unavailable courts will point to the electoral process as the remedy.')
