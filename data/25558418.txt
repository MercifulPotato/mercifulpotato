Item(by='redis_mlc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609155272, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25553882, text='&gt; Pilots, for example, are considered to be getting compensation when they log flight hours, even if no money changes hands.<p>The above comment is so vague that I won&#x27;t even comment on it.<p>Depending on the details, it could be either correct or not.<p>1) For example, if I fly an airplane, I can take real estate photos that I sell myself as a private pilot. That&#x27;s how many new pilots funded further training back in the day. There are several other business activities that private pilots are allowed to do.<p>2) Most pilots log all hours flown, without concern for whether being paid or not. (The only required logged hours are to meet various currency requirements, but I&#x27;ve never seen anybody do minimal logging.)<p>So when interpreting FAA drone rules, I would carefully read them with the understanding of how airplane and airspace rules reply, hence my original post above. If you don&#x27;t know why and how the FARS were written, then you&#x27;re probably wrong, as most of the posts above appear to be uninformed.<p>The most important thing to know about FARS is that they&#x27;re intended to separate traffic. So if your drone is in an airspace where other aircraft are flying, you likely have a violation. If you recall a couple years ago, drone pilots griped about 400&#x27; or 500&#x27; AGL max. Well, look at a sectional chart to see why. If you can&#x27;t read a sectional chart, you shouldn&#x27;t be flying drones near a city or airport.')
