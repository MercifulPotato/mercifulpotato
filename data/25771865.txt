I have a 2017 Tesla and the screen started spazzing out on me a while back but I drive pretty often. I willfully purchased an upgrade that solved the problem as the new screen (MCU) doesn&#x27;t have the same architecture that caused the failure. I&#x27;d be nice to be compensated for my willful upgrade but at least other people can stick it to Tesla.<p>I LOVE the car and will stick to it that it&#x27;s the best car I&#x27;ve ever owned but it has its flaws and hopefully this recall teaches Tesla a lesson.')
