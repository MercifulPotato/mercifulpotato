Abandoning Symbian to switch to Microsoft was a massive step forward in both respects, although the original plan had been to drop Symbian and move to Meego with Qt available as a developer transition path.<p>(Maemo, the precursor to Meego, was originally a GTK-based platform. The Symbian faction of Nokia acquired Trolltech in order to be able to advocate for Qt to be a shared development platform for both Series 60 and Maemo, which meant throwing out large parts of the existing Maemo codebase and starting again. This delayed Maemo significantly, and somewhat ignored the fact that there were basically 0 apps on Symbian that anyone cared about in the slightest)')
