The designers of Battlefield 3 used data mining a lot to drive their decisions, particularly around multiplayer weapon balance. For a long time the competitive players said there was a balance issue with the M16, but the designers were adamant there was no issue because they didn&#x27;t see any particular issue in the data. The M16 was used a bit more than the others, but it was also the weapon everyone started with and had unlocked. So they thought everything was fine.<p>Then, after quite a while, someone made a video clearly highlighting the issue. And then the designers finally took a closer look and found that gosh darn, there was a bug in the weapon stats. The M16 did not get less inaccurate when you got hit, unlike all the other weapons.<p>So if you equipped a M16 you were significantly more likely to successfully return fire, compared to the other weapons. Like an order of magnitude. Which significantly increased the chance of surviving the firefight if you were a moderately competent player.<p>Of course the competitive folks had figured this out quickly and predominantly used the M16, but they hardly made a blip as a percentage of the total player base so it didn&#x27;t really show up in the stats.')
