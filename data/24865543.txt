I&#x27;m not saying he can&#x27;t vote his conscience but if he votes for a measure to revoke the right to marry from people in his OWN company those people are free to oppose his appointment as CEO as part of their freedom of expression.<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t agree with your assessment that he &quot;forced&quot; anyone to do anything.&quot;<p>You&#x27;re right. He attempted and failed to do so since the measure didn&#x27;t pass.<p>It&#x27;s not inconsistent to democratically vote for something that restricts the freedoms of someone else. Gun laws, abortion, wearing masks,  etc. And people are free to associate with me based on my views on the subject.')
