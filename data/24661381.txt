Using an array is 50% slower than using an object and that&#x27;s slower than using a Set in Chrome. Even worse in Safari. In Firefox array wins but you need to use a static array.<p>I don&#x27;t know all the rules of JS. Semantically declaring an array in the function itself creates a new array on every invocation. Of course the JS engine should be able to figure out it doesn&#x27;t need to create a new array every call but apparently Firefox&#x27;s JS engine doesn&#x27;t do that.<p>Note: I&#x27;m making the assumption we&#x27;re talking about JavaScript since the code looked like JavaScript to me. I get that in another language the results might be vastly different.')
