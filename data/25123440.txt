So why do I have to stash when I&#x27;ve changed an unrelated part of the same file?<p>&gt; The command for that is `git merge`.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t know which branch is upstream, I have to tell it explicitly each time.<p>&gt; The command for that is `git push origin HEAD`.<p>I want &quot;git push&quot; to just do that.<p>&gt; The option for that is `--no-track`.<p>Yeah, I know, but I wish I could just turn it off for when I forget, or when I&#x27;m doing it from an IDE or similar.')
