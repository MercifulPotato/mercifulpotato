I&#x27;d like to say it was because of concern about the amount of plastic I was wasting. But, in reality, it was more a thought that there must be something that worked better than those crappy disposables, which don&#x27;t even shave very well and seem to clog with every stroke. So that I spend more time tapping it on the edge of the sink vainly trying to unclog it,  than actually shaving.<p>I&#x27;ve got to say, the safety razor has been a revelation. I almost enjoy shaving now. There&#x27;s no more hacking. It cuts through beard hair with ease, even the tough bits round the moustache and point of chin area. A quick shake in the water every few strokes is enough to stop it clogging. And, after several months of use, I&#x27;ve just broken into my second packet of 10 out of the box of 200 blades I bought. So, once the cost of the razor itself is set aside, the ongoing cost is negligible.<p>I fancy trying a cut-throat eventually. Just for the fact it looks so cool and hard-core<p><i>[Im fair haired and usually have a bit of stubble. So I only shave once a week. Other people&#x27;s blade usage mileage may vary]</i>')
