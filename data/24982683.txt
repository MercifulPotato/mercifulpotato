While I&#x27;ve never quite understood, I&#x27;ve seen many German posters call out a national broadband backbone based on Copper as the root cause.\nI don&#x27;t know if this is true, but I am in Ireland and know that also the UK did a rollout of a Fibre backbone network, and in both there&#x27;s widespread availability of 1GB+ consumer connections.<p>I think what&#x27;s happened is in many or some European countries there was a rush to increase Broadband adoption and speeds, where being the first mover left them with now outdated backbone infrastructure. Those who moved later, more gradually, or chose a more future proof backbone network benefited.\nThe sunk cost and possibly inflexibility of the network to upgrades holds back the push for better speeds. If the service is good enough, the push from consumers for more is lessened.')
