If you can&#x27;t find any papers about it, that&#x27;s why. It&#x27;s like finding a paper on death by lava lamp explosions. It&#x27;s happened (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;la-xpm-2004-dec-01-na-briefs1.5-story.html#:%7E:text=A%20man%20who%20placed%20a,said%20police%20spokesman%20Paul%20Petersen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;la-xpm-2004-dec-01-na-brief...</a>.), but not enough to study it.<p>• Much of the speed was gained by relaxing enrollment rules, which are for study participant safety. The majority of normal study participants join in the last year or two anyways.<p>• These studies were larger than usual to make up for the decreased time. 30,000 people is a lot, and plenty to check for rare side effects.<p>• Then compare the odds that there&#x27;s a common reaction that didn&#x27;t show up in 30,000 participants against the ~5-10% chance of serious health complications from COVID. It&#x27;s a no-brainer.<p>You can read the list of recalled vaccines and why they were recalled straight from the FDA (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccinesafety&#x2F;concerns&#x2F;concerns-history.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccinesafety&#x2F;concerns&#x2F;concerns-history....</a>).')
