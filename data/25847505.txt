Do agree with others though, that you should expose the course sections. I don’t use vim as my main IDE but I still do use it for quick edits and commit messages, so I don’t know nothing about it. Would be great to see if the course is more&#x2F;less&#x2F;same as my current working knowledge. But also a one-time $15 isn’t bad at all, thank you for not trying to make this a subscription :)')
