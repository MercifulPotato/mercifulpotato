I have been using Bitwarden for over 3 years now, paid premium user as well. No big issues, the odd bug a few times but all fixed promptly and didn&#x27;t impact my ability to access my data.<p>While the Bitwarden apps are not as &quot;pretty&quot; as 1Password&#x27;s I find them a little simpler to use. Obviously UI design is highly subjective though so your thoughts may be very different :)<p>Anyway yes I <i>highly recommend</i> Bitwarden. Kyle and the team have built and continue to run a top class product that costs 1&#x2F;3 the price of 1Password.<p>Edit: To clarify I use Bitwarden solely for personal use. I cannot fairly compare Bitwarden and 1Password for multiuser&#x2F;shared vault use.')
