It boiled down first to budgeting and calculating expenses (especially discretionary expenditures) vs earnings (As a school lesson, I think being forced to try to figure out a budget of a single parent on a minimum wage would be pretty eye-opening). For a general class, a practical lesson on tax filing would probably be worthwhile. And then for investing I agree about covering the general landscape of various savings and investments work, but more focused on in-depth&#x2F;concrete lessons on fundamental concepts. Compounding, tax-advantage, dollar cost averaging, correlation, and rebalancing would basically cover it I think.<p>I think learning about how money (and debt) works - I&#x27;d argue that <i>most</i> people don&#x27;t have a great understanding of that at all, some basic macroeconomics, and maybe some freakonomics type topics for color would be useful as well, but I don&#x27;t think that financial literacy needs to go beyond the very basics to give everyone a bare minimum framework to be able do their own research&#x2F;learning. But I also generally think that should be the goal of every topic taught, which seems to be rather at outs with mainstream teaching and learning practice in American public education.')
