If you elect a President who does that, you really messed yourself up already.<p>In this case we did -- though honestly, the last minute pardons and orders were far less bad than they could have been. It&#x27;s hard to tell how much of that is incompetence, how much is grumpiness, and how much is having pissed off his own party so much that there just wasn&#x27;t much point. Executive orders are easily reversed.<p>The Lame Duck period is actually pretty important. For those on the way out, it&#x27;s the only time that they get to be truly free to vote their conscience. And even for those who will face re-election in 2 or 6 years, they have the maximum time to put any votes here into context (and to bury a lot of it in the flurry of lame duck work). It&#x27;s one of the few times Congress can get around its deadlock and actually achieve what it&#x27;s supposed to. And yeah, that includes the President.<p>So if you go in assuming that government actually does have a function (as opposed to the all-purpose &quot;government never does anything good and only bad things&quot; argument, which is very lazy), it&#x27;s best to start with the assumption that they&#x27;re not going to be completely malign, even if they could be -- and we have evidence that they sometimes are. But it&#x27;s very rare, and there are already a lot of checks and balances in place.<p>It&#x27;s true that there has become a lot of bad faith, and that is literally an existential crisis. But I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll fix it by putting even more restrictions on them doing their intended jobs. I&#x27;d much rather fix the bad faith problem -- which shouldn&#x27;t be intractable. If we&#x27;re going to be a country, and a democracy, we&#x27;ve got to find a way to have a certain faith in our fellow citizens. That&#x27;s shattered now,  but if it&#x27;s unfixable, then it&#x27;s the country that&#x27;s unfixable, and no rules-tinkering will help.')
