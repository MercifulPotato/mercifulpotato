I hope they succeed soon.<p>I get the sense that a lot of people here (I assume from the US) are worried about their rights being infringed, as part of trying to protect people from getting sick. I&#x27;m not saying there doesn&#x27;t need to be a discussion, or there isn&#x27;t a balance - but it does come across as a bit churlish and petty, to try to openly defy public health measures in the name of defending human rights in the midst of a global pandemic.')
