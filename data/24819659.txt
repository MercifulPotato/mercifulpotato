Item(by='phkahler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603043017, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24818916, text='&gt;&gt; If these things are good for you as an individual (cheap, convenient), why would you want the government to step in and mess them up?<p>I can&#x27;t speak for that commentor but from what I&#x27;ve seen most people who say things like that just dont want to take any responsibility. The attitude is: I do what I want today based on my immediate wants. Its maximum freedom! But I want the government to protect me from others bad behavior. And if they do try to regulate or break up a company that&#x27;s giving me what I want, imma complain about it because it may interfere with my choice.<p>It&#x27;s a combination of narcissism and lack of personal responsibility.<p>Edit: and that last part sounded really shitty. Maybe I need to change who I hang around so I see less of that.')
