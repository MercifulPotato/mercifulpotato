They&#x27;ve been benefitting from millions of man-hours of engineering time RedHat have spent making RHEL without paying a penny for it.  Granted this all benefitted RedHat, but that&#x27;s beside the point -- if you don&#x27;t have a two-way relationship with someone, you don&#x27;t have any right to be upset when they change direction.<p>Pre-2014, all of those users should have recognized that the group making CentOS might disappear at any time, leaving them having to switch away from their current setup; post-2014, all of those users should have recognized that RedHat might change their attitude at any time, leaving them having to switch away from their current setup.  They chose to take that risk because it was free.  Now it&#x27;s time to pay the piper.')
