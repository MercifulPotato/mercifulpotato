During the interview they were telling me how they have a large staff and only expect 60-80% billing because anymore leads to burnout and how they have &#x27;work-home balance&#x27; meetings to ensure they are good.<p>Ya that should have been a red-flag. That stuff lasted at most a month until it ended and it went back to &#x27;the beatings will continue until morale improves&#x27;<p>It was super common to work 60 hour weeks, but every hour of overtime you wanted to get paid for... you had to give detailed explanation to justify why you worked so that they could bill overtime&#x2F;emergency rates to the client.<p>At my first year performance review I got scathing terrible review because our time&#x2F;attendance system said I was late &gt;40 times to work. I immediately asked which days I was late for... so my boss looks it up. Every single one of those lates was me logging in on a weekend after 9am because something was down and generally speaking the on-call person called me for help. So not necessarily that I worked 40 weekends, but saturday at 10am login and then next day at sunday at 11am would be 2 lates.<p>Did my performance review change for the better after realizing that not only was I being awesome and working afterhours and weekends to help my coworkers and the literal only complaint against me was having been late? Nope. Not even a little.')
