Looks like a really awesome little board that&#x27;s going to allow all KINDS of interesting use cases. I really hope to see a new TuringPi cluster; doubly so with ESXi now being available!<p>One note about your article:<p>Due to the nature of PCIe, ANY GPU will happily run on the 1 lane presented here. The limitation will be data transfer, which primarily shows up in texture loading. Tom&#x27;s Hardware did an article [0] a decade ago comparing lanes to performance. This is also why some x16 connectors will be listed as &quot;electrically&quot; x8; they only have 8 lanes exposed.<p>However, you will have issues with the power delivery; PCIe GPU&#x27;s are allowed to pull up to 75 watts from the slot itself before going to direct connectors. There are ways to fix this; I ran a mPCIe (WiFi) to external PCIe adapter for a couple years on an old laptop with a GPU just fine.<p>Another use case (and likely more relevant) would be plugging in an HBA for a NAS. Upgrading the NIC to something multi-gig sounds interesting, but that PCIe x1 is not going to be any faster than the built-in GBe except in edge cases. I&#x27;m actually really curious to see what people do with this.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tomshardware.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;pcie-geforce-gtx-480-x16-x8-x4,2696.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tomshardware.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;pcie-geforce-gtx-480-x1...</a>')
