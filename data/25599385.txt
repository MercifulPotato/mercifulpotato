Itâ€™s too volatile to be an efficient store of value or a useful unit of account for general purposes; it&#x27;s got some use as a competitive medium of exchange for certain circumstances (but again not really with the generality of any major fiat currency.)<p>It&#x27;s commodity that seems to (retrospectively, at least, and there is some reason to expect this to continue for the near future) have good investment performance if you are in a position to wait out down periods, which makes it nice as a component of an investment portfolio.<p>It&#x27;s good at things that aren&#x27;t the purpose of money, but mostly not good for things that are the purposes of money, except for a narrow subset of one of three major purposes of money.')
