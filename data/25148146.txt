It works fine, certainly better than in X. I use the version as shipped by Ubuntu with no changes. Initially there were some bugs but haven&#x27;t had any that are Wayland specific in a while. Chrome has recently enabled Wayland support in the release builds. I&#x27;ve only briefly tried it in that mode so I don&#x27;t know what bugs it may have.<p>- Emacs is X-only because of the way it&#x27;s built, that will take a while to fix. But XWayland works fine. The blurryness with HiDPI is fixed by a workaround in XWayland. I haven&#x27;t used it myself because I don&#x27;t use either emacs or fractional scaling but the solution exists.<p>- Electron is now getting Wayland support with the new versions but it&#x27;s not needed to use those apps. I use Microsoft Teams daily in a HiDPI screen even. It works fine under XWayland and even has a setting to change the size of the interface if wanted. Everything but screen sharing works.<p>- Screen sharing with pipewire exists and works in both Firefox and Chrome, it&#x27;s still going through the channels to be available in distributions. The first workaround is sharing a tab instead of a screen in Chrome. That has always worked fine and I&#x27;ve used it extensively for presentations. The full workaround is that Chrome under XWayland is also able to share any other XWayland window so it&#x27;s possible to create a fake output, connect to it using a VNC app running under X and share that app. Complete hack until we get proper pipewire support from Electron apps adopting newer Chromium. Don&#x27;t know about Zoom and Webex but if those support X sharing the same hack works and if they&#x27;re native apps they also need a pipewire patch.<p>If you&#x27;re happy with your Xorg session then by all means stick with it. Quips about year of the Wayland desktop are actually quite appropriate as they&#x27;re the same as the complaints about year of the Linux Desktop. For me the year of the Linux Desktop was over 20 years ago, and I&#x27;ve been taking advantage of it ever since. The year of the Wayland Desktop for me was this year, as even after dealing with the rough spots I&#x27;ve gotten quite a bit of value from the transition. If you use different apps or have different requirements you may want to wait more, no one is forcing you to switch. Complaining online that your use cases aren&#x27;t solved to your satisfaction in open-source projects is a bit much in my opinion.')
