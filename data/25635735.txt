I augmented those days by walking to a nearby coffee place in the morning to get out of the house and get some movement in.<p>I&#x27;d also try to meet someone for lunch when schedules worked out.<p>This year many of us combined working from home with a restriction on all of those &quot;safety valves&quot; and in-person socialization in general.<p>Personally I think I was happiest with the part-time flexible work from home setup, but I think I could make full time work if I moved to an area with more walking-distance amenities.')
