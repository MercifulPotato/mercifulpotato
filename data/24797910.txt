The email doesn&#x27;t include the name of the bad guy, and even if it did, if the statements are true, then there is no lawsuit to be had. Sure, you could be sued by someone claiming that they&#x27;re false, but under Anti-SLAPP laws if you prove that it&#x27;s frivolous you can yourself be awarded $25,000.<p>Overall it&#x27;s just very hard in the US to sue someone for telling the truth about how awful you are.')
