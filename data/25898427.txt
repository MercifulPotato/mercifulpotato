You do lose consistent non-indent alignment (N-leading space plus M-other characters doesn&#x27;t consistently result in the same horizontal position for constant N+M, or even constant N and M, M&gt;0.)<p>For python, this is not a problem, as consistent indentation is important, but alignment is not (I use proportional fonts for Python and YAML all the time, and the only problem is how annoying the ASCII Art labels someone put in some of our YAML are without consistent alignment.)')
