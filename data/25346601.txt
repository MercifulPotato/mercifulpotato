All we know right now is that Apple has introduced wireless, ANC, over-ear headphones at a premium price.<p>If I were looking to spend that kind of money on headphones -- which, we should be clear, isn&#x27;t that hard to do if you&#x27;re serious about it -- I&#x27;d absolutely <i>listen</i> to these. Given Apple&#x27;s general approach to usability and quality, it&#x27;d be insanely foolish to dismiss them without trying them.<p>&gt;Honestly, I don&#x27;t understand why you would buy these when there are a lot of established professional audio companies offering better sound at a cheaper price.<p>This is what I&#x27;m talking about. How do you KNOW that $other_headphones sound better? The Apple model isn&#x27;t even available yet.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s dead solid clear that Apple&#x27;s making a big move here. It could fail. But they tend not to fail. If they&#x27;re pricing these on par with serious high-end over-ear headphones, then they expect them to be able to compete with those high-end headphones on all the points people care about in that market.<p>&amp; about that: Your counterexamples aren&#x27;t in Apple&#x27;s target market here at all. None of them are wireless, and none of them include noise cancellation.<p>Moreover, the Audeze are <i>open backed</i>, which (for the non headphone nerds still reading) means those around you can hear what you&#x27;re listening to. You get great sound that way -- lots of folks would argue that the best sounding phones in the world are all open-backed -- but it means they&#x27;re terrible choices for most modern headphone applications, like in a public place or open office.<p>I love me some Grados, but they have the same problem.<p>Apple&#x27;s play here is against the high end wireless, ANC product in the market, not these audiophile-only options you mention. I have a $300 pair of ANC wireless Sennheisers that I typically used on planes (ha, ha; remember travel?) or in other contexts where I really needed isolation. They&#x27;re clunky to use and have weird idiosyncrasies, but they do sound better than my Airpods Pro, and they work better for long flights.<p>If they broke, would I consider the new Maxes? Absolutely.')
