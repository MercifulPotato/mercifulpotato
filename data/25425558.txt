You don&#x27;t have the right to infect me. You give up your right not to wear a mask when you go into a grocery store. But no matter how foolish you are, if you get sick, you still get to go to the ER, where you&#x27;re contributing to the maxing out of capacity. And you can infect those on the street.<p>In some perfect libertarian society, where I could tell that I got sick from you, I&#x27;d settle things by suing the pants off you. But that&#x27;s not the real world. Your choices affect me, and society&#x27;s restrictions are how we set that balance.')
