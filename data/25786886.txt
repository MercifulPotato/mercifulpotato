Decoupling academia from this horrendous publishing parasites is an ongoing project that has taken a vast amount of effort from a vast number of academics and continues.<p>You have metrics. You pulish with the parasites, they&#x27;re bigger than with some open-source journal nobody has heard of. Your career progression relies on getting published by the &quot;most prestigious&quot; journal.<p>You want your work read. Everybody in your field read parasite journal A, there isn&#x27;t a good substitute. You&#x27;re stuffed.<p>You don&#x27;t get to decide.
