There is a meaningful interpretation of &quot;buy a dozen&quot; that the wife intended to convey but the programmer fails to notice (because he lacks common-sense knowledge about typical purchase volumes of different items and&#x2F;or is blinded by the parallelism of &quot;buy a... if &lt;condition&gt;, buy a...&quot;). What is the meaningful common-sense interpretation of &quot;I can&#x27;t work here anymore&quot; (was that even the literal wording?) that Timnit intended and Google failed to recognise?<p>If you are instead just saying that Google should have let it slide because it was just an emotional outburst (&quot;anger and frustrations&quot;) and not meant to be taken seriously, well, in what context can we hold adults to their word at all? Email is written communication, not an offhand verbal remark uttered in a tense meeting in anger. You should be able to see what you are about to send while typing it, and have ample opportunity to look over it again before you press that &quot;Send&quot; button. If your ability to review your words has atrophied, perhaps under the influence of social media which encourages &quot;unfiltered&quot; stream-of-consciousness venting, then this ought to be on you, simply because it is doubtful that society can function without <i>some</i> possibility of making binding statements and we do not have anything more commitmental than email widely deployed (and operable at the pace of the modern workplace) in work-from-home times.')
