On average JS developers will be cheaper than C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Rust developers to hire, so I don&#x27;t see shops changing their personnel or stack anytime soon, especially if the job is to knock up a website that&#x27;s a bit interactive.<p>It simply won&#x27;t be viable to have low-level engineers do things like &quot;build a dropdown nav&quot; or &quot;make an interactive carousel&quot;, and these sort of tasks will always be around.<p>WASM is there to augment JS in places JS isn&#x27;t suitable for, rather than outright replace it. JS will definitely still exist.<p>To answer your Q there&#x27;s also a comprehensive list of projects using Web Assembly on this site:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;madewithwebassembly.com&#x2F;all-projects" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;madewithwebassembly.com&#x2F;all-projects</a>')
