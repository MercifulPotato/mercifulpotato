For DC on the other hand there&#x27;s no guarantee the arc will extinguish at all. You can imagine how a sustained arc would be bad for a relay.<p>Of course a higher frequency would heat the contacts even less, and I imagine you could get a relay rated for even higher voltages given a higher AC frequency.')
