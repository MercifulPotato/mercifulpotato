Failure to cite relevant research is a reason to reject a paper from a conference but that&#x27;s not the job of an internal review. Research independence is fundamental and why professors are given tenure. Sure companies are companies and don&#x27;t play by those rules, but you can&#x27;t claim to be making a fair academic criticism if you&#x27;re not adhering to academic norms.<p>If the paper was bad it should have been rejected by the conference to which it was submitted. If the paper was critical of things Google does and it didn&#x27;t like that, that&#x27;s pure suppression. And, as you say, academic norms provide a period of rebuttal, it&#x27;s unclear how much was allowed here.<p>Secondly there is value of having anonymous review in an academic setting, however it sounds like they tried to enforce that anonymous review for the company, which again doesn&#x27;t serve the same purpose. People should be told exactly why decisions are being made so they can correct their mistakes in the future. If you aren&#x27;t willing to invite someone into a decision making process, when a large portion of their research is in biases in institutional decision making, then you have <i>got</i> to know you&#x27;re in for a bad time.')
