Item(by='bonestamp2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611779331, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25933099, text='&gt; watched a lot of TV in the past year with the volume down and captioning onf<p>I like how Apple TV now lets you pair two bluetooth headsets. My wife and I can watch shows without waking the baby. Combine that with the visual sound indicator on the baby monitor, and headphones with transparency mode, we can see when the baby is making noise and hear other environmental noises too. It&#x27;s a nice combination of accessibility features that make a clever setup for hearing the TV. I can&#x27;t wait until Apple TV supports spatial audio... then we&#x27;ll have &quot;surround sound&quot; in our headphones too!')
