The main problem is that people put more minutes of stuff into their backlog &quot;for later reading&quot; than they take out. Every day the backlog grows, because every day there is more interesting stuff published and added to the backlog.<p>Apart from regularly declaring backlog bankruptcy, the only way out of this is to spend more time reading&#x2F;listening and less time adding stuff to the backlog. No amount of optimizing the organisation of the backlog will help if you just keep going deeper and deeper into debt.')
