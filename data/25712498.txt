If a provider is notified that there is problematic content on their machine, they have an obligation to take it down in a reasonable timeframe.<p>Sia hosts already have tooling for complying with DCMAs and abuse notices. To the best of my knowledge, no Sia host has yet received one, but we are prepared for when that moment happens.<p>Most of the rest of the issues in that letter are overstated and ungenerous. Sia&#x2F;Skynet is an early project, with a small team and a limited budget. Of course it is not as polished as its centralized alternatives, but if you compare to better funded projects like Storj and Filecoin, I believe it&#x27;s very difficult to say in good faith that our team is not up for the task.')
