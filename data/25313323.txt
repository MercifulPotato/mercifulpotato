As you know, stock footage is beneficial to filmmakers as it saves shooting new material.<p>Example - \nStarting with something basic, such as creating a folder where you essentially dump, say, every piece of video footage that involves &#x27;writing&#x27; can be a good start.<p>Then narrow it down and creating substructures such as:\n- writing on the computer\n- writing with a pen\n- writing with a pencil etc.<p>It could also be nice if you have some ideas on some software one can use to quickly do a keyword search and get a link&#x2F;path to the desired clip inside your folders.<p>Apply and expand this for various types of footage can be a huge time saver.<p>How do you organize your files?\nAre you using any software to tag&#x2F;find?<p>Thank you!')
