Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25406729], score=None, time=1607854668, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25404320, text='&gt; Did you know that screenreaders, palm PDAs and others all had support for it...and that publishing to a new platform was as easy as linking a new stylesheet? None of that HTML5 crap was necessary. No modernizr, no JS, no pixelperfect designs necessary. It just worked. XHTML 1.1 strict ran everywhere. And by everywhere, I mean even the mobile audiobook players that used the DAISY format. Fully automatically transformed, and voiced over content.<p>And yet none of it really worked. CSS was never good enough because the layouts you need on different platforms require a different markup hierarchy, so either you write some transformations in CSS and some awkwardly coupled XSLT or you do everything in XSLT. But XSLT was awful for humans and awful for tools; I&#x27;m all for declarative sub-Turing languages (efforts like Dhall are wonderful) but XSLT is just bad at being one of them. Even if people made a transformation that worked for some pages, it&#x27;d fail for others, because it&#x27;s impossible to write a transformation correctly for arbitrary input pages and testing every m*n combination of page + transformation is tedious and unrewarding. The only way you could make XSLT or CSS do the right thing is if your page markup was reliably consistent because you generated all your pages with the same program - but if you&#x27;re generating everything from a common sources it&#x27;s easier and more reliable to just generate whichever different versions of your page you want (mobile&#x2F;print&#x2F;whatever) from that.<p>People don&#x27;t actually know or care about the semantics of their pages. Designers want pixel-perfect layouts because they care much more about what their page looks like than what it says, and non-designers had to use the same techniques as designers because browsers were asleep at the wheel in how they handled unstyled pages.')
