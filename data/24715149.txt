It was based on seeders and leechers and worked fine. Granted, trackers were bad, but mostly due to underlying missing encryption for transport.<p>We just need to fix p2p transport encryption with keys that are not made for identification but rather just for the sake of transport of states - in order to guarantee privacy.<p>If keys - or wallets - can be uniquely identified, people could&#x27;ve just used google chrome instead, because they actually gained nothing.')
