Nature isn&#x27;t balanced in any meaningful sense. It lurches from one equilibrium to another in a haphazard way [0]. Equilibriums only appear because all the many unequilibriums die out, so by evolution everything rapidly reaches equilibrium.<p>Also this idea that humans are somehow above nature is not realistic. We <i>are</i> nature, in the same way everything else is. What we are doing is pushing the world to a new equilibrium. The history of everything will class us in the same pool of &quot;sorta-terraforming&quot; species as cyanobacteria. If we can make the world work without wolves, that is the new natural and there is no particular reason to believe there is some sort of cosmic doom awaiting us for our hubris.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equatio...</a>')
