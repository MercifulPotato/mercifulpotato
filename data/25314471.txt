But the people who got in early with Gates or Musk made out like bandits.<p>And the bigger question is - would Microsoft or Tesla happened <i>at all</i> with Gates or Musk?  I mean, at least in Musk’s case everybody thought he was guaranteed to fail.  I don’t begrudge his $1B of wealth in the least - he put his money where his mouth was when everyone else said it was dumb - but <i>he was right</i>.<p>It’s not like they Gate and Musk kept all the wealth for themselves.
