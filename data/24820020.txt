You sound like you have experience with this, so maybe you could give some recommendations:<p>a. How critical is it to use such dedicated hardware - could I use a RPI4 with an added usb3-gigabit eth adapter? (I don&#x27;t need a wired lan, only a wifi one). \nHow much worse would that be compared to the hw you link?<p>b. Which AP would you recommend? I think the Ubiquity AP lite one is reasonably low cost - are there better options with similar cost?')
