Is it scientists? It doesn&#x27;t seem to be for typical engineers who have a <i>lot</i> of very specific needs in FEA software. I can&#x27;t see much aimed at them on the website. Examples of big difficult features that are useful for engineers are robust contact, automatic contact detection, plasticity, post-buckling, geometry defeaturing, automatic midplane extraction for shells, associativity with CAD models, being Ansys or Abaqus (because everyone knows and trusts them), not having to write scripts, not having to convert imperial units to a coherent system, not having to learn a huge complex pile of software (some tension with all the other requirements!), etc.<p>Easy to use FEA is a seemingly impossible goal because of the huge range of features that some users want and other users don&#x27;t want as well as the fact that it has to combine a lot of concepts just don&#x27;t seem to naturally fit well into any simple organizing principle for the user. Then there&#x27;s the zillions of man-hours to do it all.')
