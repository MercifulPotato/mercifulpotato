They have a nice form factor with the size, elastic band, and rear pocket, but they are garbage to write on with every pencil and pen I’ve tried - and I’m an artist, I had a lot of different tools to try the last time I tried them.<p>Currently I have multiple Pentalic Traveller Pocket Journals lying around (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pentalic.com&#x2F;traveler-pocket-journal&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pentalic.com&#x2F;traveler-pocket-journal&#x2F;</a>), they are basically “Moleskine except the paper isn’t waxy trash that your ink slides off of”. No spiral binding, either, they’re perfect bound.')
