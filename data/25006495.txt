That attitude is... not great. The point of making telemetry optional is to respect the users choice, not to say &quot;well you can turn it off but then we do not care about you as a user any more and we&#x27;ll make your life harder by killing features you rely on&quot;. This is exactly the kind of attitude we are seeing way to often when it comes to giving consent to gathering and processing user data; I expect Firefox and Mozilla to be better than that.<p>To me, this is a cautionary tale not for Firefox users but for Firefox developers, who have to learn to deal with the fact that telemetry only reflects a (non-uniformly chosen) subset of their users. If you removed a widely-used feature due to unreliable data, the blame is on you for relying on the data too much, not on users that used their agency to make a choice.')
