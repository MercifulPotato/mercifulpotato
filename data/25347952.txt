I wanted to start a company that builds privacy preserving&#x2F;enhancing products+services. The first product was this location sharing service (scratching my own itch), and my friend said I should just put it out there to see if anybody is actually even interested in it. The code is AGPL [1], the crypto is based on libsodium and the mobile apps are all native.<p>I’d like to find a way to charge for this service so I can spend more time on it, and building other privacy preserving services, but I’m not sure of some things:<p><pre><code>  * Is this a service you would use?\n  * Would you pay for it?\n  * Would you or your company sponsor it?\n</code></pre>\nHappy to answer any questions you may have. Any feedback is appreciated.<p>P.S. I&#x27;m sure you may be wondering &quot;where is the iOS app?&quot;. It&#x27;s coming. Real soon. Now&#x27;ish. Later. It&#x27;s currently undergoing a UI overhaul, and because all of the people I share with are Android users, it hasn&#x27;t been as high of a priority.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zood" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zood</a>')
