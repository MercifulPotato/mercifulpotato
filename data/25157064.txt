I can believe that typescript might not be typesafe, but what does the runtime not having type information have to do with that? If a compiler only accepts sound programs, then it shouldn&#x27;t matter whether the runtime actually knows about the types or not (unless you want to do some sort of reflection, but allowing that is arguably _less_ typesafe). By that logic, you&#x27;d also have to consider anything that compiles to native code also not to be typesafe, because there sure aren&#x27;t types in assembly.')
