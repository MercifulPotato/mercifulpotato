Item(by='pvg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603133535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24828181, text='<i>but in the end one has to be familiar with some calculus and complex numbers to make sense of this topic.</i><p>I think this is more important than the listing of terms one by one in some of the sibling comments. The intros to Calculus, Analysis, Linear Algebra you get in high school&#x2F;university will get you to the right place. But if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with &#x27;function&#x27; or &#x27;exponentiation&#x27;, you&#x27;re probably missing some more secondary-school-level maths background to tackle those topics. That&#x27;s not a difficult gap to close but it&#x27;s a necessary first step before taking the next one.')
