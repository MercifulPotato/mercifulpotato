This was in the days when things like Zip drives were not yet obsoleted, and it seemed visionary.<p>So I was surprised and pleased when YC funded Drew because Microsoft never did anything with Ozzie&#x27;s vision. Early Dropbox was elegant and simple, as Drew intended.<p>I think this is a case where adding Adobe integration is like how Adobe installs McAfee by default, etc. Referral programs to generate revenue because the freemium product is not generating enough to keep investors happy.<p>I would not be surprised if Drew was irritated that Adobe had to be bundled into the product.<p>But let&#x27;s also note that Drew has been very pragmatic and hired neocon hawk and Iraq war architect Condi Rice for the board in an attempt to secure government contracts.<p>I think Dropbox did a great job with Sync and I like the filesystem extension idea, it just needs a bit more refinement. SmartSync has worked very well for me and I think turning it on by default is the obvious correct choice.')
