You should be taxed for owning things, because the government enforces your property rights, not just for labor, for which the government doesn&#x27;t directly contribute at all. I should be able to earn money for my labor without the government taking a fraction every time it moves around. Even if you move to the woods, you&#x27;re still taking military protection from the surrounding government- even if you somehow avoid using any other service like roads, public education, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t understand this widespread belief that you have a right to permanent ownership. Someone has to enforce that ownership, and that has costs. What does seem wrong in principle is taxing transfers of money, which are virtually free with modern computer systems, not to mention the increased economic friction in the labor market.<p>You raise a good point with liquidity. Personally, I wonder, how could we set up a system of fractional ownership that delays repossession in such cases? Of course, if you never pay tax on that heirloom, then you&#x27;ll eventually lose a controlling interest- and I think this makes sense, especially for fundamentally limited resources like land.')
