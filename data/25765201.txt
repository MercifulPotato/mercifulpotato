The easiest distinction here is &#x27;inappropriate&#x27; content from the rest. Sometimes the user is interested in that content, but not every time they open the app. It might even be that most of the time they don&#x27;t want to see that content.<p>I experience this with politics videos on YouTube. Sometimes I&#x27;m in the mood for that. One evening I&#x27;ll watch a few politics videos. The next day, my recommendations are filled with politics. Over time my recommendations get back to normal. Then I&#x27;m struck with the politics bug again, but my recommendations don&#x27;t give me an easy way to find more politics content. They&#x27;re recommending the type of stuff I&#x27;d normally watch. The day after that I&#x27;m annoyed again about politics being all over my recommended lists.<p>It feels like I should have separate profiles based on the topics I&#x27;m interested in. The platforms don&#x27;t seem to really support that though. Even different users seem to influence each others suggestions.')
