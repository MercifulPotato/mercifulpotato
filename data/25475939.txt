If Appleâ€™s are sufficiently attractive it will eat the market share of consumer devices from the likes of Dell&#x2F;HP&#x2F;etc. When they start selling less devices they have less need for AMD or Intel CPUs.<p>This leaves only the datacenter market where Apple will not compete with Intel and AMD.<p>Indeed, there is lots of room for a (new?) player to pull of the same trick as Apple for general purpose cpus. I just think they are not as well positioned because of the lack of vertical integration. So AMD and Intel indirectly have to worry about what Apple is doing.')
