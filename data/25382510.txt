This is the fundamental problem that we need to solve, and what RSS is very poor at addressing today. I think that being able to process massive content streams in a human-friendly way is one of those problems that would be world-changing if solved effectively. Facebook and Twitter have failed at this so far, with far-reaching negative consequences for societies.<p>My gut feeling is that this probably means that we need a paradigm shift in how we relate to content streams. I think your move towards algorithmic transparency is a step in the right direction, though it may have to be bigger than that.<p>I think the fundamental design flaw of modern content aggregation sites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, is that lack of transparency. They think that they know what&#x27;s best for you.<p>1. You don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re being recommended what you&#x27;re seeing.<p>2. You can&#x27;t teach them to avoid topics. You can only mark individual videos&#x2F;posts as &quot;not interested&quot; and hope The Algorithm takes the hint. Likewise, you can&#x27;t teach them to recommend more of a certain topic.<p>3. You can&#x27;t see a feed as someone else, so everyone is in their own bubble by default. Reddit and Hacker News avoids this issue by showing everyone the same feed.<p>4. They tend to have poorly thought-out metrics for relevancy. For example on Facebook comments, users tend to use the Laugh and Angry reacts as negative signal. These comments also get a large number of negative comments. Facebook is completely blind to this, and shows them at the top since it treats all interactions as effectively equal. Cool, they&#x27;ve just built a system that boosts toxicity.')
