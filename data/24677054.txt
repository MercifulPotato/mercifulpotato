On my servers haproxy (doing SSL termination) accounts for about 70% of CPU time spent. Doing SSL termination on my load balancers would mean I would need about 2 &quot;load balancers&quot; for every 1 server - which could be a legitimate setup in other circumstances though.<p>If I needed to do load balancing via an intermediate server, it would make more sense for me to load-balance on the raw (i.e. TLS traffic) TCP layer.')
