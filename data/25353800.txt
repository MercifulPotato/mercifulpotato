Item(by='sokoloff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607474853, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25352781, text='UPS does indeed run a third-party-logistics (3PL) business, but I doubt that&#x27;s able to be cannibalized to act as a buffer tank for their parcel business. (I also suspect that UPS&#x27;s 3PL business is also booming this year. They reported Supply Chain &amp; Freight as their fastest growing segment in Q3 earnings, growing 16.5% year-on-year, while US domestic grew &quot;only&quot; 13.8% with the note &quot;continued elevated residential demand&quot;. SC&amp;F is not solely domestic 3PL, so it&#x27;s hard to be sure how that sub-segment is doing, but it&#x27;s probably also under volume pressure.)')
