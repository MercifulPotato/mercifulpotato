In the 1980s it was probably quite good. So was the Commodore 64, but you wouldnâ€™t write your thesis on it in 2020, would you?<p>Whenever I see this type of argument I always get frustrated. I use shovels too, they were invented ages ago. I still use hammers, they&#x27;ve been around since time immemorial.<p>More close to home, I use SQL, which was also invented in the &#x27;70s&#x2F;&#x27;80s, and I love it.<p>Speaking to TeX directly, yeah, it has some unfortunate warts because it is old. But, by the same token, it is mature and has sooo many packages allowing you to typeset nearly anything. Markdown does a pretty good job, but sometimes you need something special or weird, which is a common problem in academia. I mean, that&#x27;s what you do in academia: you try to find something novel to present to others.<p>Sure, I&#x27;ll try new stuff if it comes out and tries to remove warts. But, I doubt anything that removes the warts of TeX will not also remove some of its usefulness as well. Rust hasn&#x27;t yet killed C++.')
