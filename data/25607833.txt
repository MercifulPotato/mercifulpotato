The houses have been rebuild many times, but there is still wood in some houses here that&#x27;s been dated to the 1530s. My own house only dates to c. 1870-80, though it&#x27;s made of recycled stone and wood, presumably from the house known from records to have been on the same site in 1620. Apparently, there was considerable demolition and new builds&#x2F;rebuilding in the town in the 1870s. \nAll the houses in the street have chimneys, and there&#x27;s a ready supply of wood locally, either gathered from the countryside or purchased from one of the many suppliers. Unsurprisingly, fires&#x2F;stoves are frequently used for heating, and there&#x27;s usually a smell of smoke outside in winter. \nMy house originally had three flues; one for the kitchen range (now blocked off and the range replaced with a sink), one in the master bedroom (blocked off with the fireplace merely decorative) and one in the main living room (fitted with a modern stove).')
