Very little.<p>And what happened when you got online? You could communicate online, suddenly reaching millions and then billions of humans. So learning just a little bit about IP (let&#x27;s be real, you didn&#x27;t need to know shit about TCP)<p>Compare that to a VPN or Tor. What do you need to understand to use it, and what is the payoff for knowing it? It&#x27;s nowhere near the same situation as IP and the beginning of consumer internet.')
