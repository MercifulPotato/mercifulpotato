I decided just this week to try to get back into listening to audiobooks, and this morning I was sitting here  having my usual angst about the Amazon ecosystem and looking at the options. I can’t help wondering if this is one of those things where I think about an old song I haven’t heard in years and suddenly they’re playing everywhere, making me feel I somehow manifested it, but the truth is that the reason I thought of it in the first place is that they had started playing it everywhere because of a wave of zeitgeist. In this case, I can’t help wondering if something about lockdown or current-events burnout is causing folks to want to switch from podcasts to longer form media less filled with hot takes, which is sort of where I’m at.<p>Another interesting thing on this topic is that Audible now allows signing up within the iOS app, which I don’t believe was possible before. Im not sure if the reason for that has been reported anywhere, but I assume that means one of a couple of things: They have struck a deal to reduce Apple’s cut (seems unlikely), they’re taking a loss to try to solidify their domination of the market, or maybe some combination of taking a loss plus their new business model which involves a lot of cheap “Amazon Originals” content. There seems to be a rush right now between Spotify and Amazon to become the next Netflix of podcasting (which is to say, a closed, subscription-based ecosystem of exclusive content). I don’t think that’s going to be a great situation, but I don’t get the sense they’re super interested in my opinion on that.')
