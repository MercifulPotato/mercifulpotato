Some points to add:<p>- CICS was largely used to run online apps, using it to process back-end functions grew in popularity during&#x2F;after the Client-Server period<p>- COBOL is has become a fairly complex language. e.g. You can write a GUI app for Windows (or at the time OS&#x2F;2 PM) with it<p>- Cloud has many dimensions other than shared allocation of computing resources<p>This high-level comparison isn&#x27;t much different or worthwhile than saying a Facebook datacenter is their modern computer&#x2F;application-platform.
