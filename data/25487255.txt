I was wondering if anyone has any advice on dealing with stress during coding tests for entry-level software engineering jobs. I have done a few of these before and have so far failed every single time.<p>As objectively as I could assess myself (more information below), all the evidence (both subjective and objective) points to a case of stress-induced degradation in performance, and I don&#x27;t really know how to deal with it.<p>I&#x27;m honestly not trying to find an excuse to make myself feel better for failing. Thank you very much for any help in advance, and I wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy New Year!<p>## Additional information<p>I have considered that it&#x27;s simply because I am not skilled enough, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case because I always have the problems saved, and when I reattempt the problems immediately after the test:<p>* I seem to be able to think through the problems much more clearly.<p>* I can come up with more edge cases that I didn&#x27;t during the actual test.<p>* I notice, in comparison, in the actual attempt I would be fussing over too much how variables are named (and often end up naming them worse); whether or not my code was clean (and end up writing super ugly code); and whether or not time and space complexity are optimal (an end up forgetting all about the data strictures and algorithms I know and produce a wrong solution).<p>* I can often come up with a substantially better (and correct) solution both in terms of time complexity and space complexity.<p>* I can usually solve each problem within 15 minutes (including time spent on writing the code and testing). Whereas in the actual test I would often spend at least 30 minutes on a simple problem, and then end up writing a brute-force algorithm that&#x27;s still wrong because I&#x27;m running out of time.<p>* I&#x27;m pretty sure the uneasy feeling I had during the actual test was stress&#x2F;anxiety, not least because I regular do coding challenges and can solve much harder problems')
