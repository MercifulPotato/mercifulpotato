Not a big deal; got the spare on, schedule some time at the mechanics to get a new tire. Tire gets put on, everything is great, time passes.<p>Later, come back for a regularly scheduled tire rotation. &quot;We can&#x27;t get the lug nuts off. They&#x27;ve been over tightened.&quot; the mechanic says. &quot;Well, how do you suppose that happened?&quot; I ask. Of course, it goes a. completely over that their head, (they were the last ones to touch the lug nuts) and of course, b., it&#x27;s my wallet that pays for their error.<p>They were not the mechanic for a while after that. Aside from that gaffe they did good work, and everybody else I tried for a while was all around worse. Eventually returned to them, and that was really the only problem I ever hadâ€¦')
