People have fought and died for conquering other&#x27;s people land, to enforce the &quot;true&quot; religion, for money, for glory...<p>&quot;Are you sure all those people were that wrong that they sacrificed so much, for something they shouldn&#x27;t have wanted?&quot;<p>The more wrong, the more stubborn.
