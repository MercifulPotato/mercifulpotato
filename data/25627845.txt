(Disclaimer: I work on ads at one of these companies).<p>Platforms can accurately determine who engaged with an ad (basic logging on their sites), they have infrastructure to create statistically balanced ad experiments, and can also accurately determine whether a conversion happened (either through a conversion pixel or through data brokers).<p>Running these tests on behalf of advertising clients, or for internal research is fairly standard. If we couldn&#x27;t prove statistically that our ads were working, I would have left a long time ago.')
