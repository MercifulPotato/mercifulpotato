The question will be if Apple intend to have the chip they are going to be using in Mac Pro to be running inside their own DataCenter? It is highly unlikely Apple will be switching to macOS for their own Server infrastructure, so the question is would Apple make sure Linux works on their M1?<p>Would the model make sense? Even if Apple manage to sell 100K Mac Pro a year, it would barely make up the cost of a new CPU SKUs. So they will certainly need more volume to amortised those cost. And Server seems like a logical extension to it.  Would Apple start using <i>and</i> selling XServe? Considering they are so far ahead of competition and it is extremely power efficient. Electricity cost contribute to a lot of the Datacenter running cost.<p>To me the M1 or A14X has always been the less exciting part, since everything is well known. You are limited by 10-20W TDP there is only so much you can do. The most interesting parts remains on the 100W+ TDP Apple Silicon.')
