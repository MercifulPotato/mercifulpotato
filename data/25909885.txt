That&#x27;s part of why the US freaked out so much about missiles coming to Cuba and why Russia developed more mobile launch capability than the US. The only real &#x27;defense&#x27; against and ICBM (at the time we&#x27;re maybe figuring out real defenses now) was to be able to survive to strike back which isn&#x27;t so much a defense as deterrent.')
