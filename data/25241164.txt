It doesn&#x27;t make you better or more special (or unique) than other people, but it helps you realize that what works for others may not always work for you, and vice versa, and that&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s important when dealing with others and oneself to remember that everyone&#x27;s different, and different isn&#x27;t bad.')
