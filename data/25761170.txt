The tabloid was reporting correctly.<p>The fact these sorts of things, including all the other violence and destruction going on at the time, were either ignored wholesale or played down by mainstream news sources, while also being actively encouraged in the next breath ought to be a source of shame for them. The country spent the last year being gas-lit.<p>Its no surprise at all why many people on the right distrust them.')
