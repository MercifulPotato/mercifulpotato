And you can today exchange btc for monero, ethereum or whatever and back again and it&#x27;s virtually untrackable who owns it or where it came from.<p>Because of this, governments could no longer do any automated taxation, they could no longer have any verification of who owns what, and so they would have to manually tax everyone based on manual observation of physical assets, as they probably couldn&#x27;t look into most peoples actual financial records either, unless it was voluntary. This is untenable of course<p>&gt;I’m also interested in what a world with a fixed amount of currency really looks like.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be fixed in reality, and nobody would really know how much money exists and each currency and inflation would have to be determined individually and you would have booms and crashes based on just how individual markets supply&#x2F;demand progresses (i think?)')
