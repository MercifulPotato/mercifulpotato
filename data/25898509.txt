They&#x27;re behind the times.<p>It&#x27;s not about the times. It&#x27;s about biology, people are born with this type of behavior that is as biologically ingrained as heterosexuality or homosexuality. Humans tend to group with each other based off of race. This occurs everywhere including with Japanese and Chinese people born in the US. If you ever grew up in a community of people where there was a large enough mixture of Caucasians and minorities you will see that races group together automatically little incentive from others even though everyone more or less shares the same culture of being born in the same country.<p>You can&#x27;t expect culture to override biology. What you see in the west is the unique phenomenon and everywhere else is basically displaying the biological norm. Because of biology this phenomenon is unlikely to establish itself as the norm for the majority of human existence. You cannot overwrite biology.<p>If you go to another country and your face stands out like a sore thumb expect to be treated differently everywhere because of nature, don&#x27;t expect everyone to come to their senses and implement total equality.<p>The best you can hope for is equal treatment under the law, but the law is an ideal that is a caricature of the actual reality. If you have a two foot long nose, you will be treated differently in every country you go to, no amount of equality in the law can fix this.<p>I can cite tons of evidence for the biological origins of this &quot;racist&quot; behavior if that&#x27;s the direction we want to take this. Either way I don&#x27;t agree to even attack minor &quot;infractions&quot; or call it racism because it can&#x27;t ever be fixed.<p>What can be fixed is deep racial hatreds and actual racial tensions. White people enslaving black people then segregating them and shooting them under the cover a &quot;crime&quot; is a real issue. White people forcing and enslaving chinese people to build rail roads is actual racism, Hitler killing Jews is racism. Other things are unfix-able and minor and therefore I wouldn&#x27;t group it with the atrocities committed above.<p>Not to mention when a white guy goes to an Asian country they often actually can get &quot;better&quot; treatment along with the &quot;bad&quot; treatment just because of the privilege associated with the caucasian race. It&#x27;s often one of the reasons why white people go live in another Asian country because Asian girls are &quot;easier&quot; and more &quot;beautiful.&quot; No doubt if you lived in Asia it&#x27;s likely you&#x27;ve taken advantage of this &quot;reverse&quot; racism.<p>By all means take advantage of it, I see nothing wrong with it, but don&#x27;t expect total equality, we all know it&#x27;s not going to happen if we&#x27;re all perfectly honest with ourselves... especially if you&#x27;re already taking advantage of the inequalities that benefit you.')
