It&#x27;s pretty standard stuff if you want to ship an API into a production environment and expect other developers&#x2F;services to interact with your model.  How do you know your model is failing&#x2F;slow to serve requests? You need monitoring&#x2F;logging.  How do add security? I&#x27;m talking API security, like JWT tokens with scopes and claims.<p>Maybe we mean different things by &quot;productionising ML applications&quot; but building a docker container with an R runtime and the correct package versions is not all, or even half, of what&#x27;s required for production.')
