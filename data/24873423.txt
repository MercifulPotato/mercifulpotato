The alliance hasn&#x27;t fallen apart entirely, and in the event of an actual shooting war with China would most likely be forced together. But shooting is unlikely, and the fragility of the alliance makes peacetime coordination more difficult.<p>That&#x27;s potentially to China&#x27;s advantage. It&#x27;s not larger than the US plus its allies, but when the US goes without its allies, it&#x27;s no longer the largest player. In a multiplayer world, those allies you mention could well decide that China is, if not their ally, at least somebody they can do business with.')
