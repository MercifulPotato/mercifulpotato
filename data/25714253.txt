It&#x27;s either USD or EUR wired from abroad directly or equivalent sum in UAH if you have contract with Ukrainian entity (we simply can&#x27;t have transactions inside the country in currencies other then hryvnia). You can&#x27;t get your hands on hard cash in USD or EUR either way, but in the first scenario you can at least keep it and choose when to sell.')
