I said the more vague term “undermine democracy”. That was on purpose.<p>Social media is used for personal and political gain throughout the world. You could argue (and I wouldn’t disagree) that brexit happened because bad actors used social media to undermine democracy in the UK. However the UK is still democratic (at least to the same extent that it ever was). The same can not be said if Trump uses social media to declear him self a winner in a partially tallied election.<p>I think the nearest international example if the current (very likely) US situation is the Venezuela presidential election of 2018, where Juan Guaidó declared him self the president even though Nicolás Maduro won the election. But even then social media wasn’t the medium of choice to go about it (international leaders were; albeit international leaders that used social media).')
