It did the same sort of things that joining a &quot;cut ties&quot; cult like scientology or 7th day adventists did;  you&#x27;d lose friends, spouses, even your job, etc.<p>None of this is a new phenomenon - it&#x27;s just, people don&#x27;t join the moonies or hare krishna anymore - they join weird internet cults now like QAnon.<p>(In my case, we essentially lost a family member who went on a deep-dive into anti-semitic nationalism back in the 60s.)')
