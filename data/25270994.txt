It&#x27;s to complain that a product is overpriced. People do this all the time, go look at reddit or HN or anywhere else complaining about inflated monthly costs, expensive SaaS, lamenting how Adobe is now a subscription.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re selling, but one of the best ways to get a shitty price review is if you lock any features behind IAP. To prevent this, sell a 2nd version with the feature already in there _with an app purchase price_, not IAP.<p>For required permissions, absolutely, I would complain and let people know, especially people that are not technically inclined, if something was demanding contacts or location or the ability to scan for BTLE when they don&#x27;t need it and it&#x27;s purely to satisfy a tracking or advertising SDK. 1 star, disgusting  abusive behaviour.')
