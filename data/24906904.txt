My friend was an intern who was tasked with porting some of the network protocol stack to SystemVerilog. Apparently it did work and SystemVerilog was the right HDL to use because of support for structs that can map to packet headers. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s being used in production.<p>It&#x27;d be interesting to see how AMD will execute and integrate this acquisition, considering they are less of a madhouse company than Intel.')
