I have no doubt it will, but you can still hide serious security issues in 4k LOC. Especially C. Also, you can still have bugs in client implementations, and especially in the process used to pass keys around.<p>I picked OpenSSH purely because it&#x27;s been around so long and had so much data tunneled through it.<p>That said, I would still trust WG with my data.
