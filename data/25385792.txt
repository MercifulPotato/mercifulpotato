This is first and foremost a legal document, yeah?  I wonder which of the dozens of public &quot;incidents&quot; informed this decision (or maybe the fact that so many have happened is what spurred the rewrite).<p>Just something to think about from a &quot;new startup&quot; perspective; if you have users that can post content, you need something like this, and the old &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; versions probably don&#x27;t cut it today.')
