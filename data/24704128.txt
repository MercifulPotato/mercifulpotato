It&#x27;s not that there is a shortage for talent. It&#x27;s that there is a shortage for talent available at the price point that corporations want. Does that mean we should create an indentured servitude system to make that available?<p>The whole idea of artificially creating an immigration system expressly for those willing to get exploited is pretty distasteful to me and harkens back to a bunch of other distasteful ways this country used to procure its cheap labor. The bandaid has to be pulled off at some point. People will get hurt in the process. But if this isn&#x27;t rectified now, even more suffering will occur in the future.')
