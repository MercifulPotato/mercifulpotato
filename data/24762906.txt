My claim is that the _details_ of how cloud functions work will gradually mutate in strange and subtle ways you can&#x27;t anticipate today, in a manner akin to the way that Google Chrome&#x27;s behavior has gradually mutated. Just because successful services will tend to follow their most lucrative customers&#x27; use cases. The long tail running tiny lambdas will lose influence over time.<p>This may take many forms. Pricing models may change. Use cases that gradually see diminishing use may get discontinued (Google Chrome). You might get on some sort of treadmill of having to update details every so often (Facebook API). I can&#x27;t predict what exactly will happen, but I believe that if your use case doesn&#x27;t fit &quot;we run a bazillion Lambdas and send tens of thousands of dollars (at least) into Amazon&#x27;s bank account every month,&quot; any service you receive is accidental and contingent.')
