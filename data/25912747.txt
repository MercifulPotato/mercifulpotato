Voting isn&#x27;t a technology problem; it&#x27;s a funding and people problem like most political issues. Other countries--large, developed countries--don&#x27;t take days to hand-count paper ballots, and the tallies don&#x27;t need people blathering about audits and statistics for voters to have confidence in them.<p>The fact that it takes as long as it does in the US and there is <i>still</i> a fear that it&#x27;s not secure or that it&#x27;s suspicious--no matter how wrong that fear may be--is a problem. And it&#x27;s not a &quot;dumb normies need more education about statistics&quot; problem. It&#x27;s a problem created by forcing a &quot;solution&quot; that is unnecessary (paper ballots, counted by hand work fine) and unnecessarily complicated.')
