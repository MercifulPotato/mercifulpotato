I think what spurred my comment was that I feel like I have hit a brick wall and just feel exhausted. I am not getting younger, got a wife, two kids and a demanding career as a principal engineer. I want to desperately build my own start up again and learn something new. As you said, persistence and resilience are the critical components to getting through that barrier. Like many others here I assume, it can be exhausting wanting to learn about everything :).')
