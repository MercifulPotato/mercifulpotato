Its all real. If instead of a direct mix down to baseband, you tell the sdr to mix the minimum frequency in the signal you care about down to just above zero, you can work without i and q. For instance, if you mix an am radio freq down to audio frequency, its all real and you can hear it and represent it as an array of real values.<p>Edit, this is how the Airspy sdr works, to avoid iq imbalance like you get in the direct conversion receivers in most sdrs.<p>Second edit for terminology. Mixing is multiplying by a frquency to shift frequency. Baseband means you shifted the center of the frquencies you care about to zero, so half of the frequency content is negative. Negative frequencies are what drive that mean imaginary number into the whole thing.')
