I recently did some vanilla ES6, now that browser support is finally at a point where you don&#x27;t need to transpire to ES5 - I admit, ES6 is <i>much</i> nicer than things used to be, and not having to transpile is <i>wonderful</i>.<p>But realistically you still want a JS build pipeline of some kind, for minification, compiling SASS to CSS, and other things. And of course if you&#x27;re doing &quot;modern&quot; frontend work, you&#x27;re not using vanilla JS like I was - you&#x27;re using a complicated framework like Angular, React etc, and having to deal with the likes of webpack.<p>And then there&#x27;s the anaemic standard library - honestly, <i>barely</i> any better than it was 10 years ago. And then, largely as a result, you&#x27;ve got NPM-dependency hell, with hundreds or thousands of deps for just about anything. Want to trim a string - there&#x27;s a package for that.<p>And then there are other languages and ecosystems - when you compare JavaScript to those... well, then you really <i>have</i> to admit it&#x27;s a turd.<p>Hating on JavaScript isn&#x27;t a bandwagon - there are many genuine reasons why people dislike it and the ecosystem. IMO, comparing it to a &quot;circle jerk&quot; is like that meme where some character is surrounded by fire saying &quot;this is fine&quot;.')
