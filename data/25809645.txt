I&#x27;m just saying, Iran are winning.<p>So we either need to drive them back. And that means a huge military operation lasting decades, costing trillions and with a lot of troop deaths. It will make Iraq look like a picnic. The USA will probably need to reintroduce the draft. The Europeans will want no part of it. And it will have to last 100 years.<p>Or we sit down and negotiate: stop fucking with Iraqs oil and we will let you sell yours too. Drop the nuclear program and you can access western markets instead (they already went for this). Stop pushing Hezbollah and we will guarantee your safety.<p>I don&#x27;t think we have the stomach for the first option. So we negotiate it we lose.')
