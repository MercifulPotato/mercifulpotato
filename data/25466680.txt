I want to seamlessly work as if I was sitting in the office (I can ssh to the machine).<p>My current setup is to sshfs mount my remote code, install a conda env on my laptop mirroring the office one, and execute things in a terminal window. PyCharm then becomes an editor, autocompleter, refactoring tool, code navigation tool etc, but I don&#x27;t do debugging within it.<p>There is some SSH and remote interpreter options but it&#x27;s limited and hard to use. You can&#x27;t directly work on the remote files, it uses a model of publishing your changes to the remote and keeps multiple copies etc. Several of us spent quite some time trying to come up with a good workflows for this but some rather use remote desktops or X forwarding because it&#x27;s not straightforward.')
