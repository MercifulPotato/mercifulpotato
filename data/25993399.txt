I mostly like hot drinks when I have to sit down and work throughout the day. I definitely cannot relate to that caffeine buzz. I consume almost no caffeine on the weekends and I cannot really tell a difference from an alertness standpoint. There are nights I cannot sleep at all and toss and turn until the wee hours of the morning, and there are nights I fall asleep within 5 minutes and sleep throughout the night. Neither seems to have anything to do with the amount of caffeine I&#x27;m consuming.')
