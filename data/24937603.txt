Not by the government. Not by private enterprise.<p>People pay good money with good reason to have things curated for them. The New York Times decides what to publish and your local TV station decides what to air. That they choose to not print your article or letter to the editor or air your content is not out-of-bounds censorship. Why must Twitter or Facebook or YouTube be held to a looser standard? Or should the NYT print it all as well?')
