I try to make communication &quot;modular&quot;. There is tension between over-communicating (giving full context) and under-communicating (leaving out details). The first sentence of each paragraph summarizes the point. If you know that stuff already, you can skip. If you are re-reading, you can quickly get up to speed by skimming first sentences. If you are surprised by the first sentence, read the paragraph.<p>3. I often use numbers so that my recipient can answer or discuss just one point from my text. That usually starts with &quot;Ad2&quot;. You can then &quot;split&quot; the discussion by numbering annotations &quot;Ad2.1&quot;.
