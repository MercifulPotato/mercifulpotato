Taking a quick look around it does feel like FlightAware has a lot more openness to it than FR24, which is interesting for me, but I am interested in other opinions on this?<p>I mean, getting the subscription for pushing the data is always a nice bonus, kinda tempted to just push data to both, and have another Pi sitting in my loft!<p>Personally, I love just being nosey and seeing the flights around my area, but I am just a bit strange like that ;)')
