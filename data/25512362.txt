It&#x27;s the fact that you have to step on people to get past a certain level that&#x27;s the toxic dynamic.<p>And, as far as boot licking goes, that&#x27;s easy to explain.  People are under the delusion that if they suck up to the boss enough, eventually they can <i>be</i> the boss.  That&#x27;s wrong on so many levels, but the easiest one to see is that for every N employees at any level of the corporate hierarchy, it only makes sense for there to be at most, say, N&#x2F;4, or N&#x2F;10, or, generally, N&#x2F;k (k &gt; 1) people at the next level.  So, your chances of rising further up the ladder decrease the further you go up, provided you stay at the same organization.<p>That&#x27;s actually the way it works in general, except that there are a <i>lot</i> of organizations out there; the hierarchy cuts off at a level before it becomes literally impossible to advance; and, even if that fails, one can start one&#x27;s own organization, place themselves at the top, and then take on the challenge of building that organization to meaningful levels.<p>But, really, it all amounts to the delusion the bottom 90% of the ladder has that they can eventually join the top 1%, if only they work hard enough!  You know, as if it were literally even possible to work enough hours at any reasonable wage to become a billionaire or something.  That&#x27;s the real reason.')
