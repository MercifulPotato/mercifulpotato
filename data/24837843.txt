When I opened it, the very first thing it did was ask me if it could access my contacts for sharing them with my (as yet unchosen?) identity server.<p>Then, I registered an account and clicked the “People” tab. I was immediately prompted to enable contact discovery, via a modal called “Contact Discovery”. It specifically calls out finding contacts by email and phone number. There was never an option presented to select my own identity server, or change what info is published.<p>If “contact discovery” isn’t part of the core offering, it certainly makes a great attempt to look like it is. The only choice I had available to me is to decline sharing my metadata, which is the same option Signal makes available for SGX.<p>I get that due to the magic of open source and federation, Matrix implementations could technically use random numbers or favorite colors or some other identifier, and I’m sure there are other less recommended clients which let me pick my own identity server or only share certain slices of data. But if we can’t agree that the flow recommended on the website is the one that the vast majority of users are going to follow, there’s not much room for a productive discussion.')
