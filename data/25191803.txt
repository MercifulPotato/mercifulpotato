Maybe one won&#x27;t get very ill if they are infected with Covid-19.  But it&#x27;s also possible that they&#x27;ll inadvertently pass it on to others who may become gravely ill (or worse.)<p>What does it cost you to wear a mask? It&#x27;s uncomfortable and annoying - I agree!  If we make mask-wearing complicated (over nose, under nose, under the chin!) people will just do the most comfortable thing and it&#x27;ll wind up being completely ineffective.<p>The coronavirus doesn&#x27;t care if you are republican or democrat.<p>Simple rule: wear a mask when there&#x27;s other people around - your life may not depend on it, but your or someone else&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s might. If a vaccine is truly around the corner, we can actually cause some people not to die by wearing masks. There&#x27;s just no good reason to be this selfish, prolonging this nightmare in the process.')
