I worked in there for a few days to get a feel for it out of curiosity (my team was in a dif building). It was awful, it was completely dark inside, almost no natural light, the building is old as shit and super janky as a result. It&#x27;s also across the street from McStabs so once they moved in, every Seattle employee started getting emergency stay inside texts because of the street level problems outside that building.')
