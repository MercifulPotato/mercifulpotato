I have an app on my phone that tells me sunrise and sunset, but as the article describes these aren&#x27;t the same thing. I also have a very expensive top-of-the-range Garmin watch and even <i>that</i> just tells me the less useful sunrise and sunset, which makes me suspicious it&#x27;s not as military as it markets itself as.<p>I don&#x27;t know if anyone knows an app that gives first-light and last-light for the phone, so I don&#x27;t have to buy a new watch?')
