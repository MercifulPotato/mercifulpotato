Can even replace copper use cases if cheap enough<p>problem with gold is that there&#x27;s a consistent 2% supply inflation per year and if gold price shoots up, Miners mine more and i&#x27;m technical innovation will inflate supply further(asteroid mining or atleast cheaper mining techniques). So if you&#x27;re a gold holder, gold miners go against your value. in the long run gold is not a great investment but it is still better than most of the other stuff that can be produced easily with machines etc.<p>Bitcoin supply issuance is predictable and mathematically known and provable. If prices goes up, more people mining only increases the security and decentralization of the network. So if you are BTC holder, BTC miners are your friends not enemies unlike gold.')
