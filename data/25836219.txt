There was a similar event somewhat recently. (last 8 years?) I unfortunately can&#x27;t remember the exact quote or article, but a leader of a small protest movement for racial justice was meeting with the president, and said something like &quot;We feel like our voices aren&#x27;t being heard,&quot; to which President Obama replied &quot;You&#x27;re speaking to the president of the United States.&quot;<p>We seem to have a similar problem now. A lot of the frustrated, disenfranchised people are heard quite a bit: by their local government officials, their Senate and House officials, and then by some sections of the news media. It makes me wonder that &quot;we&#x27;re not being heard&quot; actually means &quot;we can tell we&#x27;re not considered mainstream in popular culture.&quot;')
