Item(by='6gvONxR4sf7o', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606174773, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25190138, text='SFWA seems to be saying that Disney&#x27;s argument is that when they bought the rights from George Lucas, the royalties didn&#x27;t come along with that. It seems Disney is not asserting there are no royalties in the contract, just rather that they don&#x27;t have to pay them.<p>I assume SFWA and ADF have discussed this beyond what they are posting to twitter. Him not posting the contract to everyone on the internet seems like a weird detail to call out as a point against him.')
