Even more so than experience.[0]<p>Whiteboard interviews are used, not because they have a lot of relevance to the job, but because they&#x27;re a hard-to-fake indicator of high intelligence. Somebody who shows a lot of mental fluidity with complex data structures, almost assuredly can quickly master any specific tech stack. Even more so than a less intelligent person with years of experience in that specific tech stack.<p>It&#x27;s the same reason that the military selects infantrymen based on word synonyms and fast mental arithmetic. What does that have to do with loading a rifle or marching in formation? Not a whole lot specifically, but whenever they&#x27;ve lower the intelligence standards, the results have been disastrous.[1]<p>There are other important qualities for certain. Honesty, resilience, hard work, enthusiasm, being a team player, reliability, etc. But almost all of those qualities are easy to fake and hard to assess in a 30 minute conversation. People who are hired on these qualities, are usually tapped from a pre-existing network, not selected from the recruiter funnel. If you&#x27;ve only got a half hour to choose a candidate, then pretty much your only reliable option is test their intelligence.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psycnet.apa.org&#x2F;doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.86.1.162" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psycnet.apa.org&#x2F;doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.8...</a><p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Project_100,000" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Project_100,000</a>')
