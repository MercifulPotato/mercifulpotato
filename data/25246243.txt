In theory, maybe I could outperform my Julia program in C with careful thought about cache strategies and so forth, the same way I could outperform my C code with hand tuned assembly. In practice, the ability to prepend a &#x27;for&#x27; loop with &#x27;Threads.@threads&#x27; and suddenly the loop runs in parallel - or the ability to declare an array as type &#x27;cuArray&#x27; and suddenly all operations on it run on the GPU - means that it&#x27;s vastly easier for me to write fast Julia code than fast C code.')
