AFAIK mmap-ed pages are part of RSS and it&#x27;s quite usual for them to use up everything up to the memory limit (databases kind of rely on this &#x27;feature&#x27;). None of that would provoke an OOMKill.<p>for the second comment - I&#x27;ve used images the author has published on Docker hub. Maybe there would&#x27;ve been a way to make it work, but if you take a look at the amount of code in missing-container-metrics, you will realise that I&#x27;ve used less time to write that than I would&#x27;ve spent debugging someone else&#x27;s Docker build and golang code that is not really maintained.')
