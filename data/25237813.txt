Not only the Statue but other riverside details like the vent systems for the tunnels and the Hoboken train station are copper covered and thus verdigris colored. In the general mishmash of buildings and activity I unconsciously navigate to the green accents on the river.<p>Another green is in the serpentinite(sp?) rock which dominates the Palisades which runs on the Jersey side south of the George Washington Bridge and then eventually crosses the New York border heading north. The rude, jagged eruptions of rock provide just about the only places for wild growth of trees and other vegetation in the most densely populated corridor of the US - the soccer and baseball fields in front of my apartment have long given over to an artificial turf. But the green on the NYC waterfront is like a vein of ore in otherwise gray world.')
