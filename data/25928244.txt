However, if it is a public corporation, it is no longer an individual entity, a citizen entitled to control over whom you serve.<p>Once your company is public and traded on markets within the United States, it is now available to any individual to become a partial owner. To claim that you represent an individual opinion about whom you want to serve is only figurative. These companies are owned by thousands maybe even millions of people with all types of beliefs.<p>What I am seeing right now with big tech are the voices of a dominant billionaire leader and noisy, radical employees steering decisions about who should be served by the company. This minority of people in a public corporation should not have this kind of power. Their decisions should be driven entirely by the legal system and what is legally allowed and who can be legally served.')
