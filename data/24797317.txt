Not wanting to work from home however usually really means &quot;I don&#x27;t want <i>others</i> to be able to work from home&quot;, it&#x27;s about taking options away from other people. The exception being people who don&#x27;t want to work from home because they have a pack of screaming children at home, etc - in their case saying they don&#x27;t want to work from home is actually honest.<p>Your comment is a good example. For your perceived issues to be resolved, we need to make <i>other people</i> work at the office. The idea that others shouldn&#x27;t have the option to work from home because them being at the office helps someone else build their network is not something I can agree with.')
