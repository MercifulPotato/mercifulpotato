Everywhere I look I see criticisms of these 2 companies together being poor stewards of user data but almost all the articles focus on Facebook&#x27;s track record.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Google is completely clean in this regard but it has never had breaches of data or trust that even compares to Facebook&#x27;s.  In this article for example, they can point to Cambridge Analytica for Facebook (which was bad IMO) and can point to Google Photos charging for high quality photos (uh... what?)<p>Even when it comes to government surveillance, Google was the first to release the transparency reports and from my understanding, even when requested to keep requests from data for law enforcement they&#x27;ll often push back and notify the owners of the accounts when their data was requested and delivered to their government (according to a few lawyers I&#x27;ve spoken to which have had experience with Google provided data).')
