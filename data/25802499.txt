I agree with Kristian here that with your set of languages it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to get into, personally I found &quot;You (still) don&#x27;t know JS&quot; a great introduction, even if you read just the first few volumes and if typed JS is your thing the TS docs should get you going. I you&#x27;re keen to stay server-side, NestJS could be interesting, its picking up a lot of steam, otherwise the ReactJS docs are as good as anything to get going in the front-end.<p>Honestly just play around and try not to let the size of the landscape get to you. Unlike some JS devs seem to believe, you don&#x27;t need to know everything about everything to get going.')
