Others, who maybe don&#x27;t have great job mobility, stick around, but feel miserable, because their job makes them do unethical things.  Not a great outcome.<p>Is free speech for all more important than refusing to sell to people you believe are doing something unethical with your product?<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know the answer to that question.  My gut reaction is to celebrate Parler effectively getting kicked off the internet, but I do worry that the long-term consequences of doing things like this will haunt us as a society.')
