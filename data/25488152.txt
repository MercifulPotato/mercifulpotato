Since the cable is a shared resource, any misbehaving modem can prevent all others being able to connect.<p>Perhaps just 1% vulnerable modems across the USA, and most people&#x27;s home internet would be offline for weeks until whoever in every single neighborhood has an infected modem is identified and unplugged.<p>Considering that, I can completely see why they wouldn&#x27;t want you using a cheapo modem you got from Walmart.')
