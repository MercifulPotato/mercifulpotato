Iran supported Assad from the beginning, without it he wouldn&#x27;t have survived to 2015.

The US&#x27;s decision to not get involved against Assad (they&#x27;re there for ISIS I remind you) had a far worse result in human lives and geopolitical impact than any of the US&#x27;s &#x27;meddling&#x27;.')
