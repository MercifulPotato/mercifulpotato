Do you apply that rule to the other areas of your life?<p>Maybe a different example - until very recently, if you bought a BMW, you could only get Apple CarPlay as a subscription, you couldn&#x27;t just pay upfront to have it. Which is not how this works literally anywhere else, every other brand has it as a one-time unlock and then you have it for life.<p>Surely, every person buying a brand new BMW knew this, it&#x27;s clearly advertised. So....should they not have complained about this? After all, they knew what they were buying. But, people have been complaining, and BMW has finally changed it recently. Good riddance I say.<p>But back to the iphone dillema. The problem with your argument is that this is traditionally not how markets work. If company X wants to sell something to John Smith(let&#x27;s say an app for their iphone), but cannot without going through some kind of licence holder(Apple in this case) - it&#x27;s totally a valid question to ask if Apple is stifling competition here or not. In my opinion - they are. Maybe the company X is making a completely legitimate web browser, that John Smith wants to buy and pay money for - but Apple will say nope, you can&#x27;t buy that, because that would compete with our own product. That&#x27;s anticompetitive behaviour, and traditionally it does eventually get stopped in court. Like I said in my example several posts ago - volkswagen cannot do anything to stop the company X from selling brake pads to John Smith, yes they fit a car that Volkswagen made but Volkswagen doesn&#x27;t get to say whether John Smith is allowed to purchase and fit those parts or not. Courts all over the world have decided, many times, that corporations shouldn&#x27;t have that power. Why do smartphone manufacturers get to keep that power now then? That will change in my opinion, and they will be forced to open up.')
