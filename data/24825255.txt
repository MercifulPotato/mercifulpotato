IKEA uses a lot more solid wood these days than compressed particle board, and is thus not bad.<p>The only issue I&#x27;ve seen (which IKEA has attempted to remedy in its more recent iterations) is that the bottoms of some of the drawers in a chest of drawers will &quot;bow&quot; down under load.<p>I&#x27;ve had mass-produced furniture from major brands known for quality, I&#x27;ve had hand-made wood furniture from NC, I&#x27;ve had big-box store self-assembled furniture and I&#x27;ve had IKEA furniture.
