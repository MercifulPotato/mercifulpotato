Only one question allowed using shift+enter to insert new lines, but all of the long form questions would have benefited from this. For most of the questions, I ended up writing one extremely long line, using hyphens to try and separate things.<p>If possible, I&#x27;d explore finding a form system that allows using textareas.')
