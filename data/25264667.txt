This cannot be done without math.”<p>I’ve long had this (mistaken?) belief that formal methods and mathermatics do not primarily apply to the areas of computing I’m involved with.<p>I am involved with business systems that are primarily concerned with the recording of activities. Those activities relate to thing&#x2F;s, and often involve people and places acting in some role (context). In some ways I am modeling interactions between phenomena, together with the concepts through which they are abstracted. Consider for example a payroll system or a airline reservation system.<p>How can formal methods and mathematics help in this?')
