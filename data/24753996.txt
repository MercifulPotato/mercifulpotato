Only 2% of Federal criminal cases actually go to trial[0], and 97% end with the defendant pleading to a lesser charge.<p>Overall, something like 90-95% of <i>all</i> criminal cases in the US end with a plea bargain[1]<p>Usually, the prosecutor uses the threat of jail or prison (for more minor offenses) or the threat of lengthy (15 years?  Life?) for more serious ones to force a defendant to plead guilty to a lesser charge.  And this is true even if the defendant is innocent of the crime charged.<p>And when someone is poor and can&#x27;t afford bail, prosecutors can exert even more pressure to force a plea bargain[2], as the defendant (whether or not they actually committed a crime) will sit in jail either until they agree to plead guilty to <i>something</i> or go to trial.<p>How long would you keep your job if you were sitting in jail?  How long before you couldn&#x27;t pay your rent&#x2F;mortgage without income from that job?  Or even worse, if you&#x27;re a single parent, how long could you retain custody of your children?<p>And it just gets worse.  Should you plead guilty, you now have a criminal record and most employers won&#x27;t hire you.<p>And remember, these are people who haven&#x27;t been convicted of a crime, and no court or jury has heard their case.  Yet many people&#x27;s lives are ruined just because they&#x27;re poor and can&#x27;t afford to pay bail.<p>Edit: Fixed percentage of overall cases which end with a plea bargain.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;11&#x2F;only-2-of-federal-criminal-defendants-go-to-trial-and-most-who-do-are-found-guilty&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;11&#x2F;only-2-of-f...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bja.ojp.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;g&#x2F;files&#x2F;xyckuh186&#x2F;files&#x2F;media&#x2F;document&#x2F;PleaBargainingResearchSummary.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bja.ojp.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;g&#x2F;files&#x2F;xyckuh186&#x2F;files&#x2F;media&#x2F;docu...</a> [PDF]<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bja.ojp.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;g&#x2F;files&#x2F;xyckuh186&#x2F;files&#x2F;media&#x2F;document&#x2F;PleaBargainingResearchSummary.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bja.ojp.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;g&#x2F;files&#x2F;xyckuh186&#x2F;files&#x2F;media&#x2F;docu...</a>')
