It&#x27;s not just a problem of designing and executing (which are real large problems), but also a problem of forming a large base of devoted fans, and a reality-distorting fieldâ„¢ to keep them devoted.<p>The latter cannot be done with smoke and mirrors, only with solid design and engineering, plus the right elitist-but-accessible marketing. This is easier when you are Ferrari or Tissot, but Apple managed to be almost price-competitive, and sell massive amounts.')
