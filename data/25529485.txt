Sure it could feel at times that it was simply about walking to point A&#x2F;B, but with that came the challenges and points being made throughout the game. That alone challenges can be overcome, but there will be more obstacles, and the weight of burden (literally and metaphorically in the game) will crush one&#x27;s morale, motivation, and ability. Together, with the right motives, we can accomplish more to benefit everyone. But the ones who only build or help for self gain&#x2F;their reward system, will ultimately be corrupted and left empty by their own doing, as their structures will whither unless they exhaustively maintain them to gain pointless intangible&#x2F;abstract rewards&#x2F;social scores.<p>The satisfaction that comes with collaboration and helping one another is where one finds true satisfaction with this game.<p>It&#x27;s also just a lot of fun, challenging, and beautiful in general, aside from the story :p')
