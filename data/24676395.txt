In the old days, people write your own code and relied on a vendor provided standard lib, for example C++ stdlib, Java platform or Python&#x27;s batteries included. Since software is expensive, to save time and money people started to rely on 3rd party libraries, conveniently delivered by package repositories, for example CPAN, PyPI or npm.
