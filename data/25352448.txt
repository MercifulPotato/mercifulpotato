These are flea bites, not fatal blows, but it&#x27;s all that the US can muster for now from a &quot;policy&quot; perspective. And keep in mind, the US may not have a grand strategy here, but China certainly does.<p>Or, to condense it into a thought experiment, think about what it would take in some alternate future timeline (which may not be so far-fetched), that would make it more likely for Alibaba to one day acquire Amazon, then for Amazon to acquire Alibaba... We may already be headed to that future.')
