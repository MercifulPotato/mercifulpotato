I had a better computer and plenty of different places I could work in my house.<p>But now I have kids at home all day and working from home is hell.<p>It’s all about context.<p>And you are correct: A lot of people don’t have good setups to work from home. And then on the other end, some offices are amazing and some are terrible. People who want people to come into an office should really try to make a better experience. Forcing people to come into a crappy office is insane.')
