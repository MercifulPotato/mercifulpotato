The other biggest problem is that my need at one moment may be similar by slightly different to a situation&#x2F;question posed on StackOverflow, and so I&#x27;m left to guess if I can take the answers and work from those... or if I will end up in a worse or weird situation by following them.<p>It&#x27;s very difficult to even discuss situations in Git, because the smallest details can be a deciding factor in choosing what next step to take.  It reminds me of analog and digital electronics... sometimes you must be very precise and know exactly what you&#x27;re doing, and sometimes you can just approximate.  Knowing when to do one or the other takes lots of experience.')
