It&#x27;s nice that &quot;unemployment&quot; can be measured this way monthly without too much measurement controversy. Useful for charting trends with high resolution.<p>That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it is not an estimate of &quot;unemployment,&quot; defined in a way that we care about more. If you ignore the involuntarily retired 58 year old because measurement is subjective then you are undercounting by a lot. You&#x27;re not undercounting evenly, especially over time, geo or in extreme circumstances (like recession).<p>It&#x27;s an issue if the primary unemployment measure does not even estimate &quot;unemployment&quot; harmonious with a common sense definition')
