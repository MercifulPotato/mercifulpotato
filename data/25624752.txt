It is simply data you may chose to act on or not.<p>If this person was out for optimizing income, tye6 would not have studied a PhD in the first place, because that&#x27;s 6 years wasted, plus tuition on top of it.<p>You can your tracking to optimize for whatever variable you want to optimize. You could realize that you work too much and aim for working less. You could realize that you do social media too much and aim to do less of it, etc. It&#x27;s up to you.<p>As for not making money. The world is, sadly highly biased towards rich people. If you are poor and happy (which is totally possible) you are still highly at risk that this state won&#x27;t last. Without money, you are f<i></i>*ed in this world. It&#x27;s just the way it is. If you are dependent on income you are dependent on A LOT of things. The best you can generally do for your happiness is become income independent as fast as possible, which usually means to earn as much as possible as early as possible and then live from investments while focusing on everything that&#x27;s not work.')
