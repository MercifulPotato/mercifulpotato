It&#x27;s already over.<p>The premise of money laundering rules is that you have two conspiring parties transferring illicit gains between one another and the regulations have the bank as an intermediary informing on them to the government.<p>The existence of cryptocurrency makes it possible to do this without an intermediary party. It has already happened and you can&#x27;t put the genie back in the bottle. It doesn&#x27;t matter how you regulate above-board exchanges and transactions in the US because the illicit transaction can occur digitally outside of the sphere of influence of a given country without using any of the intermediaries being subjected to the regulations.<p>What it means is that all the costs of AML and KYC regulations are no longer buying you anything because actual criminals now have an end-run around them, but they&#x27;re still costing you something, as the law abiding people trying to comply with the rules, for as long as they remain on the books.')
