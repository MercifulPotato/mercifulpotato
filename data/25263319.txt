If companies just created a sales team from their highest performing customer support reps and didn’t give them quotas or bonuses I think the model would still work as well from a revenue perspective, drastically reduce costs, and also lead to less irritated customers as no one i know looks forward to any sales call, ever.<p>Ok, broad generalization but you get the idea.')
