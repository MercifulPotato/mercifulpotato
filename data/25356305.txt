It seem correct. Are there alternative explanations other than mental processing speed and so on? (For example, later in life, you&#x27;re less likely to be in a position to do the same sort of work. But that seems to have been tested by e.g. the institute of advanced study.)<p>As far as I can tell, this section might be one of those facts that people try not to think about too much. I don&#x27;t worry about it, but I end up thinking about it a lot.<p>There was recently some headline news about an older mathematician that made a significant breakthrough. Other than that one outlier, have there been many important contributions made by people after the age of, say, 45?<p>--<p>&quot;I had better say something here about this question of age, since it is particularly important for mathematicians. No mathematician should ever allow himself to forget that mathematics, more than any other art or science, is a young man&#x27;s game. To take a simple illustration at a comparatively humble level, the average age of election to the Royal Society is lowest in mathematics.<p>We can naturally find much more striking illustrations. We may consider, for example, the career of a man who was certainly one of the world&#x27;s three greatest mathematicians. Newton gave up mathematics at fifty, and had lost his enthusiasm long before; he had recognized no doubt by the time that he was forty that his great creative days were over. His greatest ideas of all, fluxions and the law of gravitation, came to him about 1666, when he was twenty-four—&#x27;in those days I was in the prime of my age for invention, and minded mathematics and philosophy more than at any time since&#x27;. He made big discoveries until he was nearly forty (the &#x27;elliptic orbit&#x27; at thirty-seven), but after that he did little but polish and perfect.<p>Galois died at twenty-one, Abel at twenty-seven, Ramanujan at thirty-three, Riemann at forty. There have been men who have done great work a good deal later; Gauss&#x27;s great memoir on differential geometry was published when he was fifty (though he had had the fundamental ideas ten years before). I do not know an instance of a major mathematical advance initiated by a man past fifty. If a man of mature age loses interest in and abandons mathematics, the loss is not likely to be very serious either for mathematics or for himself.<p>On the other hand the gain is no more likely to be substantial; the later records of mathematicians who have left mathematics are not particularly encouraging. Newton made a quite competent Master of the Mint (when he was not quarrelling with anybody). Painlevé was a not very successful Premier of France. Laplace&#x27;s political career was highly discreditable, but he is hardly a fair instance, since he was dishonest rather than incompetent, and never really &#x27;gave up&#x27; mathematics. It is very hard to find an instance of a first-rate mathematician who has abandoned mathematics and attained first-rate distinction in any other field.1 There may have been young men who would have been first-rate mathematicians if they had stuck to mathematics, but I have never heard of a really plausible example. And all this is fully borne out by my own very limited experience. Every young mathematician of real talent whom I have known has been faithful to mathematics, and not from lack of ambition but from abundance of it; they have all recognized that there, if anywhere, lay the road to a life of any distinction.<p>1 Pascal seems the best.&quot;')
