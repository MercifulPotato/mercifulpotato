Replacing property tax with land value tax would push the profit calculation 100% in favor of lots of smaller units because you would only pay a fixed tax for the land. If the LVT is $360k&#x2F;y the landlord would pay $1k tax per month in the small apartments. In the larger apartments he would pay $2k. The tax is a pure loss for the landlord so he wants to pay as little as possible by building more units.')
