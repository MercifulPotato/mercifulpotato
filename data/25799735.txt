The big problem is that there can only be one union per workplace in US if at all, so workers have to vote etc. You can&#x27;t just pick the union fitting yourself best and keep the union as you move between companies, instead USA ties your union to your job like it does everything else. Why tie healthcare, union and a lot of other unrelated things to your job? Doesn&#x27;t make sense, and as we see unions in USA where they have this nonsense rule are much less popular than unions in Europe where you mostly stick to the same union your entire career.')
