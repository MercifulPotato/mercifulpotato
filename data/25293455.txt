Item(by='contemporary343', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607023956, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25293193, text='Agreed: Even if one is cynical (as I am) about the reason these companies hire AI policy and ethics researchers (for PR and to deflect criticisms on how their products operate, far too often) - it is clear that many potential consumers and regulators (!) that are inclined to be skeptical or critical will think more positively of the company.<p>Also, let&#x27;s be real. How much revenue are the vast majority of AI&#x2F;ML researchers <i>actually</i> driving in these companies? Sure, someone gets promoted for multiple NeurIPS papers, and it looks great for the company. But most of the time, it doesn&#x27;t directly impact products and revenue -- in the short-term -- and that&#x27;s ok. Same deal for AI ethics and policy researchers.')
