So Jeremey has to file an appeal or the decision will stand? So the onus to fix this is on Jeremy who seems so exhausted by this whole process that he&#x27;s quit conference talks?<p>That seems a response that lacks any sense of empathy to Jeremy.<p>edit: Okay. On Twitter they said that no judgement was made even now. However their enforcement policy (which the apology explicitly references) only mentions appeal if an action was already decided upon &quot;Give them a place to appeal to if there is one, but in the meantime the action stands.&quot; Given that not adhering to their own process and written documents was a chief complaint it seems they haven&#x27;t learned much yet from the incident.')
