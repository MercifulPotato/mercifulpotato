This stuff is reported in Asian outlets <i>all the time</i>, but the American mainstream media will tell you sweet stories of Asian business owners &#x27;supporting&#x27; BLM riots. You have to remember that these people, including my parents, have come from countries where it is normal to publicly say whatever you need to to appease the majority group. My mom and dad, like most Asians, will say whatever needs to be said to keep their family safe, even if they disagree. Americans do not understand Asian culture at all.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globaltimes.cn&#x2F;content&#x2F;1190650.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globaltimes.cn&#x2F;content&#x2F;1190650.shtml</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;30&#x2F;403231749&#x2F;baltimore-unrest-reveals-tensions-between-african-americans-and-asian-owned-busi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;30&#x2F;403231749&#x2F;baltimore-unrest-re...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texasmonthly.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;black-lives-matter-billboard-houston-vietnamese-american-community&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texasmonthly.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;black-lives-matter-billboa...</a>')
