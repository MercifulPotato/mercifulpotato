Item(by='btilly', descendants=None, kids=[24947762], score=None, time=1604092651, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946837, text='And my judgement after all available information is that they are straight up lying.<p>Here is why.<p>His stated recollection is that they said, “that is what the reporters stated, and what we found” and to his asking why his statement was not requested, “we all watched the video, so we could see for ourselves the violation”.<p>What they said in his version is very clear.  That is not a miscommunication.  Calling it a &quot;miscommunication&quot; sounds like nothing more than the best excuse that they came up with for themselves.<p>Therefore this reduces down to a simple &quot;he said, she said&quot; type of conflict.  What I have to judge on is what is publicly known of his character, their incentives, and indications about their character.  He has a solid public reputation as an upstanding person.  Their incentives are to minimize perception of wrongdoing in their actions.  Both the fact that they got into this mess, and their non-apology in attempting to get out of it, suggests that they lack even a shred of integrity.<p>Therefore it is his word against theirs.  He is believable.  They are not.  And so I conclude that they are lying on this point.')
