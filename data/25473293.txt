People don’t statistically assess risks the way actuaries do, even the most rational people don’t think like that. There’s already a significant percent of the population that believe any number of irrational things about vaccinations. Around a third of Americans aren’t planning to get the vaccine. If there are a significant number of adverse reactions convincing people to behave rationally will become even more difficult. When assessing the risk we can’t just look at the direct effects we also need to consider the effects on how the population at large will behave.')
