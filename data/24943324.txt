I&#x27;ve used sqlite, but being able to query the data is not the same as being able to browse that data.<p>For instance, consider a project that I&#x27;m currently working on. Google Docs sheet exported to CSV. The file documents dozens of servers used as load balancers, websites, and database servers. The files has gone from MS Excel to Google Docs, and been maintained by four admins over 12 years. There are no columns per se, rather &quot;sections of rows&quot;, each of which isn&#x27;t even consistent in itself. One section is double columned, with the top row listing public IP address, login name, etc and the second row listing LAN IP address, login password, etc.<p>sqlite is useless on these files and frankly I&#x27;ve seen these things more often than well-formatted spreadsheets at every company I&#x27;ve ever worked with. Nobody but software developers treat spreadsheet columns as database fields.')
