God, that was the worst office space I&#x27;ve ever been in -- the floors moved a ton when you moved your chair, echoed when you walked around, the temperatures were absolutely all over the place depending on how close you were to a heater&#x2F;cooling vent, and worst of all... malls don&#x27;t really have windows.<p>Working in a converted mall might as well be working in a prison, for all I can tell. The walkway through the middle was kind of nice (and the food court still functioned as a cafeteria, so you could walk fully indoors during cold winter&#x2F;hot summer days to get a coffee or lunch)... but I think I&#x27;d still rather be able to see the outdoors from my desk.')
