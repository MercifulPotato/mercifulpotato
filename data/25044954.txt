Do you maintain something yourself? Do you have some projects on your mind which could adopt such approach?<p>I am currently just beginning my research of the current state of things in Linux distributions with regard to the distribution (pun not intended) of bugticket time to resolution. I am doing this to get a fine grasp of actual state, and be able to articulate the additional value of such userbase-funded commitments.<p>I aspire to tracking my commitments up to full deployment in SDLC terms, but it seems this information is too hard to consistently get with the existing bugticket handling practices of Linux distros, so now I am going to start with measuring how much time it takes to mark the ticket &quot;closed&quot; or &quot;resolved&quot;, whatever that means (seems to mean mostly &quot;integration completed&quot; in SDLC terms).<p>I sketch some of my thoughts here, but the notes are somewhat outdated: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;userbase-funded&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;wiki" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;userbase-funded&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;wiki</a><p>I have also contacted the current maintainer of one valuable but neglected project, but got no response so far. That project is vdirsyncer, it has been not actively maintained for a year and a bit until recently, but has many consumers, and I think such projects are a good fit for my idea. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pimutils&#x2F;vdirsyncer&#x2F;issues&#x2F;790" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pimutils&#x2F;vdirsyncer&#x2F;issues&#x2F;790</a>')
