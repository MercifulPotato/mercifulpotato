Yes, the feature here is &quot;power efficient, high quality mobile video streaming&quot;, but consider that content <i>producers</i> have to encode, store, and serve multiple different formats (plus more licensing fees for the encoders) in order to serve all <i>their</i> users.  That&#x27;s incredibly wasteful and causes people all sorts of headaches on the backend.  Both Apple&#x27;s stuff and WebM do indeed satisfy the user-facing feature requirements, but Apple could have just used WebM and saved content producers a lot of time and money (which often -- but admittedly not always -- translates into saving end-customers money as well).<p>There&#x27;s of course a balance to be maintained; if we single-source our streaming video codecs, that will dampen innovation in that space.  But I&#x27;d hope there&#x27;s a less wasteful middle ground than the place we&#x27;re at now.')
