The rule is 6 feet, and I add the extra few feet to remove ambiguity.  When I go to certain trails in the Boulder, CO area, there are many &quot;mask nazis&quot; who clearly are extremely paranoid, and on a power trip.  They will absolutely not hesitate to scold and holler despite me walking off the trail and not going anywhere near them.  Your assumption that everyone is rational and people getting scolded is a sign of their guilt is just wrong.<p>For anyone that lives in the area, the worst are the Nederland residents.  Territorial assholes when there isn&#x27;t a pandemic, and now they feel empowered to really let you have it.  Going 10 miles south to trails in Jefferson County, and as long as you stay 6 feet or more, people smile and tell you to have a nice hike.')
