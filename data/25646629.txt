And because Tesla runs on the stock market quarterly cycle.   The cars manufactured in the first month of the quarter are mostly delivered to Europe for delivery in the last month of the quarter.   The cars manufactured in the second month get delivered to Eastern North America and the third month cars get delivered to California and close states.   That way most cars are delivered in the same quarter they are manufactured in.   So over 4000 cars were delivered in Norway in December, but only 200 in october.<p>The COVID-19 shutdown disrupted that cycle, so December was really the only month this year that Tesla delivered a significant number of cars to Norway.')
