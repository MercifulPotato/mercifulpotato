Discipline is only one of many tools at my disposal.<p>One of the most important things about being a software engineer, in my mind, is the ability to be flexible (I won&#x27;t say &quot;agile,&quot; as that word seems to be pretty much worthless, these days).<p>One of the <i>disciplines</i> that I&#x27;ve developed, over the years, is writing flexible code; Code that has a future.<p>One of my favorite text editors is BBEdit[0]. I&#x27;ve been using it since the 1990s. During that time, I&#x27;ve tried others that have been raved about, like Sublime, TextMate and VSCode. I&#x27;ve liked them, but always ended up going back to BBEdit, which has been doing a great job of adapting to the new operating systems and workstyles.<p>The fact that the app is nearly thirty years old, and started off with a bus factor of 1, says that the original author applied discipline and a &quot;future-facing&quot; design ethos, back in 1992. I can respect that.<p>I also use Adobe Photoshop, which I first met before Adobe brought it, in the late 1980s. That seems to have grown well.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.barebones.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;bbedit&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.barebones.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;bbedit&#x2F;</a>')
