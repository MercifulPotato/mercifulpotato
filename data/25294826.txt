Also going to a theater is a purpose driven choice in a way watching a movie at home is not. It allows you to focus all your attention on a movie that simply can&#x27;t easily be replicated at home.<p>I can easily focus all my attention on a movie at home, precisely because I also can&#x27;t easily replicate the experience of crying children, iPhone flashes going off, inconsiderate moviegoers talking and commenting loudly, etc etc. The perfect theater experience is great, but unless you can afford paying to go to a premium theater (where in my experience, issues are less frequent) or at some odd time of day, it&#x27;s often a gamble whether you&#x27;ll get fantasy movie experience, or the real-world movie experience. At home, every aspect of the experience is under my control, so I&#x27;ll never have to worry about the issues I encounter in the theaters, with most of the enjoyment. Despite being a huge fan of moviegoing, there are few experiences I couldn&#x27;t have enjoyed as much at home. Those ideal experiences can be hard to come by')
