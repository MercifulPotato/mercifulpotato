Do I trust this administration? The current law enforcement? Forever? What could they do to me or my family if we suddenly become persona non grata?<p>To be honest even under this system people can reason that this is just giving the police etc powers, so even then their &quot;privacy&quot; isn&#x27;t really at risk.<p>They aren&#x27;t necessarily thinking that:<p>- data can be leaked<p>- data could be sold<p>- you can get malicious officers<p>- the data can be used for other purposes<p>- etc<p>These are the other parts of the conversation that need to also be thought about because otherwise this is just another security blanket.')
