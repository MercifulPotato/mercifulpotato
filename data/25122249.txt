Most of the complexity is due to the bad design of the system and rent seeking attitude of various government departments involved. Prof. Bibek Debroy was appointed to study Railways and has produced excellent analysis of the malice in Railways.<p>The real problem with Railways bookings has nothing to do with total tickets sale. The problem is when thousands of people are trying to book a specific ticket. A sleeper class with 10 coaches will have 720 seats and around 2000-5000 people will try to book them at the same time. Each train booking is independent and hence can be parallelized. Where IRCTC can book 1.3 million tickets or not is irrelevant, what is more important is whether they can efficiently solve this simple problem of 720 seats.<p>The alphabet soup of PRS, RTR etc. is a waste. A kid wrote an app that vastly improved user experience of the system tells you just how bad the entire user experience is.<p>Mismanagement of IRCTC can be attributed to the Railways mafia who benefits from such inefficiencies.<p>Technical note: The 720 seats for 5000 people might sound simple but in reality is a little bit more complex as passengers also put preference for preferred berth, there is a special affirmative action for disabled, seniors etc., family members want to travel together, there are some seats reserved for politicians, and some for &quot;agents&quot;. Some will be booked via railway terminals only. Those who do not win this 720 lottery will get into a waiting list and can still travel but will have to stand.')
