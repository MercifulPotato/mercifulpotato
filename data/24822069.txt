That or this post has generated so much interest the world is hitting their server hard.<p>All seriousness aside, I am a LaTeX user, so I get it.  But to me one drawback of LaTeX is that it isn&#x27;t hierarchically structured in the same way that, say DocBook XML, is.  That is, you can&#x27;t automatically pull out a 3rd level section (all the text under a subsubsection) like you can using XML and an XSLT.  Nor can you label such a subsubsection with a &quot;role&quot; (DocBook XML term) and either include it or not include it in your PDF, depending on a parameter that you provide on a command line.  (We did that to produce technical and non-technical versions of PDFs.)  Rather, I think you have to give what amounts to begin{} and end{} commands.<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong!<p>BTW, another wysiwym editor is XMLmind--for XML (mostly DocBook), obviously.  I think oXygen also does that, although I&#x27;ve only used XMLmind.')
