I am figuring this out as I type:<p>1. There is a fixed exchange rate for every currency. \n2. Trade is conducted with this fixed exchange rate.\n3. There is also a floating rate for the currency which means that it is strong or weak depending on GDP, economy etc.<p>4. OTOH, there are local economies. For cities inside the USA. Why should trade of soy and hogs with China affect the rent paid by a retiree in small town America?<p>5. Many pension funds invest in companies listed on Wall Street, but when dispersed, it is used for exchange of goods for money in high streets and local economies.<p>6. Can not a local economy be separate from traded currency? This would create a barter like economy.<p>7. Padding an economy from future shocks is easier if local economy is divorced from trade economy.<p>Thoughts?')
