I was wondering you might be proposing this. You should not be using &quot;new&quot; keyword anywhere in your code&quot;<p>That sounds like dogmatism, and I&#x27;m going to take a special note of the emotionally charged language you&#x27;re using here; it&#x27;s symptom of some of the underlying issues I see in our industry (more to be said on this).<p>That said, I do agree with the sentiment in general, but you <i>can</i> (and sometimes should) use the `new` keyword in your code, especially when writing tests. In some cases, it makes testing so much easier and helps with the maintainability.<p>&quot;I hope you&#x27;ll not reply-with saying &quot;don&#x27;t write unit tests&quot;<p>After 2 decades in this profession, the only think I&#x27;m sure of is there is no &quot;silver bullet&quot;. Of course, as a general rule, it&#x27;s a good idea to have a test coverage of your codebase but sometimes it&#x27;s not valuable and not worth adding it. So it&#x27;s a &quot;it depends&quot; from me!')
