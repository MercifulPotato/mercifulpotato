MySQL retaining backwards compatibility is sensible, though seems a bit awkward that they don&#x27;t introduce a TIME_LONG type or similar that can hold more useful ranges. .NET just mapping a time span with a wider range down to MySQL&#x27;s fairly limited range seems destined to cause problems.')
