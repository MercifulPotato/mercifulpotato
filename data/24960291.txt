Like I said, we build views and API requests. That&#x27;s just the same MVC framework for the past decade or so. And I&#x27;ve done the same for streaming services albeit not at the scale of Netflix. Given how apps like Netflix and YouTube are so nicely synced between mobile, web and STBs I&#x27;d still imagine all the logic and persistence is server-side. I can only speak from my experience though, I&#x27;d love to understand how you&#x27;ve done it and when you need to embed a lot of non-UI code in a client.')
