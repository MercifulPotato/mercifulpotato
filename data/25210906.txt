So, for the record, I am thoroughly in the target market for this sort of thing, and even I enjoy a little frisson of delight at imagining unpacking this monstrosity in a student lab or at a client site.  That said, I do also believe that it has little productive purpose---it is difficult to imagine a technical use case that couldn&#x27;t be better and more easily served by carrying a largish spare monitor (perhaps in a blatantly ruggedized case replete with DefCon stickers to maintain the tone.)<p>However, I do not believe it is completely <i>useless</i>.  I just think that the uses are primarily in the categories I propose above: conspicuous consumption, in-group signalling, or pure nihilism. And which of us has never made an extravagant purchase in support of those? Certainly not I.')
