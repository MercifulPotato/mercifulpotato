It&#x27;s in our culture. We&#x27;ve accomplished so much in spite of internal disagreement and oppression: voting rights, women&#x27;s rights, gay marriage (which still isn&#x27;t enshrined in the constitution -- work to be done!)<p>Imagine if we froze back in the 50&#x27;s because we didn&#x27;t have free speech. Pick any point in the timeline and freeze the American experiment. It will lead to a worse outcome.<p>I can tolerate some idiots with racist hate flags, \nWestboro funeral protests, etc. Because the freedom we enjoy is worth so much more than their minor nuisance.<p>edit: Yep, predictably downvoted. Go move to another country that isn&#x27;t America so you don&#x27;t have to listen to people you disagree with.')
