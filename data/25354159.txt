People put on their rose tinted glasses when thinking about products they own and ignore the issues.<p>I have completely had it with Samsung consumer level devices. Every single one I have had has come with bloatware, discontinued support after a short time and seems to slow down real bad after a few years.<p>The last samsung product I own is a TV which was perfectly fine on day one but now its so slow I find it hard to change channel or volume and turning it on shows a shitload of HUD bloatware about random streaming services.<p>And when you point out any of these issues people go &quot;Oh its not a problem you just open the registery editor&quot; or &quot;you pop the back of your tv open and unplug the antenna and then flash this file on to the spi chip&quot;')
