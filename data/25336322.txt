Item(by='oh_sigh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607370461, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25336279, text='That&#x27;s only the conditional part of the ultimatum, not the threat. (the &quot;X&quot; in &quot;Do X, or I&#x27;ll do Y&quot;).<p>The exact phrasing she used is (probably - IANA employment lawyer) very important. If she said something like &quot;Do X, or I&#x27;ll have to reconsider if I want to  continue working here&quot;, that doesn&#x27;t sound like an ultimatum. But if she said &quot;Do X, or I&#x27;m going to quit on December 5th&quot;, then that definitely sounds like an ultimatum you&#x27;re begging the company to take you up on.')
