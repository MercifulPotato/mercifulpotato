Under a slogan of &quot;Don&#x27;t Vote McAfee&quot;, and with neither himself nor many of his campaign staff physically located in the country. (Indeed, it&#x27;s likely that he would have been arrested upon entry, under the same charges that just got him arrested in Spain.) One gets the sense that he didn&#x27;t take his &quot;campaign&quot; particularly seriously.')
