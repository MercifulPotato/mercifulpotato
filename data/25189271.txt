If they don&#x27;t like your content, the majority of your intended audience will never see it.  This isn&#x27;t including search traffic.  They regularly censor news organizations without telling them.<p>Recently, Mailchimp announced that they will block any content they deem unacceptable.  They get to decide what your recipients will see.<p>Payment providers like Paypal and sites like Kickstarter also regularly ban people they deem &#x27;unacceptable&#x27;.<p>The phone company isn&#x27;t allowed to block you because you said something politically incorrect to my friends and tech companies should be no different.<p>The tech community isn&#x27;t protesting this right now because their perceived enemies are being blocked and censored en masse.<p>Don&#x27;t be shocked one day when you are censored and blocked and people like me just don&#x27;t give a shit anymore')
