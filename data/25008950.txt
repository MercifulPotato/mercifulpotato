Encourage others to do the same!<p>One thing I&#x27;m doing that&#x27;s actually having a significant impact is helping out build local mountain biking and hiking trails. This has downstream effects as it gives kids something to do that&#x27;s healthy and positive.<p>I have other friends that volunteer in churches and various ministries playing music which also has downstream effects.<p>Remember the line for the homeless shelter is very long out front, but the door on the backside of the building where volunteers enter never has a line.')
