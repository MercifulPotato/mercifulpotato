What I want is boring. If I want it it means I already basically know what it is. I want to be like &quot;what the fuck is this...? but its awesome!&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll give you a recent anecdotal example. I stumbled (via recommendation) onto a show called Hellier. I don&#x27;t know about you, but hipsters trying to use a transcranial magnetic stimulation rig to talk to aliens (season 2) is not something I would have thought I wanted or brought up in a focus group. But it was awesome (provided you suspend disbelief a bit).<p>Something like that show, which I don&#x27;t even know how to categorize, would never be greenlit in traditional publishing or production. It&#x27;s pure indie. I&#x27;d kind of compare it to the film Primer in terms of cost vs. quality of result.<p>Problem is indies of that quality require a rare combination of talent, LOTS of time, situation, and enough capital to actually pull it off. Very few people can do it, so those are few and far between.<p>Go back in time before the bean counters took over and you&#x27;ll see big budget films of that level of uniqueness and quality, like most of the films of Kubrick and David Lynch. Those would never be made today, and those types of director-auteurs would never make it today.')
