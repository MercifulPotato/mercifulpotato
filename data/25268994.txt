Primary insomnia is a known symptom of depressive episodes. Uncommon to be sure, but not unknown.<p>And to prove it really is primary insomnia, let me walk you through the three different kinds of insomnia I deal with.<p>1. Anxiety-related insomnia. Rare. My brain is stuck in a feedback loop.<p>2. Manic insomnia. Occasionally. My brain running overclocked and I don&#x27;t feel tired. Imagine trying to sleep while doing lines of cocaine.<p>3.
