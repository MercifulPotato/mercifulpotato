Compare this to any article about Google, where anything they do is interpreted in the worst possible way for Google.<p>AMP was my favourite example.  You could interpret AMP as Google ensuring a better experience for users, or as Google highjacking the web into a closed ecosystem to squeeze out competitors.  HN threads about AMP almost always concluded that it was a terrible overreach by Google, anti-competitive, and bad for everyone.  But an article suggesting that Apple maybe put the FBI ahead of users in this instance?  Dismissed because OP is &quot;inclined to believe.&quot;')
