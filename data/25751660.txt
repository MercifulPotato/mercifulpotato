Item(by='nimih', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610477990, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25748013, text='&gt;For people that mention software like Ledger, Excel and Google Sheets to do their accounting, what do you do to make sure you don&#x27;t accidentally delete&#x2F;duplicate&#x2F;edit a transaction and how do you import the latest transactions in an automated way?<p>My general workflow is:<p>1. Pull tx data from bank websites, mostly via some hacky web browser automation scripts which log in and download the appropriate QFX&#x2F;CSV.<p>2. Run `bean-extract [args] &amp;&amp; bean-file [args]`, which processes the tx logs into a beancount file of newly seen transactions, and then move+renames the original files into an archive.<p>3. Copy entries from the generated beancount file to my permanent ledger via my favorite text editor. The processing rules I have (which get run during bean-extract) are comprehensive enough that this is mostly just copy-pasting large swaths of text to the appropriate section (e.g. &quot;Balance Transfers&quot;, &quot;Employment Salary &amp; Benefits&quot;, &quot;Everyday Expenses&quot;), but I&#x27;ll usually have a couple odd expenses which don&#x27;t get automatically categorized.<p>4. Add a `balance` assertion for any accounts which have new transactions--this throws an error if my current calculated balance for that account doesn&#x27;t match the assertion.<p>5. Run fava to check for errors and view any reports I&#x27;m interested in.<p>6. `git commit` the whole mess.<p>In general, (3) is only adding new text so it&#x27;s hard to make deletions&#x2F;edits by accident, and (4)+(5) give a strong guard against duplicated&#x2F;missed&#x2F;incorrect entries. (6) lets me glance over the diff before committing, mainly to confirm it&#x27;s an append-only operation (unless I changed the name of an account or something like that, which is both rare and can be done in a separate commit to keep things tidy).<p>At the end of the day, the amount of supporting code I have for all the automation is around 1k lines, and it&#x27;s been built up pretty slowly over the years--the initial automation got set up incrementally in order of how tedious I found various bank websites vs. the volume of transactions for the associated accounts, but at this point I can mostly just copy-and-paste my previous work on the rare occasion I need to set up a new account.')
