Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605554382, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25115234, text='&gt; Whatever the term that means “If you don’t pay us, bad things will happen.”<p>That would be extortion.<p>To shorten Popehat&#x27;s explanation of RICO more fundamentally, RICO requires several elements to all apply to kick in. It is <i>not</i> mere extortion (plus other racketeering crimes). It is also <i>not</i> extortion repeated over several times. Instead, it is the repeated extortion by the defendant in the service of the <i>distinct</i> enterprise.<p>Stepping back out again, if you&#x27;re arguing that a company&#x27;s actions mean it violates RICO, you&#x27;re almost certainly screwed because the defendant you&#x27;re suing is the company, and the relevant enterprise is, uh, the company again, which causes the suit to fail.<p>So, no, it&#x27;s not RICO because the defendant is Yelp and the enterprise is Yelp, and the defendant cannot be the enterprise.')
