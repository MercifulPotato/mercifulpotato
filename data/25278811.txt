I ask because I am guessing people who are angered by this have no idea what data employers can already access.  Have you seen the data that most MDM or network monitoring software can provide about employees?  That is much more sensitive data than what Microsoft is reporting and I haven&#x27;t seen anyone really object to it in large numbers.  The Microsoft stuff seemed intrusive and wrong headed, but odds are if your employer wanted to use that they are also using some much worse stuff too.  I might even consider the Microsoft tools helpful as a canary in a coalmine for other bad practices that are much harder to see.')
