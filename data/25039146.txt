Let&#x27;s call it 1.4 billion by the end of 2021. The USA + Canada will get half (USA gets 100M guaranteed and the option of an extra 500M). I assume Europe gets the other half based on the numbers I&#x27;m seeing that UK has ordered. Africa, Asia, and South America will probably not see meaningful levels of this vaccine until 2022.')
