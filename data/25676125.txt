Item(by='godelski', descendants=None, kids=[25678061], score=None, time=1610048272, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25670446, text='I think it makes more sense to use federated protocols after you&#x27;ve reached a certain critical mass of features and usability. Look how much Signal has improved in the last 6 months. That would be harder with a federated system as people just don&#x27;t update apps. I&#x27;ll buy a push for Signal to become federated when it is fully featured (which may be pretty soon). Also at that point, what is to stop people from making a federated Signal? Or creating a fork that allows contact with the centralized server AND a federated space? Is it impossible to have a mixture?')
