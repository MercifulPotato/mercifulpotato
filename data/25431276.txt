It still has the problem that people like to post junk, but there&#x27;s a natural limit on it. Algorithmic feeds however promote &quot;hot&quot; content, which is pretty much inevitably emotionally driven. There are a lot of possible fixes, such as rate limiters and manual review of high performing content, but they all come down to the same thing: don&#x27;t let sheer virality be the driving metric. The best way to decouple virality is just to make advertising against algorithmic feeds illegal.')
