Thank you.<p>The model shown is for 1D space and 1D time, and this 2D spacetime is curved, remaining 2D. Can you though show us a 3D model of curved 2D spacetime? Maybe as a rotatable, scaleable 3D scene, where more complex phenomena, like planetary motion around a star, would be possible to show?')
