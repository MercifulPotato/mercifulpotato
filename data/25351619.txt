Sometimes presenting yourself as a &quot;dark-traits&quot; individual with no moral compass and no remorse is the correct action, even when you do have an internal moral compass that would stop you.<p>In the face of bullies, it&#x27;s better to pretend to be unbridled like them, than be exploited by them. Deterrence and unpredictability are sometimes desirable traits. Sometimes pretending to have no moral boundaries will lead to less boundaries being tested.<p>Presenting red-lines and boundaries can be impossible for people whose moral code is known and predictable. Threatening with an immoral reaction is sometimes the most effective way to deal with bullies, and it&#x27;s not really immoral as long as you don&#x27;t do it.<p>Look at how Obama drew red lines in Syria that were trampled, and provoked to the edge of his reaction. It&#x27;s all a result of his moral compass being an open book.<p>On the other hand, Trump doesn&#x27;t even need to draw a red line. Being known as unpredictable was more deterring than any action Obama did.')
