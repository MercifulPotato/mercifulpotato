I live quite well. My colleagues live quite well. The company is doing quite well.<p>Do keep in mind, that every extra euro that ends up in my savings account, is an euro that is not ending up in \nsomeone else&#x27;s wallet in the country where the customers are. That is, if my company decided to raise our salaries, the customers would have to raise prices on their customers, and so on, I would have more savings, but someone else wouldn&#x27;t be able to have a coffee or pay their tuition money.<p>Why then, would we want the already well above average salaries raised?')
