I think what we&#x27;re seeing is what we see with TV, there is just less of a way to track it with those stations. - when I buy cable, I get both left and right news stations. I only watch one, but nobody but me knows that. When I use social media, I can access right and left, but everyone can see what I access, and the people who see it can cater their message to me specifically.<p>Anyway, I think you&#x27;re wrong. I don&#x27;t believe people inherently distrust traditional media. I think they distrust traditional media they don&#x27;t agree with.')
