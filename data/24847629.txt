No, i&#x27;m not talking browser extensions because that would require users to proactively install something for a webmaster (yeah, i said &quot;webmaster&quot;, i don&#x27;t care if it shows my age)...I&#x27;m talking about integrating the top X most implemented javascript libraries into the browser itself...why not just do that i wonder?<p>I&#x27;m half-winking as i state this (bloated aspect) because i give much respect to browser makers for all that browsers actually do&#x2F;have to do for us when rendering web experiences.  So, i don&#x27;t take adding even more stuff into browsers as a simply, hand-wavy thing to consider. But I also wonder if these libraries do in fact provide such helpful (and ubiquitous) utilities, why not incorporate them into the default - what is called - ecmascript?')
