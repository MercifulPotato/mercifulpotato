This let&#x27;s me use Google to (most of the time) find what I&#x27;m looking for, but without worrying as much about tracking or having a profile on my browser (Focus resets every time you leave the app). I&#x27;ve found that there are few occasions where I actually want to keep a search history.<p>Honestly a browser which kept no history but could let me save bookmarks and manage logins (either via a third party app or natively) through a walled garden would be great. Not sure if managing passwords without accumulating tracking cookies is even possible.')
