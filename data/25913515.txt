And they were so horribly expensive (say about $800 bucks in today&#x27;s money) that we were paranoid about zapping them with static electricity.<p>There were several projects using only standard TTL chips and making a usable computer, but they quickly were displaced by the &#x27;CPU on a chip&#x27; when the 8080, Z80, 6800, 6502, 2650 and a bunch of other chips all came out. Eventually the wide selection was whittled down to pretty much just the 6502 (Apple) and the Z80 (The main bunch).<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ljw.me.uk&#x2F;educ8&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ljw.me.uk&#x2F;educ8&#x2F;</a><p>I suppose a good question is: What do you want to do with it?<p>Do you want to learn programming principles?<p>Do you want to learn programming a particular CPU?<p>Do you want to learn programming in machine language (assembly language) or a higher-level language (C, Java, Rust, Python)?<p>Do you have an embedded computer&#x2F;hardware combo in mind?<p>And many other questions like those.<p>And of course, most of those 40-year-old CPUs are still available to play with, anyway. :)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3KAjZbjPqnA&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3KAjZbjPqnA&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>')
