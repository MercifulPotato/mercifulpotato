It&#x27;s not that deadly for the majority of the population actually, especially for younger people.\nNo, the reason we went into lockdown was to avoid the hospitals overflowing with patients. If you let the virus spread around like wildfire through the population with its spread rate of 2 to 3, then you would very quickly make a lot of people very sick and need hospitalisation. This isn&#x27;t to say that the majority of people would get very sick. You only need a small minority of the vulnerable population to get very sick suddenly all at once in order to shock the hospital system.<p>So, if indeed we care about treating people with other diseases as you say, our priority should be on making sure we have as many beds and doctors available in hospitals. And the only way to achieve that is with coronavirus restrictive measures. It&#x27;s much easier to get doctors and hospitals to treat other. &quot;doing nothing&quot; as you suggest would be counter-productive to what you are trying to achieve.\npatients if they don&#x27;t have to constantly worry about their COVID-19 patients.\nIf the hospitals were full and you e.g. broke your leg while on your motorbike, would you like to be told at A&amp;E that &quot;sorry we&#x27;re full, we have all these COVID-19 patients that are dying&quot;? I wouldn&#x27;t.<p>&gt;The worst consequence of global warming will be economic depression caused by pushing expensive and ineffective, but low-carbon technologies on us.<p>You only need to take a simple cursory glance that the IPCC report to realise that it&#x27;s not that simple.\nHell, ask the CIA! They consider global warming a serious threat to national security. If the CIA considers it a threat, shouldn&#x27;t we worry?<p>Relevant videos that show how climate change is already having detrimental effects on our daily lives:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t0x46-enxsA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t0x46-enxsA</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Vo61TiAGwhk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Vo61TiAGwhk</a>')
