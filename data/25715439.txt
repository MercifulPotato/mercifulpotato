I am not familiar with Mises directly, but I read Hayek, who also analysed this price information problem.<p>This article frames the monetary price issue as an issue about profits - without prices manufacturers do not know if doing something will be profitable or not. That might be true but that is secondary. The main point to me seemed that the prices, as they are formed on the market, tell individuals what to do and what not to do in the social interest.<p>Example: imagine in some city one district has a water shortage. Quickly the people there will start offering higher prices for water. Then someone who is willing to work for social good can look at those prices to determine the needs of the people. Or put it another way - if you want to help society you should do things with highest monetary rewards. It is not tied to profit, as you can choose to do those things even at a loss for yourself. The prices just give you the information you need evaluate the needs.<p>Few nice consequence of this: 1) even the greedy people will end up doing good for society, since they will be chasing those same price signals; 2) people are rewarded in accordance to how much they are able or willing to contribute.')
