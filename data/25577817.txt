He claimed to leave twitter, but didn&#x27;t for any reasonable definition of &quot;left&quot;. Yet people continue to claim that Gebru &quot;cancelled&quot; him or something. He&#x27;s had like 15 twitter interactions today.<p>I&#x27;m guessing LeCun wasn&#x27;t trying to trick people with an elaborate hoax, but quit the usual way people quit social media, smoking, etc. But hating it and wanting to quit, then coming back anyway. The point is the interaction made him temporarily want to quit...')
