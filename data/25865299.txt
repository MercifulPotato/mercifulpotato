There is no memory. If you close the window, to copy the password, you have to re-search for the account to find the username.<p>2. If you open up bitwarden before the page is loaded, it says it can&#x27;t find the password box to fill in. This is probably an extension limitation, but still annoying.<p>iOS<p>1. No memory. If I search for a username, I have to re-search for the password. It always opens up to the search screen (when I am using it via the password helper keyboard).\n2. iOS the keyboard doesn&#x27;t always show up to let me search for an account via password helper keyboard.<p>In general<p>1. You should be able to set a default username or email to automatically use when creating a new account. I hate having to type my email address in every time when creating the account on mobile.\n2. When you&#x27;re registering an account on a website, I first create it in Bitwarden with a password then I paste the password into the textbox to register the account. If the website rejects the password cuz of formatting, I gotta go back into bitwarden, edit and update the password with the new format. it takes like 5 clicks. ugh.<p>Thanks for listening.')
