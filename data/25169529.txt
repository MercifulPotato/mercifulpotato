Item(by='jhgb', descendants=None, kids=[25169741], score=None, time=1605964213, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25168842, text='&gt; The term “software engineer” was invented to describe the work being done by Margaret Hamilton and her team, when developing the guidance software for the Apollo moon landings.<p>There&#x27;s a considerable debate about when and where this term was &quot;invented&quot;, apparently with some oral histories placing it even into (late?) 1950s.<p>As for grandparent&#x27;s comment, I think it was referring to the fact that the <i>nature</i> of the job is completely different. For example a large portion of a traditional engineer&#x27;s job deals with fighting the natural world. A bolt may rust away and stop doing what it was doing until then. A source code line in the form of<p><pre><code>  a=a+7; \n</code></pre>\nwon&#x27;t do any such thing. As long as it exists it will keep doing the same thing. Hence software engineers have to deal with a completely different set of issues, to the extent that calling it &quot;engineering&quot; is to a certain extent metaphorical.')
