It doesn&#x27;t have to be confrontational if you don&#x27;t want it to be. As a manager whose used it plenty in the past, I&#x27;ve found it to be an excellent tool to filter out people who were smooth talkers and seemed &quot;clued in&quot; but didn&#x27;t have the technical chops to do anything. I didn&#x27;t care at all about syntax, language of choice, or anything superficial like that. All I wanted to see was how they approached a problem, not that they simply memorized a piece of trivia. Also you can ask design or high level architecture questions during a whiteboard-interview too.

In the end, resume, grades, side-projects, whiteboard code, style of problem solving, feedback from previous co-workers, etc, etc, are all signals that you have to absorb and make a decision. You can&#x27;t just rely on one signal.')
