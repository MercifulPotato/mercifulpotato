The exaggerated fear of criminals, even though Japan is very safe.  Very low interest rates and lots of public debt.  In the wealthier parts of Japan newspapers featured articles on flu, with maps and graphs charting its activity.  Many people wore masks and if I coughed in public people would take a wide path around me and look at me as if I were a barbarian. Exactly like it is in Europe now.<p>In terms of having an old population Japan was more than 10 years ahead of Europe.  So it makes sense Japan was the future Europe.')
