Others have pointed to some libraries that make this possible in C++ and Rust; I&#x27;m sure it exists for other languages too. But this seems still short of what&#x27;s needed: Every number in an application should be of a certain type and those types should combine on mathematical operations. Often those types already exist within the application&#x27;s type model -- i.e. every class&#x2F;interface is an obvious candidate. Then it would just be a matter of assigning those types to numbers. This would yield the ability to express things like Users&#x2F;Client or Requests&#x2F;second through simple math operations on variables and have it all type checked.')
