To make a product, you need customers.  Whatever research we did to deal with SARS and MERS became moot when people stopped spreading the diseases; maybe Moderna could have delivered a vaccine, but there would have been no customers because other containment measures limited the spread.<p>My outsider impression of Moderna is that they had all the technology ready to deal with something like COVID-19, but there was no COVID-19 until now.<p>The fact that Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech independently produced a similar product on a similar timeframe is a pretty good indication that the technology was ready, and was just waiting for a market.')
