Many times it&#x27;s those fundamental moral assumptions that are in discussion, not the evidence itself.<p>For example: if the scientific evidence is &quot;lockdowns stop the spread of the virus&quot;, someone may say: &quot;well, this evidence supports my viewpoint that we should be in permanent lock-down until the virus is completely eradicated&quot;. But that starts from the assumption that stopping the spread of the virus is always the most important goal and other considerations (economy, education, etc) should be ignored.<p>Fake facts are an issue, but once we agree on facts, we&#x27;re only halfway there, then we need to agree on what to do based on those facts.')
