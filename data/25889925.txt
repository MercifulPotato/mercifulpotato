The socialization aspect is poorly addressed with virtual happy hours, or other tactics put on by really good leadership.<p>I think a lot of that can be addressed by having in-person social events once it&#x27;s feasible to do so.<p>I spent many years as a consultant for several different large consulting firms.  If we were productive, we were generally at client sites most of the time.<p>That meant we were rarely together as a group while working.<p>In order to promote teamwork, camaraderie and make sure we knew our peers, superiors and subordinates well, at least at the well-run organizations, we&#x27;d have regular (semi-monthly) team get togethers and at least quarterly office get togethers, either in the office or at a public venue.<p>That sort of thing is much less costly and since it&#x27;s outside of the regular work routine, socializing and building relationships doesn&#x27;t negatively impact productivity.<p>Whether or not WFH+regular get togethers is a good solution depends on the organization and its dynamics.  But it absolutely can make a big difference.')
