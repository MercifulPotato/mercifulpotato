But not so great otherwise.<p>You have much higher probablity of getting a good education if you are born in Europe than in US. US college education is unaffordable to vast majority of people.<p>And don&#x27;t even get me started on healthcare, gun violence, etc.<p>The point of money is to have a good quality of life.
