Quantum randomness is of a fundamentally different character than chaos.  Bell&#x27;s theorem (and concommitant experiments) shows that it is <i>not possible</i> for the results of quantum experiments to depend on information that exists in our universe before the experiment was actually conducted.  So if the results of quantum experiments are deterministic, the information that determines their outcomes can only exist outside of our universe.')
