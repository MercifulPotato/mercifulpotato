Apple had already provided the FBI with the phone’s iCloud data, which usually contains backups that have complete plaintext message history. Apple also dropped their plan to encrypt iCloud device backups that would prevent this sort of surveillance, specifically to aid the FBI.<p>Facebook already provides whatever surveillance law enforcement requests. This is a press hit along the same lines to spread the lie that routine communications on Facebook are <i>not</i> subject to surveillance.<p>They absolutely are. You can tell this by trying to send banned links via Messenger. A platform that doesn’t surveil the content will necessarily permit them as they will be opaque to the provider. Facebook has many systems in place to monitor and censor message content.')
