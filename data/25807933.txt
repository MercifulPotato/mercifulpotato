At the time I was confused because I&#x27;d always been taught more connections between the peoples and nations of the world was always good. To see people who I recognized as having very similar values to my own fighting so passionately against something I had until then never questioned being good was quite the wake up call to learn more about all sides of the issue. So now it&#x27;s very odd to me to see many of the same people and groups have turned into cheerleaders for globalism. The position now doesn&#x27;t seem to be so much a position as an anti-position against the anti-globalist views of the rising populist groups. The speed at which it has happened is what&#x27;s really surprising.')
