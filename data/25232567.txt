And had PG said &quot;a successful scientist has to produce knowledge&quot; I&#x27;d be fine with that statement. Instead, he used the word &quot;novel&quot;.<p>You could not say &quot;I am doing novel research to reproduce the results of study X&quot; and have &quot;novel&quot; be a correct usage of the term. That is simply not what novel means.<p>Sure, PG is right that &quot;novel&quot; research is important. But not that it&#x27;s a necessary condition for success. That just reveals the SV bias against actually doing the daily work it takes to simply keep things going<p>It&#x27;s fine to want to disrupt things, to (in the appropriate context) move fast &amp; break things, fail quickly and move on, whatever. But when the dust settles on a successful &quot;disruption&quot;, you need large numbers of people to put in the day-to-day work to <i>make</i> it work and keep things going. There is a tendency in SV culture to regard that first part as the highest virtue. Heck it&#x27;s right there in PG&#x27;s title: <i>Think for Yourself</i> The implication being that you&#x27;re not thinking for yourself if you&#x27;re one of the millions of people that make things work every day in a million different ways. Or take this quote:<p><i>&quot;If you&#x27;re naturally independent-minded, you&#x27;re going to find it frustrating to be a middle manager.&quot;</i><p>This is so incredibly insulting to imply a person could not be a manager and also think for themselves. It&#x27;s indicative of the out-of-touch siloed SV cult mentality that has raised novelty for its own sake along with hustle porn &amp; more to cargo-cult virtues, all while deriding, denigrating, and just outright insulting any endeavor that isn&#x27;t in service to that.')
