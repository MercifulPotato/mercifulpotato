I do apologise in advance if this is something you wouldn&#x27;t want to discuss, but do you think a notice such as this would have prevented you from burning out in regards to your open source projects?<p>You have contributed immensely to the go community and I expect the decision to take a step back from open source contributions was hard and that you probably have revisited it often. I wonder if you have thought of things that might improve the process for other maintainers. Would the ability for example to disable pull requests help? Maybe a way to ask&#x2F;find people to help moderate the issues or PRs before they reach you?<p>Thank you both (Fatih and Ben) for all the hard work you&#x27;ve put into open source.<p>---<p>ps. For people who might not know what I&#x27;m talking about, this might help. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arslan.io&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;taking-an-indefinite-sabbatical-from-my-projects&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arslan.io&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;taking-an-indefinite-sabbatical...</a>')
