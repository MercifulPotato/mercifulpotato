Not all implementations need to support all features. You cannot compare it to something like AGE, which is simply a single implementation without any effort to turn it into a standard about anything, nor the goal to support various use cases. We could go on talking about the differences of approach and the benefits and drawbacks of standardization, flexiblity, libraries vs. end-user applications etc, but that&#x27;s been discussed times and times again here and elsewhere. There is simply no alternative to OpenPGP the standard and its efforts. Or can you point us at one?<p>Have you looked at the OpenPGP spec? I find it pretty readable, and you will quickly see how it cannot be compared to any single application.<p>I understand that AGE also has a &quot;spec&quot;. It is limited to a single use case, encryption. No signatures, no certifications, no thoughts on key discovery or trust, etc etc.')
