But the debate over the appointment of ACB struck me as a great example of why I find aspects of the Democratic platform to be objectionable. ACB is, in the tradition of Scalia, an originalist justice. She is not perfect, but her commitment is to interpret the constitution <i>as it was understood when it was written</i>, not as she wishes it to be understood today.<p>The principle objection to this appointment was that she might overturn Roe v Wade or the ACA... even if an originalist interpretation of the constitution might (but not necessarily would) show that the ACA is unconstitutional. It seemed like an indefensible position to be saying &quot;we don&#x27;t like her because she tries really hard to interpret the constitution correctly&quot;.<p>Other countries, like Canada, have a &quot;living tree&quot; method of interpretation that I find to be wholly objectionable because it puts unelected justices in the position of legislating from the bench. Understanding the reasons for America&#x27;s amazing success over the last 200 years, and trying not to dismantle the system of government that has underpinned this success, should not really be an issue of party alignment.<p>Anyway, I guess the point I&#x27;m trying to make is that a lot of people seem to be distracted by the orange shiny object and don&#x27;t bother looking at the substance of policy, even when they would probably find things to agree about in the analysis (if not the conclusion).')
