Dendron started its life as a standalone app (eg. think Obsidian) but I quickly realized I was spending most of my time building undifferentiated editor scaffolding instead of focusing on the hierarchies and schemas that made Dendron unique.<p>I wanted to spend more time building out features that supported Dendron&#x27;s [hiearchy first approach](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kevinslin.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kevinslin.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0...</a>) to note taking which is what led me to re-write it for VSCode.<p>That being said, the core dendron engine is not vscode specific and there are folks that are experimenting with porting it over to other editors (eg. sublime, vim). We also have plans for a standalone editor in the future (most likely, this will be a fork of VSCode optimized for note taking)')
