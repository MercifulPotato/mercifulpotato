Item(by='AndrewUnmuted', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607100501, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25304193, text='&gt; You live in a place where the COVID statistics improved after a lockdown and mask mandate.<p>That place is now locking down again. Reconcile that for us.<p>There is no evidence that implementing &amp; enforcing these two actions led to any change in COVID statistics. You will have a terribly difficult time even proving correlative relationships between the COVID data and enforcement of these ridiculous policies.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s not the same thing as compliance with mandates<p>Yes, it is. This shows me that you have not even read the mask mandates. Compliance with the NYC mandate [0] for instance is as simple as wearing one, and only when you cannot &quot;socially distance&quot; from others.<p>Surely, you are aware that our constitutionally-limited federated republic provides no legal route for these mandates to be anything more than toothless.<p>&gt; Even if it were, how many of those people answer yes but also dine out at a restaurant, or otherwise remove their mask in higher-risk situations?<p>See how easy it is for the lockdown policies to enter the mask mandate discussion without any rhyme or reason whatsoever?<p>The mask mandates were employed so that we could <i>stop</i> being locked down. If the only way for the masks to work is if we also are locked down, you are already admitting that this policy is not only worthless but also misleading in its intent and goals.<p>Citation needed on the claim that going out to dinner is a &quot;higher-risk situation.&quot;<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regs.health.ny.gov&#x2F;volume-1a-title-10&#x2F;content&#x2F;section-66-32-face-coverings" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regs.health.ny.gov&#x2F;volume-1a-title-10&#x2F;content&#x2F;sectio...</a>')
