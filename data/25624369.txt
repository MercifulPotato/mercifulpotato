It is not only pretty exceptional in its general partial evaluation construct combined with compile-time introspection (although D and Nim have some similar features), it is the only language AFAIK where a single general partial evaluation construct is used <i>in stead of</i> type generics, value generics, typeclasses&#x2F;concepts, constexprs, macros and conditional compilation.<p>Zig might not be your cup of tea, and that&#x27;s fine, but it is without a doubt unique in its design and not only special, but pretty radical.<p>&gt; Talk about confusing, implicit syntax of Zig<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any more confusing than any other syntax (and less confusing than C&#x27;s `for` syntax where the ubiquitous `;` is treated differently than anywhere else), even though it might not be familiar to you before learning it, but there is absolutely nothing implicit here. You might find `in` more appealing to you or more familiar than `|` but it&#x27;s certainly not more <i>explicit</i>.')
