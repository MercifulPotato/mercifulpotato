I don’t know if anyone else posted your blog posts to HN but assuming it’s just you, I counted five posts (excluding the flagged ones) that would have made it to the front page of HN for any meaningful amount of time. Based on this, I would say that you are unlikely to be HN’a top blogger.<p>And I don’t know how you’d set up your blog with AWS but I don’t see how it could be expensive to host static content there.')
