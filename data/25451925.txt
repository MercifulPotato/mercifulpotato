This would allow you to actually move around and interact with your space.<p>I briefly played the HoloLens AR game where you have to shoot at robotic bugs that crawl out from your walls.[1] The fact that I could duck behind my office partition was awesome. The fact that when I blew a hole in my wall I could see the &quot;studs&quot; behind it was similarly cool.<p>In an ideal world, I could trace out my house and play up and down the stairs. Or go to a field or forest and play in a whole other world.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=29xnzxgCx6I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=29xnzxgCx6I</a>')
