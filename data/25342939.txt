By default, you would mostly expect food subsidies to increase the price that agricultural land fetches.<p>Most subsidies would only have an impact on prices, if they encourage more growing overall.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s also subsidies and regulations for producing less food.  (The EU has a lot of these, too.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to grow more grapes for wine.)  The US has the famous corn ethanol subsidy.  And some tariffs on food imports.')
