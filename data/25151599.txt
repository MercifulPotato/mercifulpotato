But it&#x27;s clear the construction that&#x27;s there isn&#x27;t safe. I wonder if, provided they&#x27;re able to dismantle the remaining facility without complete collapse, if it&#x27;d be reasonable to &quot;rebuild&quot; on the same site.<p>It sounds like the towers should be rebuilt, all of the cables replaced, etc. And obviously the dish at minimum needs <i>repair</i>. I can&#x27;t imagine anything would be salvageable from a complete collapse, but if they can bring down the observatory safely, it might not be crazy to think they could erect a new one over the dish at a later date.')
