Make an API that does this particular thing.  You have two days.  Then we look at what they built and talk about it.  It&#x27;s way more realistic because that&#x27;s how we actually work-- nobody is coding algorithms on a whiteboard.  To any extent, it has worked very well.  The people that have done great ended up being great employees and the people that did just enough to pass also did that once they were hired.')
