Is Chinese mafia or Chinese big private company or Multinational Big company. For each one you close there will be more to come as long that is profitable. The Chinese (or Japanese or whatever) government will protest and try to retaliate of course<p>But is not necessarily government. Is &quot;wery well known japanese car maker&quot; storing frozen tuna for speculating with the market prices in a sort of &quot;gold&quot; substitute, but more profitable than gold market. Yes this has happened and is probably happening now. We know it because the 2011 Tsunami destroyed the hidden storages. Japan, Not China (in this case).<p>Is Totoaba prices in the Chinese market being falsely promoted as miraculous remedy for all stuff and prices manipulated to the point of making small fortunes, where the pirate local fishermen are paid in peanuts. You wipe the pirate locals has the same result as wiping the small drug dealers.<p>And in the other part of the warfield, we have a bunch of environmentalists without any real money. People that can be overpowered, crushed by lawyers or assasinated selectively. What will be more convenient.')
