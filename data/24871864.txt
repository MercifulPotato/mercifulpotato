No, it&#x27;s not Canada, but at highway speeds in freezing weather it gets cold very quickly. I can&#x27;t cover my whole face with cloth, or my breath will fog up and freeze over my glasses and visor. I apply vaseline over all of my exposed skin before riding. It does a great job of protecting my skin. I also do this when bicycling through extremely cold weather.')
