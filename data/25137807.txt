DMVs use the database to catch people trying to use a rented mailbox as their home address. An employer can catch this if they want to. At my last employer I used a UPS Store address and HR never caught on but since it was in the same town I lived in, there were no tax issues. When I tried to open an HSA, my address was flagged because an HSA is considered a bank account and they must have a physical address for that. I opened an FSA instead, which didn&#x27;t flag. So it really depends on how the company&#x27;s HR department operates and as others have mentioned, if you&#x27;re in a different tax area, there could be legal complications if you get caught.')
