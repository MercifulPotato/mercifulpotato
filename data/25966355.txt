As an extreme case, a biotech company with no sales, no profits, no approved drugs and sinking money into R&amp;D is still worth something, and can be worth a lot.<p>On a more practical case, if you&#x27;d preferred to have invested in Intel on &quot;fundamentals&quot; instead of AMD because INTC has 10x more sales...then go ahead. But you should know, 1 stock went sideways for 3 years and another is up 750%.<p>And Chamath Palihapitiya said it best when he was on CNBC...who got the TSLA investment wrong? Hedge funds. Who got it right? Retail investors.')
