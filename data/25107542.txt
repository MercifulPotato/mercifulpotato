If this grain of sand is sitting on top of this other one, do we count the full surface area of the top grain minus the point of contact, or do we declare that the grain is not actually part of Colorado but merely a grain sitting on top of Colorado? Whoops, the grain moved while you were thinking about it.<p>Then once you&#x27;ve classified every single grain as in or out, you get down to the subatomic scale. Perhaps you could define the surface in terms of a single electronic density isosurface, but you&#x27;d be choosing your isosurface somewhat arbitrarily.')
