It&#x27;s been a decade now, but my recollection is that when I spent a day or two idly reading the Awk book, and was able to immediately employ it in simple shell pipelines after reading not that many pages.  I think Awk is useful once you&#x27;ve learned just a bit about it, and I don&#x27;t think learning a <i>lot</i> about Awk is <i>very</i> useful - there are languages that are better suited for complex tasks.')
