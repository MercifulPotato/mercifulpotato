I’d had enough.<p>I bought a HP laser jet printer, which I replaced with a wireless one in 2015.<p>I’ve never replaced the toner since I bought it and it prints flawlessly, quickly every time without fail.<p>I get that people are unhappy with HPs motives but I’m a happy customer, and if it’s any conciliation taking this approach will result in HPs business model not working out for them.<p>Good luck.')
