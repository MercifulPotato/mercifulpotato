I must say, I prefer weak copylefts for my projects (MPLv2 with the incompatibility clause), so my concern isn&#x27;t copyleft per se, but the virility of it.<p>That said, I do have a couple questions:<p>- Would a non-AGPLv3 open-source or source-available project using K6 be incompatible with AGPLv3 given they might &quot;distribute&quot; CI&#x2F;CD along with their open-source or source-available code?<p>- If a closed-source project publishes results from K6, are they now in violation of AGPLv3?')
