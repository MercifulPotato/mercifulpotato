I never have to fiddle with any menus in my dumb TV. You turn it on and it&#x27;s ready to go. All the HDMI inputs have dedicated buttons on the remote control, so switching inputs is easy. Changing picture mode: dedicated button. Other than for switching inputs, I don&#x27;t use the TV remote at all. The Android TV box&#x27;s remote is a beautiful thing of simplicity. Smart TVs running Android TV come with complicated remote controls: the &quot;android box&quot; feature built inside doesn&#x27;t have its own simple remote (unless you buy an after-market one, I suppose).<p>- portable &quot;brains&quot;: the box or dongle you plug into it fits into a coat pocket. Take it anywhere and watch your content (anywhere, modulo possible geographic restrictions, for which you need a VPN).<p>- portable &quot;brains&quot;: possibility of upgrading the TV, without the hassle of re-installing apps and logging into each one: just out with the old TV, in with the new. <i>Logging into apps on a new device is particularly a pain if you&#x27;re mooching logins off friends and relatives!</i><p>- the ability to shut the TV off, yet have content keep playing and listen to the audio. This is possible if your Android box has an audio jack! I absolutely love this. I hate visual content burning pixels on the screen when I&#x27;m just listening to music.')
