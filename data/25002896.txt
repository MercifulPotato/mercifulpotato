It’s simply impossible to argue that was an accurate model.<p>538&#x27;s PA <i>indicator</i> ended at Biden +4.7%. But the overall 538 <i>model</i> doesn&#x27;t care if a candidate wins PA by +0.7% or +4.7%. The 538 model is designed to do 1 thing: predict the EC winner. It uses state-wide predictions as indicators, but you can&#x27;t judge a model based on the performance of a single low-level indicator, you judge it by it&#x27;s final prediction, which is Biden 90% &#x2F; Trump 10% to win the EC.<p>But yes, the lower you go in the model the higher variance you&#x27;ll see:<p>Level 1 -&gt; EC Winner (538&#x27;s focus -- could end up 100% correct)<p>Level 2 -&gt; State Winners (low variance -- could end up 90-95% correct)<p>Level 3 -&gt; State Polling Averages (moderate variance &amp; could be 75-90% within margin of error)<p>Level 4 -&gt; Individual Polls (high variance &amp; could be 60-80% within margin of error)<p>If you click on any individual state (like PA: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;2020-election-forecast&#x2F;pennsylvania&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;2020-election-forecast&#x2F;...</a>), you can see the state-wide vote projections. Biden was projected to earn between 49 and 55% of PA&#x27;s vote with Trump expected to get between 45 and 50%. The final outcome looks certain to fall within those expected ranges. Again, the margin really doesn&#x27;t matter, just that the idea of Trump getting above 50% and Biden getting below 50% seemed pretty difficult, hence Trump&#x27;s low (but not impossible) 16% chance of carrying the state.<p>I like the way their &quot;Winding Path to Victory&quot; chart (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;2020-election-forecast" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;2020-election-forecast</a>) explains their model. It&#x27;s basically saying: &quot;Trump&#x27;s path to 270 likely goes through PA, NE-2, AZ, FL, NC, ME-2, GA, OH, IA &amp; TX, where he has a fighting chance of winning any of those, but a very low chance at winning all of them.&quot; On the flip side, &quot;Biden&#x27;s path to 270 goes through Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania, where he&#x27;s likely to win all of them&quot;. That seems like a pretty reasonable EC prediction to me.<p>If Silver was promoting the model as being able to accurately predict state vote percentages, I&#x27;d agree that it&#x27;s underwhelming. But when you average all of that variability and uncertainty, you can get a pretty reasonable EC winner prediction IMO, at least better than others I&#x27;ve seen that had Biden closer to 95 or 98% to win the EC, or betting markets that had him as low as 60%.')
