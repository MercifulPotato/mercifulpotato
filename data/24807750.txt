Maybe the ISP should be talking to that someone, even in an automated way where vulnerability scanners cut off their access and they need to manually re-enable it after having disconnected the offending device?<p>&gt; US tells China their ISP is liable for spam traffic<p>I think most countries would agree that certain behaviors are undesirable. The damage &amp; waste of time caused by spam and malware transcends political and religious opinions for example.<p>The solution doesn&#x27;t have to be a <i>legal</i> liability per-se, simply a code of conduct that all ISPs agree to and anyone found to be in breach will get cut off by the others. They&#x27;re not necessarily on the wrong side of the law, but for all intents and purposes their business is done because nobody will peer with them.')
