Which is often.<p>People aren&#x27;t stupid.  There&#x27;s a reason why everyone who can swing it buys an AWD to commute and not everyone buys snow tires.  The snow tire is still gonna be slush-o-planing any time you go onto highway slush of appreciable depth.  Heck a mud tire with big fat grooves is your best bet when the tire is on that.  There is no tire (suitable for general use, I&#x27;m sure the Florida mud racing crowd has something up their sleeve) that can handle that without planing.  There just isn&#x27;t enough space between the tread blocks for all that viscous fluid to be forced through (assuming you&#x27;re going like 20+mph) and you end up on top of it.<p>Being able to change lanes and enter traffic from side streets&#x2F;driveways with less slip is just a soooooo much better experience than not being able to do those things gracefully but in exchange for a slightly a better worst case stopping distance in fairly rare conditions (ice and fresh powder).<p>Commuting in snow is nothing like those commercials where they drive on ice.  All the traction in the world won&#x27;t help you when your problem is that the tire isn&#x27;t making contact with the road.  Driving on ice and fresh powder are so rare it&#x27;s no surprise that consumers don&#x27;t optimize for that.  Sure you can put snow tires on your AWD but the lions share of improvement in the conditions people actually encounter comes from AWD.')
