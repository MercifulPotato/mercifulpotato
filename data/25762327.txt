We&#x27;re in an odd situation where what passes for the Government has been trying to implement a &quot;one laptop per child&quot; initiative but has failed spectacularly. We&#x27;ve even had BBC regional TV news asking viewers to donate old&#x2F;obsolete&#x2F;unwanted devices and in a few cases there has been a moderate response. Add to that the lack of broadband in low socio-economic households and many rural areas, and you can see that this is a non-starter.<p>However, I could say with a fair degree of accuracy that over 90% of UK households have at least 1 TV (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.barb.co.uk&#x2F;trendspotting&#x2F;tracker-number-tvs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.barb.co.uk&#x2F;trendspotting&#x2F;tracker-number-tvs&#x2F;</a> ) and many of the poorest families seem to be able to run an Internet-capable Smartphone, so this is where it gets interesting. Oh, and there are numerous public (pay to use) British Telecom Wifi access points in many streets, embedded in termination boxes.<p>If the Government could somehow furnish a small, cheap computing device with no resale value that could optionally use a TV screen for display and a Smartphone as a hotspot, or do a deal with British Telecom to connect to already-available WiFi access points, they could make a significant inroad into getting kids online and learning again. All it needs is some thinking, planning and timely implementation (and this is why the Government is certain to fail).')
