Item(by='gnicholas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603090126, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24823048, text='&gt; <i>Basically look at the tag if it was manufactured recently.</i><p>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not that simple. The update to the CA law is that manufacturers are no longer <i>required</i> to include flame retardants. They are still allowed to. I was surprised that even at a high-end furniture chain (Restoration Hardware), they were unable to tell me whether their furniture contained flame retardants or not.')
