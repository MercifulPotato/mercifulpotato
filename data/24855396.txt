But aren&#x27;t prices in Canada generally lower than Europe when you include taxes? Sales taxes are 5-15% in Canada. They are generally 20% or higher in EU. Car insurance is perhaps more expensive in Canada, but vehicle registration&#x2F;taxes are lower than Europe, so the total cost of ownership is lower.<p>I fell like a lot of the perception of things being more expensive in Canada is that CAD is values lower than EUR&#x2F;USD&#x2F;CHF&#x2F;GBP. So looking at raw numbers, things feel more expensive. If you do the currency conversion, they become more comparable. Do you have any data showing things are generally more expensive in Canada compared to Europe, when accounting for currency conversion?')
