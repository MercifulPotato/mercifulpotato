Material (Google&#x27;s design system) uses 10 shades, Fluent (Microsoft&#x27;s) uses 8, Lightning (Salesforce&#x27;s) uses 12. Even the most basic terminals in use support 2 shades of EACH color.<p>While 2 or 3 colors are fine for a simple blog, any app that has more functionality than just reading can benefit from a wide range of semantic colors. A dangerous action should be red, a graph trending upwards should be green (or red in East Asian markets), a warning should be yellow. These colors help convey meaning to the actions that are present, and the usefulness of a wide spectrum should not be discounted.')
