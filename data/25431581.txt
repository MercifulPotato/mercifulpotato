[ ! is never correct, neither is ! [ -z or ! [ -n. one bracket in &#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh, two in bash. quote every variable expansion unless you have a very good reason not to. add new lines in sensible places. nobody (sensible) complains that you can&#x27;t write<p><pre><code>  for\n    num\n  in\n    mylist\n  :\n</code></pre>\nin Python, so don&#x27;t write it in shell either.<p>the problem is there is so much cargo culting garbage. the same problem exists in &quot;C&#x2F;C++&quot;, where people write &quot;int* buf = (int* )malloc(num*sizeof(int))&quot; to be &quot;compatible&quot;, or do gratuitous pointer aliasing with undefined behavior, despite the fact that any modern C implementation with any optimizations at all will inline small fixed-size memcpy.')
