You can deny service to anyone for any reason as long as it&#x27;s not a protected characteristic! Apple already cannot deny your app based on your race.<p>If a restaurant doesn&#x27;t like your attitude they can ask you to leave. Can&#x27;t Apple do the same?<p>&gt; Again, how exactly does that inconvenience you, personally?<p>Because the smartphone gets worse. Less locked-down, less simple, more complex, more avenues of attack. More expensive to make and maintain.<p>But why does anyone have to justify why they don&#x27;t like it? I think &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to do this&#x27; should be reason enough for Apple to not do it. As long as they aren&#x27;t impacting people who aren&#x27;t their customers it&#x27;s their business not yours.<p>&gt; no one is imposing anything on you<p>Yes you are you want to impose that Apple change their software to suit you - it&#x27;s selfish.<p>You want it your way, I want it my way. Hope can we resolve this? How about we let Apple choose who to market to?<p>We can&#x27;t make it a legally protected right to have products designed for people&#x27;s random whims.')
