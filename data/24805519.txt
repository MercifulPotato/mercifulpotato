We typically sell &quot;access&quot; to the idea, even though the supply of access is infinite. If you want to account for human labor and cost, then you&#x27;re describing novel ideas, not &quot;an idea&quot;. novel ideas are scarce, access to an idea is not.<p>That may seem pedantic, but that distinction is the thing we <i>charge for access on</i>.<p>The reason I&#x27;m harping on this is to make it black and white crystal clear, that the existing system we are using is a kludge. It would be shocking if such a system was flatly the best way to do things.<p>No idea what&#x27;s better, but there are much smarter people out there than me.')
