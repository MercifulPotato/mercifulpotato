I really wanted to like the credit unions, but their general level of operational competence is a small fraction of the big banks.<p>Everything takes much longer and major hassles are far more frequent. They have automated little to none of their operations. They are so small that their tiny staff has never had to deal with your particular issue before, and doesn&#x27;t know what to do about it.<p>The big banks, on the other hand, deal with other versions of your problem dozens to hundreds of times a day, and have evolved a very high degree of efficiency in handling your case.')
