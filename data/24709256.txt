If there are links using normal text (rather than just autolinked URLs) or a logo, it&#x27;s HTML â€“ so deliverability or privacy arguments based around being &quot;plain text&quot; don&#x27;t entirely hold up.<p>Now, do I think there are accessibility and privacy benefits to be had by sending truly plain text email? Absolutely. No open trackers possible, no potential for HTML related vulnerabilities, no dangerous elements to filter..')
