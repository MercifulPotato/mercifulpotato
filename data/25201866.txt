Although normally a one-off at installation, with lots of devices present don’t expect it to work first time.<p>Occasionally when encountering bugs in various software&#x2F;hardware combinations i have seen suggested fixes of ‘just re-pair everything to a hub’ which for a full house will take a day and drive you insane.<p>One additional concern is the environmental impact of the number of cr2302 batteries in use - one for most switches and sensor that aren’t permanently wired in - even with a 1-2 year battery life it adds up to a lot. I think firmware updates in current systems take a big bite out of theoretical battery life spans.')
