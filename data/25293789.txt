Putting aside their artistic concerns that their films are best experienced on the massive widescreen, having a big box office haul seems to be a key part of Hollywood braqfests.<p>If simultaneous theater+streaming becomes the norm, it would seem the days of multi-hundred-million box office gross will be past. In 2020, the highest grossing film (domestically) so far is the Bad Boys sequel, which released in January and got $204M. The only other 2020 release to break $100M is the Sonic the Hedgehog movie. And many of 2020&#x27;s top grossing movies were released in late 2019, e.g. &quot;1917&quot; and Star Wars. Even worse, Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Tenet&quot; – released in September by Warner Bros – basically bombed at under $60M [0].<p>Given the huge movies that WB is planning to put on HBO (Matrix 4, Wonder Woman, Dune), I wonder if that&#x27;ll spur Disney to throw Black Widow onto streaming. Apparently its Mulan release (which required a premium subscription) didn&#x27;t do so well, but seems risky for Disney to sit on its hands while WB goes all in.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boxofficemojo.com&#x2F;year&#x2F;2020&#x2F;?grossesOption=calendarGrosses" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boxofficemojo.com&#x2F;year&#x2F;2020&#x2F;?grossesOption=calen...</a>')
