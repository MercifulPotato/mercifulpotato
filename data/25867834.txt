I think that&#x27;s what this will all boil down to.<p>A lot of Apple&#x27;s success with iPhones happened because they were able to dominate the market for the latest and greatest components, locking out competitors by simply buying up every scrap of cutting edge parts. If Tesla is able to leverage their capital and lock everyone else out of batteries, they might strangle the competition in a similar fashion. On the other hand, if Toyota or some other competitor can develop some game-changer battery technology and lock Tesla out, they could fold just as easily.')
