Even if it&#x27;s in the &#x27;cloud&#x27; but maybe where something like telegram&#x2F;signal has to &#x27;pair&#x27; each device with your account and ultimately, the user has the keys.<p>I don&#x27;t have the time to watch your presentation but I skimmed your slides. Wolfram is legit. I didn&#x27;t know that about him and I plan on reading that article about his productivity.<p>Also, I didn&#x27;t realize that others were actually interested in this. I&#x27;ve been trying to do this type of stuff for....about 4 years now. I&#x27;m not super tech savvy and I also keep getting busier. I <i></i>really<i></i> want this for myself. I have a ton of webpages that I want to put into a system (dated on when I enter it, tags, etc). I currently salvaged my entire email system, even after a lot of headache (years....worth). I have Todoist for tasks. I have Pocket for bookmarks. I want a place for all my notes, tidbits, all my digital content to be put into one place.<p>Even recently, I was thinking, I could get an ANN&#x2F;ML that would see what I&#x27;m &#x27;saving&#x27; and doing and it could suggest higher value ideas&#x2F;content for me to consider. (Like a Youtube recommendation engine but...instead of trying to get you to waste your time on something, instead the ANN is focused on trying to give you a ROI for what you&#x27;ve coming across; becoming a better father, as ME, as an individual..., or taking my first step to learning something that I didn&#x27;t realize that I wanted to know [accounting is one strange topic that has arise in my life], etc, etc). I would like to eventually get a team and hire a few personal assistants but...ultimately my game plan is what I wrote above. A decent algorithm that has a solid feedback loop based on my experience through life, to help me become more productive on what my goals and thought processes are.<p>I say this all to you, hoping that maybe you or someone in HN could build this. I&#x27;d probably be willing to go up to $1k a year or something. Until I generate a lot more money for myself, through my own brute force, I won&#x27;t have the cash flow to get someone to help me build this myself. I wouldn&#x27;t want to sell it. I&#x27;d want it for myself because there is a &#x27;good enough&#x27; threshold that I think would be incredibly valuable to me. (Sure, you could keep iterating...but I suspect that after the threshold is reached, it would be a certain limit of diminishing returns until some major algo breakthroughs happen)<p>P.S. I do understand than you want to target businesses, etc. That&#x27;s where the money is, sure. But...I wish people could finally get a solid product for once. What&#x27;s that email service that reduces everyone&#x27;s clutter that people are <i>paying</i> significantly for? Yeah. Be that, but for the personal data warehouse. I&#x27;d pay the premium.')
