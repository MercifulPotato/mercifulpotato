As you expose yourself to new bodily stresseors (regular exposure to a much more reactive atmosphere than normal) you may not be turning &quot;back&quot; aging, but rather reactivating old eukaryotic coping mechanisms evolved long ago, but not employed regularly since circumstances have changed. If you further cease to expose yourself to that stressor, your body will slowly shift away from utilizing those metabolic pathways back to something more efficient given the set of stressors in your typical environment.<p>Higher concentrations of oxygen from your respiratory system would likely signal the need in your entire body to upregulate cell division, due to oxidative stress both internal and external. It could also kick in metabolic processes that are not as efficient is substantially lower lower O2 partial pressure environments.<p>Nevermind the fire hazard. Pro-Tip: With enough 02 around, and nothing else to get in the way, everything burns with comparatively little inducement to do so.<p>Light reading \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eiga.eu&#x2F;index.php?eID=dumpFile&amp;t=f&amp;f=208&amp;token=cbf5e6654875b233874a1309555bb105d140fde4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eiga.eu&#x2F;index.php?eID=dumpFile&amp;t=f&amp;f=208&amp;token=c...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nj.gov&#x2F;health&#x2F;eoh&#x2F;rtkweb&#x2F;documents&#x2F;fs&#x2F;1448.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nj.gov&#x2F;health&#x2F;eoh&#x2F;rtkweb&#x2F;documents&#x2F;fs&#x2F;1448.pdf</a><p>There were a few other good searches I did long ago for another random walk of whimsy, but I seem to have lost track of them.
