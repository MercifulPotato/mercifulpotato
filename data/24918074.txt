Would we want to accept a vehicle that consistently ran them over? The raw numbers might be better but that doesn&#x27;t fully paint a picture of what those numbers would look like.<p>I also think the &#x27;will randomly kill people, but rarely&#x27; aspect of self-driving cars will be majorly off-putting on a very human level.<p>And finally there&#x27;s a perception issue here - the self-driving hype is around the idea that the car is effectively being driven by a far better driver than a human, the second it turns out it does really crazy things sometimes (doesn&#x27;t even have to involve fatalities necessarily) is also going to put people off I think.<p>I personally prefer the idea of driver assists (responsibly developed so drivers aren&#x27;t just distracted) aiding driver safety while we work on a supplemental self-driving solution, or perhaps as discussed in the article create some infrastructure along roads to make things more certain.<p>I am far from being against self-driving cars, I just feel the timeline is longer than currently hyped.')
