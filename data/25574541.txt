Then I flew back via O&#x27;Hare, and really saw the difference when waiting for the transfer; quite dramatic levels of obesity.<p>I wonder how much of it is just down to urban Americans walking places, and rural and suburban Americans less so.<p>I did also notice that there was added sugar in virtually _everything_.')
