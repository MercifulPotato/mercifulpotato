After a few years of that, I went into the professional world, and can relate to how you and others in this thread feel, about the dullness and lack of satisfaction. I remembered those times, though, and I kept looking for something to do.<p>I realized what the difference was: Back then, I was programming for myself, for the enjoyment of it. I was dogfooding everything, at times I was not only the top user, but the only user of my software.<p>So I went back to doing that, and I can happily report that I feel that way again. It can be done, don&#x27;t give up hope.')
