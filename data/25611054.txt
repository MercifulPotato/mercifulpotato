It&#x27;s more of a clusterfuck. You can run mainline Linux on any PC. When it comes to mobile ARM, there is no unified device management system (UEFI&#x2F;BIOS). Devicetree is a joke and no one uses it, and every device take a Linux kernel and patches the hell out of it in totally non-upstreamable ways.<p>PostmarketOS has made great strides in fixing this issue, but Linux doesn&#x27;t just work on ARM. You have to port each distro you want to use to each and every device. With a PC, you can buy any Lenovo, Dell, HP, etc off the self and you will always be able to boot to a console; usually graphics mode too. That&#x27;s not the same case at all with ARM boards.<p>I wrote more about this a few years back:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;android-fragmentation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;android-fragmentation&#x2F;</a>')
