That&#x27;s not what you are asking about, but I leaned some important things doing it.  The most important was my estimate that there are about 10 years required to build a 3-bedroom conventional house giving a job and other obligations.  The second is that to do it yourself will likely result in a divorce.  This is a very tough road to follow.  Consider designing exactly the house you want (it takes me about a year to design a nice house) and then act as your own general contractor hiring sub-contractors to do the actual work.  Even then it will probably be the hardest thing you have done and take over a year.  Getting a house up and looking good on the outside is relatively easy, quick, and cheap.  Finishing the inside is much more expensive and time consuming that a person expects.<p>Good luck!')
