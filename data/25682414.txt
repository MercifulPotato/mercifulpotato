Did you mean to link something else entirely?<p>That&#x27;s a Plipbox. One side of it speaks 10baseT (or maybe 100baseT, it doesn&#x27;t really matter) and the other is a literal Centronics-style parallel port, not Ethernet at all.<p>The idea is, your Amiga can do PLIP (IP over the Parallel port) and this box turns that into Ethernet traffic which you can drop into any network with IP.<p>But if you&#x27;ve got some 10base5 or earlier Ethernet, this does not help you at all.')
