See for example [the figure on this page](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gavi.org&#x2F;vaccineswork&#x2F;qa-ola-rosling-gapminder" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gavi.org&#x2F;vaccineswork&#x2F;qa-ola-rosling-gapminder</a>): in this survey, in Germany, 13% said they believe vaccines are not safe in general, but only 3% of babies are not getting the measles vaccination.<p>So let&#x27;s hope many of the people that currently are not planning to get the vaccine, will change their mind and actually do so in the end. I think good information campaigns in the media and testimonies of friends that have received the vaccine will do a lot to mitigate this problem.')
