That&#x27;s a very different and explicit operation &amp; manipulation.<p>Although example 1 doesn&#x27;t strictly have anything to do with types, you could get the same behaviour with `x = 0` in any language with closures (like javascript), or `foo = 0` in a language which passes parameters by (mutable) references as long as that information is not visible in the caller.')
