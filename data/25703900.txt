It does feel like there&#x27;s something missing in Splunk when it comes to analyzing issues.<p>When there&#x27;s a problem at work it&#x27;s usually easy to see that something is wrong on a dashboard, but when I want to drill down into it I usually end up with ten tabs of different searches and Grafana dashboards that I&#x27;m trying to correlate between manually.<p>I haven&#x27;t fully formed any ideas about how to tackle this since there are still fairly basic features missing in Logsuck that I need to work on first but it&#x27;s definitely something I&#x27;ll be thinking more about in the future!')
