Debian does not have the audio stuffs I need, and getting caught in compile dependency circles was bad. For some reason, even the maintainers and the audio software group could not get the package working on Debian. I had to back off and go to Mint.<p>I suppose this sounds like a counter argument to me wanting control... but I will admit I am in a special situation in that I want more control, but I use very specialized software that has issues with old or very bleeding edge distros.')
