Basically they are accredited data scientists. Oh scratch that, they would have been data scientists if the CAS exams hadn’t stagnated their knowledge. instead of keeping abreast of the industry, they devote all their time to study for antiquated exams that just serve as barriers to entry, but it does keep their jobs safe.<p>Also ones of the key arguments the article uses isn’t just applicable to accredited professions, everyone can go to jail or be fined if they lie to a judge. This is the first major reason the authors cites...
