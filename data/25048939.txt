If they think it&#x27;s a &quot;small change&quot;, it may as well be done, so they speak about it as if it is. You correct them and you are ignored, or they tell you it&#x27;s just for a high level discussion, so it doesn&#x27;t matter. Sometimes they&#x27;re right, sometimes they&#x27;re not. It is a very fine line between stretching the truth and  exaggeration, outright lies. As &quot;technical&quot; people we try to be precise on our language and want statements to reflect reality.')
