They seem to view this feature as part of their product segmentation strategy.<p>Some consumer SSD vendors do enable 4kB LBA support. I&#x27;ve seen it supported on consumer drives from WD, SK hynix and a variety of brands using Phison or SMI SSD controllers (including Kingston, Seagate, Corsair, Sabrent). But I haven&#x27;t systematically checked to see which brands consistently support it.')
