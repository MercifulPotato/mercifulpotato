(It also reads as if it betrays some hurt feelings on the part of its creator, IMO). I think this is why it&#x27;s traditionally, historically, so incendiary to talk about class theory.<p>Also, here we are at the point in history when even reclusive billionaires are starting to change and improve the way they contribute to the world. Some are even giving away all their money before they die, which was once seen as a feat the bible itself couldn&#x27;t envision.<p>Michael Scott is also given occasional but shy credit on the show for being someone whose values freely interconnect with those of his workers, which to me was an understated win of the series.<p>The fact is, Michael can&#x27;t be the best of everybody, even though he tries. But he can sure reflect their good back onto them, even when he&#x27;s completely exploding an otherwise harmless situation! It&#x27;s an underrated gift. We need more of that good-reflecting in the world, and less criticism of the kind that reflects a hopeless situation.')
