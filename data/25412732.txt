In that light, one hypothesis is that other automakers have pretty convincingly demonstrated that they are not able to sell significant numbers of cars at large profit margins, dooming them to perpetually hover slightly above or below breakeven depending on whether the economy is growing or in recession. Tesla hasn&#x27;t proven they can do this, but they are unique among automakers in at least _not_ proving they _can&#x27;t_, leaving open the potential of growing into an Apple-like position of commanding the majority of the profit in their industry, even if only a minority of sales.<p>Ford&#x27;s success with the F-150 line might be an exception here, but the pickup truck market will always be much smaller than the rest of the automobile market.')
