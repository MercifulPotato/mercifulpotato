That’s what QAnon actually believe, and if you are that deluded, storming the Capitol building in a desperate bid to ensure that Trump remains in office long enough to break up the secret Democrat child sex trafficking ring has a certain internal logic to it.<p>This is no joke—one of the rioters who made it to either the House or Senate floor was carrying a sign with a vague message about saving the children, while another one—the one who faced off with heroic Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman—was wearing a “Q” hoodie.<p>It’s very strange to consider that some 4chan troll had this impact on history.<p>To your point, I think it’s worth considering all the potential outcomes:<p>1. Harm coming to any of the elected officials in the Capitol that day\n2. A bloodbath on the Capitol steps on live television\n3. Chaotic scenes of men in pelts occupying the Senate floor followed by the resumption of normal business that evening\n4. A large armed presence with physical barriers and riot squads surrounding the Capitol<p>Obviously in retrospect we would take #4, and that’s what we’ll get for the inauguration. But #3 was obviously the second best choice on the table, and potentially the best if you want #4 to look legitimate, especially after about half a year of anti-police narrative.')
