Yet, I believe she does society a service in doing so.<p>I have yet to see anyone contradict her basic premise with factual information.  I wish she were wrong, as I would love to see a breakthrough towards an experimentally verified Grand Unified Theory, including an explanation for what we currently identify as dark matter (similarly for dark energy). From what I read, physicists that criticize her take their own wishes for reality, and prefer to attack the messenger rather than confront the reality of the message.')
