If you have 2 or 3 other axes where you cut off anybody below the median (intelligence, income, politics, interest, etc.) you&#x27;re quickly finding yourself looking only at a few percent of the population.<p>And if you have no other metrics other than attractiveness, you&#x27;ll find that few women wish to date you.')
