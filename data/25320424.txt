PQ crypto could be introduced in that way.<p>Unfortunately existing PQ signature schemes don&#x27;t have a great mix of maturity and performance that make them especially attractive absent a clear and present need.<p>For years I maintained a private patch set to introduce hash based signatures on short notice if needed.  I haven&#x27;t for a number of years now in part because there are now enough contributors I&#x27;m confident that if it were needed it could be done quickly without any special preparatory effort.<p>Users can change the rules governing their coins just by moving them.')
