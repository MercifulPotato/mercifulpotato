A Laserjet 5N that I found set out for the trash on the curb one rainy night worked like a tank for over a decade, only very rarely needing consumables, which was perfect for someone in poor grad student in expensive city mode.  When the muffin fan finally needed replacement, and I found a newer Laserjet on CraigsList.  (And I decided to part out the 5N, rather than repair, which IIRC paid for the new one.)  That CL LJ&#x27;s original toner lasted many years, and a quick tipping around of the cartridge made it last longer.  Eventually, I decided to buy a new (third-party) cartridge at the start of Covid (since I didn&#x27;t know what would happen to supply chains).<p>To that, I&#x27;d add, if you care about such things: the Ethernet-facing firmware on my current printer looked so unsettling, like it might be full of vulnerabilities and possibly a lot of malware or features I didn&#x27;t want, that I put my own print server in front of it (running on an old OpenWrt device, at the moment), and only connect the printer as USB.  I also use open source drivers without all the features and bundleware I don&#x27;t want.   When I get a chance, I want to make the print server do filtering of what can be sent to the printer, since I strongly suspect there&#x27;s some vulns there, but the current setup does block a lot of potential other headaches.  I also have some VLAN work to do on a new router.')
