Once these micro-drones can be mass produced cheaply enough, and you can put enough high-explosive on them to fly up to a person&#x27;s neck and !<i>!pop!</i>! someone&#x27;s head clean off, you&#x27;ll see them programmed with swarm behavior and be unleashed onto the battlefield.<p>They fly faster than you can run (13 miles per hour), have a 1 mile range, and a 25 minute flight time. More than enough capability to swarm entire battalions and wipe them out.')
