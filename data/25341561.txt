Dart’s nominative type system makes much of standard FP much harder than you’d imagine. I know Rust is nominal too but Rust has a lot of complexity to support these things.<p>It is very simple to add a Maybe and Either type to Dart (my code base has variants of these to deal with null issues) but imperative destructing is a pain. You can get most of the benefits of those techniques in user land without the language knowing about it, but I agree it still misses out on some stuff.<p>If Dart already had pattern matching or was willing to add it first then the ADT version could have been chosen, but without that prerequisite nullable types was the only ergonomic choice.')
