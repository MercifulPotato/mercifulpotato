Wheeler, a Boston-based white male actor<p>The fact that this framing is so normalized to just be thrown out in a mostly technical article with no other explanation is insidious and insane. There&#x27;s video of the guy right above. It&#x27;s very clear what his skin color and gender are. And it&#x27;s totally off topic.<p>At a minimum if you are going to do this, it should be done for every single person mentioned consistently. Why don&#x27;t we get Nixon&#x27;s gender and race or Francesca Panetta and Halsey Burgund genders and races? And of course when you have the choice between doing this consistently for everyone or not for anyone it becomes clear that it would be way over the top if done consistently and in reality is inappropriate in all cases.<p>It gets into Noam Chomsky&#x27;s manufacturing consent arguments in my mind. Everything is a meaningful editorial decision. This IS a political statement. By including this you are implying it would have been undescriptive and impproper not to include whereas the opposite is the case.<p>And yes, I know it&#x27;s off topic but I think it is important to call out nonsense when you see it lest it be normalized. If you want your article to be discussed instead of prompting a culture war, then don&#x27;t bait a culture war.')
