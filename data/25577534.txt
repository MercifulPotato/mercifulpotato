My neighbor has signs, I&#x27;ve petitioned Maps several times that it&#x27;s private property and nope: ignored.<p>A friend of mine just bought a property in regional Australia, and Maps wants to send anyone going to going to his place via forestry roads and then across two private properties to get there, despite having main road access.<p>Once in another part of Oz, we were sent up a cliff face, in the middle of the night, and it took an hour and a half to correct it&#x27;s mistake.<p>Every time I try and &quot;fix&quot; maps by reporting it, and very very very rarely is it fixed<p>Another property has two &quot;crown roads&quot; on it, but to all purposes, they&#x27;re very dangerous 4wd trails, again thru private property. The owner has signs, but the belligerent and unaware swear by the Goog, insisting it&#x27;s correct.<p>I prefer paper maps over the Google rubbish.')
