Infinite data composability, subject only to the constraints placed by schema authors. And namespaces are URIs, so they <i>can</i> be URLs.<p>The bad smell was mostly coming from all the things inherited from SGML - CDATA, entities etc. Although I would also add that separation into elements and attributes is not a particularly convenient way to model many things; it mixes up differences that should really be orthogonal (ordered&#x2F;unordered, atomic&#x2F;composite etc).')
