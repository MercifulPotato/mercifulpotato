The value of social media for politicians is the &quot;social&quot; part.<p>Actually no, the &quot;value&quot; in Twitter for politicians is<p>* Short succinct messages - people don&#x27;t want to read a book from their politician for every issue.  If it&#x27;s important and does need more, then they tweet the image of more text or whatever.  But most of the time a simple headline does suffice.  Otherwise twitter wouldn&#x27;t be where it is.<p>* The tweet can be linked from anywhere else on the internet, and everyone &quot;knows&quot; what it should look like and can basically distinguish reality from fake stuff<p>* Like the above, it&#x27;s uniform and simple.  Someone else commented to me that each politician has access to a website or something.  Did anyone else know this? I sure didn&#x27;t, yet I&#x27;ve seen a billion links to twitter for politicians.<p>* It would be really sad to learn that politicans are reading replies to their tweets.  I don&#x27;t know how they could get anything else done. Have you ever scanned through a twitter thread from any one of trump&#x27;s tweets? There is nothing of value, and it&#x27;s so invaluable that I bet you everyone in the world would be better off with read-only tweets from politicians!')
