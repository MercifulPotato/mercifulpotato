The primary key wasn&#x27;t wide enough, we hit 2 billion rows, and everyone panicked.<p>We had been working unwise hours for several days, and we got the fix together, and I made a mistake: I pushed it directly to production.<p>Man, my boss was really mad; no one had been getting enough sleep and we were all stressed. I apologized profusely and said it would never happen again. Fortunately, the fix was correct, so this could have been worse.<p>Ok. Do you notice what&#x27;s missing from this story?<p><i>We never addressed the flaw in our deployment which made it possible to push to prod without passing test.</i><p>Apologies are for when you harm others. Some mistakes do, and some don&#x27;t. A blanket policy that a mistake is an occasion for apology and navel-gazing is culturally harmful, because it casts mistakes as personal failings, when they are frequently the result of institutional or procedural shortcomings which can and should be addressed.')
