Put another way, while free software is good and should be encouraged when it&#x27;s practical, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right to insist that proprietary software is bad and should always be avoided. The companies that abuse the power that comes with the proprietary model are well-known (and thankfully I no longer work for one of them). But some developers of proprietary software are just trying to develop good software while making a living, the only way they&#x27;ve judged that they can.<p>Also, the hosting business model sometimes leads to misaligned incentives. I don&#x27;t believe Sourcehut falls in this category. But consider, if a developer of an open-source package makes their money from hosting, then what incentive is there to make the package easy to self-host?')
