I shouldn&#x27;t assume the systems we&#x27;ve built in USA apply to every other country.<p>It&#x27;s a rant that&#x27;s been building up in my head for a while, so I had to get it out :) You see these &quot;Bees are dying&quot; stories all the time now, and they use the same sketchy logic, and like to present the topic in a very self serving way.<p>In regards to this specific story, the article admits that sugar beets are not a flowering crop. There would be no reason for wild honey bees to travel in these fields.<p>But collateral damage from chemicals washing into waterways, or some bees flying onto the property I&#x27;m sure is a big problem. But enough to endanger the entire wild population?')
