(And make sure you don&#x27;t go the extremist route.) Keep reading, learning and working out (start with simple calisthenics f.e., then progress to weight lifting or do some other sport just make sure your body is physically active). Improve yourself as much as possible, but, again, don&#x27;t over do it.<p>Allow your mind to be occupied by something else. Reward yourself once you achieved a goal established by you. Maybe write your own To Do list. Focus on that.<p>Find balance in all things around you.<p>And if you need to look back, do it because you&#x27;re remembering a forgotten and useful lesson and not because you want to change something from your past.<p>Chin up and stay strong. You can do it. Keep going.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MjwLienADFQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MjwLienADFQ</a> (it&#x27;s a <i>metaphor</i>!)<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phoenix_(mythology)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phoenix_(mythology)</a>')
