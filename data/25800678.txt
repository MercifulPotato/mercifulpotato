I want to add something though regarding #2 - having a code review process is not enough. You need to train people how to do good reviews.<p>I’ve seen countless times people treat reviews “an approval” by both author and reviewer and for various reasons. People don’t consider it worthwhile, or they don’t want to offend, or they feel offended.<p>There is countless amounts of advice out there on how to write good code. But there is precious little on how to review code, and even less on how to write “reviewable” code, which is also a thing.<p>But if people understand the PR review process as more of a conversation, meant to align people on one direction, PRs are incredibly awesome.')
