Once your relationship has made it past the climb phase, economically speaking, you have a lot of altitude to deal with issues once you&#x27;re at cruise altitude. &quot;Growing apart&quot; and financial reasons are the top causes of divorce [1] (infidelity and addiction are still substantial but minority causes). Divorce is one of the most financially devastating events that can occur in your life (besides unexpected medical expenses), so there are incentives once you&#x27;re married and financially successful to remain married [2].<p>Commitment and &quot;sticking it out&quot; is a topic onto itself. Love is sacrifice and marriage is a (hopefully rewarding) job (personal opinion, YMMV, this paragraph comes from several years of counseling and ~15 years of marriage). You want a cofounder who is going to work on the relationship and and stick it out with you, not one who is going to bounce whenever life gets hard. Marriage is just enough friction to not leave on a whim, but not so much friction you can&#x27;t dissolve the partnership when necessary.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4012696&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4012696&#x2F;</a> (Reasons for Divorce and Recollections of Premarital Intervention: Implications for Improving Relationship Education)<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019-07-19&#x2F;divorce-destroys-finances-of-americans-over-50-studies-show" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019-07-19&#x2F;divorce-d...</a> (Divorce Destroys Finances of Americans Over 50, Studies Show)')
