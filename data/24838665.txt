Consider this IM to a friendly teammate concerning an important (but not critical) meeting:<p>&gt; did we get everything sorted out for the meeting this afternoon? we cant screw it up again<p>&gt; Did we get everything sorted out for the meeting this afternoon? We can&#x27;t screw it up again<p>&gt; Did we get everything sorted out for the meeting this afternoon? We can&#x27;t screw it up again.<p>In my world, the first two communicate pretty much the same thing. In the first example, you could probably even replace the question mark with a comma. I would likely send the second message, as I prefer descriptive, detail-adding punctuation. I would be less likely to send the third message to a young coworker because it seems standoffish.<p>Having said all that, any of the three messages would suffice. Someone mentioned elsewhere in this thread, but we - or at least the younger generation - have all become quite good at code switching. Crazy times')
