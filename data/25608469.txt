I recently got stung by someone who did a great job with a small task and billed a reasonable amount of time. Once I gave them the real work, they subcontracted it (without approval) to someone who didnâ€™t know what they were doing and billed 40 hours per week until I realized what was going on. The code was useless and Upwork basically told me to go fuck myself when I complained.<p>Fiverr is good for logo concepts if you filter out all but the top rated sellers.')
