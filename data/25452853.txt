But based on the patents, and what I&#x27;ve heard unofficially, it does support 2 simultaneous beams. The point of that isn&#x27;t to double throughput or anything like that, it&#x27;s to accomplish &quot;make before break&quot; handoff as one satellite moves towards the edge of view, and another is better.<p>Don&#x27;t know much about how they&#x27;ve set up their satellite terminals--for a typical GEO station, they&#x27;d support a huge number of static beams simultaneously to multiplex as much through the station as possible. With many birds in LEO, it&#x27;s unclear how extreme they have to get about that.')
