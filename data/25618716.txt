I actually quite like the route&#x27;s output.<p>&gt; Creating a route from markers is a nightmare of complexity.<p>Is it really so complex? Globe icon or menu -&gt; switch to cycling profile -&gt; itinerary icon -&gt; adjust start position and destination, markers are suggested when tapping on either. You can add more intermediate markers by tapping the &quot;+&quot; between source and dest.\nYou can press any part of the map -&gt; directions -&gt; add as {subsequent, first intermediate, last intermediate} destination. You can also tap existing markers to do so.<p>In my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t get much easier than this? I was so confused at google maps&#x27; interface when I was handed a phone to plan a route three days ago, it felt like it was burried down more menus, reorganizing destinations was a pain, while it&#x27;s just edit -&gt; drag and drop in OSMAnd.<p>For biking, also try brouter: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brouter.de&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brouter.de&#x2F;</a> I know it can be used with OSMAnd, but I never spent enough time to figure it out. The web version is quite good already.')
