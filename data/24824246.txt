They stay up later than they should, wake up to an alarm and then their mornings are screwed for productivity. Additionally, normal demands screw up this time of your day. Instead of working during one of your most productive periods, you&#x27;re getting ready for work, prepping the family, cooking breakfast, commuting and everything else which makes them hate mornings. They don&#x27;t realize they get two peaks in a day and they are screwing up the first one.')
