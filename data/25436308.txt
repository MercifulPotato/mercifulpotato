Said gay billionaire went on a crusade, funding a number of lawsuits against Gawker. Hulk Hogan&#x27;s was but one of them, and the former wrestler was less concerned about his body being on display than of the video evidence of him calling his daughter&#x27;s black boyfriend a &quot;fucking nigger&quot; (and before anyone flags me for that word, I use it purposely to drive home the point of which issue Hogan was likely most worried about, by way of their relative responses to that phrase vs the mental image of Hogan&#x27;s phallus).<p>It should be noted that this billionaire none other than Peter Thiel, who was at one point, after this debacle, affiliated with Y Combinator. To speak to one of the higher up comments questioning the rise of authoritarianism on HN: here you have an example of two public individuals who HN readers are likely to side, or at least identify, with versus a quasi-journalistic entity.')
