The RAT has gained popularity in recent years over the Lean MVP.<p>The RAT is really important in areas like Healthcare that require a lot of monetary investment to build an MVP.  In my experience, the hardest part about the RAT from the technical side is convincing people before building that their MVP assumptions or technical understanding may be wrong.  Technical RAT only works if estimates are trusted and management isn&#x27;t overriding technical judgement.<p>Whether it&#x27;s RAT or MVP, the most important priorities are still talking to users and working from solid data, to avoid leaning on assumptions.')
