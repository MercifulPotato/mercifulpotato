It was a mess and had to have emergency surgery to put it all back together. After surgery I&#x27;m sent home with a &quot;ball&quot; around my neck that is a reservoir for some pain meds that are being fed into my body via a catheter that was threaded into a vein in my neck.  So I am sitting on my recliner a few hours after the surgery , awake but groggy.  Anesthesiologist calls me on my cell phone to check in on me. So the pain med ball has a valve on it calibrated from 1 to 10. It&#x27;s on like 9.  He asks me how the pain level is. I say &quot;no pain&quot;. He say&#x27;s &quot;great, what&#x27;s the setting our your valve&quot; I say 9. He says &quot;whoa! you need to turn that down! At that level it will be used up in about 10 hours and you need it last for at least 48 hours&quot; I say &quot;okay.&quot; He then hangs up. So being a groggy engineer, I think &quot;okay, I will dial it down to like 2 and then as pain arrives adjust up to needed level&quot; So I turn it down to 2.  About 45 minutes later I am in the most excruciating pain I have ever experienced.  Think teeth clenching. Sweating. Tears. I immediately turn the dial up to 10.  The pain lasted for 2 hours. I&#x27;m an atheist, but let me tell you I was coming to Jesus in those two hours. Once the pain subsided, I call him back. He says &quot;Oh yeah, you should have slowly backed down on the dial.&quot; Upside is that I have a lot of empathy for folks who say they are in pain.  Seriously, if that pain had continued I would have taken anything, Heroin, whatever!!!')
