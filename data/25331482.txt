Taht&#x27;s 11,500 people per square mile<p>Are you really suggesting that 7% of Chicago&#x27;s entire land area be given away for free to car owners -- because if everyone owned one car you&#x27;d need 1.7 million square feet to park them. That&#x27;s in addition to the space used for those cars to move around which is at least as much.<p>If you don&#x27;t own a car, how can you claim your free space?')
