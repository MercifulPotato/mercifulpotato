That&#x27;s what I was given for my colonoscopy. Totally knocked out, and when I opened my eyes again it was all over.<p>Side note: I was never warned about a particular effect of propofol. They started pumping it in and told me to count down from 10. At about 5, I suddenly felt this <i>horrible</i> searing, burning pain in my IV-connected arm that I felt spreading throughout my body. Thinking something was terribly wrong, I opened my mouth to say I&#x27;m feeling awful pain, but by then I was already falling unconscious. So I only consciously felt the pain for a few seconds, feeling totally fine (besides grogginess) when I woke up, but it was panic-inducing and some of the worst pain I&#x27;ve felt.<p>Apparently it&#x27;s pretty common for propofol. I think they might have told me I might feel a little discomfort, but they didn&#x27;t mention the possibility of sudden, dramatic pain, for some reason. I could&#x27;ve grit my teeth through those seconds if I knew it was possibly going to happen, but I feared that I was having an unexpected severe allergic reaction or something, so I spent those few seconds absolutely terrified.')
