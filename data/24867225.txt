I was a naive post-doc and wanted an academic job, but soon realised that it wasn&#x27;t going to happen without years of hanging round in crappy roles. So I got out and didn&#x27;t look back. I can assure you, there are plenty of &quot;normal&quot; jobs out there where people _will_ care about your PhD and the skills you learned while getting it.')
