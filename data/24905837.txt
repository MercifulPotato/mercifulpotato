It&#x27;d use a search engine such as Google Images to download pictures and blend them with each other. The result was a unique, colorful experience which was unique every time, where you could look into and try to figure out what is included (it had a NSFW filter, and also allowed you to include search words). You could save the result to a lossy format, but you could also edit the canvas to remove pictures it found. IIRC it was made by a NullSoft employee who also worked on other visualization plugins in WinAmp (unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a link!). I used it in the early &#x27;00s, though it was Windows only. I don&#x27;t remember if I got it to work on Wine.<p>Nowadays I have Bing Wallpaper on most of my machines. Every day I get a curated, unique wallpaper of the day (the Bing background of the day). Sometimes I like it, sometimes not. No matter which machine I&#x27;m on though, the wallpaper is the same for every machine. I&#x27;m not a Bing user other than that but I love this Bing feature!<p>[EDIT]I found it!
