Can I rephrase to make sure I understand?<p>What you&#x27;re saying is that; due to debt issuance in the US, it&#x27;s hard for commodities and consumer goods to be priced efficiently. I interpret &quot;confusing price signals&quot; to mean that e.g. Apple can charge $1k for an iPhone and sell out to families who wouldn&#x27;t typically be able to afford it, but the price of bread remains the same. Your medical bill comment -- you&#x27;re basically saying that when one of these families hits a statistically predictable snag, they&#x27;re instantly bankrupt because they&#x27;ve always been functionally broke, propped up by the consumer debt industry?<p>And so you&#x27;re saying that most commodity goods face deflationary pressure as a means to stabilize the market? So <i>if</i> the price of commodity goods <i>does</i> increase significantly beyond the capacity of debt issuance, we&#x27;re likely to see a depression?')
