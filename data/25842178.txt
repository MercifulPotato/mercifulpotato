In pricing, there’s a real advantage to being small: prices are often artificially low at low volume to promote lock in. Then they gouge you in the middle. Then at the high end, they have to stop gouging you because you know that they know that you know you could go elsewhere for your volume.<p>For example, AWS free tier is a great bargain. AWS is a terrible value once you’re paying the price of a bare metal box each year (or sooner!), but then at Netflix scale it balances out again because Amazon knows that Netflix could easily talk Microsoft into doing the port themselves if it would actually make financial sense.<p>Most pricing is S-shaped, so it typically is best to be in the position of exploiting a loss leader or running at scale.')
