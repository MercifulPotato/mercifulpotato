We already know that a ^ a = 0, a ^ 0 = a, and a ^ (b ^ c) = (a ^ b) ^ c, so we must have a ^ b = 0 only when a = b. Therefore in the C convention where 0 means false, a ^ b = not (a = b) = (a!=b) (this equality only holds for expressions that are going straight into a Boolean operation (or test in eg an if statement), as a!=b should always evaluate to 0 or 1.<p>The compiler may use this by xoring a and b and then jumping if the zero flag was set.')
