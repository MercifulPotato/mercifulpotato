Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603829496, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24910816, text='If you look at a graph of music industry revenue, it peaks in 2000, collapses until 2015 (at ½-⅓ its peak value), and has been on a strong uptick since then. Peak apoplexy about the impact of piracy was around 2005, and there was a strong desire to tie the collapse in revenue directly to piracy.<p>From what I can tell, most of the studies establishing a clear economic cost to piracy tend to rely on numbers originating from the music industry without clear attribution to data, or by naïve analyses estimating that 1 download = X lost sales, without considering effects like budgetary limits (I&#x27;ll spend at most $X on entertainment this year) or conversions to profitable sales.<p>Additionally, there&#x27;s a lot fewer studies on piracy post-revenue nadir. It seems as if the rise of streaming has caused the industry to stop panicking so much about piracy, and there&#x27;s some evidence that streaming has converted consumers to paying customers.<p>All-in-all, I would say that it&#x27;s not so much that piracy hurt the industry as piracy filled the existence of a market segment that the industry refused to fill. Piracy only hurt the industry in the same way digital cameras hurt Kodak: the existing business model was unsustainable, but they refused to pivot to take advantage of the clear coming shift in the business model.')
