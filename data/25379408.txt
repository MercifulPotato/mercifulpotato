The original obj-c app was built with under 10 iOS engineers in mind, and now Uber had 100s of mobile engineers work on one app in some form or another.<p>We didn&#x27;t do a simple build scalability test until we were well into the project.  If we did it would of revealed swift&#x27;s build problems to us.   Our swift experience is what slowed down our kotlin migration significantly.  Today Uber android is still a majority Java app.<p>Even very recently the experience of working in swift compared to the old obj-c code base isn&#x27;t as good.  To this day there are debugger issues, xcode responsiveness issues and a slower build time.<p>Hiring on the other hand would be harder now, because it&#x27;s getting hard to find people who know Objective-C and it&#x27;s surface ugliness scares new people away.  Swift is a decent language if you don&#x27;t have to have a very large code base, so most people rightfully so don&#x27;t have that much Objective-C, and if you were to work in Obj-C, you might as well go work at Facebook then.')
