All sorts of weird subtle bugs relating to the very fundamental UI interactions that make the whole experience very frustrating. The main one I remember is that certain buttons in the UI are simply unreliable - depending on what processing is going on (sometimes if nothing heavy is being processed), certain buttons in the UI will not respond when clicked. I used IDEA for years and very often had to click a button 4-5 times until it would activate, especially while using the debugger.<p>If the UI toolkit can&#x27;t get a button right, it is completely broken IMO. Even including intelliJ products, I have never used a Java GUI which was good.')
