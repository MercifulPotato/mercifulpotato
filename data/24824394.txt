To have consistent good mornings, you need to be going to sleep at exactly the same time every night. You then develop a pattern where you get tired, sleep and wake up at the same time every day. This assumes that you don&#x27;t have issues which get in the way of this (sleeping disorders, etc.) If you don&#x27;t want to go to bed, then you&#x27;re probably not hitting the sack at the same time every day. Pandemic doesn&#x27;t change this as you could be doing the same browsing HN late at night rather than partying. Also, alcohol will really screw this up as well.')
