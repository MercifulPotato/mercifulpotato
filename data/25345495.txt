However, patients &gt;80 yrs who were attending in person were identified as eligible for the vaccine.  They have attended elsewhere in the hospital to receive the vaccine, but my understanding is that it needs -80&#x2F;70 for storage, and can be moved a total of 4 times before needing to be discarded.  I&#x27;m afraid I do not know more.  Maybe if I wasn&#x27;t so busy in the clinic I would have read through the info sheets in more detail, but it&#x27;s always a rush!')
