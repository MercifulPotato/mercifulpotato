The product went downhill abruptly around that time, I still keep it around as an extra debit account so I get some ongoing visibility to the spiral. I have to call a special support number printed on my card, newer customers called the one on the website. The oft-promised chip supporting GoBank card still has not arrived for me, today, in 2020, despite their support promising me literally years ago it would be available in a month. It doesn&#x27;t work with Apple Pay.<p>The app, which when they launched was one of the first decent bank apps, simply has disabled its most compelling features. You used to be able to peek your balance without signing in, the slider is still there but it doesn&#x27;t do anything. Fortunately most other mainstream banks have great apps these days.<p>The app still lacks FaceID support. You can use FaceID only through the Apple autofill keyring.<p>And as I just Googled them to make this post, I see there will never be a chip card at all because GoBank doesn&#x27;t offer a debit card anymore. Apparently GreenDot is powering payments at Uber and Apple Pay P2P now though, so good for them.')
