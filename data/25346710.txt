I also don&#x27;t really see men in general trying to fit any model.<p>Australia started a war against Emus...<p>... and lost. I don&#x27;t see it as emasculating, but I still laugh about it and I am solidly on Team Emu.<p>&gt; there is pressure on men to live up to traditional masculine stereotypes<p>No, not really. Maybe I am oblivious to it, but that would be the same as no pressure, wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>And I think there is merit not in classical roles, but in knowledge about family relationships. Men raised by single mothers or without a male parent will have difficulties to cut ties to start their own lives. Mothers have difficulties to let them and sons might feel guilty to leave and neglect themselves. That can happen with genders completely mixed up, but it is common in this constellation. This is such a common occurrence it isn&#x27;t even funny anymore.<p>&gt; Yet, they also had the highest levels of endorsement of men&#x27;s use of violence, homophobia, breadwinner roles and men&#x27;s patriarchal power and control in relationships.<p>No wonder, maybe because you try to gaslight them with your shit about gender roles. Get your shit together, women.')
