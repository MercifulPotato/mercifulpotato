We are quickly embracing digital alternatives because they are more efficient and easy to use.<p>Bullshit.  After trying all kinds of &quot;digital alternatives&quot; for note-taking, I went back to pen-and-paper.  As a tool, it&#x27;s more flexible, balanced, and easy-to-use than alternatives.  Plus, hand-creating a physical artifact allows one to utilize natural memory for manipulating physical objects (e.g. remembering the information I need is &quot;on the bottom-half of a page roughly in X location, next to a diagram of Y&quot;).<p>Digital technologies are unbalanced tools optimized to favor a particular use case (e.g. fast entry of <i>only text</i>, bulk reproduction, fast transmission, etc.) at the expense of others (e.g. tool-weight, complexity, overstrict schemas, difficulty composing different types of things).')
