If you&#x27;re fast enough, cars won&#x27;t needlessly overtake you (in rush hour, most car traffic may not exeed 30 km&#x2F;h for example due to roads being packed too full, that&#x27;s easy to match for a trained cyclist).<p>Also at intersections, being really quick at acceleration allows you to get out of the danger zone of cars crossing your path before there&#x27;s a conflict.  Think about right-turning trucks starting after a red traffic light.<p>I think fitness (and maybe reaction time) is some reason why severe cycling accidents seem to happen to older cyclist at a higher rate.  In Berlin out of 15 cycling deaths this year, more than half of them are age 60 and higher [1], 3 are beyond 80 years of age.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adfc-berlin.de&#x2F;radverkehr&#x2F;sicherheit&#x2F;information-und-analyse&#x2F;145-unfallorte&#x2F;782-getoetete-radfahrende-2020.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adfc-berlin.de&#x2F;radverkehr&#x2F;sicherheit&#x2F;information-und...</a>')
