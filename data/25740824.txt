Eg quoting from the <i>Discussion</i> section of his thesis:<p>&gt; [I]t seems to us to be much easier to understand particle aspects from a wave picture (concentrated wave packets) than it is to understand wave aspects (diffraction, interference, etc.) from a particle picture.<p>or<p>&gt; This view [ie Everett&#x27;s view, as described in the thesis] also corresponds most closely with that held by Schr√∂dinger.<p>The main point of MWI is not to go back to a more classical picture of point particles, but to remove wave-function collapse and Heisenberg cut from the description.')
