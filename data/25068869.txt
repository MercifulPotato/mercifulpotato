While I&#x27;d agree with the sibling reply that people often don&#x27;t consider long terms effects, it&#x27;s worth considering that immediate effects are more definite.<p>Any mac user could have seen this transition coming many years ago, and given up their platform of choice then on that prospect, but what good would that have done them? They wouldn&#x27;t have got to enjoy anything.<p>Lastly, I do simply see it as a bit of a false dichotomy (or whichever fallacy is more accurate) to suggest that by using a mac that can&#x27;t run other operating systems, you&#x27;re giving up computing freedom. If I found it necessary to have a Windows or Linux machine, I&#x27;d simply just go get something that probably has better hardware support anyway. Yes conceivably Apple is setting some precedent that other manufacturers could follow, but in the previous example Apple is also just pushing you to buy their products instead.')
