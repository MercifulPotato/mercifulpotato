He&#x27;s on team New York Times, &quot;knows&quot; the Koch brothers are Satan incarnate, &quot;knows&quot; Trump owes Russian oligarchs money, etc.<p>It just didn&#x27;t register that the AMA is the sixth-biggest spending organization on DC lobbying [1], right behind Blue Cross Blue Shield (an insurer) and the American Hospital Association.<p>People worry about the NRA and all kinds of other stuff. They should really get mad about how outrageously the medical industry lobbies (as do the realtors), and how much they&#x27;ve managed to extract from ordinary Americans. It&#x27;s an utter coup of PR that people aren&#x27;t rioting in the streets about this. Everything about the medical industry -- licensing, high physician salaries, etc. is rigged to be good for insiders.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;federal-lobbying&#x2F;top-spenders" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;federal-lobbying&#x2F;top-spenders</a>')
