With megacorps in question routinely spending billions on frivolous stuff, they should have instead equipped the local OSM communities with gear to take 360 photos and GPS loggers to enable those on the ground to survey their local areas.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Armchair_mapping" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Armchair_mapping</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;viewforum.php?id=46" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;viewforum.php?id=46</a> (AFAIR many of people posting here are Western immigrants to Thailand, so take correction for that).')
