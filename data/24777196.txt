Item(by='aswihart', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602687380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24776916, text='- don&#x27;t talk over women in meetings\n- don&#x27;t ask women to do informal &quot;secretarial work&quot; for the group, e.g. note-taking, summarizing meetings, ordering the Christmas cards, buying birthday presents, ordering furniture\n- don&#x27;t expect all women to have the same personality (warm, bubbly, cold, bitchy, etc.) \n- don&#x27;t say dumb shit about maternity leave (the day I came back from maternity leave, my boss told me he wished he had been on &quot;vacation&quot; for 3 months)\n- hire men too for traditionally &quot;women-dominated&quot; roles, e.g. office manager, customer support, chief of staff, HR. Show that gender balance cuts both ways.\n- don&#x27;t make assumptions for women with kids (oh, you probably can&#x27;t come to that happy hour, etc.) that you wouldn&#x27;t make for men with kids<p>I personally think on-campus recruiting is a great way to get young women into tech. I loved mentoring the young women we hired, managing them, promoting them, etc. (before I left to found my own company).')
