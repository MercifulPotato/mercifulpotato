Also I recognize almost nothing in their list of All Artists on the IA.[2]<p>SugarMegs[0] has an amazing collection of bootlegs. Be prepared to spend days there! It seems to be mostly rock, but also there&#x27;s a lot of funk, jazz and who knows what else there, from 1930s to present day. e.g. Hundreds of Hendrix gigs. Hundreds of Miles, Coltrane, Keith Jarrett gigs.<p>Also, everything has a setlist page with tunes, musicians, sometimes the story of the gig etc, which is nice. They appreciate it if you can fill in unknown tunes, fix incorrect details etc. Send them the corrected HTML setlist pages. I started doing that because I felt I owed them so much.<p>Sound quality varies.. it&#x27;s lossy too, but the music comes from DIME[1], a private torrent site you can join free and download highest possible quality audio <i>and video</i>. (SugarMegs is audio only). It seems they remove anything that&#x27;s commercially available from their site, and respect some musicians&#x27; wishes to not have their bootlegs distributed anywhere.<p>[0] search page: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tela.sugarmegs.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tela.sugarmegs.org&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dimeadozen.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dimeadozen.org&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;browse.php?collection=etree&amp;field=creator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;browse.php?collection=etree&amp;field=creato...</a>')
