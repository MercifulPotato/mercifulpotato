The real story we&#x27;ve been witnessing for decades now is how little people care about labor rights abuses (particularly if they happen overseas). This isn&#x27;t the first time child labor has been linked to Apple and I&#x27;d be really surprised if it&#x27;s the last. The headline should read &quot;Consumers of Apple Products Knew About Labor Abuses for Years and Still Buy Their Products&quot;. Thats essentially why it took three years to cut ties--because no one cares (above social media finger waving).')
