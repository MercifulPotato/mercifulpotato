But the mirrors on a car are mandated by law, so the equivalent for that would be a missing Cancel button (which forces you to always open a file). If I had to pick a car part equivalent to the file thumbnails, it would probably be seat heating or a built-in navigation system - it&#x27;s nice to have (for some, others never use it), but you can use the car without problems if it&#x27;s broken or not installed.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s not a nice feature to have, but it&#x27;s also definitely non-trivial - it&#x27;s not only thumbnails for images, if you do that people will also demand thumbnails for videos (including, of course, all ancient formats), PDF files, Word&#x2F;Excel&#x2F;PowerPoint documents, HTML pages etc. etc. etc.')
