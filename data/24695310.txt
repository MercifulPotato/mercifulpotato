Chrome absolutely SUCKS at displaying SVGs. I rarely use them and I&#x27;ve already found two stupid bugs.<p>One super weird one (probably too much caching) where an animated element in a &lt;use&gt; clone didn&#x27;t inherit colours while its non-animated siblings do. This one is fixed now.<p>What isn&#x27;t fixed yet is that `filter: hue-rotate(90deg)` applied to an SVG child element doesn&#x27;t do anything (in firefox it does), is a pain in the ass because SVG filters, while more powerful, are much harder to set up.')
