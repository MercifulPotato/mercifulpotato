Lua also does this well.<p>This is the oft-overlooked embedding case which can be difficult in other languages (compared to the normal case where you start out in language X and need to call into a C function to do something low level).  For example in Python the embedding case is tricky and lightly documented, and with only a semi-stable API which has changed under us a few times.<p>In nbdkit we do a lot of language embedding (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;libguestfs&#x2F;nbdkit&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;plugins" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;libguestfs&#x2F;nbdkit&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;plugins</a>) including Tcl, Lua, Python and many others.')
