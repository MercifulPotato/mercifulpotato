I lived a relatively healthy, &quot;normal&quot; life until I woke with extreme joint pain one day. The diagnosis rocked my world.  I went (and am going) through the usual stages of grief.  Before I was diagnosed but after the symptoms appeared I went to a bad place.  After diagnosis I still mourn for my old life.  When I have a &quot;flare&quot; (joint pain) I dive into depression, not knowing if my medication has stopped working, my condition has gotten worse or some other factor (diet, stress etc.)<p>I think about my disease every. single. day.   I worry about my kids, and my wife.  I don&#x27;t want to be a burden to them, and I don&#x27;t want my kids to have this horrible disease passed to them (there&#x27;s a genetic factor). I worry about my future.  When the pain is bad I have a hard time working (typing, using the mouse, sitting etc.) which has me thinking about what happens when I can&#x27;t work at all.<p>I could write a novel, but I just wanted to say that in a nutshell ... life goes on.  I now have a greater sense of empathy for others dealing with pain, and also realize that even your loved ones can&#x27;t fully understand your pain - it&#x27;s yours, and yours alone to bear.')
