But then they don&#x27;t want to see bank runs where people convert all their commercial bank deposits into digital Euro, so they&#x27;ll put a limit on the amount you can hold. So this can&#x27;t really be used as a safer alternative for bank deposits at scale.<p>Another advantage I expected would be the elimination of the need for settlement for digital euro transactions. But then they talk about a system of intermediaries who manage the system and who would still have some form of settlement between them?<p>There would also be a system of onboarding much like for a regular bank account (not anonymous), restrictions on foreigners to limit use as an investment vehicle etc.')
