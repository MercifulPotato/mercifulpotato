That’s 1 in 200, so it’s not huge, sure- but if you gave me the choice between running that risk or taking a shot, I know which <i>I</i> would go for.  It would even be too high a price for a night out with my friends.<p>Like, a 1-in-200 chance of losing all the hopes you had for your life and instead dying an agonizing death in some overcrowded ICU, doesn’t sound like it should be treated lightly.')
