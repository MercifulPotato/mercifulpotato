Do they gain something from all of that effort? A more genetically diverse mating pool?<p>Or could it be that it is worse, but they are stuck in a <i>nash equilibrium</i> where any single deviant would be worse off, so there is no viable path to better behavior.<p>Or is it their behavior suboptimal, even for the individual, but remains because so much is built on top of it that it would be hard to &quot;refactor&quot; the genome to remove the assumptions of a journey?')
