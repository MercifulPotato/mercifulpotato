Science is generally about testability, right? If math isn&#x27;t science, it&#x27;s still extremely useful, and a valid, rigorous field in itself. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so easy though. If anything, it seems like in software engineering, you come up with a &quot;model&quot; of how it ought to be done, and then see if that actually works in the real world. Food for thought :D')
