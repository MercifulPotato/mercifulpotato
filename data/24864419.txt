But if you wanted to own the market this was an ok attempt.<p>One of the reasons many people doubted Quibi is because short-form content is something Netflix and Hulu have already experimented with.<p>The idea is like crack to product folks - habit forming! make the user get used to opening up the app every day! - but nobody has ever really made it stick for Hollywood-style or even just &quot;a bit more premium than Youtube&quot; content that requires a subscription.<p>Quibi to me looked like &quot;Vessel&#x2F;Go90, but with spending way more money&quot; and that was a dubious proposition.<p>(And this was said by many people in threads before Quibi even launched, so...)')
