It&#x27;s reassuring when I can see whether the author is capable of cooking, and whether the result looks appetizing (to me subjectively).<p>For instance, I&#x27;ve found that Jamie Oliver, despite his big names, makes food that doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. If I only read the recipe, I might not figure that out. But watching him cook and seeing the product, I&#x27;m pretty confident that I won&#x27;t like it.')
