And different languages have different and somewhat incompatible support for datetimes.<p>And, worse, people want different behavior for invalid datetimes.<p>So your parser either balloons in size and requirements and its test-suite or restricts it to a handful of cases, at which point for most users, your datetime type is useless.<p>This is why if you have a protocol like JSON that allows you to construct arbitrary types or simply parse strings, you let users figure out how to handle it.')
