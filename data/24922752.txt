Retailer does not want to deal with that much volatility in price as customers would demand refunds, so it is left to the scalpers to take on the supply risk. It is surprising that the retail version of the cards are available upon release as is and not dedicated for a period of time to OEMs - Apple, Alienware, etc. (volume customers) negotiated for guaranteed supply at premium rates.')
