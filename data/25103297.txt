Why are you telling me something I never said? I believe you are utterly mistaken to believe that I hold this opinion.<p>&gt;If you really need an IDE, just use one.\n&gt;I donâ€™t see any point in that.<p>You don&#x27;t see the point because you completely missed the point.<p>I want an IDE that is as lightweight as vim&#x2F;emacs and as powerful as a Jetbrains IDE and lives on the console.<p>So right now if I &quot;just use&quot; an IDE it&#x27;s not lightweight as it likely runs on the JVM, I can&#x27;t fire it up on a console when I&#x27;m ssh-ed into a server.<p>If I fire vim up on a server I can&#x27;t get any code highlighting or code following or integrated graphical debugging without a lot of yak-shaving and even after I do the yak-shaving it&#x27;s still not done as well.<p>I want both on one app. Now you may not like this idea, you may be opposed to it. But this is what I&#x27;m asking for and this is my opinion. I respect your opinion but please don&#x27;t tell me to &quot;just use&quot; an IDE when that is not the topic of the conversation.')
