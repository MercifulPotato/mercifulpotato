When looking back and depending on what you already know these insights have either been chewed upon for a long time and aren&#x27;t that fresh any more or are still quite interesting. Thanks for the short summary of something, which is rather common knowledge today in our circle and thus makes perfect sense to wrap up in a short sentence instead of going into the full length article. Though it is also about opportunity and where I live (somewhere in Europe) there mostly is only the chance to work a decent job and paradoxically with that keep &quot;the old big industry further afloat&quot; - sideways and to the right on a high level (stock &#x2F; revenue), locking everyone in this world and maybe&#x2F;probably watching Silicon Valley disrupt it.')
