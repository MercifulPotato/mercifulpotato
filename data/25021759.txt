Like when he called Mexicans rapists&#x2F;murderers&#x2F;drug dealers, or when he made fun of a disabled reporter, or said a women was too ugly to rape.  Trump is just a horrible person. I&#x27;m German, a and left wing European.(I used to live in the US also).  I don&#x27;t like democrats politically. But if I could have, I would&#x27;ve voted for them as I view them not as destructive as republicans. But, even if Trump was as left as Sanders, one of the few American politicians I actually like, I wouldn&#x27;t vote for him.')
