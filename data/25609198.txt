This is the benefit of using a large and well built wood furnace.  Also all of the wood I use is dry which not only reduces the amount of bad stuff that gets into the air it also increases the usable heat from the wood.<p>I also live in a very rural area on a 1 hectare lot surrounded by other 1 and 2 hectare lots.  I would not want to run this in a typical suburb and I agree with most the other comments that wood burning really shouldn&#x27;t be a thing in densely populated areas.<p>Unfortunately for me my only other real option is electricity which can be relatively intermittent where I am and also expensive.  It would end up costing $700-$1000 extra during winter months. I&#x27;m heating two homes with it.  A newer one with walls at an R40+ rating and an older one with walls at a recently upgraded from nothing to an R20 rating.
