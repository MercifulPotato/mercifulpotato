Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=[24674095, 24677267], score=None, time=1601750950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24673650, text='&gt; If mjw1007 reports a bug in a piece of software that mjw1007 doesn&#x27;t even use<p>Given the burden on upstream maintainers, probably mjw1007 should have included a crucial bit of information in the bug report: That they are not using the software any more, this is just to report a known bug they encountered before.<p>I&#x27;d say at least half of my bug reports are for things where I&#x27;ve already found a workaround for my situation, or I&#x27;m not using the software any more.<p>Those bug reports are a burden to create, because I don&#x27;t get anything directly useful from doing so, and I usually take care to show how to reproduce the bug, ideally with a minimal reproducer, which sometimes takes hours.<p>If the problem upstream gets solved, it&#x27;s nice to know I contributed a little civic duty, but I won&#x27;t likely need the fix.<p>But I know what it&#x27;s like to be on the receiving end of reports.  So as a reporter, it&#x27;s on me to not waste the upstream maintainer&#x27;s time, by making it clear this is just an informational bug report.  After all it&#x27;s more burdensome for them than it is for me.<p>If they report back, as many do, asking if can try X, Y and Z, I may have to apologise and politely say I&#x27;m not using it any more.  Ideally I already mentioned that, but upstream might not have noticed the first time.<p>If upstream says they can&#x27;t help me or fix the bug without further input from me, it would silly for me to become infuriated because my effort seems wasted.  <i>That&#x27;s on me</i>.<p>When I contribute a bug report freely as a sort of civic contribution, it&#x27;s not reasonable to expect upstream to do anything in particular with it if I&#x27;m not willing to help as well.  It has to be given freely with no expectation on my part, because they haven&#x27;t promised anything.<p>If I&#x27;m <i>infuriated</i> that the maintainer responds as if I want something from them, and I didn&#x27;t bother to clarify that I don&#x27;t, then ironically that means I <i>do</i> want something from them, which is to read my mind and magically guess what I do and don&#x27;t want, or alternatively to avoid assuming, spend an extra round trip asking what I was too lazy to say up front.')
