I&#x27;ve heard auto manufacturers have notoriously low margins, but in reality they seem just as fine as any other business.<p>That being said, those same margins are not at all within the realm of what Apple current enjoys. That all means unless some further accounting engineering goes on, it spells a less attractive future for Apple in terms of overall margins, but one would hope a better future in terms of free cash flow. Apple already obscures some details from shareholders in ways that I find less than scrupulous.')
