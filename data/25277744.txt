However, the claim is wildly simplistic. We get tons of different micronutrients from tons of sources. If OP were correct, vegans wouldn&#x27;t be able to survive. Vegetarians wouldn&#x27;t be able to survive.<p>Basically everything we need in terms of nutrients (micro and macro) can be found in non-meat food products. Wherever a non-meat diet falls short of the needed micronutrients, multivitamins can be added to make up any deficiencies. Again, see vegans.<p>Finally, lab grown meat IS meat. Our bodies can break down and harvest any micronutrients grown into the meat. Furthermore, as developments are made, it&#x27;s naive to assume the companies producing the lab grown meat won&#x27;t attempt to add anything important which might be missing.<p>There&#x27;s also precedent in the food industry for adding nutrients to food staples - white rice in America is legally required to be enriched. This point also confirms OPs concern is worth thinking about to begin with - the rice nutrient deficiency has caused epidemics in Asia. However, this problem has largely been solved.<p>Finally, OPs rant seems to start from an adversarial position. The arguments put forward seem to be in bad faith, as they are mostly distilled with minor research on lab-grown meat.')
