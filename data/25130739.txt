My daughter spent 8 weeks in the hospital but only on the day we bought her home did I finally have the realisation that she is utterly and completely reliant on me and my wife. That was the moment that something changed in me. It was possibly also delayed as the pandemic caused hospital to severely limit visiting time for dads.')
