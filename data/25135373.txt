It only takes one extra click to read.<p>I assume that you&#x27;re aware of the HN setting that allows you to see dead posts. I assume that you&#x27;re aware that clicking on the time of a downvoted post makes it completely visible.<p>However, once a post is flagged or dead or the user is banned, it&#x27;s not possible to reply to a post.
