You could use buffers for each element to avoid some of it, but then you may have to update several buffers for various changes.<p>If you have elements that are updated a thousand times per frame (progress bars) do you update the whole element every time, only update the affected region of it on every change or try to somehow collect changes that might affect different parts of it for a single update operation?')
