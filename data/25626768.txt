Including infamously using &quot;reserved for future use&quot; areas of bitfields, which for example caused a lot of app crashes during early days of Windows 95 (where certain common API gained a new flag that was not compatible with previous flags, which worked fine so long as you didn&#x27;t set them concurrently - which all properly written applications avoided.)')
