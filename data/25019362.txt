It turned out more people hated Trump as a president than liking his presidency, and Trump supporters should accept such choice.<p>I weigh more on the culture side, and I&#x27;m abhorred that institutions can blatantly teach racism like critical race theory, which discriminates an entire race. I don&#x27;t believe ACAB. I&#x27;m disgusted that Pelosi thinks that people can topple statues if they want, and AOC says &quot;Is anyone archiving these Trump sycophants for when they try to downplay or deny their complicity in the future? &quot;, and the media kept spreading hoaxes like &quot;fine people on both sides&quot;. I certainly don&#x27;t agree that different political views should be moralized. Well, none that that matters now, I guess. American people have decided that left view is what they want, and we should respect and accept the decision.')
