I see the opposite with with some engineers who always have this illusion that the first or even second version of their project will be the final one for all times so they build it to scale (which actually doesn&#x27;t even really scale because they don&#x27;t know where the real bottlenecks are) and highly configurable. I&#x27;ve seen way, way more projects bite the dust because of poor product design or product market fit than the inability to scale.  I&#x27;ve definitely seen projects that can&#x27;t scale but at least from an engineering point of view, those problems are way more tractable than people not wanting or needing what you&#x27;ve created.  As I&#x27;ve gotten more experienced, I&#x27;ve realized one of the great skills a good engineer has is the ability to change&#x2F;fix&#x2F;scale a project once it is up and running and while people are using it.')
