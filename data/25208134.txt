Maybe in 2000.<p>2) Those numbers for EU are incorrect. Look at Stockholm for one. It is at a minimum 2x too low. Even Denmark which is in top is too low. I live in Denmark and even if I pick cable the lowest I can even order is 300Mbit&#x2F;s. But that would just be stupidity since I can just click on Fiber and get 1&#x2F;1Gbit&#x2F;s for US$45.')
