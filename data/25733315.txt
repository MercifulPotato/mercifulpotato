It&#x27;s impossible for people to change their race, and our society has agreed that we shouldn&#x27;t force people to change their religion.<p>Political beliefs are not protected classes. When your political beliefs include inciting violence by spreading unfounded conspiracy theories, then private companies have a right to kick you off.<p>&gt; Certainly all the tech companies banding together to silence politics they don&#x27;t like plays exactly into the narrative the far right is pushing.<p>In my opinion, the far right is already too far gone — they are already conspiracy theorists. Any contradictory information will be used as evidence to show that the conspiracy is much wider and bigger than one could have imagined — adding to the weight of the theory. There is no reasoning with them unless someone they truly believe (read: Trump) dismisses the theory convincingly.')
