As cool as this technology is, a lot of these images seem to draw on pedophillia and sexualizing children. This is an example of a &quot;neutral&quot; training set with results that I wouldn&#x27;t want to use to represent the entire genre.<p>I have no idea if this comment is off limits for HN. I&#x27;m surprised to see no one else voicing their discomfort with the results of this StyleGAN output.')
