While you’re disconnecting the water supply, your onions are burning, but just as you get back to them, the power goes out, and you have to go investigate. You come back an hour later, and resume cooking, when somebody knocks on the door, wanting to know how many squirrels can fit in a party balloon. You respond, go back to your onions, but the pan has inexplicably broken in two while you had your back turned. You get a new pan, and then you realise you are out of onions, and it’s 2am, and you go to bed, feeling you’ve accomplished nothing.<p>Most context switching isn’t voluntary, and isn’t controllable.')
