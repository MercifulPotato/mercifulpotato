Just look at my &quot;Promotions&quot; tab in gmail. 1000 unread.<p>I believe one of the reasons this happens is limited trigger types for email sequences and even more limited support for customizable content in the email (I know Mailchimp does this). Because of that you are left with primitive trigger types like time than something more granular like trigger based on user app activity.<p>By bringing the automations closer to the application source code, I believe you can build in &quot;engagement&quot; and &quot;rentention&quot; mechanisms that don&#x27;t suck.')
