When asked why they want to use elasticsearch over RMDB is it because they wanted Trie over B+tree? They didn&#x27;t understand. Also the use cases almost always relational. Postgres have good enough FTS actually if anything elasticsearch is almost always a complement database not a replacement to RMDB.')
