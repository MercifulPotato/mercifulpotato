I haven&#x27;t seen this idea out in the world much, but a book called &quot;Object Oriented Ontology: A New Theory of Everything&quot; kinda runs at this from a neat science-rooted philosophy perspective. It basically says that any philosophical framework needs to have just as much to say about fictional beings as it does physical, since fictional constructs certainly affect us.<p>I&#x27;d just never run across that idea before that book, but is there a specific place you came across it? :)')
