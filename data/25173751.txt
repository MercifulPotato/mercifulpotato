In the first two loops I tried my best, but I could feel I wasn&#x27;t really connecting.  In my third, they asked questions about the kind of thing I had just spent six years building and I connected perfectly.  It was like the sensation of hitting a homerun in the third loop, compared to foul balls (or strikes) in the first two.<p>In a way, this is luck.  How lucky for me that the third job fit what I knew about and was comfortable talking about.  It was lucky that they asked the kinds of questions that were things I was very experienced in.  I was the same candidate in all three interview loops, just unlucky in the first two that what they were looking for wasn&#x27;t a good fit for what I knew, and lucky in the third that it was a good fit.<p>That said, there&#x27;s also a way in which this isn&#x27;t luck.  That is, I had to have some area of knowledge and skill or else I would have been flailing around forever without connecting.<p>Any individual interview is luck, but hard work and experience can increase the size of the target you&#x27;re hoping to hit.')
