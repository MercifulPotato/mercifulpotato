We don&#x27;t print all the time (typically 3-4 times a year), and it would be sufficient gap that between prints we&#x27;d find the ink cartridges had dried up or just stopped working.  No amount of cleaning runs would get it to flow smoothly again.  It was getting stupid expensive to keep buying ink.<p>I bought a multi-function HP Laser printer a couple of years ago and haven&#x27;t looked back (although we started having to print more and more frequently as our kids have got older).  It&#x27;s one of those devices that &quot;just works&quot; now.  Even Linux automatically detects it on the network and configures itself for printing.')
