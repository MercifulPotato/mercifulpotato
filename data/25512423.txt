Prefer the 1440p at that resolution.</i><p>That&#x27;s what we say too. 27&quot; 4K monitor is too small at 100% scaling, while too small at 50% scaling (pixel-doubling hi-dpi mode).<p>That&#x27;s why the idea is to have a 5K at 50% scaling (so everything is pixel-doubled on each axis, and a pixel becomes 4 pixels, doubling the detail you see).')
