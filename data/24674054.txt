It seems like educated opinion has swung towards doing prescribed burns, and I remember hearing about this decades ago too. But- don&#x27;t the same areas keep burning in California every fire season? Shouldn&#x27;t these uncontrolled burns have already swept out the detritus, easily burnable material, etc.? If the same areas burn every year- doesn&#x27;t that sort of indicate that controlled burns aren&#x27;t effective?')
