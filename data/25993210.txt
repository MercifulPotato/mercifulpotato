Much like the issues reported at EA&#x27;s studios (with Frostbite), if you&#x27;re working on a game in it you want to be working closely with the engine devs. They&#x27;re the ones who know how to make it work, or can fix it when it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>A number of CryEngine developers left to join Cloud Imperium&#x27;s Frankfurt office working on Star Citizen. That office basically exists to pick up the ex-Crytek people who wanted a job where they&#x27;d get paid. I don&#x27;t know if Amazon snagged any of them, it would&#x27;ve been a harder sell to relocate to the US, but with the amount of money they were pouring into this, not impossible.')
