It&#x27;s processes and controls you have in place to make sure that you don&#x27;t violate HIPAA.<p>On a small team, this is pretty easy to have your CTO take this responsibility simply by being involved in EVERYTHING. At a certain point that breaks, then you need good processes.<p>Personally, the biggest pain of HIPAA is actually the product restrictions (or requirements) rather than the technical requirements.<p>* Lots of limitations on how you can use and share information\n* Lots of requirements for durability&#x2F;accessibility&#x2F;forgettability\n* Lots of mindfulness of where you store data and what has access to that data.<p>For example, look at cookies. It&#x27;s a best practice to not store sensitive data in there. In a non-HIPAA environment, you don&#x27;t really have to worry about it. Worst case, you identify the problem and resolve it. In a HIPAA environment, the could result in a violation, so you need to build a process to avoid storing sensitive data in an insecure manner.<p>Extrapolate to a bunch of different risks and suddenly you have a lot of surface area to look after.')
