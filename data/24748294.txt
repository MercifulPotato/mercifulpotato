QUIC may fix this by it&#x27;s shift to UDP. I haven&#x27;t seen a benchmark yet.<p>Quic can&#x27;t defeat physics. Performance will still lineary degrade with distance to (edge) servers, and therefore CDNs will stay important.<p>What Quic however will do is reduce the time-to-first-byte on an intial connection by 1RTT due to one less handshake - which can be e.g. a 30ms win. After the connection is established it aims to yield more consistent performance than e.g. HTTP&#x2F;2 over TCP. But packets will still require the same time to go from the browser to an edge location, and therefore the minimum latency for a certain distance is the same.')
