Frame sizes smaller than 10ms disable the LPC and hybrid coding modes, which are quite advantageous. [0]<p>In my experiments with transmitting realtime audio signals using Opus, 10ms frame sizes are acceptable for 1-way synchronicity (e.g. if you want the user to perform an action and hear the result as simultaneous with the action) but it&#x27;s definitely the upper bound.  From what I remember my signal processing professor say, the threshold to try and hit is 7ms total latency for truly undetectable processing, but I can&#x27;t find a reference for that, so take it with a grain of salt.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opus-codec.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;html_api&#x2F;group__opusencoder.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opus-codec.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;html_api&#x2F;group__opusencoder....</a>')
