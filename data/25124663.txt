And they have experience with the tooling for lots and lots of cores from CUDA. So I&#x27;d expect to have 5x to 10x the M1&#x27;s performance available for desktops in 1-2 years. In fact, AMD&#x27;s MI100 accelerator already has roughly 10x the FLOPS on 64bit.<p>That said, it&#x27;s an amazing notebook CPU.')
