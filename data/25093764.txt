Now it has no background, there is less to separate a list of notifications from my messy desktop!</i><p>Looking at the photos, holy shit, the new Notification Center aesthetic is basically... Dashboard widgets. Which I find hilarious given that one of the reasons I haven’t left Mojave for Catalina is that Catalina finally killed off the Dashboard.<p>I expect that in two or three years, the Notification Center will be able to fill the whole screen instead of being an awkward phone-width column at the side, and it will be hailed as new and innovative. Or at least I hope so because that is about when I expect to finally leave Mojave because I’m buying a new computer.')
