Heck, I used mutexes extensively for years in C code and even I didn&#x27;t know they were an option.<p>That said, mutexes are also not always wrong. Compare-and-swap is good, ensuring atomicity is good, but sometimes a mutex is what you need, especially if you&#x27;re fixing legacy code with concurrency issues.')
