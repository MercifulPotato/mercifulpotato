I have KMT friends who openly say that there’s no likelihood of unification with mainland China. For the most part they like the status quo, they love their Chinese cultural heritage, and don’t really care that it’s confusing for the rest of the world as to whether they are Taiwan or ROC.<p>The reason that ROC still de jure claims 20th century territory (including Mongolia) is because redrawing the borders would upset the status quo and signal independence to PRC which is a red line for missile attack. In every practical way, the Taiwan province has been streamlined away and the ROC _is_ Taiwan.')
