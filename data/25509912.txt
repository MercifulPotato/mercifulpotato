Life requires a modicum of effort, point blank.<p>If I understand the author, you’re conflating <i>effort</i> with your own definition of <i>work</i>. People do, regularly, pour 10,000 hours into their hobby like music or sports or art or writing. Yes, there’s some market for all of those things, but most people are introduced to those outside the context of that market. [Some] People are driven. We crave mastery. Directed effort can be incredibly rewarding for the mind and body, ever the more so when you truly get to focus it at your wim (play) instead of according to <i>someone else’s wants</i> (I.e. the market; work).')
