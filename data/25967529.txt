Last I tried to use it there was no support for TLS registration (leaving your calls unencrypted, barebacking the web) or for push notifications.<p>Linphone, Zoiper, etc can show a badge in your notifications menu&#x2F;top bar at all times and get semi-reliable access to run in the background, but expect to miss 5% to 20% of all incoming calls. Firebase push notifications are mandatory if you care about battery life or reliable inbound calling :c')
