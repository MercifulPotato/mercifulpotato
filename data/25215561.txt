So whatever compiler you&#x27;re using for stage0 can have the virus, inject it into the produced binary, &amp; you&#x27;ll never find it since the virus is in the binary not in the source.<p>The point of stage0 is that it doesn&#x27;t need to be compiled, only assembled, and that it&#x27;s small enough to inspect the binary or assemble it by hand if you <i>really</i> wanted to. (Not that you necessarily want to, but if you have to...)')
