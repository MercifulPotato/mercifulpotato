If you live in a place with mild winters all season tires can get you far, but if you get a lot of snow or ice seasonal tires are critical.<p>Cold tires are slick tires that will slide all over hell and back, the tread on winter tires is designed to better move slush and snow out of the way so the contact patch can hopefully reach the road surface; while the softer rubber heats easier so it can get to a nice &#x27;grippy&#x27; temperature and grab hold of the road even in conditions where the wet and cold are trying to sap heat from it.<p>During the warmer months these winter tires will be less effective because they have smaller contact patches (due to more&#x2F;deeper grooves in the tread to drive moisture away), and will actually get hotter than desired (softer rubber) causing a loss of grip as the rubber will want to start shearing off instead.<p>Everyone needs to remember no matter what fancy engine, electronics, etc. your car has - your tires are the only thing that actually touches the ground. Acceleration, braking and turning are all highly depending on their ability to grip the ground (and withstand the forces being placed on them) - so make sure you have the right ones and don&#x27;t put off replacing ones that are nearing the end of their life.')
