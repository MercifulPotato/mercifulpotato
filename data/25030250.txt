If not then can you really count it as a <i>reason</i>? This word implies it&#x27;s a sufficient condition, but I am not in UK and not even native English speaker, so I might be wrong here.<p>And just FYI - you don&#x27;t have to hand over a leased car, at least in the US, you can pay it off and keep it.')
