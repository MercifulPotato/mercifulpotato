Sometimes it just doesn&#x27;t even work on Windows 10. Clicking an app just doesn&#x27;t do anything. If the link is invalid, you don&#x27;t even get an error, but it randomly happens to any app. It is complete junk. For many months Windows wasn&#x27;t able to sort icons on the desktop on multiple monitor setups.<p>So forgive me if my enthusiasm of this message is slightly dampened.')
