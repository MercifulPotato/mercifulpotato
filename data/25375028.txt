That should really be done with any OS regardless.<p>You could pick another distribution, Ubuntu, Debian, etc... though you may have some up front time sink in getting everything re-tooled, depending on what you use the OS for.  On large bare metal fleets, this should involve some critical thinking and planning.  Some vendor tools may not be available.<p>You could go BSD.  This is an even bigger change from a different distro, as 3rd party library and application support would need to be verified.  Hardware support and monitoring would need to be tested.  Proprietary (dell, hp) tools will need alternatives.  OpenIPMI, static raid controller tools, etc... this is a massive topic on its own.<p>Other considerations are what reviews and approvals you need from your legal departments, compliance teams, security teams, datacenter build teams, etc...')
