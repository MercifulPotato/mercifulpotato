(And the use of &quot;feel&quot; is very intentional, I&#x27;m fully aware that Telegram groups and ordinary chats <i>might</i> be backdoored or whatever )<p>My journey was something like<p>-Facebook,<p>- private blog with logins so my parents and siblings could read, post and comment<p>- Started using Hangouts(or so I think, there&#x27;s been so many Google messaging apps) with my wife because it was convenient to not have to dig out the phone everytime we worked at a computer and needed to send som messages.<p>- Started using WhatsApp. Fell in love. &quot;Sold it&quot; to my family and my wife&#x27;s family.<p>- All our close friends picked it up too at around the same time.<p>- Facebook announced it would buy WhatsApp. I felt uncomfortable, but waited.<p>- Telegram showed up and was better but I didn&#x27;t want to switch as they were free and WhatsApp was still paid so WhatsApp felt safer.<p>- Facebook made WhatsApp free and took away all guarantees.<p>- I started using Telegram. Soon after everyone around me switched too.<p>I won&#x27;t say I started the move to WhatsApp and later Telegram among my friends but I have wholeheartedly supported it.<p>(Say what you want about the encryption in early WhatsApp and later in Telegram, but there&#x27;s more to security than encryption and most of the stuff we post would otherwise have gone on Facebook so it is a huge step forward anyways and it is so liberating to know I can talk to anyone and know that it doesn&#x27;t automatically get pumped into Facebooks data lake.)<p>Edit, FWIW, two more observations:<p>- Google Hangouts could have been the place we went to instead of WhatsApp, but lacked polish especially on group chats.<p>- Google+ could have been an alternative but didn&#x27;t feel private enough.<p>- After Google+ I gave up Google.[1]<p>- There&#x27;s a number of interesting options at any time, but I haven&#x27;t found what we (my family and close friends) need: hubzilla seems promising but lacks community it seems. Mastodon is public by default so more like Twitter, while we want 1-1 or group messaging. MeWe is focused on being a 1-to-many network, and they lack pseudonym accounts so they still don&#x27;t come close to Google+. Ideas are welcome.<p>[1]: Maybe I won&#x27;t work there even if I&#x27;m offered a job as it feels like a minefield for anyone with a different background like me and they also haven&#x27;t managed to get a single service to improve since 10 years ago as far as I remember.<p>Most services are even going backwards it seems, reducing quotas, killing products, even search has been failing badly for years and ad targeting is so bad it would have been funny if it wasn&#x27;t so insulting. (I always complain about this so I should probably say the <i>last few months</i> I&#x27;ve seen ads from stores I&#x27;d actually want to buy from instead of just the &quot;hot singles near you&quot; scam etc.)')
