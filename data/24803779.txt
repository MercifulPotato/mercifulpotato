I recently made a similar change; the removal of the cognitive dissonance between &quot;I&#x27;m a person who likes X and not Y, but I admire people who like Y and not X&quot; was refreshing and invigorating.<p>On a side note, it&#x27;s interesting to meta-analyze the strategy and realize that the kind of person you want to become is also shaped by the same factors. However, I find I have a much better chance at arriving at a &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;best&quot; aim by objectively analyzing identities other than my own, and then changing my own to match, than by simply following my own random impulses.')
