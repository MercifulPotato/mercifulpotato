Why are the actual events being so forcefully twisted to fit a particular narrative?<p>clicks. after a decade during which they lost money over fist not knowing how to monetise their product on the internet, they all went to the lowest common denominator: clicks. this in turn forced them to start bending the truth (something that tabloids where known for, and for which they got huge profits).<p>basically we still don’t have a viable business model for this industry. the only one that works needs headlines such as the one you mentioned to function.<p>the interesting bit is that publication such as Nikkei or the FT are still top-notch, but these are niches, not general audience publications. (also my FT subscription is £30&#x2F;month and that’s a lot of money if you’re not in that niche)')
