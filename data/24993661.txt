Here&#x27;s what it asserts:<p>- We don&#x27;t care about the speed of the results. That is trivially false, everyone is following the reporting, Trump is out there saying he won, people question the delays and suggest they may give time for bad actors to rig the vote.<p>- It&#x27;s too expensive - There is no backing to this claim except &quot;it systems routinely go over budget&quot;<p>- It disregards secrecy as important - secrecy is a vital part of an election process. It allows people to freely have any opinion they want without consequence or fear of people forcing them to vote for someone else (violence or other).<p>- Accessibility - I&#x27;m not sure how they can assert that we can&#x27;t make e voting accessible?<p>EDIT: For those downvoting, please do provide a reason why you disagree with what I said. Is any argument in that article actually strong?')
