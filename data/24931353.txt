For example, if the person providing support is blind, image-based screen sharing is completely unusable; they would have to ask the customer to run a screen reader and share audio (or more likely, they just wouldn&#x27;t be able to get a job providing remote support in the first place, even if they&#x27;re technically proficient). If the person receiving support is blind, or has some other disability, it may be challenging for them to get the person providing support to give them instructions that work for them.<p>In principle, this DOM-sharing approach could solve these problems. Implementing a shared cursor in an accessible way could be an interesting challenge though.')
