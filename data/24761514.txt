You then have a situation where if you&#x27;re seen as a bottleneck, holding up the expensive&#x2F;complicated thing, then the total cost of the project will balloon.<p>Many prefab companies know this and are happy to sell modules with little QA work done, because it&#x27;s unlikely that there will be serious repercussions. Once you accept the work then it&#x27;ll be too hard for your legal team to fight for (or at least, not financially worth it).<p>I&#x27;m not saying that prefab companies are ethically bankrupt, but it IS an environment that promotes this method of doing business. I&#x27;ve been in construction for mining&#x2F;oil&amp;gas companies, on both sides of this situation, quite a few times. The amount of shoddy work you&#x27;re willing to accept is quite terrifying once the cost for re-work gets into nine and ten digits.')
