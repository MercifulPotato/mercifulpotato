You can&#x27;t tell how the VLANs are configured on the other side of the network.  There is nothing of value on the web interface.  The only times I have looked at the web interface was during initial evaluation of the platform  -- everything that matters is on the OLT and is not accessible from the ONU.<p>By break it, I mean that people who poke around at the ONU are likely to break something on the fibre side while satisfying their curiosity.  Every time you pull the connector out you run the risk of getting dirt on the fibre, and if you&#x27;re $joerandomenduser you&#x27;re probably not going to clean it.  Or you won&#x27;t push the connector all the way in, or...  there are more ways for you to break things than fix them when you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.  Please don&#x27;t touch the fibre, as I don&#x27;t want to have to charge you for a $200+ truck roll caused by your cluelessness.  And yes, a truck roll really does cost more than $200 when all the travel time, fuel, tools and equipment costs are accounted for.')
