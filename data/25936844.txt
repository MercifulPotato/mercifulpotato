Item(by='zamfi', descendants=None, kids=[25937266], score=None, time=1611796867, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25936646, text='&gt; By buying a Tesla you&#x27;re supporting the notion that proprietary connections are good.<p>You continue to say this, but your evidence is nonexistent for this claim. Standards exist, Tesla doesn&#x27;t use them for &lt;reasons&gt;, therefore if you buy a Tesla you disagree that standards are good.<p>I bought a Tesla, I agree standards are good, I wish Tesla would use a standard connector. They don&#x27;t, because of vendor lock-in. We agree.<p>We agree that a standardized port is both good and possible. You keep arguing with me like I&#x27;m arguing against you on this point, I am not. That is the straw man.<p>Also:<p>&gt; yet you also think they&#x27;re not purposefully pushing their proprietary connector for vendor lock-in reasons<p>No, I know that they are doing this for lock-in reasons. That was literally in my prior post, perhaps you missed it.<p>What I AM saying is that the claim that eliminating vendor lock-in will make DC fast charging better for everyone is false. You&#x27;re right that I care more about fast charging and increased adoption more than standards, because I think we will eventually have standards and it will all be fine.<p>I don&#x27;t think that mandating standards now will make fast charging better, which is the thing I care about. I argued strongly for this and you did not refute any of it, instead continuing to argue that those who buy Teslas must not care about standards and are supporting vendor lock-in. Even if true (and I disagree), it&#x27;s irrelevant.<p>If you care about standards more than about EV adoption, fast charging proliferation (which I think is a prereq for adoption), then sure, I disagree with you. I think the latter are net better for humanity than avoiding a fragmented charging ecosystem.<p>You seem to think that a fragmented ecosystem is what will suppress adoption, but I think you are wrong -- I think taking away the incentives of those who are deploying fast charging at scale (i.e., Tesla, for vendor lock-in) will do much more harm than good: in that world, no one will be financially incentivized to build fast charging without market intervention, which perhaps you support but are not arguing for.<p>And I think present-day vendor lock-in is a small price to pay for 10-years-from-now higher EV adoption.')
