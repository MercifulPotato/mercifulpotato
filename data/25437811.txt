Apple has been providing RAW image capture APIs for several years</i><p>I don&#x27;t see how that means I&#x27;m in luck.  Me being in luck would be, &quot;Apple has such a feature, but it&#x27;s just hidden behind another invisible iOS button.&quot;<p><i>recommend patients to use a RAW camera app</i><p>You dramatically overestimate the technical ability of the average person.  We have to write our healthcare web sites for people with an eighth-grade reading level.<p><i>perhaps create a basic app for the healthcare company.</i><p>If we had the money for that, we&#x27;d probably hire back some of the doctors and nurses we&#x27;ve laid off over the last six months. Like most healthcare companies, we jettisoned medical professionals in order to stay afloat.')
