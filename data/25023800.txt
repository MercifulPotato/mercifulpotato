There are a few different strains and I had one of the milder ones but it was still enough to put me in the hospital for dehydration as an otherwise healthy 20yo.<p>In Thai it&#x27;s known as hemorrhagic fever, but unlike in English, where &quot;hemorrhagic&quot; is a technical term where the meaning isn&#x27;t clear or is softened, in Thai it&#x27;s just three simple Thai words: ไข้เลือดออก, &quot;fever [that makes] blood [come] out&quot;. Luckily I didn&#x27;t have any hemorrhaging.')
