Where each on itself is a complete topic of its own.<p>What you are suggesting here, is that for example, Sony announced their First Batch of PS5 will go for retail price of $800, and two months later it will be back to normal $500.<p>Problem 1. There will still be scalpers, the market for first to own PS5 is a lot higher than $800. I could resell a PS5 right now for $1000 USD with queue in my front door.<p>Problem 2. Getting a $800 RSP may create lots of bad press and \nun-intended consequence for marketing.<p>Problem 3, Generally speaking having constantly sold out PS5 is a good marketing problem to have. Lots of opportunities to talk about the product. Hunger marketing is real.<p>Problem 4, An RSP of $800 or higher RSP will create opportunities for your competitor.<p>Apple has been getting very good at handling these sort of thing and the only way to stamp out most of the scalpers ( <i>most</i>, not all ) is to absolutely flood the market at first launch. Of course that partly only works because they are Apple, the best supply chain and logistic company in the world.')
