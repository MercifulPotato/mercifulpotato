It&#x27;s actually one of the lessons one should draw from remembering dark times.<p>Some people may worry more than others. I have read reports from therapists that they have clients from former communist countries who struggle with the lockdowns, because it reminds them or horrific things they experienced.<p>There are also a lot of people who have built up enourmous hatred and murderous thoughts because of Corona. Where I live, there are writings on the wall that &quot;Covidiots should be burned&quot; and stuff like that. It&#x27;s not that far fetched to think about totalitarian regimes murdering people in that context.')
