And the idea that Google &quot;didn&#x27;t know&quot; this is total garbage. Google&#x27;s advertising business is not a neglected corner of the business.<p>Given so many sites run google analytics - google can run the metrics from click to dwell time etc.<p>What&#x27;s weird - I don&#x27;t have a phd in data-analytics, and I&#x27;m not google analytics expert, but it&#x27;s pretty clear when some source of traffic is being tricked or the other one I had issues with (paid) to click through. Because they don&#x27;t convert, and some bounce within a fraction a second.<p>And google couldn&#x27;t determine this stuff was low quality?')
