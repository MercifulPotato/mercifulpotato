As a digital resume which recruiters&#x2F;other people can find on their own, and can contact me if they really need to.<p>2. As somewhat of a soft sign that I &quot;know&quot;&#x2F;&quot;have been accepted as a connection by&quot; people who work(ed) in the same company&#x2F;area in the past. Kind of a signal that &quot;maybe this guy is who he says he is&quot;.<p>Everything else on Linkedin is treated as trash. People I connect to are manually unfollowed almost immediately. Notification settings are modified so that I don&#x27;t get any emails except inmails and connection requests. I thankfully haven&#x27;t seen much spam from that till date.<p>Here are some firefox ublock origin filters I use to make the site a lot more bearable (basically removes the feed, the &quot;news&quot; sections, and other things which don&#x27;t directly relate to the home page or connectivity). Only bad thing about this is that your list of connections won&#x27;t show up; I haven&#x27;t had the time to fix that yet.<p>www.linkedin.com##.feed-follows-module<p>www.linkedin.com##.ember-view.feed-shared-navigation-module.overflow-hidden.Elevation-2dp.left-rail-container<p>www.linkedin.com##.ember-view.pv3.feed-shared-news-module<p>www.linkedin.com###launchpad-wormhole<p>www.linkedin.com##.right-rail<p>www.linkedin.com##.ember-view.sticky<p>www.linkedin.com##.artdeco-card.share-box-feed-entry__wrapper<p>www.linkedin.com##div[class^=&quot;feed-shared-update&quot;]')
