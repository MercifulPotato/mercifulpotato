The average view of China in the US is so cartoonish it&#x27;s quite ridiculous. If you talk to an educated, middle-class Chinese audience about the US people generally have actually a surprising amount of understanding of the basic structure of government, values and so on. You go to a very educated audience in the US or other Western nations and it&#x27;s still embarrassing. And it&#x27;s actually a huge problem for the West that both government and citizens do not engage China seriously.')
