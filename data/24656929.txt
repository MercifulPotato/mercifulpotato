Maybe I&#x27;m more sensitive to this behavior since I spend a lot of time evaluating research papers for work, whereas the average person might just read a headline or two in a journal.<p>I&#x27;m sure folks mean well but it stems from this thinking that science is some kind of truth generator. It simply isn&#x27;t, its a method of investigating the natural world. Only when enough people independently verify your result, will you get _closer_ to what could be defined as objectively true. And even after verification, there could still be huge gaps in our understanding of a natural phenomenon. There is no guarantee that one group of researchers is going to present a complete picture. It may take many researchers studying the same topic over many decades to reach a scientific consensus. Until then, its simply an idea&#x2F;ideas - which could be interesting to think about by itself - but its not incontrovertible truth.')
