Item(by='lmkg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604889800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25030868, text='A &#x27;place&#x27; is not a meaningful unit of civic participation.<p>From one direction, California and New York are populous. California has 4 individual cities that each have a higher population than Wyoming. Is it unfair that California&#x27;s influence is larger than Wyoming?<p>From another direction, is California a single place? The Electoral College lumps together San Francisco, San Diego, and Sacramento into a single unit. Those are miles apart from each other culturally, economically, and demographically (and for that matter, they&#x27;re hundreds of miles from each other geographically). The Central Valley&#x27;s relative lack of influence at the national level is because they&#x27;re tacked on to the same &#x27;place&#x27; as Los Angeles and San Francisco, which is an arbitrary division.<p>The House of Representative does a much better (but not perfect) job of geographic representation, because the geographic units are more proportional, and are continuously re-drawn with community cohesiveness as an influencing factor. Much of the skew of the Electoral College comes from the +2 votes per state, when state lines are fixed for centuries.')
