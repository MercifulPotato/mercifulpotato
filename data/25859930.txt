Lots of 64 year olds could walk into a grocery store, wishing they had a vaccine, but they don&#x27;t. Ideally, every store employee at such a store is low or no risk for that 64 year old, just in case. Masks help but are not 100%. Catching it from surfaces is, I believe, presumed to be low on incidence, but I would not assume it is 0% either.<p>So the best bet for 64 year olds that are not yet eligible for the vaccine is that employees at places people have to go contain largely vaccinated employees as soon as possible. Also don&#x27;t know the numbers, but there are probably a lot less grocery store workers than say all people between 50 and 64 years of age.<p>(I&#x27;m also not 100% clear on when a 64 year old with no underlying conditions and no front-line worker qualification will otherwise be eligible.)')
