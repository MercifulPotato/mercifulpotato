Lots of bickering about was was and wasn&#x27;t worth including. To navigate this environment requires committees and formal standards documents.<p>But you know what&#x27;s a great consolation prize for not getting exactly what you want? Not having to do any work! So when Docker comes along with Docker Containers or Google comes along with Kubernetes, the consolation prize of not having to do any work is a lot larger than the downside of not getting to have any input. Working code is working code, especially if someone reputable has also promised to maintain it for free.')
