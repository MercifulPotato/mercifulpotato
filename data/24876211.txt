Second song is about someone longing for their ex while in their current relationship. Maybe I interpreted this wrong. I assumed &quot;Morning Pickup&quot; was supposed to be music played to &quot;pick me up&quot;, make me ready for the day, in other words, happy or inspiring music. Instead it could have just meant music promoted this morning.<p>Spotify: Prince (Radio)<p>Spotify plays rap. AFAIK that&#x27;s a racist suggestion. Prince had nothing to do with rap. The only connection is that he&#x27;s African American.<p>Youtube Music: Song &quot;Fuck you till your Groove&quot; by Jill Jones (radio)<p>Youtube plays &quot;Such a Shame&quot; by Talk Talk and &quot;All Night Long&quot; by Lionel Richie as suggested followup songs!?! WTFBBQ!!<p>Youtube Music: Swingrowers (Radio) (this is a Swing or Electro-Swing group)<p>Youtube plays &quot;Bliss on Mushrooms&quot; by Infected Mushroom<p>Youtube Music: Prince (Radio)<p>Youtube plays &quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody&quot; by Whitney Houston, &quot;Inspector Horse&quot; by Todd Terge, A bunch of Micheal Jackson, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; by Santa Esmeralda, &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; by Blondie. Those all of next to nothing to do with Prince.<p>Youtube Music: Depeche Mode (Radio)<p>Youtube plays &quot;Call on Me&quot; by Eric Prydz')
