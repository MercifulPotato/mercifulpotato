Honestly, platform specificity except for the games is gone. I pretty much use the Mac and Linux interchangeably. I&#x27;ve got 20 years on a *nix so I imagine the only reason I don&#x27;t use Windows for dev is that I don&#x27;t know the ecosystem.<p>It can&#x27;t be very much harder, though.<p>But my Macbook is a very good laptop. It isn&#x27;t as good a computer as my desktop (latter more powerful, more RAM, more cooling capacity, bigger GPU) but it&#x27;s a good laptop. Way better than the gaming laptop I have.')
