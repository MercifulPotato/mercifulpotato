Apple owns around 15% of the PC market space and almost the entirety of that is Intel-based systems.  Outside of HN, nobody cares about the M1 chip, it isn&#x27;t a selling point to my mom or her friends.  If someone at the Apple store recommends it they might buy it instead of an intel-based system but it definitely isn&#x27;t something they&#x27;re seeking out.<p>The only threat Intel has right now in the consumer space is AMD, and it&#x27;s a very real threat.  AMD won both Sony and Microsoft console designs, and the mobile Ryzen 5000 chips released at CES look to have enough OEM design wins to put a serious hurt on Intel in 2021.<p>Even if Apple goes 100% M1, there&#x27;s the other 85% of the market that Intel is likely far more concerned about.')
