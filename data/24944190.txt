I still prefer local control for stability.  Internet outages are rare, but twice they have happened when I am out of town and exactly when I really need certain aspects of my automation to work.<p>And I always suspected these services wouldn&#x27;t be free forever - and what a surprise, they eventually had to figure out a way to make money.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to go commercial like HomeSeer there are many other open source projects like HomeAssistant that are still relatively friendly and provide great functionality.  The RasbperryPi has really been a game changer offering cheap local processing for very cheap.  I don&#x27;t mind using cloud for remote access, but I would never want all my logic running remotely in the cloud.  Been burned too many times by services either changing with zero or little notice, or as I stated earlier, internet issues.<p>With projects like HomeBridge, gluing different standards and universes together is getting easier which also negates a lot of the necessity for things like IFTTT if you are willing to trade some time for convenience of just subbing to a service like it.<p>Choice is always good :)')
