Every one of us runs completely untrusted code on our machines ever day.<p>Pretty most (all?) Shopify staffers and devs are, every day, running untrusted JS code on V8.<p>So it&#x27;s nice to see progress, and I can&#x27;t wait to see more details, but it looks tricky from the start ... and TS was never going to be the obvious starting point for WASM.')
