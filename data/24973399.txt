I know we were holding off because nobody wanted the old keyboard. These will last 3+ years, so Apple have some time to screw around and get software updated while companies stick with old hardware. I hope they announce when they will stop making intel MBPs, as that is the real date when Apple silicon becomes real for most people.')
