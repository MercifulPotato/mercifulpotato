It has very little to do with controls, and everything to do with price &amp; conveninece. Because a PC gaming system is <i>much much</i> more expensive.<p>Take Horizon: Zero Dawn.

If you want to play on a PC, you need a PC that, at the level of a budget DIY system, will cost you around $600.<p>This doesn&#x27;t even take into account the fact that this particular game didn&#x27;t come to PC for 3.5 years.')
