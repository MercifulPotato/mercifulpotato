Person B borrows not from person A, but the broker who.  Person C buys the stock and again leaves it in the same broker.  In the database there is 10 shares to person A, -10 to person B, and 10 to C.  If A wants his stock back, then the broker just takes the stock from the pool not from person B.<p>Since there are a lot of people with stock at the broker there is no problem to shuffle around, it is all the same stock and an entry in the computer.<p>This of course leads to the real issue: you can buy stock and not leave it with your broker.  This has been done, but only rarely (and not in this case)')
