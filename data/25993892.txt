My impression is you have to &quot;stream&quot; to convert a file, and then it just sort of happens without you knowing when it&#x27;s done.  And the settings are...odd.  Selecting a framerate&#x2F;resolution is still old school - provide some common defaults, or % choices to match the video&#x27;s ratio.  Very clunky. --- I just tried it and it keeps repeating itself trying to overwrite a file, had to force close it, though it did convert!')
