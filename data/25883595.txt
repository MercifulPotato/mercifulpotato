What about the GPS history from your Apple Watch (should that data be available)?  How many RFID-tagged devices are in your wallet?<p>I&#x27;m not saying that any of these aren&#x27;t convenient or worth the tradeoff, but the last assertion (telling people to just be smart about what electronics they bring) is not realistic as the vast majority of THINGS we own become trackable electronics, whether the average consumer knows it or not.')
