Technically this is an extremely lossy compression as only the most important data from specific features is transmitted. I still would differentiate it from mpeg, because it is probably not generic for any pixel image.<p>A client could verify the result of the morphological operations with the real image to check the result. Computationally expensive, but Nvidia probably has a solution for that.<p>I still hate video calls though.')
