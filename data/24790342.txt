If someone actually complies with a request from Apple, there is a lot more going on than ‘merely following guidelines’, an obvious one being that there may be a real problem with the content behind taken down.<p>By saying this, you exclude the possibility that Apple is acting in good faith.<p>To summarize, your comment was in no way a fair rewriting of Apple’s comment.<p>You introduced a set of additional content that weren’t in anyone else’s version, and which give the appearance of Apple’s actions being the meritless bullying of a bad faith actor.<p>That is the entire substance of your comment.<p>It’s certainly possible that Apple’s actions are disagreeable to many people, but HN shows that they are not universally considered meritless.<p>It’s also possible for Apple to act like a bully uninitentionally, or to <i>actually</i> bully developers.  They are not above that and we should discuss it.<p>But those facts don’t make your ‘rewrite’ a fair reflection.')
