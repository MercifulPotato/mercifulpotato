[0] (Not counting data-store cost.) It&#x27;s backed by highly reliable server-grade hardware, and is connected to the high-speed AWS network. Doesn&#x27;t that count as cheap?<p>I agree that &#x27;lower tier&#x27; providers may be even cheaper, but they still count as cloud computing, so I think my point stands. As a slight off-topic, I&#x27;ve found that the cheaper providers generally offer an inferior product. You can expect to encounter poorly considered features, broken features, or expected features missing entirely.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;ec2&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;on-demand&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;ec2&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;on-demand&#x2F;</a>')
