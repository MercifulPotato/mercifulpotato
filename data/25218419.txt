I&#x27;ve started a small company and have 5 clients currently, I manage social media, SEO, website changes, content writing, etc. I&#x27;m charging a small upfront fee (about £500) followed by a monthly retainer for a minimum term of 12 months (£300).<p>The problem I have is that it doesn&#x27;t scale at all. ALL of my time is spent on SEO, Social Media Posting (Creating posts and then scheduling them), and finally content writing for blogs. I could hire people to do these things (i&#x27;m actually struggling to find jacks of all trades like myself) but the problem is that it&#x27;s no longer profitable if I start hiring.<p>Any advice? It would excellent if we could chat privately somehow.')
