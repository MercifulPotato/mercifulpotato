For someone like me, who likes convenience but isn&#x27;t particularly obsessed with sound or sound quality, this release exists to frame Airpods and Airpods Pro as &quot;value&quot; options.<p>Personally, however, I&#x27;m actively working on moving away from this ecosystem. I&#x27;ve felt like every purchase is a lose&#x2F;lose for a while now. I can&#x27;t deny that Apple products offer a superior experience in almost every category, but feeling like I&#x27;m getting ripped off every time I buy is miserable, that&#x27;s just not how I want to live life. I used to love apple stores, now they just remind me of nearly-mandatory $200 storage upsells.')
