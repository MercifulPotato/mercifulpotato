Neither side has principles or real values. Just agenda.<p>One side will say a small bakery is a private business who can serve whomever they want. The other side will say it&#x27;s a violation of people&#x27;s rights for a small private bakery to deny service to [insert whatever minority group they are currently using to further their agenda].<p>You flip the situation and now it&#x27;s the leftists defending private companies to deny service... The same people commenting here defending &quot;private companies&quot; were the same ones screaming bloody murder about a small private bakery.<p>It&#x27;s hypocrisy, it&#x27;s a human trait. It&#x27;s like how assange was a hero when he exposed bush, but now...<p>The exact same ones who claim big tech is evil when they vociferously defend big tech&#x27;s censorship here. It&#x27;s almost like they have journalist&#x27;s logic&#x2F;agenda.')
