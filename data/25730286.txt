It&#x27;s a wireless unit, which pairs with the soundbar, which I got with my TV about 5 years ago.<p>I quickly come to the conclusion the power supply is broken. And <i>of course</i> the power supply is internal.<p>I tried to open up the thing, being fairly competent with electronics. But try as I might, I just couldn&#x27;t figure out how this thing comes apart. I don&#x27;t want to brute force it, thing is stylish and my SO likes that about it, but also a lot of plastic so easy to break.<p>Ok, I searched the web for a service manual. Nothing. Not even close.<p>In contrast, the DVD player my mom uses (mostly as a glorified CD player) died before xmas. It&#x27;s an old Sony unit, bought in 2000 or 2001, and been on ever since (standby or active). I searched and I found a beautiful service manual, with detailed schematics and instructions for disassembly and reassembly. Even the PCB itself has lovely markings making it very clear what is going on where.<p>Quickly discovered the issue in the power supply and ordered some replacement parts (still waiting).<p>Sure I could probably have found a second-hand DVD player for cheap. But yeah it just seemed so senseless to toss away a perfectly good unit when by all accounts it just needs $3 worth of parts.')
