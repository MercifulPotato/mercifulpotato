There is a shared ethos and a lot of very smart, skilled people on HN. Some themes I see on HN more than anywhere are open sourcing, discussions of tools of all kinds (using them&#x2F;making them&#x2F;improving them), spread of novel ideas, financially supporting certain projects, products, people (patreon), generally a broad interest in advanced STEM topics, and the list goes on.<p>So, my question is, if us HN users were to “organize” for lack of better word and do something - what would it be?\nAdvance a project, contribute labor to some new thing, raise&#x2F;donate money for xyz, commission some art, it could be anything. But I’d like to think of it as potentially achievable (sorry Elon, HN probably can’t take you to Mars).')
