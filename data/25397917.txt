You probably have your information from old Leafs.<p>Most people that actually drive EVs I&#x27;ve heard from do not have problems with long charging times. In fact, it only takes a couple of seconds to do most charges (the time it takes to plug it in in your garage). When they are travelling, it does take longer, but for most people it just means a slightly longer coffee break.<p>Coal is on its way out, and even with coal on the grid, it doesn&#x27;t actually defeat the purpose, as it is still more efficient than small fossil engines not running at their optimal revs. And it is on its way out!<p>Hydrogen for cars is not going to happen, outside a few compliance cars. And you&#x27;ll probably be surprised to learn that you can&#x27;t fill up a hydrogen car as fast as a gas car.<p>The main problems holding EV cars back right now are lack of production capacity and upfront cost.')
