One register pointed to the top of all your main memory in assembler. Solving COBOL dumps required resolving pointers to pointers, and I had not kept good notes in COBOL class. Fortunately soon after I returned to COBOL programming debuggers came on line that solved the COBOL misdirection for you. <i>Misdirection</i> is the kindest word I can think of to describe COBOL dumps.<p>I&#x27;ve really never solved a dump since COBOL, which I have not worked in since 1996. Debugging has come a long way.')
