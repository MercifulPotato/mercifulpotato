I am a civil engineer and there&#x27;s a standard of ethics and personal responsibility among engineers that is very, very high.  When we graduate, most engineers participate in a ring ceremony.  They get a funny, angled ring on their right pinky.  It was originally made from the metal from a bridge that fell down and killed people.  It was meant to be a daily reminder, worn on the drafting hand, that every single drawing you signed carried the weight of public trust of their lives.  Even pedestrian bridges get built with vehicle load standards, because you can&#x27;t just assume that it will only be used by pedestrians.<p>Civil engineering is a licensure, and no matter what liability structure you use, when you stamp a drawing, you carry PERSONAL liability for anything that might happen if that design fails.  Even small violations of ethics or operating outside your scope of knowledge are dealt with very aggressively by the licensing board.<p>In school, if we misplaced a decimal or got a calculation wrong or failed to adhere to a very specific standard, it was automatic failure because if you do that in real life, people die.')
