I personally have all 3 (Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram) and use all three with different groups and scenarios.<p>For example:<p>- With my mom and grandmom: WhatsApp<p>- Group of friends from jiu-jitsu: WhatsApp<p>- Work Colleagues and friends working with Network Security: Signal<p>- Notifications from services that I run like weather station, waves forecast, how full my gym is right now, some other batch services that I have: Telegram<p>There is no reason to be radical here. We have options, and that&#x27;s great!')
