They&#x27;re loyal, brilliant and quick. Startups that we celebrate on this forum exude this from all their pores.\n</code></pre>\nDuring a planning meeting, you decide that Bob should build new feature X. Bob says yes, and then never does it.

Your support burden triples and no one is left to tell you how undocumented legacy functionality was supposed to work.<p>If startups worked like corporate executives, there would never be a successful one.
