Really.\nI dont blame Apple or Foxconn or whoever that tries to squeeze as much as they can.<p>But we (as the western civilization) can make deals with most of these countries and set basic standards and minimum wage requirements that is both beneficial to them and to us. I dont want western workers try to compete with cheap labor from India or Vietnam but at the same time I dont want these people be exploited as much as they are now.<p>They can make a decent wage based on the economy of their country and still be treated like humans.')
