I stopped looking at the numbers daily, but still take a look at least once a week.<p>We have a baby, it is hard to see doctors&#x2F;dentists as we don&#x27;t want to take him there. We never go to stores together and someone needs to watch him. Daycare doesn&#x27;t seem safe yet for us, so we are doing our best.<p>Majority of parents work, many kids now study from home. This is putting an insane pressure on the parents.<p>I&#x27;m not suffering from &quot;psychic numbing&quot;, by now I know the risks, I am just TIRED physically and mentally. What else can an average citizen do? Distance, wear a mask, suck it up and wait for your turn to get a vaccine. Searching COVID daily does nothing.')
