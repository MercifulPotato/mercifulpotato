In the first episode, his character has a breakdown and is wandering the Brooklyn Bridge in diapers swinging a fake lightsaber screaming “I’m a Jedi.” It’s hard to get crazier than that. Tracy stays crazy, but the novel stuff because his normality. In the mid-seasons, they have arcs where he hates partying and has never cheated on his wife - despite the image he has created that imply those things.<p>He never becomes normal, but he starts out over-the-top. When a character starts there, sometimes showing normal behavior is more surprising than trying to be even more over-the-top.')
