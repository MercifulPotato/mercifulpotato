(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inews.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;health&#x2F;covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-wait-give-birth-vaccination-uk-775264" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inews.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;health&#x2F;covid-vaccine-pregnant-women...</a>)<p>This seems at odds with the gung-ho &quot;it&#x27;s 100% safe&quot; rhetoric of our politicians.<p>I am by no means an anti-vaxxer, but I&#x27;m already finding it creepy the way any concerns are simply being dismissed. It&#x27;s also just bad policy: it means that any unexpected side-effects that do emerge (even if very rare &#x2F; not serious) will look much worse and immediately stink of a cover-up.<p>What&#x27;s wrong with saying: &quot;We are confident, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that the risk of taking this vaccine is lower than the risk of contracting Covid&quot;? Not &quot;This vaccine is definitely safe&quot;. I am sick of politicians treating the electorate as if they are morons who can&#x27;t understand the slightest bit of nuance.<p>As you mention, vaccines can cause harm and have done in the past. Some degree of caution might be warranted.')
