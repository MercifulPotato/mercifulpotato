Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604098225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946428, text='&gt; now you&#x27;re bringing up how low the tax revenue is, which is of dubious relevance.<p>Sorry, I misunderstood &quot;apportionment by use&quot; as meaning &quot;division of payment by users, according to usage&quot;. That&#x27;s what I get for not reading the original comment thoroughly, which suggested a flat per-user fee, distributed to content owners :-P. However, I think libraries still fit the bill.<p>&gt; that producers be paid by how popular their content is<p>Libraries tend to buy more copies of popular content to reduce waiting time for patrons. So this does happen.<p>&gt; nor does a single library&#x27;s physical DVD rental satisfy the entire internet market<p>Libraries don&#x27;t have to do only physical DVDs. They already loan e-books, there&#x27;s no reason (other than the availability of licensing) they couldn&#x27;t do the same for movies and TV shows. And a library can certainly satisfy the demand in its city.')
