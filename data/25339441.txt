A self-driving-car business doesn&#x27;t need any drivers on board, so driver recruitment isn&#x27;t a moat. And Google already have Google Maps on a big fraction of phones, so app installation is scarcely a moat.<p>Of course Google will have plenty of opportunities to shoot themselves in the feet, so it&#x27;s certainly not a done deal.')
