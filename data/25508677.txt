Item(by='xyzelement', descendants=None, kids=[25508837], score=None, time=1608657699, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25508582, text='&gt; For me HN is an invaluable resource since it has allowed me to take a peek into some realities that were hitherto unimaginable.<p>Just wanted to say - that&#x27;s awesome.<p>&gt; This sort of reality clash will only become more poignant in the future as the gap between highly skilled workers and the rest deepens to become a canyon. It&#x27;s already the case that you find my perspective weird, so imagine how weird it will be to future HN posters when the inequality has reached even higher levels and they can&#x27;t even conceive of someone having to apply for jobs to get one.<p>I think the chasm is not as wide as you think - at least for me. It&#x27;s easy for me to relate to the difficulty of a job search, and at least intellectually to connect to the difficulty of scraping by in a low skill&#x2F;low wage situation. I grew up poor so it&#x27;s not that hard to see it actually.<p>The reason I reacted to your post is that the attitude it espouses is poison to those who embrace it. Here&#x27;s what I mean - if one believes that all employers are abusers out there to fleece you like a feudal lord (from your analogy) then one doesn&#x27;t actually try to find working dynamics that are better than that so they pass up opportunities. Small example - my in-laws run a small business that treats employees very well (like, health insurance for unskilled workers type well) - but if someone believes all employers are evil then folks don&#x27;t go and seek out their type.')
