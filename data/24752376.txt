That data point will be used against them by people like Cirne.<p>Clearly we&#x27;re starting to see firms separating into &quot;we just get work done here&quot; like Coinbase&#x2F;New Relic and another other category, &quot;all in on identity politics&quot; like Kickstarter, Google. Firms that don&#x27;t want to go in that direction but were previously unclear on what the damage might be from activist exits now have at least a ballpark figure - and of course that 5% number is exaggerated. Coinbase basically gave people a huge bonus for disagreeing with the new policy. If not paying people to leave, and in the middle of a lockdown recession, the number would surely be lower.')
