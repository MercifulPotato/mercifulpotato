I&#x27;ve been working at 40 Hz for 2 years and I didn&#x27;t notice the difference. I press windows-fn-F9&#x2F;F10 instead of only fn-F9&#x2F;F10, not a big deal. Automatic brightness control as on phones? I would probably disable that anyway.<p>By the way, brightness control didn&#x27;t work in 2014, then started working, then it stopped working again. Kernel versions &#x2F; NVIDIA drivers, who knows.')
