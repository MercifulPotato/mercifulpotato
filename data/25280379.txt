Item(by='kangnkodos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606937280, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25274142, text='Lending stocks involves two sides, the lender and the borrower.<p>There are three questions you should ask instead of one:<p>- Is there any reason for a borrower to borrow stocks other than betting that a stock is going to go down? The answer to that is basically &quot;no&quot;. That&#x27;s the main reason to do it. There are a few weird edge cases which are the exception to this general rule.<p>- Is there any reason for a lender to loan out stock?\nIf I run a mutual fund, most of my stock is just sitting in a big dusty pile most of the time, doing nothing. I give the impression to my customers that I&#x27;m constantly buying and selling, but really, I just buy and hold most of the time. My main problem as a mutual fund manager is not the market going up or down. All of my peers are in the same market. My main problem is figuring out how to get a tiny edge over the other mutual fund managers, so my fund is on the top of the list at the end of the year. If I lend out my stock, my mutual fund might make a quarter of a percent per year extra. That&#x27;s usually enough to bring my mutual fund up to the top of the list, relative to my peers. Profit.<p>- What is the benefit to the market of stock lending? As others have pointed out, the exact language you use to describe this transaction can be interpreted in a negative way. My opinion is that markets that allow this type of bet are much more resilient when the market inevitably turns down. Markets that don&#x27;t allow stock lending tend to have artificially high prices for a long period of time, and inevitably crash hard. So, I think stock lending is a good thing. It evens out the highs and lows better.')
