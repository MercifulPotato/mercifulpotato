There are so many problems in the physical sciences that just can’t be solved without larger and larger supercomputer-style clusters.\nI know this is a kind of ill-formed question, but does anyone in the neuro or bio fields know how far away we are from being able to convincingly simulate a brain (human or other mammal), in terms of raw compute power?')
