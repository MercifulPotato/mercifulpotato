Another concern is that it won&#x27;t be able to apply braking hard enough when a collision is imminent - in such situation it flashes a red warning on the display and sounds an alarm prompting me to brake, but because I haven&#x27;t been actively adjusting speed with my foot, it might increase my reaction time.<p>So perhaps having more of those &quot;half way there&quot; self driving features could lead to more of such anxiety, I&#x27;m not sure. And I don&#x27;t know who I would trust more, a car manufacturer, or someone like Comma AI, with my safety. Leaning towards car manufacturers to be honest.')
