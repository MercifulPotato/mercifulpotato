It&#x27;s not just containerized freight, the trucks with drivers drive on and drive off the other modes of transit.<p>Being an island isn&#x27;t required; you need effective border controls, and effective control of population behavior. It&#x27;s just a lot easier to have effective border control with an island; but England certainly didn&#x27;t make use of that possibility.')
