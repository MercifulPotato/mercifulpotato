Item(by='growse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607869373, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25405800, text='&gt; &gt; In the U.K. excess speed is the 10th most common cause of accidents<p>&gt; That may be in part due to camera-based enforcement of the speed limits.<p>I can&#x27;t lay my hands on it now, but there are studies measuring the effect on road casualties before and after camera installations. A lot of the time there&#x27;s no difference.<p>Like any punishment&#x2F;deterrent, people aren&#x27;t caught often enough for this to work.<p>If you drive around for long enough in the UK, you&#x27;ll notice that speeding is actually pretty common. However, it&#x27;s not the case that everyone speeds everywhere, you&#x27;re far more likely to catch someone speeding on the motorway or an NSL A road in the clear and dry than in a 20 outside a school. This is because most people are competent enough to regulate their speed appropriately for the environment. Sometimes it&#x27;s riskier to drive at 20mph past a school than it is to do 90 on the motorway.<p>Of course there are people who drive dangerously  around vulnerable people and in hazardous situations and these are the people who often end up contributing to the statistics. Those are the people enforcement needs to focus on.<p>&gt; Also, road accidents kill quite a lot of people. If it&#x27;s the 10th most common cause, that could still be enough to kill more people than many other things that we regulate.<p>The problem with this is that if we were serious about making the roads safer with the limited resources we have, we wouldn&#x27;t spend it on catching people speeding. We&#x27;d spend it on stuff that actually makes a difference.')
