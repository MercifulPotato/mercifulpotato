It &#x27;s also very team dependent.<p>The reason why you&#x27;re expected to be fast during the interviews is that you&#x27;re competing with people who are fast (either because they are smart, or because they&#x27;ve practiced a lot).<p>That being said, this type of interviews is clearly not for everyone. There are tons of skilled people who (for good reasons) don&#x27;t want to play that game, and there&#x27;ll always be a market for them.')
