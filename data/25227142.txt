My favorite example is Total Commander - a file manager that is still under active development for Windows which not needs almost very little memory (right now i have it open with 10 tabs -and had it open for a while- and it uses 7.3MB of memory) but even runs on something like a P133 with 16MB of RAM running Win95. It wont be <i>that</i> fast, but it will be perfectly usable and packs so many features (actual visible features, not stuff that theoretically might be useful but are behind 29301 layers and i may not even see them or even care about them) that i do not mind.')
