Sometimes they bite first without rattling, particularly when startled, but they are less likely to use venom in those circumstances and those bites will generally be to the ankles or legs.  Snakes only have self-preservation in mind when it comes to humans, never predation.  They hid because they&#x27;re scared, and they bite because they&#x27;re scared.  Their venom is meant primarily for catching meals but they&#x27;ll use it in self defence when pressed.<p>In the past 20 years in America, 30 men have been killed by snakes, vs 6 women.  Dudes trying to be macho by fucking with snakes explains most of this gap; many of them were bitten on the hands and the circumstances of many of the cases make it pretty clear the snake was being fucked with.  Only a handful of incidents were likely genuine accidents.')
