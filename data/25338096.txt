(Haight&#x2F;Ashbury, SoMa, Potrero, and Castro).<p>Where I lived in Potrero and SoMa was absolutely not walkable. Potrero was particularly bad because any amount of walking meant climbing a very, very long and steep hill - as in by the time you make it up, you&#x27;re sweating like crazy.<p>Castro and Haight&#x2F;Ashbury were walkable, but nowhere as walkable as a city like NYC.<p>The middle ground for me was a motorcycle. Easy to park anywhere. Cheap. Great gas mileage, etc.<p>I had roommates working for Cisco in SoMa who took the bus to work. That was a constant topic of frustration for him. He ended up getting a motorcycle too because of the commute.')
