Their methodology is flawed.<p>According to their experiment, the best attenuation you can get out of any ferrite is a useless value in the single digit decibel range, which can be as poor as 0.5.<p>That&#x27;s almost like saying these things don&#x27;t work.<p>How ferrites work is that they are actually <i>resistive</i> at high frequencies (in addition to boosting the inductive reacatance of the conductor). How much attenuation that translates to depends on the circuit.<p>We wouldn&#x27;t say that a simple resistor, <i>as such</i>, has a certain decibel loss of voltage; it makes no sense. A resistor can exhibit no loss of voltage, if the current flowing through it is negligible.<p>Ferrite beads work and how they work is that the target of the unwanted noise (the destination where we don&#x27;t want it to go) has, at the given frequency, a relatively low impedance relative to the impedance of the bead.<p>E.g. suppose the noise faces a 10 ohm input impedance into the device where we don&#x27;t want it to go, and the ferrite manages to create a 1000 ohm source impedance. Then we have a 100:1 voltage divider, which is a 40 dB reduction.<p>In my personal experience, the clearest directly perceptible example I&#x27;ve seen of their effectiveness was when I had serious noise on an LCD monitor due to a long serial line running under it between an embedded board and host. I had a clamp-on ferrite bead lying around and put it on the serial line. The display&#x27;s obvious visual disturbances completely disappeared.')
