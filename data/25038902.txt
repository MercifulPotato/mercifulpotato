I&#x27;d like to pick your brain a bit more if you don&#x27;t mind :)<p>What is you view on Postgresql not having a true clustered index like ms sql has? I mean that the table is maintained sorted by PK all the time (table is stored as btree). Do you think there&#x27;s a possibility of MS sponsoring it? Our experience with Postgresql shows that as the biggest drawback for many popular workloads compared to other RDBMSes.')
