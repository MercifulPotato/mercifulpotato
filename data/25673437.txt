Iâ€™m not a Twitter user, but this would surprise me.<p>The joe rogan podcast #1258 with Jack Dorsey and Tim Pool is a pretty good watch. Twitter has extensively banned right-wing personalities off their platform while outright allowing left-wing people break the rules.<p>For example Twitter recently blocked virtually all negative news about Joe biden and hunter biden during the election. For example in place of blocking the NYpost&#x27;s coverage of hunter biden&#x27;s corruption. They banned people to hide the story and then put a counter news article that called it fake news as trending.<p>Flipside, Twitter allowed Smollet&#x27;s hate crime hoax. Twitter allows celebrities calling for the death of that maga hat kid. They allowed the russian collusion stuff that turned out to be completely false.<p>twitter is very biased.')
