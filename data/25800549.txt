A low effective environment does not have a large e2e test suite.  It does not have a siloed QA team, and people write little to no unit tests, never mind integration tests.<p>If you are in a &quot;low effective environment&quot;, a &quot;siloed QA team&quot; is a godsend.  At least someone is responsible solely for quality, as opposed to everyone churning out features as fast as they can.  Disposing of the siloed QA team in such environments rarely helps matters.')
