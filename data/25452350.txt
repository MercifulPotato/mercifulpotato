In the early days if things were so exaggerated, it would have been sloppy; but as he&#x27;s improved as an artist he has an increasing ability to exaggerate things and have it be <i>stylized</i> rather than <i>sloppy</i>.  And so he utilizes that stylization to have the characters better emote.<p>Writing: I think there are 3 parts to this.  I think part of that is that they let more of their true selves through to the characters, and easing up on the invented personas.  I think as the characters develop more &quot;real&quot; personas they don&#x27;t have to lean as much on the initial defining traits of the characters.  I think they&#x27;ve mellowed as they&#x27;ve grown up; once they were uber-hard-core and could spend 16 hours in a raid; now they have children and responsibilities (or put more in terms of the comic: These days there&#x27;s a place in the comic for more casual gaming that did not exist in the early comic).')
