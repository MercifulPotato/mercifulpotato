Manual labour is still used nowadays, even for works which could be automated in some way.<p>Actually, there is a larger and larger gap between educated people with office jobs who earn a good salary to do &quot;stuff that hadn&#x27;t been worried about before&quot;... and the rest of the barely educated people who barely earn anything and get to do all the manual work (taking care of the children, cleaning homes, offices, cooking food, delivering food, harvesting delicate fruit, etc.). The gap is bigger and bigger, despite or thanks to the progress of humanity.<p>In a world where less of the manual people are asked to do manual work for some reason, these uneducated people won&#x27;t transition to other jobs. Best case scenario is they get a minimal universal income to stay calm at home and generate clicks on social media to feed AI some new data. Worst case scenario is they will want to work, and be angry at society for making them feel useless.')
