We didn&#x27;t think it was COVID, but of course wanted to make sure. It was much more difficult than I thought it would be to get tested. Many places wouldn&#x27;t test a child under 10. Once we finally found a location to test the soonest they had an appointment was 24 hours later. It took several days to get the negative result as well and I had to call them twice to get the results. I&#x27;m sure many people wouldn&#x27;t go through the effort.')
