Glass furnaces are one such case. Having an efficient local energy delivery mechanism that may be &quot;recharged&quot; with electricity is quite interesting.<p>I don&#x27;t imagine beer production requiring such high temperatures, but honestly I don&#x27;t know anything about industrial beer production.
