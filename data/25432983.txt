The primary requirement was to ensure there was no caller-side language dependency because we had multiple teams that would be calling the API and those teams might use the command line, Python, Ruby, Javascript, etc clients to consume the API results.<p>API adoption was low in the end - teams in the end wanted libraries rather than a well-defined representation with embedded hyperlinks.  Every consumer I heard about simply parsed the JSON bits they wanted from responses and hard-coded URL links in their client apps.<p>I enjoyed the design and writing of the app - I used Clojure and the liberator library.  Probably a wasted effort of engineering in the end.  Totally fun project to implement though.')
