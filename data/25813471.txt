It&#x27;s much more often the case that the cop has some plausible argument that they made a bad decision in good faith. Which makes the cases very hard to prosecute. It&#x27;s pretty seldom the case that prosecutors corruptly ignore clear cut misconduct.<p>There are flaws in the justice system. And by no means is it totally fair. But in this sort of situation, where a judge has seen the evidence and issued a warrant, usually there is usually something there. It&#x27;s very possible this is selective prosecution. But, I&#x27;ll bet you a good sum of money at even odds that there&#x27;s probable cause she committed a crime.')
