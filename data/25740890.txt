In the 2016 vote, he did get a lot of the popular votes (even tho hilary got more). That&#x27;s a sign that a lot of people in the US do agree with his world view - whether they understand that it&#x27;s just retoric trump is throwing to get votes, or they do truly feel it, is moot.<p>Trump _only_ got into power because there&#x27;s enough people in the USA to get him into power. This isn&#x27;t a case of a one time bad president - it&#x27;s the psyche of a nation.')
