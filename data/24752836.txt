Not all the problems in embedded are network security risks. If you are evangelizing Rust, please stop trying to lure embedded developers with &quot;networks haxxor buffer overflow&quot; FUD because it&#x27;s simply not going to work.<p>For instance, a developer writing the software for the sensors of a forklift has enough to worry about to not crushing the skull of someone passing near it. Edit to add: is not that security bugs are not important, but is not what we (embedded developers) are always chasing or taking away our sleep at night. Embedded is wide enough beyond computer networks.<p>Please take a look at the room around you. Can you count every little chip in there? Including the one in your keyboard, LED lamps, coffee machine? Are all these ARM? NO. Are all these connected to the network? NO. Do you expect them to work 100% of the time without hiccups? YES, and they probably do without you noticing it.<p>And they are probably running 1000s of lines of C. That&#x27;s embedded.')
