A quick google on &quot;github photo organizer&quot; shows a lot of others having done the same :)<p>It organizes all traversed photos by date (extracted from exif or from filename), and puts them in a &quot;failed&quot; folder if it can&#x27;t parse the date.<p>If any photos get the same name, they are either deduped because they are exact duplicates, or are marked as conflicts (e.g. A.jpg and A_conflict1.jpg) if they are different.<p>Last time I used it for a large input it took 3h for 200GB, though I suspect network latency was the main bottleneck.<p>It&#x27;s around 300 lines of python - verify the code for yourself if you want to use it! You probably also need to fork it if you don&#x27;t intend to run it on a Synology NAS.<p>However, as I mentioned last time I pitched this, elodie [2] might be more suitable for others than my little hack. Haven&#x27;t used it though!<p>1: (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;johan-andersson01&#x2F;photo_organizer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;johan-andersson01&#x2F;photo_organizer</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jmathai&#x2F;elodie" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jmathai&#x2F;elodie</a><p>---<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24019612" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24019612</a>')
