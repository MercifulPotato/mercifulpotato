But there&#x27;s no denying they are fashion statements. For Jobs, this went back a long way. Look at the way the initial Mac and the NeXT compared to the competitors of the day. I definitely got involved with the NeXT just because it looked so cool. And honestly I stayed doing NeXT development work long after a rational person would quit.<p>And I think that carried forward. Look at the iPod silhouette billboard ads, which were iconic. [1] Those are not about features. Those are about how fucking cool the iPod was. The iPhone was demonstrably a status symbol. [2] And this has obviously worked well for Apple. They sell under 20% of all phones, but make 2&#x2F;3rds of all phone profits. Actual features are not the only thing in play here.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pophistorydig.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;tag&#x2F;ipod-billboard-ads&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pophistorydig.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;tag&#x2F;ipod-billboard-ads&#x2F;</a><p>[2] e.g.: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deccanchronicle.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;mobiles-and-tabs&#x2F;090718&#x2F;iphone-ipad-are-status-symbols-research.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deccanchronicle.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;mobiles-and-tabs&#x2F;...</a>')
