Item(by='jug', descendants=None, kids=[25110625, 25110247], score=None, time=1605521832, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25108771, text='I&#x27;m thinking of buying the Raspberry Pi 400 and I see Ubuntu MATE indeed has a 64-bit Raspberry Pi port. While the &quot;400&quot; apparently has some compatibility issues in some scenarios, it&#x27;s essentially a higher clocked Pi 4. Assuming it&#x27;s working, I wonder if it&#x27;s performant as a Raspberry Pi OS alternative to the official distro? I think I prefer a cleaner MATE over the default stuff.<p>Edit: Oh I see now I essentially posted in parallel with another question about the Pi running this. Well, there are images for it at least!')
