Like one cohort starting at 8 and another starting at 10 or even 11.\nStanding up at 8 is hard for me and I&#x27;m happy to be in a job where I can start working at 10, but here in Bavaria school starts at 08:15 and I had to set my alarm to 06:30 for a huge part of my life even tho I rarely fell asleep before 00:30,sometimes much later. The result was that I regularly missed a day of school, because I was just too tired to go. Luckily my parents were supportive.<p>Also my performance on the 8am classes was much worse than on later classes. In university I skipped all 8am lectures and even skipped early exams and waited for a &quot;better scheduled&quot; exam.<p>The worst part about it was how non-understanding all the early-birds are. They just didn&#x27;t grasp that asking me to be awake and productive at 8am was like asking them to do work after 11pm and that &quot;just go to bed earlier&quot; isn&#x27;t a working solution. Just ignorance of a different rythm.')
