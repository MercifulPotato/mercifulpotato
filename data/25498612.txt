How is this better than strictly client or server side? It seems like it just has the disadvantages of both with additional complexity to maintain an application now coupled to both your back and front ends.<p>Presumably if your react app could be more performant with server-side rendering it would be better to simply use traditional server side rendering and sprinkle JS, and if it&#x27;s really a &quot;web app&quot; I&#x27;m not sure how substantially faster react server components will be in practice.<p>EDIT:<p>I read the FAQ and some of the answers seem to need clarification:<p>&gt; Doesnâ€™t always re-fetching the UI make interactions slow?<p>The answer to this isn&#x27;t really definitive.<p>&gt; What are the performance benefits of Server Components?<p>The answer to this makes it sound server components make fewer requests than client, but in the context of GraphQL which is mentioned in the answer, the total amount of requests should be the same. If anything wouldn&#x27;t a regular react app be more responsive?')
