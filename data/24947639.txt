In the coordinate system of an observer at a constant distance from the horizon, the path of a free-falling object takes an infinite amount of coordinate time.<p>In this coordinate system, the time coordinate becomes space-like passed the event horizon and the radial coordinate becomes timelike. There is a coordinate singularity around this switch, which is where the infinite coordinate time comes from.<p>An observer fammiliar with relativity could compute the proper time of a path traversing the event horizon, which they would find to be finite.')
