Item(by='hn_throwaway_20', descendants=2, kids=[25500742, 25500426], score=3, time=1608589032, title='Ask HN: Well paid but trapped by job title?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ve been working at a pre-IPO startup for 4+ years now, and it&#x27;s grown rapidly (I came in as employee #25, and we&#x27;re now over 500).<p>When I first joined I came in as &quot;Front-end Developer&quot;, and over the past years I&#x27;ve lead many successful large projects, and have been a dedicated employee. All this had lead to me getting a good amount of pay raises, I&#x27;m now leading a team of 15 developers, and I&#x27;m relied upon to lead many of the important projects for the company.<p>The issue is, my job title hasn&#x27;t really changed over the years (basically it&#x27;s now &quot;Lead Front-end Developer&quot;). In fact, as we&#x27;ve grown, despite  asking to be considered for promotions, the company has only hired from outside for higher level positions in engineering, and mostly given me raises instead (to be clear, it&#x27;s not just me that they haven&#x27;t promoted, other iOS and backend developers also leading teams have not been promoted as well). When I&#x27;ve asked if I could be promoted, I&#x27;ve gotten a vague &quot;maybe in a few years&quot; response from them, and to be fair to them, I was never promised a promotion from my position, I just assumed if I worked really hard and showed my value, eventually I&#x27;d rise up the ranks of the company.<p>From what they&#x27;ve told me, it will be probably be at least two more years before I&#x27;ll grow any higher at my company, and because we&#x27;re growing so fast as well, the people we are hiring for the next positions are also way more qualified than me (former VPs of Facebook), which I&#x27;ll never be able to compete with if I&#x27;m being honest with myself.<p>All this makes me consider leaving for another company, but because I haven&#x27;t been promoted very often, but I have been given raises, any position at my same &quot;level&quot; will be a huge step down (for reference, the average Front-end Developer salary where I live is 50k&#x2F;year, and I&#x27;m at 150k&#x2F;year + benefits).<p>All this feels like a huge 1st world problem, but it&#x27;s really been painful for me. Anyone in a similar situation that can share?')
