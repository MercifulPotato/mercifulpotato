Sounds familiar to another intensely politicized system...<p>My parents told me federal student loans (actually from the government) had a fraction of a percent interest when they went to college in the late 80&#x27;s, although neither of their families had any money to speak of.<p>I&#x27;m different in that my parents worked their way (along with a fair amount of luck) to teetering on the edge of entering the upper middle class.<p>They didn&#x27;t have enough money to send all of their kids to college, but were able to pay for the non-tuition expenses we couldn&#x27;t cover ourselves on school jobs.<p>I don&#x27;t know what student loans would have looked like for a family in an equivalent position in the late 80&#x27;s.<p>My main hope is that barring some form of socialized education system happening in the next 20+ years that I&#x27;m able to pay for the educations of any future kids of mine without severely hurting myself financially, and succeed in raising them in such a way where they understand and appreciate the gravity of such a thing.')
