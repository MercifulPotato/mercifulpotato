It may help shed some light onto your question:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Plinz&#x2F;status&#x2F;1339330010684002304" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Plinz&#x2F;status&#x2F;1339330010684002304</a><p>&gt; In some contexts, the meaning of the words (&#x27;racist&#x27; and &#x27;sexist&#x27;) has shifted from “assigning lower value to a person because of their race or gender” to “infidel” and “heretic”. If you question virgin birth, you don’t correct important facts. You state that you are a heretic, and you’ll be ostracized.<p>&gt; Every religious movement asks its adherents for a public commitment to a sacred creed to show allegiance. The creed cannot be literally true, or random people would profess it. If you deny it, you will invoke ire of all adherents. If you go down defending it, you are a martyr.<p>&gt; This leads to some unpleasant effects on the margins, but many young people see a genuine need for a new, atheist religious movement, since both the theist religions and the rationalist liberalism of previous generations are failing to adress their social and existential issues.')
