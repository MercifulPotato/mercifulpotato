The person who was allowed to &quot;milk the system&quot; in the office, surely, will be allowed to do the same when they are working from home. It seems unreasonable to me an employee&#x27;s manager would change their behavior based on where the employee happened to be working.<p>I don&#x27;t believe Marissa Meier demonstrated that managers significantly improved when their employees were required to work full time in the office. I think that would be the interesting measure here: do managers really perform better when their direct reports are in the office?')
