My S9 has a cracked screen and my GPS UI is visibly burnt into the screen. Since my stand-alone camera fell apart, it&#x27;s the only camera I have, and it&#x27;s not good.<p>Even then, the upgrade doesn&#x27;t solve a 600â‚¬ problem. This expense has an abysmal Euro to pleasure ratio. It costs about the same to ride a motorcycle for a week in the Atlas mountains. I cancelled my preorder. I think I can wait a year or two still.<p>When you have some spare money, it&#x27;s easy to start shopping for ways to spend it. It&#x27;s good to remind yourself that you sold hours of your life to earn that money.')
