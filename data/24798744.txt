The prof does not have to manually copy-paste anything anywhere.<p>If there is still trouble in your courses, ask your prof to paste the Zoom link with password on the hompage of your Canvas course (they can add it as first module item if using Modules as homepage)<p>As for the submission issue, I think Canvas will only tell you about multiple or unlimited attempts on an assignment if you have them. If only one attempt is allowed, then it says nothing. I agree that this is a bug.')
