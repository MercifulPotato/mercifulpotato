What are they getting in return? Don&#x27;t say &quot;food, shelter, and education&quot; because in your scenario, they already get those. What are we doing to incentivize these people to provide food, shelter, and education for everyone else?<p>What are you doing to be provided of a body and the planet?<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not talking about luxury either. I&#x27;m asking where the food, shelter, and education for everyone is supposed to come from.<p>We&#x27;ve come to a technological point in civilization where people shouldn&#x27;t have to do labor for these basic things. It&#x27;s part of advancing civilization. We can allow people to dedicate their time to whatever other endevours we could think of instead of demanding repititive intense labor work just for the sake of keeping them busy.<p>&gt; They are conditional upon satisfactory performance of the duties they were hired to perform.<p>Conditional to me means if you give me A I&#x27;ll return B. When I hire someone I don&#x27;t wait for A (performance) to be given, I provide B (Desk, computer, Office, Electricity...) forfront. The analogy of sending soldiers to war also resonate. We don&#x27;t send naked bodies to war and is not like they had to work for all the gear either. Where did all these expensive gear came from? which soldier worked so hard to get it? Its not like you know they will win the war beforehand either.<p>&gt; You want governments to provide better food and shelter for certain people? Who gets the best food? The people in charge, or what?<p>The best food (luxury), is for those who break through and are able to contribute further to society. You can think of the Silicon Valley crowd as an example.<p>Overall, if you go back in history, the majority of the people we praise these days, created their master pieces as a result of working in their leisure time. Eistein didn&#x27;t create all his work because he was in a sweatshop having to punch numbers in a sheet.<p>Something in common most of these individuals had, was being part of the noble class or having access to that financial network. So, they had all the basics pretty much taken care for. I&#x27;m pretty sure if da Vinci had to punch hours in a sweatshop he wouldn&#x27;t have been able to create half of his work.<p>If you look throughout the history of civilization, you&#x27;d come to the conclusion that keeping people poor is just another way of ostracise a social class for the benefit of the elite few.')
