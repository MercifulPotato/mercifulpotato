We may congratulate ourselves when we find one that turns out can be applied elsewhere, and even program it into our compiler, but these are benefits more often of luck than skill, and are often much less durable than we hoped, washed away in the next microarchitectural generation, and sometimes even come to degrade performance.<p>In the second example cited, recent Gcc versions deliberately intersperse other instructions between those that could be fused, to fill in for pipeline delays in a previous generation; but the benchmarks referenced for current chips were compiled with a previous compiler that didn&#x27;t. So, current compilers improve performance for obsolete hardware and pessimize current hardware.<p>Potential improvements in the next microarchitectural generation are often held hostage by optimizations performed in old compilers, used in reference benchmarks, that would be pessimizations in the better microarchitecture (therefore) not shipped.')
