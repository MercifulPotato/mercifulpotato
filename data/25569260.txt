For me that plant was Cannabis. Doing my own micro grow in a 22x38x64 [cm] box forced me to learn about all sorts of things of relevance to a plant:<p>- light intensitiy, spectrum, sources<p>- fertilizers<p>- soil types<p>- watering patterns and methods<p>- vermins and how to deal with them<p>- plant physiology and developmental phases<p>- water quality, pH levels<p>also I think that it&#x27;s worth starting from seed. this makes it more personal.<p>another interesting plant is cactus (in my case San Pedros to be specific). though, they are much less of a hassle compared to Cannabis. but that led me to asking about how cactusses anatomically relate to regular plants, needed to learn yet another watering pattern, looking forward to grafting.<p>vegetables are also cool. I personally don&#x27;t find much interest in plants which are just standing around, serving no purpose - pretty much exactly what I&#x27;d get from those suggested in the article.')
