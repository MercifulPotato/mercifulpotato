They&#x27;re in folders all over my computers and backup drives. Does that mean I&#x27;m a hoarder? This article doesn&#x27;t seem to make clear what exactly is a hoarder. Documents left over from a job 8 years ago still on my hard drive. Is that hoarding? I guess the real question is: Why is digital hoarding a bad thing; where&#x27;s the harm??')
