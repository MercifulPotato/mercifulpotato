You mean the snowy towns or the hilly towns or...?<p>&gt; I think there is also some outcome bias towards cars because they’re a comfortable&#x2F; known quantity for most people.<p>There&#x27;s a bias toward cars since it&#x27;s incentivized to drive cars. Our laws mean everything is far apart so trips are far and our transportation infrastructure is almost all fast or long roads. These are choices that prop up cars: if you could go to the grocery store with a short trip without a high risk of being hit by a car, more people would walk or ride a bike there. If transit was convenient, people would take it. People just want to get where they&#x27;re going: cars are the best way to do that in the US because we have decided to incentivize car use over other options.')
