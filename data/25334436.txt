We simply do not have 30 years to become free from fossil fuels<p>My understanding is that despite +2C being an important limit we should not cross, that every bit of warming we stop above that provides increasing benefit because every bit above +2C is increasingly harmful (i.e. the increase from +3C to +4C is much worse than the increase from +2C to +3C).')
