Unfortunately everything else sucks as well.<p>Signal Messenger is as good an example as anything. To use it effectively you need to know these concepts:<p>* What safety numbers are. Why you need to use them to establish an identity for a contact. Why you need to do something when they unexpectedly change. What that something is that you need to do.<p>* Why you can&#x27;t keep around old messages if you want forward secrecy. What forward secrecy is and why you might want it.<p>* What deniability is. What you have to do if you want to attempt to exercise it.<p>Note that Signal ended up making it significantly easier to ignore the change of safety numbers some years ago. The users simply were bothered with no idea of why it was important.<p>Public key cryptography is complicated and involves multiple basic concepts that need to be learned if you are going to use it for messaging. Making things more complicated and adding features as in the case of Signal protocol does not help if it adds to the list of concepts. We haven&#x27;t yet come to terms with the basic stuff.<p>There seems to be a cycle here. Someone comes out with a cool new thing. Regular people fail to be able to use that thing. No one seems to know why. Repeat. Signal is a good current example of that.<p>The thing is, the root cause has been known for something like 20 years now. I will leave with a quote from the classic encrypted messaging study, Why Johnny Can&#x27;t Encrypt:<p>&gt;... it is clear that there is a need to communicate an accurate conceptual model of the security to the user as quickly as possible.  The smaller and simpler that conceptual model is, the more plausible it will be that we can succeed in doing so.')
