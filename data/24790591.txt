They routinely called up two previous places I worked and offered to remove bad reviews if we paid them, which we declined. One of the bad reviews eventually became prominently featured. To be honest it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if they wrote the review themselves, that&#x27;s how scummy I feel this company is.<p>Totally garbage business model, and if anyone reading this works there I hope you re-evaluate your life&#x27;s purpose - you only get so many years and using them to help Glassdoor seems really terrible. What an ethically bankrupt piece of worthless trash that place is.')
