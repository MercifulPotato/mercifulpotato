So if I listen to artist X for 10 minutes, and you listen to artist Y for 60 minutes, then artist X gets 10% of the total money and artist Y gets 60%. It would make more sense if each subscriber&#x27;s money were split between the artists they listen to.<p><i>I&#x27;m not sure if this is still the case.</i>')
