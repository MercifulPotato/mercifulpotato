A true independent unlimited mobile connection will set you back $45 USD or so with first 40GB at full speed.<p>Realistically speaking the 20USD&#x2F;month is already quite reasonable, if world as it was pre-COVID I might coerce some friends and family to join the plan with me.<p>But I really would prefer 25 USD no strings attached.')
