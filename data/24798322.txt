Item(by='notRobot', descendants=None, kids=[24798473, 24798750, 24798525], score=None, time=1602831905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24790350, text='That website is really crappy for a tech company. The videos are absolutely unwatchable on mobile, even when I try to open them in desktop view. The YouTube embed is squeezed into a narrow, unusable box. Did you even test your website on mobile? C&#x27;mon, guys.<p>Furthermore, all the explanations are in videos and not in text? I don&#x27;t want to watch a bunch of videos just to figure out what this thing is. AND the videos don&#x27;t have captions. So if I have a hearing disability, there&#x27;s no way for me to figure out what you guys are doing?<p>Is it too much to expect a YC company to have a half-decent website?')
