Francis Godwin&#x27;s story is worth a read for anyone interested in the history of science fiction. The part about using geese to fly to the moon is fun, but it undersells Godwin&#x27;s scientific imagination. A lot of things happen in the story:<p>- The narrator asserts his agreement with Copernicus that the Earth rotates on its axis<p>- The narrator discovers that the force of gravity is less on the Moon than on the Earth, allowing him to leap around and also allowing creatures there to grow very large<p>- The narrator reasons that gravity is &quot;a secret Property of the Globe of the Earth, or rather something within it, as the Load-stone draweth Iron&quot; (an insight probably inspired by the work of William Gilbert)<p>- Although science in the modern sense was still being invented, making this &quot;proto&quot; science fiction, the narrator becomes probably the first character to assert his speculative fiction isn&#x27;t magic (&quot;finding in all my Discourse nothing tending to Magick&quot;)<p>- So when the narrator is given a stone made of &quot;Ebelus&quot; and finds that he can control gravity depending on which way the stone is oriented, that&#x27;s probably the first appearance of a non-magical anti-gravity technology in fiction<p>- It&#x27;s also probably the first proto SF to borrow from linguistics, because the narrator finds that people on the Moon speak using a language based on music and he makes an explicit analogy toward the end with tonal languages such as Mandarin<p>My feeling is it&#x27;s also a much more readable piece than de Bergerac&#x27;s later story, which is inspired by Godwin but adds to it a bunch of dry old &#x27;natural philosophy.&#x27;<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s available online:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikisource.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Strange_Voyage_and_Adventures_of_Domingo_Gonsales,_to_the_World_in_the_Moon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikisource.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Strange_Voyage_and_Advent...</a>')
