I know it’s not always easy to share, but definitely appreciate it. Maybe we can add an opt-in for our analytics: we mostly use them to understand what we should build next (or measure when we do A&#x2F;B tests in the app), as well as be able to help when people get in touch with a coach via Intercom. All of that can&#x2F;should be optional  though, so I’ll bring that to our board and see if we can do something there.<p>Also, there’s no harm at all in caring about privacy, rather the opposite, so your opinion is 100% valid!')
