Item(by='dataflow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611531514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25892750, text='&gt; I’m a member of the Django technical board and have been involved with its development for quite a while. Is that widely used or general purpose enough?<p>That&#x27;s not quite what I was saying here. Note I said &quot;wide <i>variety</i> of usage&quot;, not &quot;widely used&quot;. Django is a web development framework—and its purpose is very clear and specific: to build a web app. Crucially, a web framework knows what its encoding constraints are at its boundaries, and it is <i>supposed</i> to enforce them. For examples, HTTP headers are known to be ASCII, HTML files have &lt;meta ...&gt; tags to declare encodings, etc.  So if a user says (say) &quot;what if I want to output non-ASCII in the headers?&quot;, your response is supposed to be &quot;we <i>don&#x27;t let you do that</i> because that&#x27;s <i>actually wrong</i>&quot;. Contrast this with platform I&#x2F;O where the library is supposed to work <i>transparently</i> without any knowledge of any encoding (or lack thereof) for the data it deals with, because that&#x27;s a higher-level concern and you don&#x27;t expect the library to impose artificial constraints of its own.')
