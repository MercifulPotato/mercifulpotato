Me.<p>I was an alienated, disaffected youth.  Do you know what a Bagger 288 is?  I used to day dream about driving one of those through my city, ripping up entire neighborhoods.  When society systematically fails you it&#x27;s easy to feel that &quot;<i>Everyone</i> deserves to suffer because <i>everyone</i> is to blame.&quot;  (A line from Aeon Flux that haunted me for years.  IIRC the character who says it has some sort of emotional breakthrough and winds up donating his arm to a little armless kid or something.  Weird show.)<p>But you don&#x27;t have to be a genius to figure out that kids mostly don&#x27;t come prepackaged with severe mental and emotional problems.<p>Back in school, the hyperactive kid who rubbed his crotch on my head?
