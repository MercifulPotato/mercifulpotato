Your time is valuable and much better spent building something no one else has yet.<p>I was once heavily afflicted by NIH, but with experience I realized how much time I was wasting stubbornly trying to reinvent the wheel. That’s actually a great analogy if you think about it—-the original wheels were fashioned out of wood and are quite simple in concept, but creating modern wheels require s tons of specialized tools and knowledge to build. It doesn’t make sense to attempt this if I can just buy a premade one that suits my needs. That premade wheel also has the benefit of huge amounts of iteration in response to problems encountered over time, and I would probably need to replicate at least some of that in order to build something competitive with the existing solution.<p>In the realm of code, using other people’s solutions when available lets me focus on the original problem I want to solve. It also allows me to minimize the amount of code I need to actually maintain myself, since typically there’s a group of people that are collectively much more knowledgeable than me doing that for free. If I ever do have a reason to know how the library works (patches, bug fixes, behavioral questions, curiosity), I’ve found it much quicker to figure out how the code works rather than write my own.')
