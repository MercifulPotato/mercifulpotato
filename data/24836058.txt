Ideally these customers should be from a single target market in a single geographic region. The idea is that you work with them to help ensure you&#x27;re building the right product for the target market.<p>I&#x27;m looking for any advice and experience in how you might&#x27;ve gone about acquiring these customers (ideally small to medium business) and what incentives, if any, you might&#x27;ve offered for them to come on the journey with you. And how crucial was it in your experience in achieving success as a startup.<p>The skeptical part of me is wondering how many people actually have the time and energy to partake in such a program, so very keen to hear real world experiences.')
