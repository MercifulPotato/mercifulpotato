The fact it didn&#x27;t make _this one_ is not really relevant to postulate that academia is inefficient.<p>It happens that the team at deepmind is apparently pretty damn good at deep learning problems, so they&#x27;re going faster than matching academia labs.<p>It&#x27;s not to say that academia has none of the problems you mentioned, but it&#x27;s imo unreasonable to expect that, in a world where both public and private labs exist, only public ones would make advances.')
