Do you ship a big 100W charger with an iPhone? This issue has existed previously with USB but it seems trickier at the moment. Maybe better to punt from the perspective of Apple. And at least &quot;we&#x27;re providing a charging cable from an increasingly common standard plug.&quot;<p>(And yeah, if I bought this phone, I&#x27;d have a couple USB-C chargers but no cable though would probably use USB-A&#x2F;wireless charging anyway.)')
