In other professions like doctors or lawyers, you can stay IC and no one says anything.<p>Even IC track is not exactly software development. As a tech lead, I do a lot less technical work, and spend a lot of time doing business processes. I wish we were a lot more like doctors, and focused on what we are good at doing instead of always going for next title on corporate ladder.')
