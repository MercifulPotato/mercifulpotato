I see what you mean. Every time I think about how to do things, its linear algebra time.<p>The thing is: I&#x27;ve had this feeling before in other maths: the more you study one math subject, the &quot;worse&quot; you get in another. There&#x27;s surprising things you can do with algebra alone without any calculus... but once you learn calculus, you kinda forget those old algebra tricks.')
