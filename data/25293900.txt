Item(by='modeless', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607025698, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25293824, text='The fact that it&#x27;s a &quot;cultural property of the community&quot; doesn&#x27;t make it easy to change. Bitcoin is not just &quot;a computer program&quot;, it is a program <i>and</i> a blockchain. The same program with a different blockchain is not Bitcoin (there are plenty of those out there).<p>Adding more supply to the Bitcoin blockchain would require large numbers of people to work against their own interests, decimating the value of their own infrastructure investments and bitcoin holdings. It would be much, much more difficult to change than e.g. the supply of dollars or euros which are considered scarce enough for most purposes by most of the world. And, I contend, even more difficult than changing the supply of gold via asteroid mining. I doubt that even the second coming of Satoshi would be enough to do it (and I also very much doubt that Satoshi is still alive).')
