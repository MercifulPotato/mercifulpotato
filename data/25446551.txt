The US Federal government _creates_ money. Just up and makes it, essentially out of thin air. Congress could have, had they felt like cooperating, printed ten trillion dollars and given every single person in the US a semi-weekly $1000 direct deposit to get everyone through. Keynesian spending is only a problem during inflationary times, but in the middle of a pandemic when tens of millions of people are told they cannot work _is not one of those times_.<p>Ultimately Congress (i.e. Senate Republicans) decided that 8 million people thrown into poverty and 300,000 needless deaths are better than actually doing anything.')
