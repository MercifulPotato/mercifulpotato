It was fundamental to the semantics that looping wasn&#x27;t simple formally IIRC<p>&gt; he same reason of what exactly?<p>It&#x27;s literally there in the preceding sentence.<p>&gt; At what point Oberon code becomes verified?<p>It didn&#x27;t (AFAIK), hence my &quot;possibly not a good choice&quot;. But as you don&#x27;t know history, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Euclid_(programming_language)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Euclid_(programming_language)</a> which &quot;is descended from the Pascal programming language&quot;. IIRC the london underground train controller software was done with euclid. Please note the wide range of restrictions in the language - all for simplicity, from which reliability must in part depend.<p>&gt; I realise that you haven&#x27;t left Wirth&#x27;s lab for the past 30 years,<p>don&#x27;t be insulting<p>&gt; but there are hundreds of programming languages. Go ahead, you&#x27;ll learn a lot.<p>Like: scala? And C#? VB.net, VBScripting, a little bash, pascal, modula2, delphi, javascript, a  flex&#x2F;bison &amp; antlr, python, sql, prolog (edit: C &amp; C++) - these are all langs I&#x27;ve used commercially. If you want langs I&#x27;ve played with the list includes dylan, haskell, erlang, modula3 and others I can&#x27;t think of now.<p>Like I said, If you think you can do better then go ahead.<p>Edit: what your angry reaction is concealing from you is I&#x27;m not unsympathetic to your view, but you can&#x27;t see it and won&#x27;t learn from it.')
