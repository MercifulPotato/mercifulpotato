MySpace was the Geocities for the next generation. Express yourself, join a community, find new cool stuff. Facebook was the death of creativity until it eventually revived on Tumblr (and to a certain extent YouTube?).<p>If I have one feature request, it&#x27;s a dedicated music (or any kind of event, really) scene thing that lets local people curate events and share them in a central town square, and lets randos find those local events. It could drive a whole lot of people who&#x27;re not plugged into a scene to find awesome local events without having to go through some other portal, like newspaper event calendars, zines, rando facebook groups, etc. I spent a ridiculous amount of time curating events for punk shows by trawling MySpace pages because there was no other way to do it.')
