Discussing something on Reddit doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t post the content elsewhere. Write a blog post and post it on Reddit for exposure to both worlds.<p>Reddit, Twitter, and other fast moving websites are best for ephemeral discussions anyway. In most cases, that&#x27;s a feature rather than a bug. Writing up a thoughtful blog post that&#x27;s meant to be a lasting reference for many years takes a lot of effort, planning, preparation, editing, proofreading, and other work. The upper limit for this type of material is relatively low due to all of the effort.<p>On web forums Reddit and Twitter, people don&#x27;t feel obligated to write perfect posts, so the conversation flows more freely.<p>There&#x27;s a place for both long-lived and ephemeral content on the internet. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s productive to give blanket advice for people to avoid certain forums or deliberately withhold information to make a point.')
