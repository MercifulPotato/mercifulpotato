I feel like it takes a lot of skill to write a story about a wealthy&#x2F;successful person and prevent the audience from going &quot;boo-hooo, poor you in your mansion&quot;. But its not like it can&#x27;t be done, in fact I would have to plug both Breaking Bad and The Wire here. Both the shows go beyond the point where the initial characters achieved success in what they wanted to do. Both shows did it by expanding their universe of characters and topics. BB added more dangerous men Heisenberg can go against and The Wire started looking at the same problem from several angles (political, financial, etc). The last season even shows what a successful drug lord does.<p>I don&#x27;t like silicon valley either, and its precisely the same issue. They are laser focused on some characters and thus suffer from it.')
