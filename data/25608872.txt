The average Oracle developers probably has no inkling of how Oracle screws over their customers with onerous licensing, for example.<p>Insiders that aren&#x27;t in very senior management positions may not even be aware of the high-level decisions being made by their company. You often hear stories of employees being completely blind-sided when scandals or corruption are revealed.<p>Similarly, I&#x27;ve noticed that employees tend to make excuses for their company&#x27;s behaviour, casually dismissing bad behaviour that isn&#x27;t so easy to ignore for everyone else. This is tribalism at its finest.<p>Lastly, you hear rationalisations galore from people in senior management positions, carefully avoiding any mention of the real motivations for their bad behaviour. These lies are especially important when they speak to internal staff, especially staff they&#x27;re screwing over.<p>As a random example, I worked at a large company recently where they essentially fired their entire IT department and replaced them with an outsourcer that charged half as much.

The article was mostly true, but I guarantee you that 99% of the people at the company would have never known any of this.<p>Being an insider only gives you really detailed information about your own team, perhaps a dozen people. If you&#x27;re at a FAANG, this might be 0.01% of the company at large...')
