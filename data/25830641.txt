They couldn&#x27;t erase the real video record of where they were, but they could create fake video records showing them in 6 other locations around the world at the same time. (And browser logs, credit card purchases, chat histories, etc).<p>I wonder if at some point we&#x27;ll see deep fake profiles being made like that for obfuscation. 40 accounts with my name on facebook, all with similar but different histories and similar but different friends and travel histories. One of them is the real one and the rest deep fakes. Instead of being lost in silence, we can lose ourselves in noise.')
