If a member nation&#x27;s constitution requires something that would place them in violation a treaty agreement, then it would have to fix its constitution or be in violation.  The treaty itself doesn&#x27;t change municipal law, though.  (Unless it&#x27;s a country where it does, anyway.  But France is not one of them.)<p>&gt; unless they take over the execution of the prison sentence against the wanted person<p>Yes, that bit.
