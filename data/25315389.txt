These are mostly slower arm based machines that I think would be difficult to load a clean Linux onto them. I&#x27;d love to be wrong because the versions of Android are becoming quite slow on these devices.<p>I did pick up an inexpensive Intel bay trail tablet a couple years back that I now run Void Linux on. I don&#x27;t run any desktop environment on it. I don&#x27;t even have Xorg (or Wayland) installed! I mostly use it as an always on &quot;server&quot; and ssh into it daily. The only problem is that it seems like it&#x27;s not possible to turn the backlight off so eventually that will burn out I guess (I think lifetime is 100 000 hours). I did manage to set the brightness to 0 but for some reason the backlight will not turn off.')
