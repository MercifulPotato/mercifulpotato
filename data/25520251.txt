For example, closer to my area of knowledge, we&#x27;ve used our own executor &#x2F; provider along with the Virtual Kubelet project (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;virtual-kubelet&#x2F;virtual-kubelet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;virtual-kubelet&#x2F;virtual-kubelet</a>) instead of Kubelet.<p>We&#x27;re exploring where we can leverage the Kubernetes ecosystem, adapt components, or help contribute changes back that others can leverage to enable our use of more COTS components of Kubernetes.<p>tl;dr: We&#x27;re swapping out the engines while in flight')
