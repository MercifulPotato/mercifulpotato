I am an ML manager in a large ecommerce firm and we stand up our own feature store, experiment tracking system and model training diagnostic &#x2F; metric system (a la Tensorboard). It is exceedingly easy to DIY, I’ve been doing that stuff DIY with teams of less than 8 engineers for many years.<p>What I’ve seen is that most vendor solutions aren’t flexible enough. Many firms have their own on-prem and data privacy restrictions that make hosting model training artifacts on a vendor’s servers impossible, and it’s way easier to sell building in house.<p>I’m very surprised you are hearing that nobody is using MLflow and Kubeflow (though Kubeflow has a lot of genuine usability and bug problems). I am hearing the exact opposite. Everybody, from tiny 5 person startups to giant ecommerce firms is just spinning up simple stuff for model tracking, mostly around MLflow.')
