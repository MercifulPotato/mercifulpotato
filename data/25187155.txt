It was even present until (the unreleased) POWER10.<p>POWER chips up to and including 9 support &quot;SAO&quot;, Strong Access Ordering mode. It is mentioned in exactly one sentence in the CPU manual: &quot;The POWER9 core supports the SAO mode defined in Power ISA.&quot;<p>This feature appears to <i>solely</i> have existed for QuickTransit&#x27;s translation software, as POWER has a weaker memory model than x86.<p>Linux briefly mentions this in the man (2) page for mprotect, stating:<p><pre><code>  PROT_SAO (since Linux 2.6.26)\n    The memory should have strong access ordering.  This feature\n    is specific to the PowerPC architecture (version 2.06 of the\n    architecture specification adds the SAO CPU feature, and it is\n    available on POWER 7 or PowerPC A2, for example).</code></pre>')
