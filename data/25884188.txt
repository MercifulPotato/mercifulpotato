Selecting the RDBMS page cache size is a key performance parameter that is near impossible to get right on a mixed-use host, both non-dedicated servers and client desktop&#x2F;laptop. SQL Anywhere, which emphasizes zero-admin, has long supported <i>Dynamic Cache Sizing</i> [1] specifically for this mixed-use case which is&#x2F;was its bread-and-butter. I don&#x27;t know if any other RDBMSes do the same (MS SQL?).<p>As a side note, Apache Arrow&#x27;s main use case is similar, a column oriented data store shared by one-or-more client processes (Python, R, Julia, Matlab, etc.) on the same general purpose host. This is also now a key distinction between the Apple M1 and its big.LITTLE ARM SoC vs. Amazon Graviton built for server-side virtualized&#x2F;containerized instances. We should not conflate the two use-cases and understand that the best solution for one use case may not be the best for the other.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dcx.sybase.com&#x2F;1200&#x2F;en&#x2F;dbusage&#x2F;perform-bridgehead-4057199.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dcx.sybase.com&#x2F;1200&#x2F;en&#x2F;dbusage&#x2F;perform-bridgehead-405...</a>')
