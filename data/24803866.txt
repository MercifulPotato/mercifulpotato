The latter had more things binding them. One insight: In religious communes, sacrifices (no alcohol, etc) correlated with longevity. In secular communities, there was no correlation. Over there, every sacrifice had to be argued about and justified. There was less thrash in religious communes.<p>(Just found the author of the study&#x2F;studies: Sosis[3]<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0307455777&#x2F;ref=sr_1_1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Relig...</a><p>[2]: A commune being defined as a group of people not sharing kinship deciding to live and work together.<p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anthropology.uconn.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;944&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;2003-Sosis-Cooperation-and-commune-longevity.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anthropology.uconn.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;944&#x2F;...</a>')
