Flash was...though abused a lot, much more lightweight, able to slot into a randomo webpage without sticking out too much&#x2F;causing performance issues.<p>Also as a direct substitute, Unity has much inferior font rendering, and no built-in vector graphics capabilities.<p>If I was doing a 2D animation tool for browser export, I don’t see that unity would offer me much, and would come with a lot of downsides.')
