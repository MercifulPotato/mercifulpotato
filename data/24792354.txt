Instapaper has been my favorite, but then it was sold then it was bought back and little growth in features, and more importantly it seems on borrow times, which is the issue with most all of these that the point of them it save data that you can reference later on, sometimes many many years. Like how I can reference emails from over decades ago. But other than things like Gmail most services don&#x27;t stick around. Which is why I hope eventually it&#x27;s something that is offered natively in iOS. They have reading list which is the start of that, but it only has about 1% of the needed features, and so far has seen little to no attention from Apple. Open source self hosted options can solve some of those problems, but typically then don&#x27;t integrate with countless services as much as premium ones do, and requires a lot more ongoing maintenance and don&#x27;t have the polish or the native apps like the premium options. Having said all that, since there is no ideal long term solution, using something like this in the meantime maybe worth it, but 100% would require being able to export all the data at anytime.')
