I&#x27;m not arguing on behalf of people doing illegal things. I&#x27;m arguing against the framing of an app as the problem instead of the people committing illegal acts themselves. People use text messages for comms, people use Telegram, they use phone calls, they use a myriad of apps to communicate. Framing Parler as the problem is just a way of justifying further lockdowns on political speech and selective censorship and banning and a delegation of our sovereignty and liberty to the biased discretion of powerful corporate entities.')
