Ours aren&#x27;t even applied by hand. It only has to be made right when the automation module is updated, and that gets tested well before it goes to production.<p>Varnish rules are also not that difficult, but I said nothing of caching reverse proxy. I mentioned Memcached specifically in the context of federating traffic counts across multiple non-caching proxies.<p>Whether an application uses Memcached or not is irrelevant to the proxies.')
