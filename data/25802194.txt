Especially if you also consider the body of software surrounding zig&#x2F;rust. I believe zig developers are more likely to take a stance that libraries should be more specific and smaller, while rust libraries tend to be more all-encompassing. Even if the resulting code is small and efficient, the compiler has to do more work.<p>I think Bryan Cantrill had a pretty spot on description of this kind of thing in his &quot;values&quot; talk, even if zig is not on his list.')
