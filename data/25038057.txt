Rust has mature and production ready frameworks in Actix Web and Rocket, and newer ones like Warp and Tide. These provide everything youâ€™d expect from a web framework, from routing and middleware, to templating, and JSON&#x2F;form handling. There are crates for everything, and more!<p>I would pay for a reality show where a big Rails application needs to be replaced by Rust by the same engineers who built it.')
