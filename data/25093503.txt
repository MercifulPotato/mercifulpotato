It&#x27;s a lack of regulation to give recourse for individuals and lack of ability for them to be treated fairly by businesses.<p>We need to treat companies that put themselves into a position like utilities as utilities.  Give individuals actual transparency of why actions where taken, and an ability to appeal these decisions with transparency.<p>It will cost more, but that is ok.  What we have now is that the actions have caused real harm and the companies are unwilling to justify them.  That&#x27;s an abuse that needs to be removed through law.')
