But the restriction is that the entire f-string (after the f) needs to be a valid regular Python string.<p>Since this:<p>&quot;this is a &quot;regular&quot; string&quot;<p>isn&#x27;t valid, then neither is this:<p>f&quot;dict lookup: {d[&quot;key&quot;]}&quot;<p>However, we&#x27;ve talked about changing f-string parsing from a &quot;post-process regular strings&quot; mode, to instead having the tokenizer and parser themselves aware of f-strings. When we do that, the f-string example above will work.<p>(edit for formatting)')
