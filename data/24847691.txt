It was definitely used in entirely work-safe contexts where one would never dream of making anal sex references.<p>Of course, now that you mention it, I think your belief is likely common enough to make me reconsider its use! I think a lot of folks hearing &quot;pegging&quot; in 2020 probably think of the sex practice before they think of speedometers -- a lot of people don&#x27;t have cars, and many that do never notice the little pegs.<p>However, I do think &quot;pegging&quot; (a somewhat obscure IT jargon term, with obscure etymology) is in a different situation than &quot;grooming,&quot; an incredibly common everyday word. Retiring a bit of jargon is entirely different than retiring a an everyday word.')
