Item(by='XCSme', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602605390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24761012, text='Hi, thanks for the suggestions.<p>I searched for a long time to find the best way to distribute userTrack, and the best solution I found was to use DigitalOcean + cloud-init to automatically set-up the script. One problem I kept encountering was that most platforms only allow open-source software in their marketplace (I discussed this with some folks  at DigitalOcean and they said I would need at least a free version of the product).<p>I was also looking over Cloudron lately as it kept showing in HN threads, and I think I will contact some people there to get more info on the compatibility between my product&#x2F;pricing structure and their marketplace. I also looked over Docker, but again, the product should be in the public Docker registry. Maybe I can somehow put only the installation script in the Docker public registry, but I&#x27;m not sure if this is common&#x2F;allowed.<p>This is one reason why I think self-hosting is harder than it should be: there is no common way accross hosting providers to easily distribute an application, most of them have their own marketplaces with their own rules, requirements and custom configs.<p>Thank you a lot for the purchase, it really means a lot! Hopefully, in the near future, enough people would purchase userTrack so I can afford to start planning for an open-source release.')
