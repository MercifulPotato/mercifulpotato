The vast majority of truck innovation are related to electrification (which most major European rail corridors are already, and the last mile can be handled by the new dual power locomotives) and driver assistance (autonomous driving, dead spot detectors, emergency automated brakes, driver cab comfort).<p>&gt; Truck firms are far smaller and there are way more of them, so people can conceivably get ahead by doing things differently<p>Yeah, they cheat on the safety rules, and enjoy that <i>every</i> business has a road connection while very few businesses have a rail connection so it&#x27;s easier to do computer assisted magic in scheduling.')
