I don&#x27;t understand why people underestimate them so much. When they rolled their own crypto in some areas, people made fun of them, yet no one could break it. When they published their source code openly, people say they aren&#x27;t open source like signal. When FB bought WhatsApp, people seriously continued to choose it over Telegram, despite Telegram able to host much bigger chats, and so on. And being used all over the world, by the same government officials who were officially trying to get it offline LMAO.<p>I just don&#x27;t get what&#x27;s so bad about Telegram.')
