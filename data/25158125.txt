They&#x27;ll rank pages to generate as much money for Google as possible - that&#x27;s a balance between quality of results to keep users coming back, making sure the ranking order is <i>bad</i> enough that users have to click adverts instead of only using the search results, and making sure the ranking order is opaque enough to encourage companies to buy adverts rather than simply invest more in SEO.<p>The final point is the relevant one here - Google need to change the rules regularly in order to hamper company&#x27;s SEO efforts, which makes them buy more adverts until they can make it back to the top of the SERPs again.')
