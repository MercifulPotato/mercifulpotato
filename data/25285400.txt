Until Lollipop or Marshmallow arrived, we were discouraged or forbidden from having corporate accounts on personal phones, because there weren&#x27;t the necessary Blackberry-style features yet, e.g. remote wiping. I remember Honeycomb (the Xoom) having only encryption, but no wiping. At some point you could add your work account as the primary on your personal gift phones (dogfood ones were a different story), but that meant that the device got bricked when you left the company, forcing you to a factory reset — and there was still no good isolation.<p>I definitely had my personal account as the primary on my N5 along with a work profile and I believe that&#x27;s the first device&#x2F;OS combo where it was feasible, if you ignored the annoying duplicate app icons in the launcher. The first truly &quot;tolerated&quot; personal devices were probably the Christmas gift Chromebooks from a few years earlier, as long as you used Yubikeys.<p>Didn&#x27;t the policies even predate Android?
