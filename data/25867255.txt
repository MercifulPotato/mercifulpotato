There is a group of people tired of woke culture invading their workspace. There is another group of people who are in a Pro-Trump bubble and believe that the election was stolen. There is another group of &quot;libertarian &#x2F; free speech&quot; ideologues. There is another group who are surprised that a US President who had just received 74 million votes was &quot;silenced&quot; by big tech.<p>My guess is that most of the concern you see on HN is from people in the last group that are afraid of what it means for society if a President can be cancelled. Personally, I think that their concern is overblown because Trump wasn&#x27;t silenced he is just too lazy to take the time to come up with another messaging plan. I assume he is still on Twitter under a fake name hurling insults out at everyone.')
