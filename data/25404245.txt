This isn&#x27;t required to start GNOME (you can use any other display manager) and FreeBSD&#x2F;OpenBSD seem to be maintaining consolekit patches for it downstream. So I see why there is little incentive to fix this upstream. (On non-systemd Linux distros the focus has shifted to staying compatible with elogind, but that doesn&#x27;t work on BSD)')
