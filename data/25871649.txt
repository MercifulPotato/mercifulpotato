That&#x27;s a lot of extra bytes from some convenience when viewing logs or raw data etc.<p>UUID&#x27;s stored properly in binary form are only 16 bytes which can still be a concern over an 8 or 4 byte integer when you have a lot of them all over the place in a large db. (larger index more memory use).')
