GCS is dirt cheap even for terabytes of data, so as added bonus this gives me a \nhistory of all my files (eg, i still have backup archives from 2013). Both calls wrapped into a shell script that is regularly scheduled via a cronjob on my local server. Within my network i sync between laptop, pc and server via syncthing. Works well for me, even though it doesn&#x27;t handle file renames gracefully.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dar.linux.free.fr&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dar.linux.free.fr&#x2F;</a>')
