If you have an employee in a particular state, as a company you are now considered to have a presence in that state and would now be required to pay sales tax on sales to customers in that state (I think this used to be only sales people, but now is any employee).<p>There are a decent number of companies that will let employees work from no-sales-tax states (FL, TX, NV, NH etc) without question, but for other states, if they do much business there but don&#x27;t already have a &quot;presence&quot; there, then they&#x27;ll have to start paying sales tax to that state on any business they do there.')
