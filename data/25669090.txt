This design is optimized for product managers and that&#x27;s it.<p>1. No communication responsibilities. The product manager owns a team for the product and that&#x27;s it.<p>2. Maximal headcount. Need a tenths of a frontend dev? You get one fully for your team!<p>3. No technical understanding required. You just tell the DB guy to &quot;make things happen&quot; via user story. No engineering manager to argue with, no wholistic constraints to consider. Disk space, bandwidth? What is that? May playlist feature <i>needs</i> to store all permutations persistently for performance!<p>The greatest admission is the implicit acknowledgement that product managers <i>cannot</i> work efficiently with teams organized by discipline. In any other industry that is the bread and butter of management: Coordinate and plan with other departments. Here we just eliminate this.<p>And what&#x27;s the outcome? A coherent product? Far from it. You get a bunch of features glued together by a UI no one really owned. These features are not orthogonal and they definitely don&#x27;t compose well. Why? Because to do so the product managers of different teams would have to coordinate between themselves. The very thing they just admitted they cannot do efficiently.')
