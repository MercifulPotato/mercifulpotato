Item(by='CRConrad', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608032417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25424646, text='&gt; What do you mean by projections?<p>@Jtsummers puts it as “Map the problem into other domains”; another interpretation (or a variation on the same) is “look at it from a different angle” or “look at it in a different light”. Do both -- move around with your light source, shine a torch&#x2F;flashlight at your problem, and different shapes will be “projected” onto the wall behind it. Kind of like, if you are familiar with Hofstadter&#x27;s _Gödel, Escher, Bach_ -- remember that “G,E,B” cube pictured on the cover of many editions? A more or less abstract “thing” or idea can be “projected” into different practical views depending on perspective. In actual practical work talking about “projections” can of course feel a little highfalutin’; to me it&#x27;s a bit like always talking about your RDBMS tables or views as “relations”.<p>But in a more philosophical sense it is of course perfectly valid. And AFAICS it&#x27;s an age-old idea in Western philosophy; what I described above is essentially precisely what is known as _Plato&#x27;s Cave_. (Which incidentally is why @tenken’s identifying it as “Eastern” feels quite peculiar to me.)')
