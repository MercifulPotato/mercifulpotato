It&#x27;s not actually a slam dunk solved problem to say &quot;Just lose the weight.&quot;<p>It pretty much is a slam dunk solved problem to say &quot;If you are deficient in X, redress that.&quot; We know how to redress a vitamin D deficiency pretty confidently, simply and in a straight forward fashion.<p>I lost several dress sizes without trying by redressing other things, primarily nutrient deficiencies. I focused on eating an aggressively nutritious diet to redress a long list of deficiencies rooted in a genetic disorder that causes gut dysfunction.<p>So my experience fits with the general idea that &quot;Solving obesity is harder than it looks and the solution may be something non obvious in any given case.&quot; Maybe our mental models of what is going on there will evolve and what I am saying will be &quot;the obvious answer&quot; to future generations, but it&#x27;s not what is currently believed to be what works to solve obesity.<p>The current mantra is &quot;Calories in. Calories out.&quot; and leads to metrics like &quot;Eat less and exercise more&quot; and some people find that wholly unworkable or unsustainable for various reasons.')
