I would expect that every single speaker is asked for at least a draft of their slides a few weeks before the presentation. Either ignoring the keynote speaker or not supporting them in such a bizarre case speaks volumes about the organizers. They simply don&#x27;t seem to care about the content of the conference that much.')
