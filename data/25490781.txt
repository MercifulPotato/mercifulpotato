It was about the claim that america was founded on the principle of government by the consent of the governed.<p>I think your response proves my point.<p>&gt; One way to see this is to look at the state constitutions written in this era.<p>Well, minus the whole slavery thing enshrined in half of them (not to mention landownership requirements that lasted until the civil war in some places, and the net <i>reduction</i> in voting rights in the early 1800s).<p>Like even at its founding, the US was only marginally better than the UK in terms of enfranchisement. About 2% of Philidelphians were eligible voters. That&#x27;s the capital of \na free state with only a few slaves.<p>&gt; . A relatively small class of plantation owners got rich off slavery. They didn&#x27;t redistribute the proceeds across the entire white population. Economically, the slave-owning South, as a whole, lagged far behind the North, and slavery is a likely cause for that economic backwardness.<p>The south, for the 17th time <i>were not the only</i> people who benefitted. Northern businesses that depended on various plantation based exports also gained.<p>But even still, I agree that your average white farmer didn&#x27;t gain a lot, that&#x27;s true of capitalist economies, not slavery in particular. The gilded age didn&#x27;t fix wealth inequality.<p>The bigger question is whether or not the relatively rich and influential southern plantation owners had an outsized impact on, say, the development of universities and such.')
