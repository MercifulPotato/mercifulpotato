I vote for the party that sucks less. I don&#x27;t care for the Democrats, but I don&#x27;t loathe them quite as much as I do the Republicans.<p>I&#x27;d rather not vote at all; I&#x27;m not convinced it does anything but rubber-stamp the continued existence of a government that neither represents the people nor serves the general welfare particularly well, but I continue to vote despite my doubts because I could be wrong about its futility.')
