In most cases, after a one-time translation, it&#x27;s running as a native ARM executable, with less runtime overhead than emulation.<p>It&#x27;d be interesting to know how close the code quality is to what you&#x27;d get from generating ARM code from the compiler.  The jump from compiling to the M1 may not be too big if the translation is good.<p>Another question is whether it&#x27;s equally able to take advantage of the specialized execution units.  It&#x27;d be interesting to know whether the native M1 compiler can target those units directly or if they&#x27;re mostly used by Apple&#x27;s libraries. I&#x27;d bet on the latter, although since there&#x27;s no overhead of transferring data to the GPU, I wonder if there&#x27;s any opportunity there to expand usage there.')
