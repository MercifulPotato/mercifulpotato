That&#x27;s exactly what the AP1 hardware did in other cars.<p>AP would still avoid every accident it could before, but now additionally not kill people when it fails to uphold the very strongly implied (even if legally disclaimed) promises it&#x27;s marketing and creator love to make.<p>-<p>AP has a set of convenience features and safety features.<p>The convenience features all come with the disclaimer that the human must be attentive at all times while they&#x27;re engaged.<p>And in cases where the human is not full engaged because they&#x27;re placing too much trust in the convenience features, suddenly the convenience features are creating a <i>less safe situation than if the driver did not have them at all</i>, since the driver is now driving distracted.<p>The safety features cannot close the gap between a distracted driver and a non-distracted driver, that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re not seld-driving cars.<p>-<p>Or to put it another way, good enough <i>is</i> good enough for the safety features. But &quot;good enough&quot; is actually the most dangerous level of the convenience features, since they lull operators into a false sense of security with deadly consequences.<p>That&#x27;s why Google abandoned their equivalent project (which Elon spoke to them about before developing AP. Google&#x27;s project was called... Autopilot).<p>It was demonstrated that giving drivers that sort of &quot;good-enough&quot; convenience feature would be encouraging distracted behavior. But that didn&#x27;t stop Elon.<p>-<p>In fact, thinking about it, how sad is that? Google used cameras in their vehicle in conjunction with AP features and proved that people would misuse the system.<p>Knowing that Elon was in contact with them about the program, isn&#x27;t it such an odd coincidence that Elon has pushed back on driver monitoring?<p>It&#x27;s almost like he knows exactly what it would reveal, but doesn&#x27;t want to invite the trouble that comes with tracking such an inconvenient truth.')
