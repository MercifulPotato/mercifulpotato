Item(by='xapata', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604520204, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24992240, text='&gt; when the thing is very important to you<p>Your preferences will change over time.  When I was younger, I had an intense desire to provide some grand public good.  Now I regret those wasted years, and all I want to do is take pleasant walks around my neighborhood with my dog, and maybe play soccer in the park.<p>Most of us, almost tautologically, are similar to each other.  Ask some older people what their preferences are and you&#x27;ll have a reasonable idea of what you&#x27;ll be like at their age.  Sure, there will be generational differences, but the shift in yourself will be comparable to the shift that other people went through.<p>I shouldn&#x27;t say I regret those &quot;wasted&quot; years.  I regret them only to the extent I regret not having won the lottery, which is to say almost not at all.  However, I want to caution against committing to a decision that might limit your options in the future.  In particular, the choice of where to live has a dramatic effect on your career, your friends, and your family.')
