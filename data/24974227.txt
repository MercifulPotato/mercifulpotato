Polio and smallpox are also hard for the body to fight off but were some of the earliest vaccines (smallpox being the first according to Wikipedia).  I don&#x27;t think it implies that it is possible to create vaccines in cases where our body can fight the disease but then does not retain that resistance over time, although I would guess there is at lest some chance that is possible.')
