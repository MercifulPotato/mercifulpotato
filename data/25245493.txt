A good chunk of that money is from your house which you no longer have. Once you buy another (or rent) those will be big drains on your cash. So you really don&#x27;t have $1 million free and clear to retire on.<p>It sounds like you are still young, only working 8 years. Early 30&#x27;s? Unless you move to a low cost area and live very frugally, $1 million might not last into old age.<p>Being a &quot;millionaire&quot; isn&#x27;t what it used to be. It&#x27;s a lot of money to be sure, but you are not rich. It may grant a lifetime of frugal retired living, not rich retired living.')
