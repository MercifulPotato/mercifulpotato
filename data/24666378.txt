It’s not even related to the flu, and it shares only a subset of symptoms. It’s also got a significantly higher mortality rate and different R0, - it seems to spread more readily and it’s therefore reasonable to believe through slightly different means,<p>There’s growing evidence that there is a much larger proportion of people who acquire it and develop either no or very minimal symptoms. It’s not at all clear yet if those people shed enough virus particles to be a significant transmission vector.<p>So, yeah - for many people, COVID-19 is “just the flu” or even “just a runny nose”. We just don’t know how many people are going to react that way, why, who they will be, or what impact they may have in friends and family.<p>Discounting it as you seem to be is a recipe for unnecessary deaths. Overestimating it is as well.')
