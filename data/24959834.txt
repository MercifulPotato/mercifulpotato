Whether this is a good idea is an open question because we don&#x27;t yet have such high performance RISC-V chips, but that&#x27;s what the RISC-V designers are thinking.  At the same time it permits very simple implementations which wouldn&#x27;t be possible if the base instruction set contained every pet instruction that someone thought was a good idea.<p>Note macro op fusion is widely used for other architectures already, particularly ones like x86 where what the processor actually runs looks nothing like the machine code.')
