Conservatism is more about everyone being in their proper place, within some hierarchy.  For instance when France fell to the nazis they needed a new motto to replace “liberty, equality, brotherhood”.  They chose “work, family, country”.  You can see where it comes from.  A mans role is to obey his boss, a woman’s role is in the home, and everyone is loyal to the state.  Everyone in their place.
