With DNNs, after training, all you need are the model parameters. For very large datasets, keeping around even a small part of your training data may not be feasible.<p>Furthermore, number of parameters do not (necessarily) grow with the size of the training data, can be reused if you get more data, can be quantized&#x2F;pruned&#x2F;etc. There&#x27;s not really an easy way to do these things with SVMs as far as I understand.')
