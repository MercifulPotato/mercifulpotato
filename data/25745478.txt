If you&#x27;re hoping to use the machine purely from the CLI (like, when sshing into your work machine) it won&#x27;t work well.<p>It is significantly less powerful than LittleSnitch, some options don&#x27;t exist (like, allowing access to a domain), but you get similar functionality in many cases.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s definitely worth testing out to see if it works for you.')
