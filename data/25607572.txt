Item(by='geocar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609537910, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25604724, text='&gt; Genuine question here: what&#x27;s the better way?<p>You tell them what the job is like, what is expected of them, and what the best way to work with you is, then you you ask if that&#x27;s what they want, and how much it&#x27;s going to take to get them in the door. That&#x27;s it.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t ask an accountant what the Corrodium 3 Deduction is; I&#x27;d tell them I need them to file my taxes, that I need them to own the process and chase whoever they need (even if that&#x27;s me).<p>&gt; I think at the core of the problem is that most companies are extremely risk adverse in their hiring and would gladly miss a Jeff Dean type of super-performer in order to reduce their number of bad hires.<p>I think you&#x27;re probably right, but if someone lies to you and says they can do a job that they clearly can&#x27;t, you should fire them.<p>This should be unusual because getting a new job can be stressful, and nobody wants to put themselves into a job they can&#x27;t do, so it&#x27;s rare that you even have to consider this -- but it <i>does</i> happen, and unless you&#x27;re a sociopath, it&#x27;s going to make you shy about ever having to go through it again, because you&#x27;re <i>not</i> going to want to fire anybody. It sucks for you, and it sucks for them, and it sucks for the team who see the revolving door, but <i>nobody</i> benefits from the wrong fit in the long run, so <i>you</i> just need to suck it up and do it.<p>So be firm, and if it turns out you&#x27;re firing a lot of people straight in the door, look inwards: you&#x27;re probably not being honest with them (or perhaps yourself) what the job actually is. Figuring <i>that</i> out instead of some new programming puzzle to torture grads with is going to pay dividends.')
