Same  with their brand products, I m sure some other brands will have  complained about unfair competition , but maybe their anticompetitive behavior hasn&#x27;t been egregious enough to bring the ire of politicians. Tech OTOH has been quite aggressively monopolistic in certain areas, and needlessly so, with things like the App Store(apple has way too much profit to justify keeping the app tax so high). In a way ... they make themselves look overly greedy and bring it upon themselves.')
