Less fine when you run half the internet.<p>It&#x27;s never fine.<p>The abdication of responsibility and, more importantly, liability to algorithms is everything that&#x27;s wrong with the internet and the economy. The reason these tech conglomerates are able to get so big when companies before them couldn&#x27;t is because it&#x27;s impossible to scale the way they have without employing thousands of humans to do the jobs that are being poorly done by their algorithms. Nothing they&#x27;re doing is really a new idea, they just cut costs and made the business more profitable. The promise is that the algorithms&#x2F;AI can do just as good of a job as humans but that was always a lie and, by the time everyone caught on, they were &quot;too big to fail&quot;.')
