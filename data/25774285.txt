European countries, and increasing gross salary kinda stops making sense at some point<p>It would be great, if these issues were addressed, and there are well-known ways to do that. But I&#x27;m not sure, if increasing salaries is a noble goal per se. While much lower than in US, they are still decent and allow one to live a comfortable life. So it&#x27;s rather US being an outrageous outlier (no wonder, given that post-WWII economy is operated on their terms). The elephant in the room here (as almost everywhere in the world) is real estate. Now that one (and prevalence of mortgage) is a huge issue, and it needs to be solved at all costs, even if just for the sake of younger people.<p>As for salaries, most developers simply don&#x27;t generate that much real value (real, not money). Though they somewhat compensate for inproportionate incomes on a &quot;higher&quot; level of economy by over-spending the surplus above the necessary living costs, though I doubt it&#x27;s by design.<p>Overall, I&#x27;d argue, that developer (and many other occupations) salaries should be lower, so that we had fewer get-rich-quickers to work and to compete with. To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying that a dev should earn as a janitor, but rather on par with other &quot;highly skilled&quot; occupations.')
