The settlement house will only trust Robinhood as far as Robinhood has collateral.<p>This is not a problem for most stocks, because they have a balanced flow of orders (for every one of RH&#x27;s customers buying, there&#x27;s another one selling, which raises and then lowers their collateral requirement.) This is not a problem for bigger brokerages, who have larger cash reserves, to keep as collateral.<p>The tl;dr is that if you&#x27;re going to do an uncoordinated mob short squeeze, with unprecedented volume and volatility, don&#x27;t use a discount broker to do it.')
