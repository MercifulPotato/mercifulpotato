Liberals don&#x27;t swoon for this any more than they do for a mandatory curfew to curb coronavirus cases. The powers of SV are a lot and I would hope that out of the ashes of the last four years we get a) a more progressive Conservative party and b) a more diversified collection of service providers, to combat AWS, and the like.<p>All of these companies, for what it&#x27;s worth, seems to only use their power when its socially acceptable. For instance, they continue to abide by restrictive Chinese laws for the benefit of money. I&#x27;m convinced they will submit to the will of the state in Poland as well, where freedom of speech appears to mean something entirely different.')
