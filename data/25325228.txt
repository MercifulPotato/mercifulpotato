You get C# which is great (but I&#x27;m biased), and F# if you have a functional paradigm. Both EF and Dapper can pretty easily hook into Postgres. I&#x27;m also partial to Azure over AWS so there&#x27;s obviously a bias toward C# over something like Java there. There are similarly great ES&#x2F;CQRS libraries for .NET - I&#x27;m not sure about CDC on the Postgres side but they exist for SQL Server if you&#x27;re using that.')
