He said too many wrong things too quickly for me to actually counter them all.<p>One that still sticks in my mind was him saying “Ladies and Gentlemen, I have found the kernel of this man’s beliefs. Either you believe in eternal energy or eternal God.” - literally every part of that sentence is false, but the dumb was too shocking for me to respond to.<p>Given what I know now, I think he technically blasphemed against his own faith multiple times… but I <i>don’t</i> think I convinced anyone who was on the fence.')
