The question the guy is asking is a straight up math problem. I don&#x27;t know about the average person here, but who often needs to calculate the area of a circle of determine factorials on a daily basis of coding? I can understand if you are in a field with the actual sciences or in gaming regarding physics. But for those of us who just manipulate data all day, why would you ask that question? We know how to program, not to do math. Sure if you gave us time to learn about how to do that kind of math we could figure it out, but on the spot asking &quot;Do this math problem but in code&quot; is like telling a construction laborer at an interview &quot;What would you estimate is the proper weight of concrete laid upon a steel beam 200ft long?&quot;')
