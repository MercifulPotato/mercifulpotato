Gentrification is the destruction of long-standing neighborhoods and the displacement of poor people, who may have no good place to go and lose their support structures. Often, those poor people rent their homes&#x2F;apartments, and so they don&#x27;t benefit from the increase in prices. Their rent just goes up until they have to leave.<p>Rich people fleeing doesn&#x27;t bring them back. Whatever they suffered in displacement is just sunk. In the very long term it may form part of a new cycle of gentrification, but only after the neighborhood has lost a lot of its old value and is usually accompanied by the kinds of desperation that poverty causes.<p>So it&#x27;s not a good thing -- though you&#x27;re right that this study is so dubious that it may not even really be an issue.')
