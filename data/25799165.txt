I learned of it in another thread on HN a few months ago. People are realizing that what they write will be translated by machine and are adjusting their written language accordingly. This is one of those interesting side effects of tech on culture that is not immediately obvious, I think.<p>It&#x27;s basically an extension of &quot;international English&quot; which avoids things like phrasal verbs or coloquialisms, but more from the standpoint of, &quot;If my coworker in Shenzhen puts this text into Google Translate and tries to create documentation from it, is it going to sound ridiculous?&quot; And then doing a few translate&#x2F;reverse-translate passes yourself until you&#x27;ve tweaked the text enough so the input and output is the same. Eventually, you start writing this way by default.<p>This could be considered the same as telegram abbreviations, or even text-speak like &quot;LOL&quot; or whatever, but the key in this instance is we&#x27;re changing our way of communicating based on what a <i>computer can understand</i>, not a fellow human.')
