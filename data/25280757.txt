I cannot imagine having to go back and fourth about calendar slots every time I have to schedule a meeting, and this feature saves so much time.<p>&gt;  Or see stats about the changelists submitted, bugs resolved, etc. of each person?<p>I&#x27;m a bit ambivalent about these metrics.  At least they are somewhat related to work results, rather than &quot;how busy are you&quot; metrics like those rolled back by MS.  It&#x27;s also just a visualization of data which is already publicly available in the git history.<p>&gt;  Or see their dot when they are viewing a document?<p>This one I think is a bit different.  In a world with remote collaborative editing, I think this gives you more visibility about who might be looking over your shoulder while you are working rather than being a form of surveillance.')
