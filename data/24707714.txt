IF you give citizenship to folks born there - or even born there to citizens, etc - then it isn&#x27;t at all about loyalty.<p>Same with granting asylum seekers citizenship and so on. Same with allowing dual citizenship - are you loyal to two countries? Citizenship is never about loyalty.<p>Citizenship has a lot more to do with the ways you contribute to the country. Folks born in a country are likely to live there for life and contribute by speaking the local language, participating in local customs, being educated in and working in the country, and most importantly, paying taxes. This is why some categories are seen as &quot;less important&quot;: Because folks think that some categories won&#x27;t integrate enough (and it is impossible for an immigrant to ever do this, regardless of background), some won&#x27;t learn enough language, or won&#x27;t contribute as much. The truth of this is thrown out the window, of course, and there is no real objective test to test these sorts of things. Time in country might be one of the better tests, though it isn&#x27;t perfect.')
