But for me it&#x27;s one of the first tools I reach for when I find a bug or confusing code, trying to understand the intent.<p>If it&#x27;s rebased then you&#x27;re not reading the history; you&#x27;re reading an artificial modification of what actually happened, performed by someone (possibly past-you) who thinks they know more about what you&#x27;re trying to do.<p>I don&#x27;t rebase precisely because I want to read the history to see what happened.')
