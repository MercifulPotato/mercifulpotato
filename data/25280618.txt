I imagine like any such large and established standard it would require a herculean effort, that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s not open just that it can&#x27;t possibly accept any random idea that comes along and still continue to serve its huge user base.<p>But let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re right and call it a closed standard. Then this change drops support for one older, clunkier closed standard in favor of the current closed standard. Still doesn&#x27;t seem like anything to get upset over.')
