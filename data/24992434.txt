The entrants and their families are invited to enjoy work-life balance unique to Finland and guided to stay safe amidst the global pandemic in a city that is run based on a pragmatic, science-driven approach.\n\n  Open for applications today, the program provides a new red-carpet entry scheme to Helsinki, one of the world’s leading technology hubs. Helsinki is the capital of Finland, a strong European democracy built on shared values and equality. Finland ranks the best in the world in happiness, a work-life balance, digital public services, education and environmental health, among others.\n\n  The ’90 Day Finn’ program is run by Helsinki Business Hub, the international trade and investment promotion agency for the Finnish capital region.\n\n  Helsinki Business Hub will ensure a smooth stay for the selected participants. Everything from needed documentation to housing, daycare, schools and healthcare will be arranged to suit the participants’ individual needs. In-person introductions to local technology hubs and business networks will help entrants get settled and up to speed.\n\n  “During a time of lockdowns, wildfires, social injustices and political turmoil, people living in strongly affected yet highly expensive areas have begun to ask themselves how they could have both a career and an enjoyable family life,” says Johanna Huurre, Marketing Communications Director at Helsinki Business Hub. “We decided to offer them an opportunity to experience what life has to offer outside of their regular hoods. In the Helsinki region, both singles, couples and families are able to combine work, family and leisure in a way that is hard to imagine for many Americans,” continues Johanna Huurre.</code></pre>')
