According to this hypothesis, supported by some early quotes, there were initially going to be 3 mentor characters to choose from:<p><pre><code>    Johnny Silverhand (tech solutions, tech weapons),\n    Morgan Blackhand (handguns?, power weapons),\n    Saburo Arasaka (Hacking, smart weapons)\n</code></pre>\nIt is said that 2018 e3 gameplay presentation featured the choice of mentors.<p>Then Keanu Reeves turned up. Eventually the marketing team had a brilliant idea to get more out of Keanu. And since he&#x27;s so awesome, why not make the game MORE about Keanu... In fact, why waste budget and manpower on the other 2 actors?<p>This type of problem with high profile actors is endemic in <i>movie industry</i>. A movie with Bruce Willis or Ryan Gosling will be about Bruce Willis and Ryan Gosling. The actors don&#x27;t have to even act that well because plot will be adjusted to play into their strengths.(Look how much screen time aging Bruce Willis got in Looper and the new Blade Runner!)<p>(polish)\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wykop.pl&#x2F;link&#x2F;5853285&#x2F;czy-rola-keanu-reevsa-jest-jednym-ze-zrodel-problemow-w-cyberpunku2077&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wykop.pl&#x2F;link&#x2F;5853285&#x2F;czy-rola-keanu-reevsa-jest...</a><p>There are various speculations in the thread, including that the game is so lacking in its systems (police, NPC schedules, driving...) because they were ordered to cut them out. They were meant to be in the game initially, but major direction shifts in the development meant they had to reassign developers to something else.<p>Some content in the game seems to support this line of thinking. There&#x27;s a quest with a monk that works slightly differently depending on which story act you&#x27;re in.<p>There are some hints that developers really wanted to make a great game, but were gaslighted and bullshitted by the management.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-12-18&#x2F;cyberpunk-game-maker-faces-hostile-staff-after-failed-launch" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-12-18&#x2F;cyberpunk...</a><p>----------<p>If you want to know my opinion, I think CDPR also overestimated their ability. A modern, urban world works very differently than fantasy sword game. CDPR had 3 games to perfect the formula, then they jumped into completely different setting. I don&#x27;t blame them, in fact I feel for them because it&#x27;s nice to work on something different once in a while.')
