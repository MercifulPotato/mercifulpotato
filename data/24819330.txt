As a reader of this Rust program, how can I figure out what&#x27;s happening? I don&#x27;t see anything in GlobWalker documentation that even slightly implies that the filter_map calls that follow are appropriate. Also, why the first filter_map(Result::Ok)? Implies the iterator emits Result? Hard to follow, to be honest.')
