The job market is somewhat sparse, and it&#x27;s a particularly tough slog this time round, but particularly because of the pandemic restricting travel and so on. Is anyone in a similar situation? What&#x27;s keeping you motivated if you haven&#x27;t just changed direction?<p>(If you have been traveling internationally and recreationally, probably best to keep that to yourself unless you&#x27;ve been taking advantage of places in very close proximity)')
