If there&#x27;s nobody that takes the responsibility for defining something, then there is no rule, law, custom, or precedent there, and all of those things may now be implemented as seen fit by one or more implementing parties.<p>If that&#x27;s the case -- then why can&#x27;t it be implemented differently, why can&#x27;t that be changed in the future?<p>&gt;While not in-kernel, systemd is ahead of you<p>That might be true -- but I am NOT a member of the systemd religion! (You know, like you have Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, and a smattering of other smaller groups in that bunch, like Wiccans, Scientologists, Deep Staters, and people that follow Joel Osteen! &lt;g&gt;  Well, you have all of those, AND you have the people that believe in systemd!  Of which I am not one of! &lt;g&gt;)<p>On a serious note however, systemd, while it might create a whole lot of &quot;conveniences&quot; -- creates equal-and-oppositely many drawbacks in terms of code complexity and the ability for someone even moderately technical to understand what&#x27;s really going on on their system.<p>But, all of that is a &quot;religious debate&quot; -- of which we&#x27;ve already seen too many of on the Net...<p>&gt;This is already the case. &quot;removing&quot; a file in Unix only removes...<p>Yes, this is well known...  However, let&#x27;s say we get a future OS student up to speed by building their own operating sysem... if they&#x27;re building their own OS, then their file system will probably not do this.  It a separate consideration and it adds to the complexity of the file system.<p>On the one hand, yes, you&#x27;re quite right, such a student could just take pre-made source code for a filesystem and link it to their OS, but if they did that, then odds are they&#x27;d learn nothing of value...<p>&gt;I think transactional filesystems, snapshots, and log filesystems already do most of what you&#x27;re asking for.<p>I don&#x27;t question this.<p>But, if you took the world&#x27;s most technologically complex airliner, whether that&#x27;s a Boeing 747, an Airbus A-380, or what-have-you... most people would rather fly on one of these things than even attempt to build their own plane, even if their own plane would be simple and crude by comparison, even if their own plane would be many future iterations removed from the current state-of-the-art...<p>Well, even if someone attempted something like this and failed(!) (e.g., they tried to build the equivalent of a Wright Flyer -- the first heavier-than-air plane built by the Wright Brothers) -- well, that is far, far superior educationally (in my opinion!) to someone who uses the latest and greatest technological marvel of the world -- and, yet, doesn&#x27;t completely understand it...<p>You might say that that&#x27;s my religion...&lt;g&gt;<p>It&#x27;s the same thing with Operating Systems...<p>&gt;I think transactional filesystems, snapshots, and log filesystems already do most of what you&#x27;re asking for.<p>I completely agree that they might...<p>But you know, we might agree that Windows 10 does most of what 99% of computer users want -- so why use any Unix derived variant?<p>I completely agree that you&#x27;re right; however, Windows 10 probably does most of what you&#x27;re looking for OS-wise... yet you seem to be more inclined to use a Unix derrived OS...<p>Why?<p>?')
