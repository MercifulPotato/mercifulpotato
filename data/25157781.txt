So far I’ve really liked zfs, but I have had some weird issues, like deletes taking a very long time.<p>My plan is to upgrade the host to Ubuntu 20.04 to see if the newer ZoL version helps. Also looking forward to root volume on zfs so I can do snapshotting to the raidz2 and just let the drive fail eventually.')
