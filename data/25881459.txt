No one would need Human Hunters if the Nature is still intact and balances itself, and sometimes Human Hunters cannot balance Nature from lets say from a mice-plague, so you have to kill them with toxic, some of them are still eaten by Owl&#x2F;Eagle&#x2F;Fox and are poisoned too, less Owls for the next year(s) means even more mice, so you need more toxins and the circle repeats.<p>Lynx Fox Wolf and Bear balance the nature and also balance each other. There are many more points why a intact nature is also better for Humans, but the Mouse sample should be enough.')
