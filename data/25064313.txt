For other development teams, perhaps those alternatives would be weighted differently. And then that in turn might affect how any future changes were viewed by the relevant language committees, who as you say would surely be aware of the implications.<p>Anyway, thanks for sharing your insights, both here and in the original article. It’s somehow reassuring to me that I’m not the only person in the world who wants their front-end code to continue working for more than five minutes, when it seems like a lot of the front-end community would consider that a pretty good working lifetime for code these days!')
