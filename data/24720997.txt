Item(by='crazygringo', descendants=None, kids=[24721154], score=None, time=1602175828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24720824, text='It&#x27;s not really a &quot;worse&quot; part that&#x27;s &quot;dead weight&quot;.<p>Companies split when two halves just have such vastly different objectives and futures that, at an organizational practical sense, it no longer makes sense for the same board&#x2F;CEO&#x2F;management to be running them together.<p>Splitting them up lets both halves select boards&#x2F;CEOs&#x2F;management that is best for them, and pursue strategies that are best separately. The &quot;underperforming&quot; segment may now perform better now that it&#x27;s free to use AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;Google cloud tools instead of just IBM&#x27;s... it can enter into strategic alliances it couldn&#x27;t before... it can merge with another company that wouldn&#x27;t have made sense before.<p>As for the people who work there... they&#x27;re still employed so nothing really changes day-to-day.<p>But the main point is that this <i>frees</i> the &quot;worse part&quot;, if you still want to call it that, to do what is <i>best</i> for it. It may very well turn out to thrive and be a huge success. It&#x27;s still a normal business like any other.<p>If it were truly dead weight it wouldn&#x27;t be spun off -- it would be shut down and everyone would be laid off. The fact it&#x27;s being spun off or split means it&#x27;s expected to be a viable business on its own. Nobody can predict the future -- who knows, it might outperform the cloud part long-term.')
