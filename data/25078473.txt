Many of them can&#x27;t afford migrating to a new stack, or want to.<p>Right, so either you&#x27;re working for a struggling company, or you&#x27;re working on the old stack while things are gradually being migrated and most new stuff is being done in a different stack. Maybe you&#x27;d find a company that is sticking with Ruby because they like it, but that&#x27;s pretty rare, and probably means that company hasn&#x27;t scaled past a certain point.<p>&gt; A byproduct of that is way more people learn Python &#x2F; Java as a first language, so you also perhaps need to think if being a Python guy gives you any edge when you turn 45-50 as hordes of young people learn it as we speak. Outsourcing a Python project is gonna be way easier 10 years from now than doing the same with Ruby.<p>Well if it&#x27;s hard to replace you in your current position then that cuts both ways. So you might be able to find a comfortable position, but there won&#x27;t be much opportunity for growth.')
