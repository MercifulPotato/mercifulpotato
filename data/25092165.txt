To the point that my point of view and emotions become influenced by others in a sort of sympathetic reaction. Very similar to how when someone yawns I find myself wanting to and normally yawning also.<p>In most cases I feel this is to my social benifit but at certain times it has been to my detriment. Typically where I have assumed the wrong perspective and feelings, or possibly my own ego has projected my perspective upon others in a sort of pseudo empathy. In my own experience this has been particularly damaging when entering personal relations with sociapathic type individuals.')
