I&#x27;ve never been a Java developer, but I&#x27;ve had to touch it a few times in my career, and have quite happily left very well paying jobs for lower paying jobs just to avoid having to write more Java. I can&#x27;t rightly think of any language I would plausibly have to use in industry that I find more unpleasant than the Java and the entire JVM ecosystem (disclaimer: I&#x27;ve never used PHP).<p>I&#x27;ll buy that Java might, in purely technical terms, be not that terrible of a stack, but it&#x27;s just so deeply unpleasant to use, such a profoundly nightmarish vampire of morality, so utterly and irredeemably cruel in it&#x27;s ability to strip all joy out of the art of software development, that I can&#x27;t possibly agree that it &quot;isn&#x27;t that terrible of a language&quot;.')
