One strategy is to use the least specific language you can that&#x27;s still truthful.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve heard of developers get turned away at the border because they began by saying they were &quot;speaking at a conference&#x2F;giving a workshop&quot; and noting they were being paid or having their expenses covered as if that makes it more legitimate. Instead, you&#x27;d start by saying you&#x27;re &quot;attending a conference.&quot; This is something border officials encounter 1000 times a day and will rarely question further.<p>Likewise, if you&#x27;re planning to record a podcast or take some photos at a conference, you don&#x27;t mention that unless asked specifically because otherwise it puts them on the track of treating you like a member of the &quot;foreign media&quot; and demanding the relevant visa for that when it&#x27;s really not relevant for most people doing such things as a side effect of their attendance.')
