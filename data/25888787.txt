Formal interpretability means you know what function the model is approximating -- there&#x27;s a long way from that to a human-readable interpretation.<p>Finally, even if the designers can tell you what features cause a certain response in the model, they can only tell you that for features that are encoded in the data! There are plenty of features that aren&#x27;t encoded in your data that can nevertheless affect the outcome of a model!')
