Item(by='Snitch-Thursday', descendants=None, kids=[25079397], score=None, time=1605130127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25060855, text='&gt; CB radios<p>Boy would I love to get ahold of some handheld radios designed for &#x27;prepper&#x27; use.<p>1. use cognitive radio techniques to find and frequency-hop to whitespace radio frequencies that are conducive to best propagation over the 0-10 mile range on unlicensed radio bands<p>2. use ad hoc mesh networking to support sending datagrams like text messages (preferably E2EE via say Signal Protocol) or GPS coordinates up to, say, 7 hops away<p>3. support a &#x27;emergency mode&#x27; where the radio power limits are relaxed and the frequencies for use by point A are relaxed to cover any radio band not actively reserved by law enforcement &#x2F; military &#x2F; first responders. In theory the cognitive radio techniques of frequency hopping and waiting to transmit until confirming radio dead air would prevent radio interference with whatever commercial TF &#x2F; broadcast radio &#x2F; CB radio &#x2F; MURS&#x2F;FRS&#x2F;Business band radio signal, but to keep the FCC and HAMs hearts from stopping, things like the military bands could be blocked off just to provide that last 0.00001% guarantee of safety against interference.<p>All of the 3 _seem_ possible to productize using SBCs and SDRs, but I don&#x27;t know where to start, I think I gotta finish my 8-bit breadboard computer YT series by Ben Eater before I even tried to tinker with this.')
