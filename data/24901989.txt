HIPAA (in the US) and similar legislation in other countries actually puts a lot of power in the hands of patients - if they know how to use it.<p>You are never going to be in the situation where the patient controls their data completely (what happens if they are non-responsive, drunk or psychotic and unable to legally consent to an intervention they desperately want). I think we shall move towards <i>access</i> to data, and possibly interpretation of that data, but not ownership. Control of the data will always come with caveats, as the body paying for the treatment will always assert their right to how the data is transmitted to minimise costs.')
