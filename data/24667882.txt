Looks it has enough flexibility to do what I can reasonably conceive of wanting to do.<p>However, its documentation is unfortunately weak for someone coming into it fresh.   It jumps into writing content without first walking you through concepts, terminology, and how inputs ultimately get turned into outputs.  This is too bad, since it seems like a really nice piece of software, and the kind of issue that might drive away new users.<p>Even the example link provided to the Internals section is at the wrong level of abstraction for a new user uninterested in the internals to understand the set of concepts they need to grasp to generate a whole site.')
