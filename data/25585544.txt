Got out of the education software sector because of it myself.<p>The problem is that it takes real budgets and effort to build these highly complex systems. It requires <i>teams</i> of competent engineers that are willing to take the extra steps to ensure the systems they&#x27;re building&#x2F;connecting are managed in a security-positive manner. When these sort of projects are bid out it&#x27;s usually the bottom-dollar bidder and&#x2F;or whoever has the most &quot;good ol&#x27; boy&quot; connections; this often doesn&#x27;t correlate to the previously stated need for technical competency.<p>Also there&#x27;s the problem of talent. Private vs. public sector development firms typically pay out on different scales for similar work&#x2F;stress loads.<p>All of this is anecdotal but I&#x27;m <i>so</i> not surprised.')
