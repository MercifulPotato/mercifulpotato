An independent news media with an explicit obligation to the truth, one that they can get in trouble for violating.  We had that obligation for a long time through the middle of the 20th century.  News organizations were well regarded even if they didn&#x27;t always make the right calls they tried their best.<p>But then Rhupert Murdock realized that you could simply pretend to be one of those respected parties and lie to the viewers constantly and there would be no consequences.  The obligation to the truth turned out to be a gentleman&#x27;s agreement and there were no truth police breaking down your door when you told lies.  That&#x27;s when we discovered that the media is like the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma.  Fox news discovered that as long as everybody else was beholden to the facts they could lie repeatedly and constantly win the game.  They&#x27;ve only fallen from the very tippy top of the ratings in recent years as other news organizations like OAN have discovered that the bigger the lie the bigger the ratings.<p>Fast forward to today and respect for the independent media (the all important 4th branch of government) is at an all time low and we have completely indoctrinated delusional people storming the Capitol building.')
