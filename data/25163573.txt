The gas spring provides resistance on the closure, and assistance on the opening.<p>With this wheel, the energy that goes into compressing the 12 o&#x27;clock spring must be provided (partially!) from the expanding 6 o&#x27;clock spring, plus additional energy from the cyclist to cover the mechanical losses in the system.<p>I don&#x27;t see any left over energy that can be used to help with forward propulsion. Maybe on very rough terrain it helps out by trading forward velocity with assistance up a bump, then trading the gravity on the other side of the bump to push forward again. But that&#x27;s a far cry from the claims being made on the page.')
