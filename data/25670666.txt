Game theory predicts almost exactly the behavior we see.<p>My own observation is that we saw major progress with the Renaissance, then the Enlightenment, the Constitution, and so on. Progress slowed around a hundred years ago. From around 1920-1970, we had progress on issues of representation, race, and gender, but otherwise, political behavior gradually drifted towards the Nash equilibrium.<p>1970-2020, progress mostly stopped, and we&#x27;ve pushed hard to optimizing to game theory. Politicians who now get elected play a near-optimal game, and playing this game is overt.<p>To make progress, we&#x27;d need significant reform of the system.<p>I would argue, though, that a statement like &quot;money in politics is a big problem on both sides. To be fair, itâ€™s been a big problem in all of politics throughout all recorded history&quot; is very reductionist.<p>For most of history, it wasn&#x27;t so much money as military might. If I had money and you had military, soon you&#x27;d have both. Money was a component of buying military, but it was just one component (see Rome v Carthage for an example, or Athens v Sparta).<p>I&#x27;d much rather be controlled by someone corrupted by money than by a corrupt warlord where I&#x27;m a serf. Democracy is a big step up. We just need another step up right now... and pretending we don&#x27;t is actively harmful.')
