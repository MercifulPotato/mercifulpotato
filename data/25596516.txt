Maybe the message is that we should give up on a strict ordering once we have many local degrees of freedom).<p>It’s interesting to interpret the Casimir effect in this language — is it that the location of negative energy density is specified by spontaneously broken translational symmetry (negative between plates and zero&#x2F;positive outside).<p>What property decides whether the system is sitting in the “vacuum” or the “Casimir” state? (If we’ve given up on “lowest energy”)')
