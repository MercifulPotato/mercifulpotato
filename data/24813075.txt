Here are some of the positives that I saw.<p>I have an older Chromebook with a really nice screen that weighs about half as much as my other laptops. I spent quite a bit of time trying to get a local development environment setup, but there was always some issue that made it awkward. The local storage was too small, using an SD card was too slow, etc... I also tried using it as a dumb terminal by SSH&#x27;ing into a box, but I like having and IDE, and managing a box is fine but more work. Cloud9 provides an okay-ish IDE, but it also manages the EC2 instance, which is really nice.<p>Another benefit, is that I generally try to avoid working on side projects from my work computer. But I spend the vast majority of time on my work laptop, including casual web browsing. So if I am on my work laptop, and I come up with an idea, or want to test something out, I can just pop open a browser. I don&#x27;t have to worry that I will accidentally leave files related to the side project on my work laptop, etc..<p>But just to be clear, I have no interest in using Cloud9 as a replacement for my day to day work. I agree with you, there are too many tools, environments, libraries, etc... that I use day to day that would be nearly impossible to replicate in a cloud environment.')
