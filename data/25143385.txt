Custom ROM and stuff.<p>Then I got a better PC and spent time trying to make website to earn money because everyone was doing it.<p>I failed. AdSense didn&#x27;t pay me anything. I realized it was more profitable to make a blog on how to make money online than go try if yourself.<p>I built my first gaming rig. Played few games and got bored after a few months.<p>I ended up watching death note on YouTube through recommendations.<p>Finished 500+ anime within a year. It was the best past time after school.<p>Got bored of that. This time, I though of making money using software. Worked with WordPress, earned some cash fixing people&#x27;s site and optimizing them by removing useless plugins, adding yoast SEO, improving cache and moving people from shared hosting on GoDaddy.<p>I started to tinker with PHP code and themes like Divi, adata. Then I wanted to build a CMS. Looked up stuff and it felt complicated so after trying for a few weeks, dropped the idea.<p>Now I got into novels and manga because I was running out of anime. Probably 700+ or so titles. Enjoyed that for a bit. Finished Chinese, russian, Japanese, etc light novels using Google translate. It was fun. I was addicted.<p>Now something clicked again and I purchased courses on udemy for 90% discount (yeah it is always discounted). Finally, I knew enough programming after few weeks to create a CMS. I did that but it turned pretty poor compared to WordPress.<p>Joined an online non-profit therapy group. Listened to people and gave advice...in retrospect, k shouldn&#x27;t have done that.<p>Joined discord, spent time there and well learnt more about weird internet cultures and spheres.<p>Started to get worried about future. Spent time researching health insurance, FIRE, investment and saving strategies. Opened broker account on few online sites using my dad&#x27;s identity. Landed on r&#x2F;wsb. Spent few weeks researching and stalking people there. Concluded it was nothing more than gambling. I started buying equity. Built a decent portfolio. Then diversified with Forex and SIP index fund.<p>Roughly more or less how I spent my teenage years. There are lot of other small and things I did but will be too personal.')
