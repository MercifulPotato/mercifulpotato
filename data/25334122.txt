I&#x27;m aware of ZaReason because I have a laptop from them, but I&#x27;ve rarely seen them mentioned anywhere.<p>The only reason I knew about them to buy one at the time (2012) was because the founder was visiting the company I used to work for (they were attempting to establish a real presence in New Zealand then) and a workmate mentioned it to me as I think I was looking for a new laptop at the time.<p>Based on the statement on their website, it seems that their lineup has been shrinking and tech support has been slowing down. That doesn&#x27;t suggest that they were in a healthy place, and so I guess it just took one more blow on top of that to knock them out.')
