Soviets did not take Africa by force in 1960s - they didn&#x27;t have nearly enough long range force projection capability - they made Africans want communism. Same in Southeast Asia.<p>Maoism is nothing like that. It is despised by everyone including China&#x27;s closest neighbours both culturally and geographically - even by Vietnamese who are sort of Commies themselves. Vietnam is willing to ally with the U.S. - who it lost millions of people fighting with 50 years who and who&#x27;s completely opposite to it ideologically on paper - only to avoid Chinese bullying.<p>But, it seems to be a good way of government for China. It works there. Nothing at all worked in China in the previous 150 years of trying, nothing else allowed to marry industrial civilisation and Chinese national character. KMT figured an alternative but only when they were already stuck to Taiwan, and only with the massive U.S. aid (which would be insufficient for Chinese mainland even under best assumptions), and only because most of Taiwanese are part Japanese and their culture had a strong Japanese influence.<p>Ofc, Dick Nixon also helped a lot.')
