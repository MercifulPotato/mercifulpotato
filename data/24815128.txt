Just measuring something from an observation point a few inches different will shift your numbers by a nanosecond.  If you need ultra-precise records from some kind of equipment then it needs to use a specialized local clock anyway, and it&#x27;s probably better if it&#x27;s hard to convert those records back and forth with normal timestamps.<p>&gt; This is what happens when your data structures declare year zero like pol pot.<p>Picking an arbitrary zero point is the only way to make timestamps work.  If we started counting with the big bang then all our clocks would be plus or minus <i>millions of years</i>.')
