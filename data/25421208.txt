It&#x27;s not useful as anything other than a store of value.<p>If we collectively decide to switch to bitcoin as our store of value network, and retire gold and silver from that use case, then we free up all the gold stored in vaults collecting dust as a value store to do more useful work that it&#x27;s uniquely capable of, like being used in electronics or dental work.<p>A lot of these use cases now aren&#x27;t economically viable because the market value of gold is inflated due to being overloaded with the store of value use case.')
