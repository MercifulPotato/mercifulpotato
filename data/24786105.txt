You and I knew that CGI was a pay for play scheme before the emails confirmed it. We also know that nobody pays a crackhead son of the VP of the US with zero industry or qualifying professional experience $50k&#x2F;mo. without expecting something in return that said cracky is uniquely positioned to deliver.<p>For the record, I don’t hate crackheads. Also, yeah this cynicism goes for Trump too. It should be how we regard all politicians, as the profession overwhelmingly shows a high preponderance towards deceit, graft, rent-seeking, kickbacks, etc.')
