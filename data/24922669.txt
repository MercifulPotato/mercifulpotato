For the design, verification can be done by computers and it&#x27;s much more powerful than testing anyway. For the hardware, I imagine there are cores inside the chip with the sole task of testing sub-circuits (fab defects are much less varied than design flaws), but I stopped following that stuff at the era of single billion transistors.')
