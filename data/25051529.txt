They are still miserable computers to run Linux on, although I think the original 2016 touchbar-less MBP performs better than all the rest, albeit (IIRC) no working audio, very poor suspend&#x2F;resume functionality, and until pretty recently no keyboard&#x2F;trackpad functionality.<p>Oh, and Apple&#x27;s NVMe interface is non-compliant. This is widely reported as Apple locking Linux out with the T2 chip, but that&#x27;s not really true. The T2 chip <i>will</i> by default prevent unsigned kernels from reading&#x2F;writing to the SSD, but this can be disabled.<p>Even if it&#x27;s disabled, the controller is not standards compliant, and Linux won&#x27;t see the underlying block device. I saw some diffs floating around on github a few years ago that fixed it, but I don&#x27;t think it was ever mainlined.<p>Basically, post-2016, Apple seems to have incorporated even more custom (and undocumented) hardware that running alternative OSes on them is basically impossible. Windows works because of the Apple-provided HAL + drivers for WinNT.')
