A dollar in 2022 is stronger than a dollar in 2020 so stocks need to AT LEAST outpace inflation to make it worthwhile at all.<p>Now, government bailouts is a different can of worms and I am not entirely sure my opinion on that. Generally I would have to say I am against it, as it doesn&#x27;t actually favor businesses that can properly adapt to the markets and new blockers. But, things like dropping the fed rate to encourage consumer spending does seem okay to me.<p>If we removed bailouts then there would be risk involved. And there is still risks involved in stocks. Not all stocks only go up. Nikola is basically a pump and dump scheme that likely wont be around in 3 years to grow with the rest of your portfolio. Plenty of companies seem flash growth and then equalize down to something more reasonable.<p>However, in general, if you buy diverse stocks and ETFs or index funds you should only see it go UP over 10-20 years. You will have dips, and you can even have a recession. The people most impacted by dips in stocks are people trying to retire during that retraction period.<p>What you described seems to be like intuition though. Stocks are high, people can&#x27;t afford them and they cannot see a lot of growth. When stocks drop you can capture more growth potential for cheaper. So it seems like a natural progression that people would buy back into the markets, thus helping the markets stabilize.')
