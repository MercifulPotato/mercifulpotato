They just buy bonds, mostly government bonds but when the utility of that diminishes they also buy corporate bonds.<p>Either way, Central Bank actions distort the entire credit market, allowing any existing bond holder to sell to the central bank at a profit. it allows corporate bond issuers to create and sell to the distorted market, or directly to the central bank in both the primary and secondary market, at a profit.<p>Note, when issuing bonds this is not called a profit, but let&#x27;s be honest here, we are talking about writing on a sheet of paper that I will pay your $2,000,000,0000 back in 10 years at 0.75% a year. They frequently use new investor&#x27;s money to pay back old investors. There is a word for that, but it dilutes my point. The accuracy of this reality doesn&#x27;t change though.<p>These sheets of paper are exchanged for money that did not exist prior to the moment of that transaction.<p>The recipients buy stocks (and everything else). The corporate issuers buy back their own stock, give executives bonuses who make a diversified portfolio. The hedge fund issuers just amplify their own holdings with extremely cheap, non-margin callable leverage.<p><i>^Exceptions:\nSwiss National Bank buys US stocks with newly created francs.<p>US Federal Reserve buys bond ETFs, in order to access the universe of bonds.<p>Outside of the West, the People&#x27;s Bank of China buys stocks directly. Predictable collective ownership philosophy.</i>')
