The issue with IE was that it supported it&#x27;s own proprietary features without consultation nor coordination with competitors. Something it was only able to do due to its market monopoly.<p>Yes, Chrome does this too.<p>It&#x27;s slightly better in that it tends to submit them to standards bodies after implementing them, but most of the time that&#x27;s WHATWG which is a much less democratic body than others, and mostly Google-led. Either way Chrome&#x27;s market monopoly leave competitors with little choice in the standards process.')
