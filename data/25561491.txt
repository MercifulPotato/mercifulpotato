Yet this sub has basically became an Instagram for the old shit people find in they&#x27;re grandparents house which offers no benefit to me now. I&#x27;m not going to buy, nor could I even find a kitchen aid mixer you grandma still uses from the 70s. Most stuff back then was made to last, we know that. I want stuff thats still made today with quality.&quot;<p>So that&#x27;s the problem, I don&#x27;t want to buy old stuff, I want to know what to buy today that will last.')
