She&#x27;s not talking about &quot;Long Covid&quot;, she&#x27;s not complaining about how bad it was, instead she&#x27;s back at work looking after our kids.<p>As a parent of three kids, I&#x27;ve made multiple trips to a local hospital to a) watch the kids be born, and b) get out-of-hours urgent treatment when no local doctor&#x27;s practice was open.<p>With multiple kids, it&#x27;s not a surprise that we&#x27;re on good terms with the staff at our local doctor&#x27;s practice.   [Un]surprisingly they&#x27;re [also] pretty skeptical about the whole C19 story.  They&#x27;re even more skeptical about getting tested for C19, something our local government seems to be pushing.')
