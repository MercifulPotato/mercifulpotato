They only do it if so many other outlets are reporting the story that they&#x27;d look bad, and then they just copy the story directly from those other outlets.<p>They don&#x27;t report negatively on sponsors, other parts of their very large and diverse companies, or any other companies that their owners or important employees are associated with, unless forced. If forced, they copy what has been reported and add nothing but mild apologia and FUD.')
