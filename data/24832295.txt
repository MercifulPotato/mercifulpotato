Nonsense? I like Discord as software and I like them as a company, but a lot of what&#x27;s beining attributed to Discord isn&#x27;t true here.<p>Firstly: won what?<p>Discord was born _years_ (over a decade for some) after some of the &quot;competitors&quot; mentioned became defunct, while others are still thriwing, and is built on top of the foundations and groundwork laid by that same competition.<p>For casual or small parties, Discord is great.
