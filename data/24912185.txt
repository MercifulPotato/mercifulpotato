Maybe there&#x27;s also a theme of being troubled by the notion that the masses might cause a mess with these tools and shouldn&#x27;t be trusted.<p>I think this kind of reaction is inevitable when people with power and privilege feel threatened by another group who are claiming some power for themselves.<p>Here&#x27;s what the article was really about:<p>&gt; The key here is that no-code tools aren’t successful just because they are easier to use — they are successful because they are connecting with a new generation that understands precisely the sort of logic required by these platforms to function.<p>It may be a poorly written click-baity article or you may think the conclusions are wrong but you can&#x27;t dismiss the reality that a generation of people are being exposed to programming concepts in an entirely different way to our experiences. This is fascinating whatever you think about the tools themselves. Isn&#x27;t the interesting discussion to be had here more about what this will mean for end-user software going forwards?<p>- Does this trend maybe mean that it&#x27;s vitally important that we build some forms of open standards around this kind of technology?<p>- Should we rethink programming education for young people knowing that many are likely to have exposure to concepts no-code introduces?<p>- What does FOSS look like with no-code - do we need some serious FOSS tools in this space?<p>I think there are a lot more interesting avenues to explore beyond &quot;I don&#x27;t like this trend&quot; and &quot;we&#x27;ve seen abstractions get higher-level before and we haven&#x27;t been put out of a job yet so what&#x27;s all the fuss about&quot;.')
