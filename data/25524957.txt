Have you done a bunch of research on this? Can you be more specific about it? Or is it just a thing you feel happens on message board threads?<p>As I&#x27;ve said: I&#x27;m a little bit at a loss as to what your problem with Robinhood even is. They don&#x27;t charge trading commissions. But they do take an 80&#x2F;20 share of price improvement payments where other brokerages take 20&#x2F;80. We can all agree that it&#x27;s not OK to lie about doing that. But now we know†, and they&#x27;ve been fined. What next? Should they take 20&#x2F;80? Why not 15&#x2F;85? Is the right split just what the majority of the other discount brokerages take?<p>Again: I loathe Robinhood. They are a force for evil. But when people come up with weird diagnoses for <i>why</i> they&#x27;re bad, it leads them to make silly decisions about other discount brokerages, none of whom (a) seriously prioritize their customers (perhaps excepting Vanguard), or (b) operate the way people on message boards believe brokerages operate.<p>† <i>You might be able to argue that knowing the right Google query here, and also giving a shit††, would have enabled you to know this before the SEC announcement, because Robinhood&#x27;s most important venue is also Schwab&#x27;s, and you can just compare the per-share rebate they&#x27;re getting. My confidence level here is not super high.</i><p>†† <i>(my subtext here is that people don&#x27;t really give a shit)</i>')
