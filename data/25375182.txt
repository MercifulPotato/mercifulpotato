You could blame that RH always looked at CentOS as their bastard child and never treated it as good as Fedora which has a healthy community relations. I don&#x27;t have high hopes for CentOS Stream, Rocky Linux is going to be the main go-to distro for rpm from now; with no corporation standing in the way I wish them all the luck but this going to be a rocky ride.')
