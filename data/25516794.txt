Curious to hear what HN thinks of it.<p>Part 1----<p>When people hear &quot;Expensify&quot;, they typically think &quot;expense reports&quot;. But with the introduction of the Expensify Card, Concierge Travel, invoice sending, and bill payment features -- all in 2020 -- it&#x27;s increasingly clear that we&#x27;re becoming a whole lot more. Indeed, this is why according to Google, more people search for &quot;Expensify&quot; by name than &quot;expense reports&quot; as a whole: what we&#x27;re building goes beyond any single function. Rather, Expensify can replace several expensive, disconnected services with one fully connected preaccounting platform for a tiny fraction of the cost.<p>And now I&#x27;m happy to offer a sneak peak of our latest addition: open-source financial group chat. Like Slack, SMS, or WhatsApp, but optimized for financial conversations, designed to be used both at work and between friends, and maintained by a community of open source developers.<p>If you&#x27;re in a hurry, go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;Expensify.cash" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;Expensify.cash</a> to join the waitlist. And if you are a developer, share your GitHub handle to skip to the front of the line, and check out our Upwork jobs to earn some extra cash over the holiday break. But if you&#x27;ve got time, pour a stiff cup of eggnog and read on...<p>Now, when we launched the Expensify Card, people &quot;got it&quot;. It&#x27;s very tightly connected to expense management, so it makes sense. Same goes for Concierge Travel booking -- it feels pretty close to expense management. Invoicing and bill pay were a bit more surprising to people, as those have historically been different industries. But expense management sits in a company&#x27;s accounts payable&#x2F;receivable department, and all these do too, so it generally makes sense.<p>Chat -- even financially-optimized group chat -- is less obvious. And launching open-source (where anybody can see and contribute to the code) is even less obvious still. To help make sense of that, let me explain two radical beliefs that underpin everything we do.')
