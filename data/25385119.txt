It&#x27;s less of a technical problem and more of a &quot;why bother?&quot; problem.<p>This is exactly right, but I fear the incentives have changed and we&#x27;ll never again see something like the x86&#x2F;IBM-compatible&#x2F;Wintel world of &quot;standard&quot; inter-compatible systems.<p>As you say, it&#x27;s a &quot;why bother?&quot; problem, and no manufacturer will want to bother: Apple has no interest in making it easy to run other OSes, Microsoft wants to sell you &quot;Windows Surface&quot; devices, not general-purpose computers, corporate buyers want a &quot;secure&quot; locked-down environment with a signed bootloader...<p>Are there any powerful stakeholders who benefit from interoperability?')
