Buyers get extra protection with extra warranties, ability to reverse fraudulent&#x2F;deceptive sellers.  Sellers get extra revenue with people buying stuff they don&#x27;t have cash for, and don&#x27;t have to worry about fraudulent cash&#x2F;checks etc.  Yeah sellers overall take a bit of a hit, but the argument can be made the couple percent is worth it to never have to worry about getting scammed by a buyer.<p>Anyway.. crypto offers absolutely NONE of that.  So comparing it to credit card companies is honestly quite laughable.<p>The only thing you can try to argue is crypto offers anonymity to a degree? Although it sure seems like you have to jump through a lot of hoops for this to even be true since it&#x27;s a public ledger...')
