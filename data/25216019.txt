I have my own colocated servers with clients and I tried the cloud with clients. The &quot;cloud&quot; (which lets face is just a buzz word for servers in a datacentre) is a convoluted maze. You can take so many paths but in the end you end up at a dead end.<p>However pushing my cynicism aside, I would be happy wager it would be far cheaper, efficient and more cost-effective to run in-house then it would be to use the cloud.<p>I have 4u colocation, 2u in two different datacentres. It&#x27;s overkill. I host eight servers. I don&#x27;t need it, but I will always be a preacher of colocation for the fact of that nothing in the world feels better then running your own code, on your own hardware on your own infrastructure on your own spec of internet dust.<p>It&#x27;s like making your own loaf of bread for the first time.<p>That&#x27;s not to say there are not reasons on why you should use the cloud but in this scenario if your corporate with consumers it should always be your own kit. How else do you provide a quality service?')
