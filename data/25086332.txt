Tim Cook famously said, &quot;privacy, to us, is a human right [1].&quot; I wonder how (or even if) they&#x27;ll acknowledge this one and walk it back. Hopefully more articles like this will ring even more loudly.<p>Sending all this stuff via plaintext is just plain scary. I&#x27;ve never worked at Apple, but from my experience at other big tech companies, this would never pass a rudimentary security&#x2F;privacy review (which surely this had, given the scale that this feature is operating at), which leads me to believe it&#x27;s intentional.<p>On the other hand, given how badly it crippled people&#x27;s computers, perhaps it was just really poorly engineered. I think Apple&#x27;s response (or lack thereof) could be really significant. I don&#x27;t own any Apple hardware, but am still keen to follow this story.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@profgalloway&#x2F;no-mercy-no-malice-apples-conscious-uncoupling-7171bb185dcd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@profgalloway&#x2F;no-mercy-no-malice-apples-c...</a>')
