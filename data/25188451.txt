How is the title clickbaity? The title says exactly what happened. Tesla took shortcuts, clear and simple. They didn&#x27;t implement things like code signing and there&#x27;s the implementation detail where they were using certificates, but oops, we don&#x27;t actually check them. If this was Ford or Toyota having this type of security lapse, then people would be all over it. The likelihood of this happening in the wild is zip because Tesla is fixing it using the OTA capabilities which is great, and I give them credit for that. But don&#x27;t underestimate the seriousness of this.')
