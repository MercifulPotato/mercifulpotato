If you dual-boot an Intel Mac to Windows (via BootCamp) it&#x27;ll daisy chain just fine, so the hardware supports it, but booted to Mac it&#x27;ll just ignore the second monitor in the chain.<p>If you are lucky enough to own a Thunderbolt (note: not displayport) monitor, that can chain to a displayport monitor. But thunderbolt monitors are rare as all get out these days.')
