Thousands of hours of silence now. As the buddha states, we must all each do the work, not adhere to scripture - the work is simple yet hard - i suggest you try vipassana or any type of extended silence retreats (muslim, christian ... it doesnt matter. I spoke wirh christisn and muslims who were on intensive prayer retreats, they reported the same experience)<p>seek truth within yourself brother - if you chase interpretation and opinion, you will spiral down. The truth itself is within you, in your flesh, inside your mind is an undying light surrounded by your traumas&#x2F;impurities. Don&#x27;t try to assume .. simply discover - the mind wishes to argue its way around truth and console itself with what it thinks is intellectual, but its just a battery of randomness.<p>Call it what we may, jhanna, yana, grace .. the understanding is truth itself - i wont and cant convince you, its work left for you.<p>I for one, do not see separation a anymore')
