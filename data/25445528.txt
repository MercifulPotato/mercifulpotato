I usually write something down every day. I&#x27;m particular about what I write with so I use PILOT Vanishing Point fountain pen and large hardcover Moleskine grid ruled notebooks.<p>My journaling consists of:<p>- 70% thoughts and ideas.<p>- 20% todos related to thoughts and ideas.<p>- 10% events in life.<p>Usually if I&#x27;m working on a project or considering a project I write down my thoughts, things I&#x27;ve learned, and so on.  Sometimes I refer back to old entries.  Sometimes I don&#x27;t.  Every now and then I might turn some of the entries into a blog article.')
