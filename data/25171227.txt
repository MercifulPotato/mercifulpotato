This creates risk and technical debt as you&#x27;ll have to invest engineering time integrating their changes in order to receive updates.  You can end up running some architecture that is gluing together multiple OSS components that are all written in different stacks and where you need to heavily hack at them anyway to get them to do what you need them to do.<p>I guess a tip to add is drive touching production to zero.  Ideally this is instrumented in your tooling w&#x2F; who, the reason, and an audit log of the actions took.  It&#x27;s fairly common to see development teams slowly overwhelmed by non-development activities due to not properly root cause problems or things like doing &#x27;one-off&#x27; sql surgery to fix a customer&#x27;s issue.')
