Yusaku Maezawa&#x27;s Dear Moon also provides $500 million in Starship funding (presumably tranches get released for successful milestones including this test). \n SpaceX are otherwise self-funding the Starship test program so far. It might become easier as Starlink satellite internet system comes out of beta and generates large cash flow.<p>Elon Musk estimated the entire Starship program to cost a mere $10 billion. Tax payer money helps (especially for moon and Mars missions), but SpaceX needs to create a next generation rocket (both stages fully-and-rapidly re-usable) to stave off future competition (though Blue Origin is very far behind).<p>Even without government funding for Mars and the moon, low-earth orbit provides ample commercial, government (ISS etc) and military (reconnaissance sats) incentive for SpaceX to slowly and steadly develop Starship. A few billion for Starship development for moon missions would definitely accelerate the otherwise self-funded schedule from 12+ years to 5 years.')
