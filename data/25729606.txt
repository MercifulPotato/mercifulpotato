I was quite optimistic for the approach that Starsky chose (but unfortunately couldn&#x27;t bring to market [1]) with autonomous segments combined with occasional remote assistance.

I worked on perception tasks for autonomous driving, and believe FSD can be done. I just don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s a year away, but I&#x27;d love to be wrong!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.therobotreport.com&#x2F;starsky-robotics-co-founder-on-self-driving-truck-shutdown&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.therobotreport.com&#x2F;starsky-robotics-co-founder-o...</a>')
