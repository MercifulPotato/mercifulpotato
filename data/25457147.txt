The paper did fail to take into account the results in some highly relevant and widely cited papers. (I&#x27;ve rejected papers claiming new results myself before now with &quot;this problem was in fact already solved by X, published in Y&quot;.)<p>2. The paper was fine, but it didn&#x27;t cite every paper published recently on the topic ever, and someone used that to shoot it down for whatever BS reason.
