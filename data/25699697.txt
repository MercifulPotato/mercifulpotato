That’s where its strengths come from but also its weaknesses. Many new languages and language features are directly inspired by Haskell’s strong typing and type safety and the world of programming languages is better for it.<p>I do question whether Haskell will ever be ready for mainstream - probably not. But hopefully some other more practical ML derivative will gain enough momentum to truly become mainstream. Arguably Scala is that language, but Scala feels the C++ of ML-derivatives - the language is too big and the syntax irks me.')
