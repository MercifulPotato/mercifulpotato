I’m running a Rails app which takes about 30 seconds to start on Run (much quicker on a standard instance or local and I’m not sure why). My other gripe is that it will just randomly restart (not after being idle for some time but literally as I’m clicking around the website). There are no server errors and nothing I can see in the logs. Coupled with the fact that restarts take around 30 seconds it makes for quite a poor initial experience for my web users.')
