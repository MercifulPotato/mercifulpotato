I&#x27;m particularly bugged by the complete lack of auto-completion. E.g. when I tag a new bookmark as #devel, I would like to be offered suggestions for additional tags, based on my existing bookmarks. Possible suggestions to #devel would be #documentation, #api reference, #python, #javascript, #c etc. Similar for searching using tags. Moreover, auto-completion suggestions would save you from having to define and remember personal tagging conventions. E.g. shall I use #recipe or #recipes? Is it #open source or #open-source?<p>I&#x27;m also missing the option to somehow create bookmarklets based on tags, so I can replace static bookmark folders in the browser.<p>I believe these features would also be relevant for LinkAce (if not already implemented). For Buku, adding the functionality is in my backburner project list.')
