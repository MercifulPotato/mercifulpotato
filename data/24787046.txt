But I recently used the not quite yet standard &quot;date&quot; library. And that is super confusing in combination with &lt;chrono&gt;. You end up having an overlap of some functions and classes, some of which are in the date namespace, some of which are in chrono&#x2F;std. And functions don&#x27;t even properly error on compile when you do things wrong, but quietly misbehave. I hope this will solve itself once both arrive in compilers and both are in std:: namespace.')
