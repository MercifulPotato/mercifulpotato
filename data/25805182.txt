Item(by='generalizations', descendants=None, kids=[25805400], score=None, time=1610828746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25804929, text='&gt; COVID deniers aren&#x27;t suggesting we don&#x27;t take vaccines because they are unsure of the effectiveness of vaccines - they are suggesting we don&#x27;t take vaccines because they are actually microchips by Bill Gates designed to track us.<p>That is misinformation.  It is absolutely the case that people are unwilling to take the vaccine because the effectiveness (and safety) is questionable.  You&#x27;re just throwing up a strawman.<p>It&#x27;s also possible you just don&#x27;t know the reasoning behind any but the most vocal &quot;covid deniers&quot;.  That wouldn&#x27;t be surprising, since the standard practice now seems to be to lump everyone who questions the &#x27;official position&#x27; in with the most extreme theories, and that makes rational people shut up.  Your generalization is only strengthening your echo chamber.')
