I once worked for a tech company which treated a security researcher who found a vulnerability with the same hostility, They had an &quot;easter&quot; egg in the code saying &quot;F<i></i>* you &lt;name of the researcher&gt;&quot;. Needless to say I left that place soon after this incident. It baffles me why companies wont reward these people for doing the testing for them instead of taking these disclosures as act of war against them.')
