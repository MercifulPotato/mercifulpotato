I recently (this year) got my first smartphone with a USB-C connector and all of the ones in the interim used micro USB.<p>As far as computers, I have had USB A on all of the laptops I&#x27;ve ever owned, and gone through 2 display connectors (DVI, and HDMI).  The laptop I&#x27;m currently typing this on has a VGA connector, should I need it.  My wife, who uses macs has had a different display connector for every laptop going back to her G4.<p>For desktops, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see a PS&#x2F;2 connector on the back of my computer, though I haven&#x27;t looked and I know my second most recent one had a PS&#x2F;2 connector.  Heck, my motherboard has a firewire pin-header, which is absurd because that standard had approximately zero popularity on PCs in the first place!<p>Apple has much more abrupt changes.  I don&#x27;t think there was a single Mac that shipped with both ADB and USB ports, and it was about a year from the first iMac with USB, and the last Mac Pro with ADB shipping.<p>This abruptness is possible because Apple controls much more of the ecosystem than anybody does in the PC world.  I think I had USB ports on my computer for 3-ish years before I ever used the for anything at all (thumb drives weren&#x27;t really a thing yet, and I had no need to upgrade my mouse or keyboard).  For a long time mice would implement both USB and PS&#x2F;2 and come with an adapter to let them plug into either.')
