The shorts are still bleeding and the GME hold is continuing though just at a slightly reduced price.<p>Retail investors who have bought GME can afford to wait out the antics of hedge funds, but those funds are on borrowed time to try to turn the loss of a century into some kind of win, or they are done for good. Ask yourself, who do you think is trailing the borders of legality? A teen who goes “hmm GME at 100$? Sure why not, I’ll take 10” or the hedgefond manager calling all his friends to stop trading because his fund is going bankrupt on a stupid bet he made that he would have gotten away with if it wasn’t for those meddling kids.')
