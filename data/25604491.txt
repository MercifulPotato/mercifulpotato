I work in a big corp and sometimes the tech you invested in, even if the PoC was great and all successful, doesn&#x27;t fit in any final product because of thousands of other constraints.<p>But I also see lots of small &#x27;mindshare&#x27; changes thanks to those &#x27;it can be done&#x27; projects. The important steps seem to be to first unlock the first TRLs, then find PoCs on real products to inspire (and increase TRLs) tech directors and product managers that they need to invest the next millions into an big and still uncertain shift, and to underinvest in other important parts of their products. In the case of tech push you often end up with a new shiny tech that can&#x27;t be used right away. So, mostly, it&#x27;s about climbing the maturity ladder, and be ready for the <i>very small</i> openings in the product development cycle to shoe your new tech in.<p>In the case of customer pull or market pull, the lead time of such projects makes it too late to ask for external help, and no research grant wants to participate in &#x27;product development&#x27; (not their job). So the tech is usually badly implemented and leaves a sour taste.<p>What I see as positive: if you have a great tech idea and available resources, and great academic&#x2F;labs contacts, you <i>can</i> get the money, with little resistance (but yes, lots of admin work) with either European or national&#x2F;regional grants.<p>IIRC the 2014 version of SPARK was designed and developed through a French civilian R&amp;D funding project : <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.open-do.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;hi-lite&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.open-do.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;hi-lite&#x2F;</a>\nThe project was clearly a success there (although I don&#x27;t know about ROI or profitability for AdaCore on this tech). Working with innovative SMBs is a great way to get funding in France and most of the projects that I&#x27;ve seen tend to conclude in new products... for the SMB. But the scale is low there (&lt;4MEUR), so it also helps to accept failure (&#x27;only&#x27; 4m &#x27;wasted&#x27;...).')
