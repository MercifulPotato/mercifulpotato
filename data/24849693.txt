Item(by='__ryan__', descendants=None, kids=[24849970], score=None, time=1603299418, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24848701, text='&gt; Edit: also, searching for &quot;prolog web framework&quot; gets you stuff about using prolog for web application development. So, yeah, naming is not great and your assertion is not entirely correct.<p>Is this a typo? I would certainly hope that a search for &quot;<i>prolog</i> web framework&quot; would not include results about a web framework written in Nim named &quot;<i>Prologue</i>&quot;<p>&quot;Prolog&quot; and &quot;prologue&quot; are completely different words with different meanings-- they are only homophones. It&#x27;s not really analogous (at all) to the Firebird situation where the names of the projects had the exact same name, same spelling and all.<p>If this project were named &quot;Sea&quot;, do you think people would conflate it with the &quot;C&quot; programming language?')
