He may have failed to help because he just didn&#x27;t care enough, or ran out of time, or didn&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on, etc. But referring to his attempt as &quot;lies&quot; tells me a lot about Walter. In particular, it tells me that Walter isn&#x27;t the type of person I&#x27;d like to help. Why bother, if things don&#x27;t go to his satisfaction, he might just call me a &quot;liar&quot; later.')
