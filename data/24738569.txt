They are anything but open, and there is no reason to believe their tall tale that the only reason they don&#x27;t release the model publicly is &quot;ethical&quot; reasons -- it&#x27;s for monetary reasons and it&#x27;s gatekeeping. Not only that, but they are playing a dangerous game strategically. Companies like Hugging Face actually release valuable parts of the open source NLP ecosystem which set new records for SOTA and which the rest of the industry can use.<p>For all the practitioners here who probably know more about this than I do, help me understand: how much of OpenAI is smoke and mirrors? Is it just me, or is GPT-3 just GPT-2 but with way more training data? Are there fundamental conceptual differences with how the scale of that data is handled?')
