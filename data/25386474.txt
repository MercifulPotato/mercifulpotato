A really good developer might come up with a slight requirement change or an engineering detour that makes many tickets meaningless, he might improve tooling such that things that took hours now take minutes, he might be able to write tests or come up with new processes that increase quality 10x. If we think of guys like Jeff Dean, the ability to close tickets written by project managers is not what makes them stand out.')
