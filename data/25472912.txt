Although a transitory gene expression might\nbe desirable as it minimizes potential risks of genetic transformation, this inevitably affects mRNA\npotency, thus necessitating a dose increase.<p>This means that mRNA reduce the risk of genetic transformation compared to DNA vaccines, but it comes as a price because you have to deliver a larger dose of mRNA.')
