Item(by='qsort', descendants=None, kids=[25242942, 25237910], score=None, time=1606575301, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25237357, text='The article is excellent, congratulations.<p>A couple observations&#x2F;questions.<p>1) You didn&#x27;t comment on the bayesian viewpoint that probability reflects a subjective idea about the state of the world. One might argue, for example, that probability isn&#x27;t measurable, and that therefore, strictly speaking, a statement about the objective probability of an event isn&#x27;t meaningful. Experimental evaluation would have to be done on an entire model instead.\nDo you have any objections to that point of view?<p>2) I don&#x27;t find the case about Kolmogorov complexity to be actually convincing, at least not as per the requirements the rest of the article sets. &quot;3141592...&quot; could pass as either &quot;random digits&quot; or &quot;first digits of pi&quot;. The fact that it&#x27;s highly unlikely a true RNG would have generated exactly those, we are back to a frequentist argument there.\nIt&#x27;s likely I&#x27;m missing something, could you elaborate more or give me a pointer?')
