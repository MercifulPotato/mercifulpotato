This isn&#x27;t &quot;clawing for absolute security&quot;, it&#x27;s recognition that if you push the Web just a <i>little</i> too far, it&#x27;s dead. As in, it&#x27;s not the Web anymore, will gradually become useless for many existing purposes, and will have to be replaced by something else borne out of its ashes.<p>&quot;The Web but without worrying quite as much about its security&#x2F;privacy characteristics&quot; is simply not the Web. Same as &quot;the Web but without stressing so much about backwards compatibility&quot;. It would be a great thing, perhaps, but it&#x27;s something different and would evolve very differently. (In particular, it would lack some of the core reasons why the Web has competed successfully with native apps.)')
