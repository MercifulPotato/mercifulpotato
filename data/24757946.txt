Guess what isn&#x27;t? Linux desktop gaming.</i><p>The name for this is platform politics (and I find it disgusting as a Linux user). Stadia came out having way less users than desktop Linux and game companies run to release for it, while continuing to ignore desktop Linux users. It&#x27;s not about the size of the market like some like excuse it with. It&#x27;s about expected to be paid by &quot;platform owner&quot; or something of the sort.<p>Linux has no owner, so these companies are at loss from whom to demand extra money, even if they can make profit from actually selling games to Linux gamers. They don&#x27;t grok open platforms. Better companies which aren&#x27;t into platform politics release games for Linux fine.<p>So part of the blame is on those who are hung on platform politics. But it doesn&#x27;t excuse anti-competitive behavior of MS in the least.')
