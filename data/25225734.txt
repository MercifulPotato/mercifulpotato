It&#x27;s my personal objetive become financially independent (get rich, but not filthy rich. Just enough to live comfortably) as it would solve most of my problems and allow me to enjoy life in peace.<p>Here are some of the options I considered:<p>* FAANG: Graduate, get a job at FAANG and start saving&#x2F;investing. Probably the safest but not the easiest for someone without a visa. I already tried to get an internship but got stuck on the team matching at Google and didn&#x27;t get called on the others.<p>* Software outsourcing: Leverage the fact that I live in a third-world country and build a software outsourcing business, start as a freelancer until I can hire people and delegate the work. Probably the easiest one to start but hard to scale well (finding enterprise grade work is hard). This year I started freelancing for a few months and made around 10k, which is decent for the amount of work I put in but I found it very hard to scale it.<p>* Product startup: A lot riskier than the other options but with a bigger yield (if it happens). They are also more interesting.<p>I would like to completely focus on one option so I can work towards my goal. However I can&#x27;t decide which one would give me a better yield&#x2F;probability, I appreciate any new input.')
