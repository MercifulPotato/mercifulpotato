You&#x27;d use your computer and modem to log into a remote system.   You would use a newsreader to browse newsgroups.  If there was something that you wanted, like binaries, they would be saved on the remote system.  You&#x27;d then need to ftp them from that system to your own.<p>If you were one of the fortunate ones to have a hard-wired connection, well, that happened a lot faster.<p>Newsreaders were awesome for reading newsgroups.  You were able to add someone or a topic to a kill file for one group or all groups.<p>As binaries got bigger and bigger, the retention time for them on the remote system got shorter and shorter.  You might have 7 days of binaries and 90 days of everything else.<p>For a while some forum software would be accessible via NNTP which was awesome.  It let more people use the forums but gave more experienced users much better tools.')
