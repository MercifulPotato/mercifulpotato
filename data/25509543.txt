If only the base classes counted to your grades you&#x27;d be free to stretch your mind without risking your expensive credential.<p>&gt; and in any event, employers know the difference between the bird courses and the ones with real meat on the bones.<p>Some interviewers do, but I feel companies hire more blindly based on your GPA than that HR people actually dive in and weight your courses against other candidates.<p>&gt; being taught higher math and physics for the same price as what my friends were paying for sociology and religion courses seemed like the ultimate cheat<p>Good attitude.')
