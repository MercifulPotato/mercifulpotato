Item(by='sokoloff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610161036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25695765, text='&gt; was charged Thursday “with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority; or knowingly, with intent to impede government business or official functions, engaging in disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds; and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.”<p>That, though not yet criminally proven, sounds like a lot more than innocently walked into a building where he thought he was welcome. Employment actions do not need “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard of proof generally.')
