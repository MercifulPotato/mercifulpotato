The people that win get the results, even if it means being a massive piece of shit and treating your employees like garbage.<p>In fact, I would wager that not a single VP or higher at any major tech co isn’t a self-serving, backstabbing asshole. You simply don’t get into those types of positions on merit alone. You need to play the game.<p>That type of environment, where it’s almost impossible to do good work because you constantly need to be watching your own back is so unappealing to me that I can’t fathom why anyone with self worth would work at a FAANG. Perhaps it’s because they don’t know yet, but Blind exists, and it’s more horror stories than not.<p>Not having to deal with office politics and deranged managers is worth a hell of a pay cut imo.')
