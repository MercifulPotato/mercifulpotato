I think number of standard deviations are a bad measure when the data is so chaotic, especially since the standard deviation can vary strongly from year to year and from country to country. Lets say that one country had a few lucky years with few abnormalizes, while another country faces catastrophes regularly. Then a minor catastrophe in the first country will look way worse than in the second.')
