Some of the materials are cheaper, but usually the overall function is better than products that would cost some multiple of the price. We have the means to buy the more expensive furniture, but I can&#x27;t find any retailers that offer things that are as well-designed as IKEA, and IKEA <i>seems</i> to concern itself with the environment (although it&#x27;s frustratingly easy for a retailer to mislead about the degree to which they are environmentally friendly, and while I&#x27;m sure IKEA exaggerates, my other local retailers are far less convincing). I have been disappointed with IKEA&#x27;s selection of bookcases, but otherwise I&#x27;m pretty happy. Most importantly, my wife and I really enjoy trips to IKEA as one of the few &#x27;outings&#x27; we get to do during COVID (we like to browse around show rooms and get ideas for our home and also to try their Swedish-themed foods).<p>That said, I really do welcome suggestions for other retailers, whether they be retailers that are more environmentally friendly, or better designed, or with a more enjoyable shopping experience.<p>EDIT: one more grievance--somehow everything is still out of stock for the foreseeable future, and they are very tight-lipped about the specific nature of their supply chain woes and how they&#x27;re going to work around them. I would expect that a year into the pandemic they&#x27;d have addressed some of their supply chain issues or at least managed to be more accurate about their shipping estimates (even if those estimates are still far off into the future).')
