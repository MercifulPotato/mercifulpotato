Apple, Mapbox, Mapzen, Google? all offer free tiers for their tiles that cost big $$$$ once you go over the limit.<p>I have thought about making a generic API for centering a map, adding a marker, etc that would map (pun intended) the instructions onto the respective JS Api (Mapbox.js, MapKit JS, ...) allowing you to rotate between the services on each page load as to not exhaust the free tier as fast.<p>You&#x27;ll get a slightly different UI each time, but I think people generally know how to use a slippy map.<p>Does this exist? Is anyone interested in something like this?')
