Without that kind of grounding, from a certain frame of mind, you can feel like <i>king</i> of the universe instead.<p>It&#x27;s really not something to mess around with, in my opinion. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve unlocked the same sorts of states the hard&#x2F;manual way, and I was really glad to have the backing of the understanding of a mature religious tradition to put it into constructive context. It&#x27;s not by any means an unconditionally good thing, it&#x27;s nothing that should be allowed anywhere near an unprepared mind.')
