There seems to be relatively few places in the Belt and outside where anyone would want to go to, and guarding empty space where you&#x27;d expect no one to pass wouldn&#x27;t make much sense. So ships transiting from Earth to the Belt would be going through Mars&#x27; solar orbit doughnut-of-influence.<p>This of course ignores that with the Epstein drive magic, one could always trade travel time for going around ie. off-plane. There&#x27;s plenty of, well, space for that. (Edit: according to the no-stealth-in-space link in a sibling post, one would be seen doing that, and likely get chased for it as being suspicious).')
