Whisper was part of the holy trinity of Ethereum. You had Ethereum for consensus&#x2F;computation, Whisper for messaging, and Swarm for storage.<p>However, for various reasons, Whisper didnâ€™t get the attention it deserved. Development dwindled, it promised too much and it suffered from many issues, such as being extremely inefficient and not being suitable for running on e.g. mobile phone. Despite this, Status used it in its app from around 2017 to 2019. As far as I know, it was one of very few, if not the only, production uses of Whisper.<p>In an effort to solve some of its immediate problems, we forked Whisper into Waku and formalized it with a proper specification. This solved immediate bandwidth issues for light nodes, introduced rate limiting for better spam protection, improved historical message support, etc.&quot;')
