If you are asking about the current hardware level, then no, current quantum computers can not solve any practical problem faster than a classical computer.<p>In theory classical computers are also not limited to have better solutions to problems where quantum computers claim superiority like prime factorisation or like Tang&#x27;s quantum inspired classical algorithm that beats HHL for low rank matrices.')
