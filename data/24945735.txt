I think most other people take the same view; those &#x27;get out the vote&#x27; campaigns are usually targeted towards demographics with predictable preferences, so they&#x27;re also results-oriented.<p>I&#x27;d rather that electoral outcomes reflect what people would vote for if they were well-informed (which is what the cited book is about). You can predict how more information and understanding would impact voting trends (there are various techniques for this), and the results are not that everyone agrees on everything, but the impact would be an improvement (in my opinion).')
