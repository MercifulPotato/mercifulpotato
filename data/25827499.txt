Putting something into a fridge is simple and familiar, and here we see it&#x27;s still a struggle to define a quality spec.<p>A client may say, &quot;all I want is a button, why does that take two weeks an $20k to add?&quot;, and the developer who knows all the ways that button breaks the system&#x27;s assumptions about data and behavior may have trouble expressing that to the client. The frustrated developer may wonder why it&#x27;s like pulling teeth to get the client stop changing requirements, but in the client&#x27;s head everything seems simple (like the fridge) until they encounter a bizarre behavior they didn&#x27;t consider but the application code had to.<p>This article provides a good starting point for a discussion between client and developer about why their process needs to be iterative, and why its important to make requirements decisions early while they&#x27;re still cheap to update.')
