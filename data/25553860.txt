Culture is best when its pull rather than push; when a large company imposes culture on you, it is natural to feel that its foreign and you&#x27;re forced to adopt it. Compare this with a small group of people that you truly enjoy being with, solving problems, expressing frustrations and listening to their woes - you can create a microculture of your own which I only see as a positive thing. I do think that its better in a physically close setting like an office-space than being completely remote.')
