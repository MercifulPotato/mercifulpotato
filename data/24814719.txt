Most of these have to do with people being all different. When people are all the same, less communication problems.<p>But having people all the same then introduces non-communication problems. Lack of genetic diversity is a potential catastrophe. Lack of outside perspective makes novel thinking difficult. Lack of change breeds complacency.<p>So you need your software to work pretty much all the same way, but you need diversity in how it works to survive environmental challenges.<p>Nature has a solution for this (as in most things): evolution. You mutate a bit every so often and eventually something works better. Then you stick with that and repeat. It&#x27;s a continuous improvement cycle driven by measurably better outcomes from experiments.<p>This can work for hardware too but it&#x27;s definitely not as straightforward. But no matter what you use it on, you can&#x27;t have some clunky, hierarchical, reactive, conservative, single-minded power structure holding the process back. The stack will always suffer as long as there&#x27;s a giant anchor at the top keeping it from being agile and mutating. It&#x27;s not so much a cultural thing as an organism; if the organism can&#x27;t agree on how to grow, it&#x27;s not gonna fare well against competition.')
