Norwegians live in quite scattered communities and even though we have better public transport that some other countries it really isn&#x27;t convenient to time your visit to the nearest town and shopping centre to coincide with the bus timetable.  For me a trip to the centre of the nearest town (Drammen, Norway) means a forty minute bus ride and the buses run once per hour, not too bad if all I want to do is go to a caf√© or buy a small bag of shopping.  If I need to visit one of the shopping centres nearer the edge of town it will take and hour and twenty minutes and two buses.  Now imagine doing that with children as well while it is raining during the twenty minutes that you have to wait for the second bus.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing against pedestrian friendly towns, in fact Drammen is very pedestrian friendly, just that it is really not enough to make a town pedestrian friendly, not here anyway, you also need a massive expansion in public transport.  You need more routes, more frequent buses, you need overlapping routes so that people do not have to change buses too often.')
