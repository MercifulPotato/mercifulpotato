Same contract either way.<p>But I think a lot of people just kept getting the 24m contract. I went though it with my lodger and lent him the 600 because I think it takes the piss to do this.<p>Here in the UK at least there are a bunch of resellers who will give you a sim only contract and use one of the big three networks. So it&#x27;s easy&#x2F;affordable at least to just do that. I hope the US has this too...')
