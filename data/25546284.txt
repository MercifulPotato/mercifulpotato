Item(by='ComputerGuru', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609015121, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25545424, text='I don’t think 4WD&#x2F;4x4 is a strict subset of AWD or the other way around. One is typically manually selected, the other is <i>typically</i> always on at a certain ratio but (at least in modern variants) dynamically adjusted (or at least theoretically adjustable) either on a front&#x2F;back or even on a per-wheel basis based on dynamic real-time feedback.<p>TBH the line has blurred considerably in recent years and what once would have been 4x4 (manually engaged fixed-ratio four wheel mode) is being marketed as AWD. I’m sitting in a rental GMC Terrain (very crappy car, with or without AWD) and it must be manually switched from 2WD to 4WD mode but it’s an electronic button (rather than gear selection lever) that can be changed at speed, and can also be used in 4WD mode at highway speeds without redlining.  This is considerably different from body-on-frame SUVs&#x2F;pickups with “true” 4x4 mode that have regular 2WD but can be changed into 4L or 4H to get different gearing ratios inside the transfer case for four wheel drive.')
