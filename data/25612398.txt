Even before 1976 he wasn&#x27;t that great either - American Graffiti is a forgetable coming of age movie. If it wasn&#x27;t made by Lucas of later &#x27;Star Wars&#x27; fame nobody would remember it today.<p>What he is actually known for is being great at worldbuilding once, with Star Wars (beginner&#x27;s luck?). Middle age took that ability away though after the eighties, like a punk band trying to be relevant in their 40s: only for hardcore fans.<p>And I say it regretably. I&#x27;d too wanted a great Star Wars 1, 2, and 3. That said, most modern S.W. movies are also crap. The J.A. ones were so much a blatant copy of the original story plots as to be useless, whereas Han Solo bordered on camp. Rogue One was somewhat decent though, and I hear good things about the Mandalorean...<p>Spielberg on the other hand is a true master...')
