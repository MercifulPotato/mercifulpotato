My point about a guy in a bright red or hot pink suit in the B&amp;W original being represented as sepia&#x2F;navy in the colorization is still the same. It&#x27;s impossible to turn B&amp;W image into a color image without guessing what the colors are. The <i>average</i> color of a guy&#x27;s suit in the colorized copy might be right if it&#x27;s trained on a realistic dataset, but ultimately it&#x27;s still guessing and making up information for each individual suit.')
