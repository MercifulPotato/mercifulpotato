But also done tone of Perl, Delphi, VB and C# back in the day. Strange mix.<p>However I also think that how you look at the language greatly depends on what actual projects you have been working on and with whom plus personal taste. I&#x27;ve been mostly in finance and accounting and personally love code that is very easy to &quot;read&quot; (definition of readable code seems to vary per person).<p>Example: C++ has so many things crammed into it that I don&#x27;t see the value of it for doing stuff that are not high frequency trading. It is like using a sledgehammer to drive a nail in the wood.')
