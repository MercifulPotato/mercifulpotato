[Removed bit about regenerating this offset infrequently.]<p>EDIT: You could even do this in conjunction with the quantization mitigation, which sounds like it would shore up the slight weaknesses with that approach (where being on a quantization boundary makes it obvious where you are in that dimension) for the best of both worlds, as long as you&#x27;re okay with further decreasing accuracy.')
