They&#x27;re happy to take the money of a fully priced game which comes with a set of expectations of what that game will look like. This game has been in development for years, there&#x27;s been loads of promotional material for it, and it&#x27;s frankly anti-consumer to say that the customers are idiots for expecting something they purchase to be a functional piece of software.')
