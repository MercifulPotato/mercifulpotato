He&#x27;s now nearing four years old and he&#x27;s very bilingual - to the extent that he translates for me at times.<p>Children learn the local language, partly because of immersion, but also because they&#x27;re corrected nearly constantly when they begin to speak.  We forget that when they&#x27;re capable of &quot;good&quot; communication.<p>I&#x27;m seeing interesting things here, I speak to the child exclusively in English and as far as he&#x27;s concerned I speak&#x2F;understand zero Finnish.  I&#x27;m hoping I can start speaking more Finnish in the near future, he should be able to understand I&#x27;m &quot;mostly English&quot;.<p>One obvious thing that really drives the language home is the notion of pronouns.  Finnish has no gendered ones, so when he speaks English to me he&#x27;ll be &quot;Mummy is asleep, he will wake up soon?&quot;.  I have to keep saying &quot;Mummy is a girl, we say she&quot;.  I&#x27;ve been doing that for 8+ months, and he still doesn&#x27;t get it right.  That&#x27;s the level of repetition that&#x27;s involved in learning a new language.. and even now it hasn&#x27;t &quot;stuck&quot;.')
