So when my wife says she would like to watch something she&#x27;s been wanting to watch, and I look it up, I find that it used to be on Netflix but it&#x27;s not there anymore<p>This is a different matter. Netflix has a finite budget to license content. It&#x27;s not clear that it would be better for the consumer if they had a policy of never removing films from the library, as this would have to be counterbalanced by fewer new films being added. I suspect this approach would be much worse for the consumer overall.<p>Also, unlike when a series is cancelled, those films are still available to stream on an <i>Ã  la carte</i> basis from Google&#x2F;Amazon&#x2F;iTunes&#x2F;etc.')
