Serious question, Am I missing TOO much or maybe 20% productivity?<p>1. I am a one man shop doing Django sites, SRR only.\nWhen I need to interact with front end for more &quot;Reactivity&quot; I use javacript + a view exporting json.<p>2. About admin: It is good for me or the operator but I dont feel like my user should be using it?<p>Then I do my own &quot;admin&quot; for the customer.<p>Please what I am missing?<p>The #1 I feel once you have 2-3 they <i>may</i> make sense (separating functions).<p>The #2 the community answer was : &quot;Not for user, only staff or operator and not for general consumption&quot;<p>I would glad hear your points.<p>Thank You')
