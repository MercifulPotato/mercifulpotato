Throw a ball at the speed of light and you will see exactly the same path.<p>Lets say you shoot rifles with different calibers. Each time the bullet takes one second to hit the ground but the faster bullets travel longer distances. Light is so fast it escapes from the planet but if the planet were big enough even light would hit the ground like a bullet.')
