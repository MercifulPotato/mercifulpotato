You were clear, I just parsed it wrong.<p>So the criticism in that paragraph is undeserved, I&#x27;ve removed it for clarity but will leave it here for posterity.<p>&gt; Wasmer the company might have been announced November 12 2019, but the open source project was around a year before that. I don&#x27;t know what happened prior to that date to make the Bytecode Alliance members want to &quot;veto&quot; you as you put it, and maybe you&#x27;re entirely blameless for that. As you point out, your trademark shenanigans hadn&#x27;t taken place yet. But saying the &quot;veto of Wasmer happened the same day it was announced&quot; is misleading at best.')
