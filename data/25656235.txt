If a dentist never pulled out a tooth and just charged for morphine now and again you&#x27;d be pissed instead of being relieved that they made you feel well just for one day. Not only do you still suffer (but with timeouts), you also payed more long term.<p>If everyone just takes turns pushing a boulder up a mountain eventually you&#x27;ll put in more effort than if everyone pushes at once, and have almost none of the results. Sometimes being even 99% there is not enough.')
