Companies deeply linked to the petroleum industry argued against action (as, of course, would be expected). But the basic pitch of the environmentalists has never been acceptable. The idea that we should curtail the comfort of the present population in a speculative attempt to do something in 50 years is unpopular. And in total seriousness, it is rare I&#x27;ve heard an articulation of what that something is vs the alternative. The options I heard were we scale back our lifestyle so our children can scale back theirs, with the alternative of we don&#x27;t scale back our lifestyle and then our children scale back theirs.<p>The environmentalist movement has avoided:<p>* Pushing overpopulation into the political conversation (we&#x27;ve roughly doubled the global population since 50 years ago. The new arrivals are largely people in dire need of better energy access). We have a lot more talks about banning coal than pushing for a 1 child policy in Africa.<p>* Nuclear energy. Pointing out the obvious, the most successful climate change initiative in the past 50 years has been the energy grid in France. Pro-climate-action has generally correlated with anti-nuclear.<p>* Talking seriously about the costs or implementation strategy. As I recall, people were saying solar was a cheap option when Germany launched their Energiewende. They now have the most expensive power in Europe.<p>The best argument historically for ignoring climate change has been that its supporters don&#x27;t seem to be taking it seriously; they ignored a bunch of contributing factors or picked solutions based on political beliefs rather than trying to support cheap clean energy for everyone. GM and Ford are not responsible for that.')
