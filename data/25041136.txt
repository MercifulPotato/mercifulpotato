You cant take Phone costs in Ontario (Population 14.57 million, area 1.076 million km²) and compare that to California (Population 39.51 million, area 423,970 km²) and think you will pay the same rates.<p>Yes, most of Ontario is close to the border, and in cities, but your cell phone works over a massive area and you pay for this.<p>2) Canadian government pledges to connect 98% of Canadians via High-Speed Internet<p>This is the liberals, and probably gettiing ready for elections so they promise the world but history shows they also wont deliver on it.<p>- Ontario Wynne pledges to lower insurance rates (this becomes a &quot;stretch goal&quot;)\n- Trudeua pledges electoral reform (nope, never took place).<p>- Ontario Liberals move to ban two-tier health care (2003)\nHow long do you think Trudeau&#x27;s wife waited for her COVID treatment?  Do you think she was she treated in a hallway like other Canadians?')
