Then I eat breakfast and relax for an hour, and afterwards I can get a couple of hours of work in before lunch (though this is usually less focused time used for more menial work).<p>I&#x27;m useless from lunch until about 3pm - I&#x27;ve always known this; at the office I would just have a huge cup of coffee and try to focus. I take a break and play videogames or read during that time, then I pick it back up for a couple of hours of focused work from 3pm-5pm.<p>I cook and eat dinner, and then if I have shipments to pack (I&#x27;m still very early and shipping physical product myself), I put those together after dinner. I leave that until the end of the day because it&#x27;s mindless but has to be done before the morning, so it&#x27;s a good way to force me to do work regardless of how I&#x27;m feeling about it.<p>So I&#x27;d say about 5 hours of focused work (I can get in more if I&#x27;m super excited&#x2F;in the zone on something) and another 3ish of more menial stuff.')
