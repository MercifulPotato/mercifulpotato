I believe criticisms of the Catholic church and it&#x27;s educational system are absolutely warranted. The Catholic Church is responsible for hundreds of years of criminal, systemic violence and abuse all over the glove. The church is currently shielding over $2 Billion dollars to limit abuse payout. They aren&#x27;t denying the abuse. They are just trying not to be held accountable for it.<p>That includes the abusers, the people who cover for those abusers, and the church goers themselves who refuse to do anything about the systemic sexual, physical and mental abuse. Those gentle, loving and supportive people you speak of are enablers of a dysfunctional system. If they cared at all about the people in those systems, they&#x27;d do something to discover and prevent abuse. They don&#x27;t.<p>The kind of mistreatment described in the video is par for the course in most American Catholic schools. I attended public school from kindergarten up to 4th. I transferred to a Catholic school in the 5th grade and felt like I&#x27;d been assigned to a mental institution. The verbal abuse was constant. The physical abuse was random, sudden and could come from anyone at any time. I, along with class mates, was regularly offered wine by the priests. I didn&#x27;t learn of cases of actually sexual abuse until I was older and my class mates could talk about what happened.<p>We didn&#x27;t know any better and our parents couldn&#x27;t believe what was reported. When some event did reach a level that required community intervention, it was dealt with quietly and forgotten immediately.<p>When you factor in that they exist to teach decidedly unscientific, authoritarian thinking, the Catholic Church is a dangerous, abusive organization that has no interest in changing.<p>Rather than be offended, why don&#x27;t you spend your time reforming the church so it becomes a better institution?<p>This isn&#x27;t a case of a few bad apples. The entire system is made of bad apples. This is a bad apple tree that makes more bad apples.')
