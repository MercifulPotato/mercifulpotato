I live a few miles down a very windy chip-sealed[2] road, that I have to drive down any time I go anywhere. As a result(best I can tell) my tires tend to go bald 10k-20k miles early. Chip seal is used because it is cheap, seems regressive that I’d be taxed at a higher rate for a poorer road.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;streets.mn&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;07&#x2F;chart-of-the-day-vehicle-weight-vs-road-damage-levels&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;streets.mn&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;07&#x2F;chart-of-the-day-vehicle-weigh...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chipseal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chipseal</a>')
