I would also add the ‘spirit’ of the Defund the Police movement was that a lack of oversight created a safe environment for bad officers to victimize their community.<p>Now, many of the same champions of this cause are taking on the role of the police themselves. Across Reddit, Twitter, and elsewhere, people are creating open source documents with the names of anyone they believe was at the riot.<p>Most troubling of all, I am seeing many people openly advocating the police should have shot more protesters or brutalized them in some manner.<p>This seems highly contrary to the goals of the movement.')
