Not because I think it&#x27;s anything on the part of Salesforce, but that all these different corporations believe that this is something they HAVE to do. Government&#x27;s don&#x27;t just rule by hard power; they also rule by soft power. Soft power is social power. And the fact that companies believe that there will be negative consequences if they do not disavow the party that is now out of power, and all those that supported that party is a very dangerous situation. I think it&#x27;s bad for business if that level of coercive power, hard or soft, is hanging over companies.<p>I think it&#x27;s especially bad for startups. Parler was a startup that was rapidly growing, a real startup with an actual ceo and actual investors, and AWS yanked the rug out from under them, and I doubt they&#x27;ll be the last. I wonder how many promising companies that would otherwise be able to exist because we cared about their products and not their politics are likely to stop before they start, or else die early due to this environment.')
