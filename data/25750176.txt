Instead of shipping the planes, Airbus ships the parts, and assembles them in the US, thus avoiding the plane tarifs. So now there are tariffs on &quot;plane parts&quot;.<p>Maybe they&#x27;ll just stop doing this, close the factory, and ship whole planes from the EU again. Depends what the difference is in the plane and plane parts tariff, and whats more worth it.')
