It&#x27;s nominal GDP is $15tn, compared to $20tn for the USA. However it&#x27;s GDP per capita is 1&#x2F;6th that of the USA because it has 4x the population.<p>Of course the west, or the developed democracies are much more than just the USA. Also while China is catching up in many areas, it is far behind in many of the ones that really count. China&#x27;s military infrastructure and military technology is far, far behind. They have been struggling for almost a decade to get even one refurbished Russian aircraft carrier operational. Their space launch and satellite technology is decades behind, as is their silicon chip tech.<p>China is almost caught up to the USA by itself in raw industrial and economic power, they&#x27;re close to parity, but this is just muscle. On the technology front they are still copying the basic stuff. It will take them another generation to catch up to the west in the ability to innovate in new technologies. They will do it though. It&#x27;s just a matter of time. Then they will be a match for the west as a whole, not just the USA.')
