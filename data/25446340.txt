I had no idea how I&#x27;d pay off such a huge amount.<p>At that point, I thought $30,000&#x2F;yr was enough to live on.<p>Right now we&#x27;re building a house, that we&#x27;ll have paid off in ~4 years, worth $700K.<p>Not too long ago, $450&#x2F;month for an apartment felt like an unneeded extravagance.<p>All of this to say... this number is a moving goalpost. At $1M, your mindset may have changed. Your life situation may have changed. Your priorities may change.<p>In fact, most likely they will.<p>Right now I&#x27;m struggling to define this elusive number for myself. I don&#x27;t know if $3M will be enough, nor $5M.<p>Instead, I&#x27;m turning inward to figure out what is joy in the present moment?<p>If I can achieve that, nothing else will matter, since joy will be my reality every day.')
