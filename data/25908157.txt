Some even to the point where I wasn&#x27;t sure the vehicle was going to get me where I was going. It doesn&#x27;t help that in the midwest the roads are 3rd world quality.<p>The business model is flawed and I would rather use a company that maintains a vehicle fleet where a mechanic is involved and knows if a vehicle should not be on the road.')
