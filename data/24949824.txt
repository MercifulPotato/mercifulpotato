I got to be in charge of the dial that controlled the no2&#x2F;oxygen mix. We started at, like, 40% no2 but then she said she was in pain so I dialled it up to 60%. She was still in pain after half an hour so I increased to 80%. 30 mins later she was in a lot of pain and I noted you could actually set it to 100% no2, but didn&#x27;t understand how she&#x27;d get any oxygen at that setting. I should probably have figured it out at that point, but was pretty sleep-deprived. I asked a nurse why the no2 wasn&#x27;t working and she said &quot;why, you&#x27;re almost on 80% oxygen now!&quot;')
