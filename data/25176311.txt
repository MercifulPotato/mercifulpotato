I have avoided COBOL but I have seen stuff written in VB6&#x2F;COM which was also in the same state. Eventually the one guy who knows anything about it leaves or dies. In the name of “progress” someone wraps it in something else and sticks a web API around it but everyone is afraid to touch that bit of VB code. Now a third party calls this and wonders why it takes 10 seconds for an HTTP API call to run and they can’t be issued in parallel or it throws a 500 error. Then the third party asks to send 20,000 of these a day and then finger pointing and stuff occurs at management level between both companies.<p>I have been on both sides of this and it sucks. I came up with Rug Driven Development as a title. All the risks and future problems are swept under the rug quickly while maintaining a happy smile and pretending everything is just fine and dandy.')
