Item(by='ModernMech', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609268960, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25571431, text='&gt; It&#x27;s about all the people who benefit because of the existence of spacex&#x2F;tesla&#x2F;etc<p>No one benefits by the mere &quot;existence&quot; of SpaceX&#x2F;Tesla. People benefit only from what those companies produce, and the things those companies produce only come into this world by way of people selling their labor to design, engineer, and manufacture the rockets&#x2F;cars. We can go all the way down the supply chain and say that people only benefit from Tesla due to the people mining lithium in other countries. And yet the CEO of Tesla believes that the people mining his lithium deserve to have their government replaced by a US-backed coup to be more friendly to his corporation.<p>The point isn&#x27;t that we should &quot;seize profits&quot;. The point is that the guy at the top isn&#x27;t producing as much value as he thinks he is compared to everyone below him. They are producing the real value, they should be getting the wealth. Maybe Musk still comes out of the equation the richest one of them all. Fine. But he doesn&#x27;t have to come out a demi-god with more money than he could spend in 100 lifetimes. There&#x27;s no reason that needs to happen.')
