Item(by='andrewjl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602503898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24749829, text='&gt; Its an asset. Like many (virtually all, other than pure financial) assets, it has associated expenses; maintenance, depreciation, and similar expenses are the norm for non-financial assets.<p>To get technical about it, code whose discounted future maintenance costs exceed the discounted revenue it is expected to bring in or helps to bring in is a liability. Some maintenance costs are invisible, such as having team members leave; leading to recruiting expenses to seek a replacement and the associated ramp time when they&#x27;re hired. Companies are often not equipped to assess the cost side in any way that approaches reality and just stick the cost of the &quot;code&quot; on the balance sheet as capex. Having an asset on the balance sheet after doing this doesn&#x27;t mean you have an asset in reality.<p>&gt; The whole &quot;code is a liability, not an asset&quot; line is something from people who might understand code, but definitely don&#x27;t understand assets and liabilities.<p>Code can be a <i>net</i> liability. Unless you are looking purely at the asset side of the balance sheet and ignoring liabilities, which tends not to be very useful.')
