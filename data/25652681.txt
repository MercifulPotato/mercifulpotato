Of course billions of years from now it will be gone.<p>Where I live the land is very much a big part of the cost of the home. The structure is worth what it would cost to demolish plus rebuild it minus existing wear and tear&#x2F;needed repairs I figure. The value of the structure doesn’t appreciate as fast as the land it is on due to degradations as you’ve pointed out and materials&#x2F;labor usually not increasing as fast as appreciating assets which the land itself is. Of course in many locations the structure is worth more than the land it is on.<p>Hence location being the most important part of the equation as any real estate agent will tell you.')
