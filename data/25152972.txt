Tests more and more were weighted towards verbal proofs, and I hadn&#x27;t yet developed the vocabulary to deal with the precision necessary to use English to prove something mathematically. It wasn&#x27;t until after graduation that I learned that there are some sophomore math courses at my university that Math majors usually take that were unofficially known as &quot;intro to proofs&quot;. I have no doubt this was missing foundation that made 400 level math courses so painful for me.')
