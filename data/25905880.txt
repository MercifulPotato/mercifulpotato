Here&#x27;s what I need:<p>* have a few incoming, simple IVRs in different languages (with local numbers via FlyNumber) a la &quot;press 1 for sales, press 2 for support, or wait for an operator&quot;.<p>* route these calls to the appropriate people (either with a ring group or any other workable option that allows people to get a call on their phone)<p>What&#x27;s the correct service for this?
