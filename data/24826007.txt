As a trans woman in IT I couldn’t appreciate this post more at this time, nor do I think it’s ever been more relevant.<p>Might I suggest you consider adding - and I put here for HN’s convenience as well — a list of potential great alternatives? :)<p>‘Hey folks’<p>‘Hey everyone’<p>‘Hey y’all’<p>‘Hey team:’<p>Even just ‘Hey -‘<p>I also like ‘Good morning’, ‘Good afternoon’, ‘Good evening’, they’re great ways to inclusively greet people and start a conversation as well.<p>Thanks again for posting this! :)')
