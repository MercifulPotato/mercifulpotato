Hard stance on X are generally a reflection of appeal in the market. Moral of the story: Few politicians have the wherewithal to lead, most reflect (in a focus group driven sort of way).<p>I&#x27;m not so sure it&#x27;s that most ppl are against drug laws. It&#x27;s that the laws aren&#x27;t working. They&#x27;re not delivering on what was promised. It&#x27;s yet another case - consciously or not - where the public is realizing that you can&#x27;t cure a problem by attacking a symptom.<p>If there&#x27;s a hope it&#x27;s that more politicians step up, lean in, and lead. &quot;Wait a minute, that&#x27;s not a solving a problem, that&#x27;s only a symptom.&quot; When we hear that often then we&#x27;ll know the paradigm has changed. As it is, one change (e.g., drug laws) is not a trend.')
