Never had a problem for most of my life, then got sick in a way that I was given hydrocodone for 8 months.  I took more than the label said, a lot more, and at some point a switch clicked over in my head.  After the hydrocodone was gone, I switched to alcohol only because it was easy to get.  I&#x27;ve been sober a while now, but stopping the drinking was MUCH harder than stopping the hydrocodone.  Alcohol is a beast once that circuit breaker trips in your head and you start drinking large quantities daily.<p>It&#x27;s very hard to explain to someone that hasn&#x27;t gone through it.  Suffice it to say that quitting isn&#x27;t really about willpower.')
