In my experience as a SW engineer it&#x27;s my side projects that I learn the most from, and I&quot;m still struggling sometimes to find people&#x2F;places to socialize some code without incurring criticisms as if I&#x27;m proposing to a VC asking for money.  Congrats, the site functions well and looks designed smartly that you can continue to add functionality.')
