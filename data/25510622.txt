The majority of game streamers don&#x27;t really need that though, although they might fork it over because they already have HDMI capture cards with dual inputs.<p>But for the most part, most streamers don&#x27;t care about their little picture in the bottom 1&#x2F;4 to 1&#x2F;8 of the screen. Good lighting in the filming room is much more important than the camera anyway.')
