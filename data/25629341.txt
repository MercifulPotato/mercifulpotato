They&#x27;re not better than the alternatives, and in many ways they&#x27;re worse: by picking a relational database you&#x27;re committing to difficulty deploying schema changes, difficulty sharding, an awkward square-table model and a terrible query language, and if you make the mistake of trying to use the transactional functionality that&#x27;s the one actual selling point of those datastores then you&#x27;re practically guaranteed to deadlock yourself in production at some point during your growth process.')
