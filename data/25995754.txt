I am afraid in future battle lines will be drawn and some cards like Ford will support Android Auto while neglective Apple CarPlay while other manufactures will go another way around. So consumers will be forced to chose compatible phones and cars. To make it worse, some families use Android and Apple phones which would make them imposbile to find a car supporting both. I would prefer car manufactures to stay mobile-OS neutral, without showing any preferences and try to support major ones at the same level.')
