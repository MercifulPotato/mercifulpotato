Item(by='antonfire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607658501, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25381795, text='FWIW, I agree with you that &quot;it seems like you dislike trans folk&quot; isn&#x27;t a good place to go, for a number of reasons. For one, it&#x27;s a tactical mistake to pull out that kind of accusation if you want someone to listen to you. For another, it&#x27;s probably too reductive to be accurate. I&#x27;m not going to defend the hill of &quot;SJWs aren&#x27;t bullies&quot; or even &quot;the person you&#x27;re calling an SJW here wasn&#x27;t being a bully&quot;.<p>But I also think if you look past that and strip the junk away, there&#x27;s a kernel of truth to it which is worth keeping.<p>Namely, the pushback against singular &quot;they&quot; here <i>is</i> grounded as pushback against some perceived nominally-pro-trans movement. (That&#x27;s what &quot;1% of the population&quot; refers to, yeah?) A good chunk of the criticism presented is criticism of the kind of people who call for singular &quot;they&quot; and not actually criticism of singular &quot;they&quot;. It&#x27;s not just about the grammar, and probably wasn&#x27;t in the first place, as evidenced by the fact that we&#x27;re talking about trans people now somehow.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to toss &quot;SJW&quot; and &quot;bully&quot; around, I think it&#x27;s not out of line for me to scrunch up my nose and throw out a &quot;reactionary&quot; when I see that.')
