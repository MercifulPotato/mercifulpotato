Item(by='ethbr0', descendants=None, kids=[25514463], score=None, time=1608693014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25513122, text='&gt; <i>it is Apple [...] track record of execution</i><p>Granted! My personal guess is this turns out much like Google Fiber: a capital- and regulation-heavy endeavor that Apple (and their investors, used to tech margins) aren&#x27;t culturally or financially willing to commit to for a long enough haul.<p>But an effort which eventually pays off by frightening existing players into cutting better partnership deals with Apple.<p>From a quick peek, Apple runs ~25% pre-tax margins. For reference, Ferrari has ~20%, as the highest in the industry. And ~10% or less seems standard.<p>So in the end, <i>if</i> Apple is more successful than Ferrari at selling vehicles profitably, they&#x27;ll still be making less money than they&#x27;re used to on the investment.<p>That doesn&#x27;t seem like something investors are going to be willing to let Apple endlessly torch cash in pursuit of, competing against firms with decades of experience, when the alternative is returning it directly to them via dividends, buybacks, etc.<p>And that&#x27;s not even getting into the optics of labor-relations with manufacturing that Apple would have to very publicly expose, vs their more hidden technology supply chain.<p>The more I think about this, the more it seems like the only viable &quot;Apple car&quot; is a limited-volume halo project, built on top of an existing manufacturer&#x27;s platform -- which would mirror their approach to technology, in many ways.')
