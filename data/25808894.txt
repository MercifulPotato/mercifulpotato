It is used in applications that don&#x27;t have anything to do with the web, but is taken into use purely because it has good tooling around it and practically every developer knows it. This often happens because there are deadlines, developers need to push out products, and nobody has time to actually work on a better fundamental technology. So, the common denominator ends up being chosen. I am not talking about whatever tehnical issue you believe exists. If the standards bodies took their legs out of their asses, they would have come up with a better standard. Instead, we are stuck on HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS.<p>&gt; Parsing and rendering HTML is not a problem. HTML does not even feature in this discussion at all.<p>If you actually read the comment tree, you&#x27;d realize that the whole discussion starts with an anecdote about how slow rendering HTML is even on a beefy machine.<p>Having worked with React since 2015 practically daily, I can say with confidence that the only reason it exists is to enable interactive UIs on top of a <i>document</i> markup language (HTML). Rendering HTML is exactly the problem, React&#x27;s (initial) purpose was to make rendering (or rather, producing or manipulating) HTML easier.<p>&gt; Your comment makes zero sense, and reads like a non-sequitur rant.<p>&quot;It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.&quot;')
