If you turn on your hood fan to its maximum, then presumably the impact to air quality is minimal. I happen to also have a counter-top induction stove, and it ALSO will trip off my air filters. I don&#x27;t think triggering air filters is necessarily an indication of unhealthy air - the smell of good food kicking is due to particles reaching your nose and that happens with all methods of heating up food.<p>But there is a greater philosophical question here: the article seems to be setting up for a war on gas stoves and gas heating. I know this is a goal of climate activists, and that push is already happening in places like Seattle where a prior attempt to ban gas in all new home construction was met with outrage and pulled back, only to now be replaced by a similar ban for commercial buildings (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;seattle-news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;amid-increased-emissions-seattle-mayor-wants-to-ban-gas-heat-in-new-commercial-apartment-buildings&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;seattle-news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;amid-incr...</a>).<p>Personally I want to be able to use gas ranges for cooking - electric cooking is simply no match for it, and I also just like the idea of cooking with fire. Should the state really be imposing all sorts of controls and restrictions in search of perfect safety? Can individuals not evaluate and make risk-benefit tradeoffs that suit themselves? After all, most people who have gas stoves do not have health issues like asthma, and the statistics quoted in this article seem to just be correlations rather than causal relationships.')
