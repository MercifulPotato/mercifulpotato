And also ignore what he&#x27;s said repeatedly in other speeches where he thinks he should be &quot;given&quot; another term and, oh right, where he straight-up mobster-ranted at Georgia&#x27;s Secretary of State <i>demanding he find him votes</i>.<p>Sorry dude. We don&#x27;t play half-blind here for the sake of your argument.<p>And if you want less &quot;partisan rage&quot;--well, plenty of the chumleys who <i>stormed the Capitol</i> are still at large, we can sure start there!
