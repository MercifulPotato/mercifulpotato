We had a fine old elm in the front yard, a swing on a chain from a large branch with a pit under it from generations of kids scuffing in the dust. Beautiful.<p>Then Dutch Elm Disease came through Iowa. Our tree lost a lot of new growth, the next year grew a million suckers from the trunk looking like a furry tree, then was dead. The stump when we cut it down could hold all the kids sitting around it (big farm family).<p>Years later I went to California to school, then bought a house on 12th St in San Jose. Beautiful mature trees lining the street! 60 ft high, a green corridor!<p>Then they started dropping branches, destroying awning and car hoods. The next year the affected ones grew a million suckers on the truck like huge furry sculptures.<p>Unknown to me, they were &#x27;Siberian Elm&#x27;. The Dutch Elm disease had reached the west coast! It had taken nearly 20 years to travel halfway across the US.<p>The city removed them all, and it became a sun-blasted street with no relief from the heat. Gone the tunnel of green. Gone all the Elm in the Western US.')
