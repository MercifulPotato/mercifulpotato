My list was tightly scoped to a process&#x2F;ecosystem about tracking the metric of page speed.<p>2) How is that metric used in the algorithm?  Boosting in the score in general?  Is the top carousel treated differently?<p>3) It&#x27;s also possible the application of the metric can change what is required from that metric.  For example: Google regular results require one page speed option, but Google mobile carousel requires a more stringent page speed option.<p>Personally, I am fine with page speed being used as a metric in search results.  Context: The main usecase for AMP, and the publishers who support it, are related to news (versus stack overflow, etc).  So there is a lot of room for &quot;kim kardashian birthday party&quot; to have very similar content where page speed is a great metric to optimize between them.<p>I am less fine with Google requiring their hosted version of it - especially in the medium&#x2F;long term once the project has gotten over its experimental phase and proven market adoption.')
