Item(by='Timpy', descendants=None, kids=[25701074, 25700359], score=None, time=1610199331, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25699723, text='でしょう roughly means &quot;don&#x27;t you agree&quot; or &quot;I agree&quot;, I didn&#x27;t play the FF games so I don&#x27;t have enough context to translate its original meaning here.<p>手に入る literally translates to &quot;put into hand&quot;, but it means &quot;acquire&quot; in the context of opening a chest and finding a potion.  Japanese games say &quot;potion put into hand&quot; and English translations say &quot;You received a potion&quot;.<p>全く literally means &quot;truly&quot; or &quot;very&quot; but a lot of the time people use to mean &quot;seriously&quot; in a sarcastic sense.  Like, &quot;seriously!?&quot; or &quot;jeeze!&quot;.  A beginner would think &quot;very&quot; but somebody with experience would know they&#x27;re just complaining in a way that doesn&#x27;t elicit* a response.')
