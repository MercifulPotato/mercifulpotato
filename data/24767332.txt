Item(by='XCSme', descendants=None, kids=[24769340], score=None, time=1602607812, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24761755, text='Hey, wanted to let you know that I took your good advice and changed the pricing from $7.99&#x2F;month to $59.99&#x2F;year. \nThis is cheaper for the customer, easier to deal with invoices for both parties, leads to less churn and overall a better experience for everyone. The only drawback is that you have to pay $59.99 to try it, where before you only had to pay $7.99, but there&#x27;s still the 30 days money-back, so maybe it&#x27;s fine.<p>You can see the updated prices here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usertrack.net&#x2F;pricing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usertrack.net&#x2F;pricing</a>')
