The terrifying thing is how few scientists understand the statistical underpinnings of their studies. The conflation happens because he thinks this is stratified by field. In practice, there are plenty of sociologists with a decent grasp on this, and a truly astonishing number of biologists who don&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t believe me? Read the studies of biology papers and how many have serious problems in their statistical treatment.<p>So we&#x27;ve got a serious problem with how science is being done. Probably doesn&#x27;t affect whether or not expertise exists, or which fields it exists in. Unless we&#x27;re going to start saying biology isn&#x27;t real.')
