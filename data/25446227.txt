What changed my mind was every single astronomer or astrophysicist I spoke to about pursuing the career literally told me not to.  No jobs, no money, don&#x27;t do it.  Being young and unfamiliar I listened to their advice and went to university for a different career.  Academia research seems like a lot of politics and bs to put up with however I think I would have enjoyed that career much more than software development I am in now.')
