Some of the integrations use the official available API (like the Telegram one) but others (like the Whatsapp and Signal ones) run on altered web client code. Furthermore, in most commercial chat systems, alternative clients are usually not allowed and can lead to a ban of your account if the server considers you a bot.<p>The product is a worthy attempt at fixing the mess that is modern chat solutions, but from my experience I just don&#x27;t trust the system enough to switch.<p>Also keep in mind that any e2e encryption platforms like Signal and Whatsapp provide is made worthless if you use a bridge; I haven&#x27;t seen any bridge use Matrix&#x27;s e2e encryption yet and your messages are all being decrypted on the server regardless.')
