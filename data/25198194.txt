Generally speaking, I found it difficult to empathize with the writer&#x27;s marvel for recolored strips, in sentences like &quot;The notion that a strip might have been colored differently from paper to paper opens up a whole new world of imagination&quot;. Dude, this has been done  all over the comic industry since coloring existed, there are entire series dedicated to doing exactly that to specific bodies of work. Sure, newspapers strip are their own little niche in many ways, but this is hardly unique or original in Garfield. I&#x27;m somewhat surprised a fairly famous strip artist in his own right (David Malki of Wondermark) wouldn&#x27;t know that.')
