As happy as i am to welcome peeps onto localhost.run it&#x27;s sad to see peeps in this space disappear, especially peeps that like SSH as much as I do.\nI read a medium article about serveo after it disappeared that suggested you could choose your own stable subdomain. localhost.run used to work like this but I got hammered by phishing sites, almost got shut down by my registrar and my hosting provider. I wonder if that was it?\nStopping phishing is, by far, the thing I&#x27;ve had to do the most work on.')
