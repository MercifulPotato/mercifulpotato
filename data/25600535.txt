Item(by='zapzupnz', descendants=None, kids=[25600611], score=None, time=1609471329, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600506, text='I think there&#x27;s a distinction to be made between a concept which can be violent and a violent depiction, specifically when said violence is depicted <i>realistically</i>. I think Miyamoto is referring to wish to avoid the latter.<p>You never see Mario&#x27;s enemies burn, you watch them disappear in a puff of smoke. When enemies are jumped upon, they flatten in a cartoonish manner rather than a realistic. Even in Zelda, where some things can be genuinely gruesome to watch, enemies mainly flash red when they are hit rather than spew blood everywhere â€” and this is a series where most bosses are to be stabbed in the eye!<p>&gt; They&#x27;re just violence disguised in cute clothing<p>That&#x27;s called cartoon violence. Yeah, it&#x27;s still violence, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s what Miyamoto was referring to.<p>For Miyamoto, his characters, his worlds, and even the enemies are all like players on a stage. They play their parts, including being the villains, and bowing out when their time is up. It&#x27;s as they go off-stage, maybe to participate in a kart racer or a round of tennis.')
