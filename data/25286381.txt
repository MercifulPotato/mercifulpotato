Also, the mention of <i>other email</i> (which I didn&#x27;t read) further hints that there&#x27;s something heated going on amongst the parties.<p>So looks like Timnit sent an e-mail to the group which wasn&#x27;t OK in the eyes of the higher management, then sent a strong mail about her demands to the same management and used &quot;I&#x27;ll resign otherwise&quot; card to force her way.<p>The management, agitated from the first e-mail, didn&#x27;t buy it and sent her home. The way they did is neither elegant nor polite but, she pushed a lot to get this response it seems.<p>This is my understanding of the issue and I may be <i>completely</i> wrong but, this is what I was able to decipher.')
