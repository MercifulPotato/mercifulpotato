British consumers are no longer protected by the rather &quot;feisty&quot; pro-consumer EU courts and are now at the mercy of the rather less consumer friendly UK courts, so companies like MasterCard will be tempted to &quot;have a go.&quot;<p>One possible consequence of this, especially if Visa decides to join in, is that some companies that are based in the EU for payments (such as Amazon) will open up UK subsidiaries which may actually have a benefit for the UK. Or they might just put their prices up a bit. We&#x27;ll see..<p>I have also added this to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brexitreality.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brexitreality.org&#x2F;</a> - a spreadsheet of post-Brexit &quot;how it&#x27;s going&quot; stories which you might find useful or wish to contribute to.')
