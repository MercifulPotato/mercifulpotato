I don&#x27;t really need fast charging, but I have a bunch of little devices to charge and almost all of them support USB-A.  AFAICT all current USB-C charging bricks are limited to 3 (maybe 4?) ports.  And those are expensive.  I&#x27;ve already got a few of the 6-port bricks.  I suppose this is because USB-C is potentially faster (PD) so they can&#x27;t support more than a few ports per charger.  Still, it&#x27;s been a hassle with my iPad Pro.  It&#x27;s kind of the bastard child of my collection, and it just barely agrees to be charged with a USB-A to USB-C cable (it doesn&#x27;t always agree to charge from a completely drained state, but it does charge if it&#x27;s already got enough juice to turn on).')
