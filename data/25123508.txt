They compete more with vacation rentals, which seems old-fashioned since their online inventory always sucks.<p>I also think hotels are impersonal. As mentioned in this thread, they market themselves as &quot;having a local experience&quot; and I think that&#x27;s been an effective message. I have gotten great recommendations from hosts  on food, dining, and things <i>not</i> to do and I get to choose the location&#x2F;theme of my stay too. Do I need to work? Am we relaxing for a couple days? The choose your own adventure aspect means that AirBnB is the starting place for all those searches, not hotels.<p>I also think there is a real lack of comparable options to hostels in the states so those could be similar jobs here (not abroad). I know of 1 hostel in my hometown near the airport (top 20 US city by pop).<p>I do agree that great hosts will push up prices to be comparable to hotels and the gap is closing steadily. I think you can still find great middle ground in most cities.')
