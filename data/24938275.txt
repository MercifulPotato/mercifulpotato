I&#x27;ve seen weeks&#x2F;hundreds of thousands of dollars wasted by proceeding with data analysis without properly considering the coordinate reference system.<p>If spatial accuracy is a concern and<p>- your data is vector-based lines or a polygons, there is no guarantee that the edges between your vertices will follow the same trajectory in a different coordinate system. This means that the spatial relationship (intersection, overlap, etc) between two geographic objects depends on the coordinate system and the relative density of points.<p>- your data is raster-based, you need to resample pixels values to translate between coordinate systems. If your pixels represent absolute&#x2F;measured values (eg population), you need to consider this carefully.<p>- In both vector and raster, you need to deal with dateline and pole issues. The earth is not a cartesian plane.<p>- In both cases, you also need to consider more than the projection. You also deal with datums which define the relationship between the actual earth surface and the theoretical sphere&#x2F;spheroid the projections are based on. Get this wrong and your results might &quot;look&quot; OK but be meters off - you might not see it visually but it will cause problems for high-precision analysis.')
