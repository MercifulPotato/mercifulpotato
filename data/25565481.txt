Item(by='jancsika', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609204632, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25562663, text='&gt; there was an image library for Gnome&#x2F;GTK, IIRC<p>librsvg is one.<p>I think it was originally written in C, and it apparently approaching being fully Rust.<p>Rust claims very loudly, repeatedly, and apparently with honesty that &quot;gotta go fast&quot; and safety are language design goals <i>and</i> features. So I&#x27;d imagine even a developer who just wants to get their hands dirty with Rust would be willing to do battle with the borrow checker since there&#x27;s a good chance they&#x27;ll eventually hit those goals that they share in common <i>with the language itself</i>.<p>Does Haskell have &quot;gotta go fast&quot; as a central language feature? If not, that&#x27;d be a real gamble for an SVG renderer. After all, what&#x27;s the use of a library that produces the output you&#x27;d expect, but also at a speed you&#x27;d expect for a kludgy, over-engineered, text-based vector image format?<p>&gt; But everyone still shits on &quot;Rust Evangelists&quot; when they bring it up.<p>Yes, but the language forces them to shit on it for reasons other than &quot;not being fast.&quot; :)<p>Edit: clarification')
