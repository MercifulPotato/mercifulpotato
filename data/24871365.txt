Checking the cvs of three randomly chosen very famous mathematicians who graduated in this period (Stein, Atiyah, Mumford), it looks like they all did postdocs.<p>This was addressed in my comment:<p>&gt; Postdocs were only for people aiming for a faculty position at a top school.<p>Don&#x27;t look at people who are outliers.
