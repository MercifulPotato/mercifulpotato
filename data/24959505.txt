A lot of the time I use a Debian box for my personal stuff with keyboard and cheap 1080p display. It <i>does not</i> run X at all. It&#x27;s literally just framebuffer console, tmux and terminals. I don&#x27;t use a web browser on it either.<p>A neat side effect of this is the machine I use is a fanless N3010 celeron based Lenovo M600 which feels positively lightning quick if you never go near the www on it. Perhaps 90% of the reason a PC feels like a sluggish POS these days is because there&#x27;s some chunk of browser stack in there somewhere.<p>Edit: picture of the set up here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;yjPMYaX" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;yjPMYaX</a>')
