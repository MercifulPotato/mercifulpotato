It&#x27;s actually impossible for them, and will be even more impossible once DoorDash goes public, they&#x27;ll be legally obligated by their shareholders to make the most money possible.<p>Our legal system supports companies making the most money the market will allow, if they paid more then the market for delivery drivers the executive that made that decision would be fired.<p>You aren&#x27;t supporting exploitative practices by using DoorDash, you&#x27;re giving somebody a job where they otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t have any. You&#x27;re funneling money from affluent city dwellers to the pockets of DoorDash&#x27;s share holders yes, but also to their delivery drivers.<p>Attacking a company for creating jobs where there weren&#x27;t any before is silly. Attack the issues with the legal framework, not the people that are using it as designed.')
