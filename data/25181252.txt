This is one of the few goods I chose to buy &quot;disposable,&quot; since I can&#x27;t repair a broken watch of any kind on my own. I work outdoors a lot and I&#x27;m always scratching the face and banging it on things. Usually the failure point is water getting in through those cracks, but I&#x27;ve had one wristband snap. I think I buy one a year roughly, and have for over 6 years.')
