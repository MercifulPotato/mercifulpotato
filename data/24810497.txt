Item(by='reggieband', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602947179, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24807040, text='&gt; As I said and you conveniently ignore, user generated content would have to be scrubbed from the Internet except from the big players like Facebook<p>I&#x27;ve repeated it ad nauseam but I&#x27;ll repeat it again - this is just hyperbole.<p>In what capacity do the majority of Internet users aggregate the content of others? I&#x27;m thinking about my own use of the Internet. In what capacity do I own domains or applications where I personally publish the content generated by others?<p>Let&#x27;s consider a few possible cases (which do not apply to me). I have a blog with a comment section. Someone posts some comment that leaves me open to legal liability. I have a few options including turning off comments on my blog, moderating all comments on my blog before they go live, paying a third party to handle moderation (and indemnify&#x2F;insure me against legal liability).<p>Second, I am passionate about some hobby and wish to create a public forum on a domain I host that allows for the discussion. Malicious participants start to show up that start to post content on this unmoderated forum that open me up to legal liability. Again, I have to deal with this now in some capacity.<p>Third, I am an entrepreneur with my sights on a startup. This startup is like an Instagram, Pinterest, Reddit, Tumbler&#x2F;Blogger, Medium, Quora, Yahoo Answers, Stack Overflow etc. I am concerned that malicious actors will use my new venture to publish malicious content. Right now, I don&#x27;t care I just build it without any worry. Without Section 230 I have to seriously think about how I ensure content is moderated.<p>I&#x27;m just not seeing the Internet break in any of these scenarios. I&#x27;m not seeing the Internet being scrubbed of content. In fact, as far as I can tell all of the above happens already to some degree. Do you expect defamatory content on stack overflow? Or do you expect it to be removed?')
