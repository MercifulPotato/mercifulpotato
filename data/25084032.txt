Sure, you could Mapquest some directions and print them out. But nowadays, you don&#x27;t even have to think about planning your drive out. You hop in the car and navigate to your location. Need to stop somewhere for gas? Search along the route and find the cheapest gas with the shortest detour (not based on distance, but an accurate time estimation based on traffic&#x2F;lights&#x2F;etc) with your favorite restaurant nearby. Traffic up ahead? Get a suggested reroute in real-time. Need to take an exit? The app will tell you exactly which lane to be in to anticipate the next turn. Road debris&#x2F;collision ahead? The app will let you know. Tioga pass closed? You don&#x27;t even have to think about it since the app will route you via the correct pass from the start. Traveling via public transit in a new city, walking, biking? The app will give you directions tailored for your specific mode of travel.<p>All of this, happening in real-time, on a device that fits in your pocket, while driving in your car.<p>I could bring up the same examples for any other type of service. The fact that so many dismiss these legit, quality of life, improvements just shows how jaded many of you are. Sure, we aren&#x27;t making breakthroughs at the fundamental levels of software, but that&#x27;s only because we haven&#x27;t even gotten close to reaching the limits of our current capabilities.')
