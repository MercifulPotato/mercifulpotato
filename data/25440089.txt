The Obama DOJ pursued and enforced consent decrees over a bunch of local police departments; the incoming Republican DOJ announced that they were backing away from them. Certainly, national politics has some influence over local policing.<p>But I&#x27;m mostly with you. I&#x27;m kind of dumbfounded by how much attention gets paid to national&#x2F;federal policing policy, where change is essentially impossible to achieve, when most people live in suburbs, where 2-3 seats on a village or township board can result in nearly arbitrary policing policy changes for that suburb. Swing House seats are a million-dollar proposition; a village board seat in Oak Park might go for less than $5000 invested.<p>A serious theory of change, and one I think more credible than passing any kind of new federal law: get reformer village boards elected in a scattering of suburbs, get them to pass sharp, meaningful policies (an end to no-knocks, crisis intervention teams, or dream big and have the police stop doing routine traffic enforcement), then <i>prove them out</i>. I&#x27;ve been watching Chicagoland village board meetings for the past couple months, and the modal question that seems to come in policy discussions is &quot;what are the neighboring suburbs doing&quot;. Start there! See if you can get a snowball rolling.')
