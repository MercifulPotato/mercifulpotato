I like Cook&#x27;s Illustrated and Consumer Reports. These publications buy products, test them and cover their costs by charging a subscription. This is the best business model for protecting readers.<p>There are plenty of “free” websites that also test products, but visitors to these sites end up paying in less obvious ways:<p>Ad Bloat - The websites have great content, but it&#x27;s hard to enjoy it because of excessive advertisements, autoplay videos (with sound) and third-party networks that hijack your browser and redirect you to pop-up ads claiming that you’ve won a free gift card.<p>Price Creep - The websites are great at reviewing products, but in order to cover costs, the tested products are more expensive than necessary. Many publishers do this (unwittingly) because the affiliate commissions that they receive are based on a percentage of a product&#x27;s sale price.<p>These phenomena are common on legitimate websites. Nevermind sites that:<p>Rent studio space to stage their &quot;lab testing;&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t know how to use lab equipment properly;<p>Fail to disclose pay-to-play relationships;<p>Give inflated reviews to maintain relationships with PR people; or,<p>Fail to investigate the issues that products have after extended use.<p>I’ve seen these trespasses throughout my career: Hucksters are everywhere.</i>')
