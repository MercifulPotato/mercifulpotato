Regardless of the emails, Hunter Biden is&#x2F;was a drug addict with no skills, being paid upwards of $50,000&#x2F;month to be on a Board of Directors of a known corrupt company.<p>What skill does he possess that is worth $600,000? The only thing that makes sense is his connection to Joe Biden. It&#x27;s obvious they were paying him money to be on the board because of his connection to Joe Biden, and Joe Biden should have put a stop to it. That&#x27;s the crux of the issue to me. The fact that the media is forming a wall of silence around this issue really does show the vast biases they have.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean Trump isn&#x27;t corrupt, by the way, which he is and I believe he is unfit to be president and nothing about the laptop or these emails stopped me from voting for Biden. But every tiny  issue with Trump is magnified and overanalyzed by the media, but this rather big issue on Biden is swept under the rug. The media is just as corrupt and biased but the only losers are we the people.')
