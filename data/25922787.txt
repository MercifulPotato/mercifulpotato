I don&#x27;t know any of these people or their dealings, but a more interesting question comes to mind;  if I were a powerful mogul (or two) and facing a litany of unsavory allegations, how would I manufacture a compelling alternate narrative? What do I need to launder that narrative into the zeitgeist? Are there law firms ready to help me conjure up a strategy? Would they have contacts in the media we can use? What kind of story would they weave? Something boring maybe, like taxes or esoteric financial contraptions? I can only imagine.')
