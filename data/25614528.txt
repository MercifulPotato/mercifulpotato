One day you decide you want to print that filename before you open it. Naive code will cause the name to “move” to print and unusable to the open in next line. Even though it is perfectly understood by all parties that there is no threading involved and print would finish before the next use of that string. Yes, I can create a borrow or clone, but having to think of it every single line of code even when there is only one thread of execution is really painful<p>Edit: I get print is a macro, but imagine a detailed logger for this case.')
