They are less bright though than models with traditional lamps. Up to the point that, with the tiny projector we have, it only works when the sun has gone down. And indeed we switch off the lights when we turn on the projector.<p>All this means you can’t use the device as a kind of audiovisual wallpaper while you go about doing other stuff, and for those who need that scenario a projector is probably not a good alternative. We switch it on to watch something specific from start to finish. I don’t mind this particular limitation, I feel like I pay more attention and enjoy watching things more in this way.')
