I&#x27;m just not sure if it&#x27;s gotten a baseline support and flatlined or if it&#x27;s growing consistently now.<p>Fully agree with almost all of your points, and if MacOS did go off the deep end in terms of functionality, I&#x27;d be back on Linux. It&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a big fan of what Marcan is doing and follow it closely.<p>If Linux support was as good now as it was when I switched, I&#x27;d likely have never switched to the Mac.<p>But now I just stick around for the hardware.')
