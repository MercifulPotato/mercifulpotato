The arguments that it causes harm seem to be based on cases which aren&#x27;t voluntary, which are then stretched by parents who are horrified by the idea that their little baby is maturing.<p>We are talking about what stallman has written.  The above is what he wrote.  The distinction he&#x27;s drawing between &quot;voluntarily pedophilia&quot; and &quot;involuntarily pedophilia&quot; is one that I don&#x27;t believe exists.  Particularly because &quot;grooming&quot; is a common tactics of pedophilies.')
