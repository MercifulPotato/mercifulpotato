If I&#x27;m understanding; your desktop is a collection of various sizes windows, maybe overlapping and stacking. If your mouse goes off the side of the one you&#x27;re focusing, it will auto focus the one you&#x27;re now hovering over. Won&#x27;t this lead to accidents where you&#x27;ll have a larger window suddenly gain focus, with no way to see the old one and re-focus it? Seems easy to make a mistake.<p>This maybe would be solved by a window manager that enforces never allowing windows to stack depthwise? Which OSX doesn&#x27;t have of course. Just size-and-position-hotkey workarounds')
