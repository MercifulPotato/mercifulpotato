I think I&#x27;m just focusing on the present and future, while you are talking about how we got here.<p>I find it much easier these days to get people to consider trying a non-Windows environment but it never goes well because of these small issues.<p>Of course people expect things to behave in certain ways because Microsoft had an anti-competitive monopoly and most people learned about computing using their platform.<p>It&#x27;s an unfair, shitty situation.<p>But the point remains that desktop GNU&#x2F;Linux has a lot of these little UX bugs, and we&#x27;re not even paying attention to them. The experience isn&#x27;t as smooth as Windows because we don&#x27;t have dedicated UI&#x2F;UX designers thinking over these issues and trying to come up with cohesive solutions.<p>When&#x27;s the last time a new consumer-facing UX paradigm that &#x27;just worked&#x27; came out of the open-source world? Apple churns them out, oftentimes created from scratch, and it extends to their physical hardware design (ie the ipod scroll wheel was amazing for its time, airpods are a joy to use).<p>The open source world makes amazing things but the UX quality _is_ a major issue in the uptake of new users today.')
