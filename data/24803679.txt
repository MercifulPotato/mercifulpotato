There&#x27;d be some issues, any commits you pulled in from the community wouldn&#x27;t be eligible for re-licensing unless your PR acceptance flow included securing re-licencing rights from them - standard GPL3 copy-left code can&#x27;t be converted to a private license without the agreement of the original authors.')
