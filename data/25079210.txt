I like the philosophy that one is &quot;free&quot; to the extent one understands the various causes that constrain and motivate one&#x27;s choices, because it sidesteps the need to answer the question of how much free will is possible given all the influences we face.<p>Going back to the story&#x27;s protagonist, using this definition of &quot;free&quot; it&#x27;s not clear how much the protagonist is aware of these kinds of influences, and therefore we don&#x27;t know where on the spectrum of freedom they&#x27;d be.<p>I don&#x27;t think Stockholm syndrome is relevant to the experience of a dog.  First, Wikipedia says there&#x27;s a bit of disagreement as to whether the phenomenon is real.  Second, my guess is the mechanism for it relies on a human&#x27;s sense of society and shame.')
