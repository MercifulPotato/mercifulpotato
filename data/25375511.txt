Item(by='olcor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607618583, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25373747, text='&gt; There are a lot of jaded people here who refuse to accept the way the world is working.<p>This is HN. Quite a few people here know how the world is working in favor of these things because there&#x27;s a good chance they built it themselves, or at least know a few people who have.<p>Of course these products are not for me, and I very much understand that there&#x27;s a market for the things they sell. Music might be a private matter for me, but it is definitely part of the social lives of a lot of people I know; they derive a lot of enjoyment from comparing different bands&#x2F;partying&#x2F;recommending new things. But looking at what the past years (and even before that!) have taught us about the so-called social aspects of technology, it is very difficult for me to believe that communities aren&#x27;t being pumped for money. Every facebook action (for pure profit motives with no heed to possible harmful consequences of their actions), political agendas festering on social networks, and attempts and successes of being able to manipulate minds of people using such platforms has definitely left a sour taste in the minds of most tech people.<p>What angered me specifically was the tone-deafness of the article; it didn&#x27;t mention any of these issues at all, but talked about the topic in a way that it was the best, unbeatable thing ever, and any company not following the mandate would be doomed to irrelevance, which is completely false as quite a few replies here have pointed out.')
