The moment this became normalized, every time something actually does ask for money, you have to decide that the expenditure is indeed worth it. Yes, 4 bucks is a pittance in absolute terms for many people, but they still don&#x27;t want to just throw it out the window, so they have to actually take the mental energy of justifying this purchase.<p>And yes you could say that the same people won&#x27;t bat an eye spending 4 bucks on beer, but beer is an immediate reward in itself. The brain is usually already wired to automatically reward it&#x27;s own decision to buy beer and buying one beer lessens the very restraints that would stand in the way of buying beer to begin with.<p>These factors are usually not present when buying an app, unless it&#x27;s a game or similar or it becomes a &quot;passion&quot; purchase.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to fix this. I would like to blame Ad Tech and the blight of &quot;free&quot; apps that fund themselves out of mining people&#x27;s data. I think it is fair to say that this was a contributing factor at least. At the same time, I think there is genuine value in a proposition where people can pick to get the product for &quot;free&quot; and sell their data, or pay for the product and keep their data private.')
