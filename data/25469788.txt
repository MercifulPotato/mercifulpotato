But I&#x27;m not sure RISC-V is there yet.  Companies have been pouring resources into optimizing ARM CPUs for years now, and they&#x27;re now starting to get to the point where their performance competitive with x86.  RISC-V is just getting started.  I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a RISC-V CPU that&#x27;s comes anywhere close to the raw performance of higher end ARM CPUs, nevermind x86.<p>Having said that, I hope AMD doesn&#x27;t decide <i>not</i> to develop a RISC-V CPU. I&#x27;d expect them to have the resources to start working on ARM now, while planning for RISC-V further out.')
