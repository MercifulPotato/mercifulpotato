This shall not prevent any technical storage or access for the sole purpose of carrying out or facilitating the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or as strictly necessary in order to provide an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user.&quot;<p>In other words, unless the cookies are <i>strictly necessary</i> to providing you with the service then you <i>must</i> provide users information about what the cookies are used for, and you <i>must</i> offer an opt-out.<p>(It&#x27;s also worth pointing out the generality of this Directive, too: It doesn&#x27;t only apply to cookies, but also to things like localStorage).<p>The ePrivacy Directive is, as its name suggests, a Directive which is addressed to member states of the European Union which have all written it in to domestic law.<p>In the UK, for example, it was implemented as PECR[2].<p>[0] The ePrivacy Directive does reference the old legislation that the GDPR replaces, so you should consider the reference in the ePD to Directive 95&#x2F;46&#x2F;EC as a reference to the GDPR. This means the standard of &quot;consent&quot; is the GDPR&#x27;s standard now.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;legal-content&#x2F;EN&#x2F;TXT&#x2F;?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;legal-content&#x2F;EN&#x2F;TXT&#x2F;?uri=CELEX%3A...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ico.org.uk&#x2F;for-organisations&#x2F;guide-to-pecr&#x2F;what-are-pecr&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ico.org.uk&#x2F;for-organisations&#x2F;guide-to-pecr&#x2F;what-are-...</a>')
