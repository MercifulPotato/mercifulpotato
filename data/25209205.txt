Most hedge funds have internal funds as well and they run it similar to a prop trading firm.<p>I think in general though a small company (JS has 900 employees, so I&#x27;m guessing around 50-100 devs) simply can&#x27;t hyper optimize their entire engineering stack to the same extent that a large FAANG can. It&#x27;s far too wasteful. And I&#x27;m talking about tooling, infra, and overall process, not just the code. Code review is the minimum any competent engineering org should be doing.')
