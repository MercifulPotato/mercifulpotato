It is hard to not see such arguments as a misguided effort to rationalize one’s self interest.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with this. I tend to agree that inequality is inevitable, but where I think I disagree with you is on the definition of equality.<p>If we create an even playing field in the environment, then we&#x27;ve just shifted the goalposts from &quot;How wealthy were your parents?&quot; To &quot;How good are your genetics?&quot;. Some people will be born smarter than others, and excel. Some people will be born with learning disabilities and relegated to the bottom of the social hierarchy.<p>Judging based on innate ability also means discriminating against people who innately lack that ability. If you were born dyslexic, you&#x27;re going to have to work twice as hard to achieve as much. The dyslexia is as innate as IQ advantages.<p>I just don&#x27;t see a way that hierarchies aren&#x27;t inherently unequal. You&#x27;re always judging who has more of a particular thing, so people with less of that thing are worse off. Right now, that&#x27;s largely money. Is using the genetic lottery a more equal means of doing this? I don&#x27;t really think so.<p>I would rather focus on reducing the difference in lifestyle between the haves and have nots. If we can&#x27;t stop inequality, we can at least lessen the effects.')
