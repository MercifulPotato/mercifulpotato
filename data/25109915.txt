I don&#x27;t care what you&#x27;re selling. If my problem that you&#x27;re trying to solve is really that important, I&#x27;d be actively searching for a solution, not waiting to be enlightened by a targeted advert.<p>Adtech evangelists seem to think that my biggest problem is a burning surplus of cash that I&#x27;m just <i>desperate</i> to get rid of. If only I could find more products to buy so I could be liberated from the pain of having money in the bank! Er, no thanks. I&#x27;ll put my spare cash towards saving for a house and retirement and the occasional luxury; save your bullshit for the people who don&#x27;t know how to install Adblock.<p>(The other way I use my spare cash on is to pay directly for content, because almost everything that&#x27;s wrong with the Internet and modern media is the fault of the current ad-driven paradigm, and only future I want to live in is one where ads are dead.)')
