It used to be that GNOME was the desktop environment you could turn into a Windows or macOS clone, but it looks like that switched with GNOME 3 and KDE 5.<p>I have Plasma Desktop set up[1] to take advantage of my macOS muscle memory when it comes to the GUI and keyboard short cuts, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine going back.<p>&gt; <i>Linux is rocking the desktop hard, if you haven&#x27;t tried it in a few years or just maintain a Windows installation to play games-- seriously give it a try. It&#x27;s wonderful.</i><p>It&#x27;s not just developers or power users that Linux shines for, either. I&#x27;m of the opinion that if ChromeOS would suit a person&#x27;s needs, so would a polished distribution like Ubuntu along with a browser like Firefox or Chrome. Ubuntu has an app store-like interface to install Zoom, Slack, and other work apps.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23607374" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23607374</a>')
