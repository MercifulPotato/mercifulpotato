Together these are 45% of global carbon emissions. And solutions are scarce.<p>&gt;Agriculture and land use account for 24% of all human emissions. That’s nearly as much as electricity, and twice as much all the world’s passenger cars combined.<p>&gt;Industry – steel, cement, and manufacturing – account for 21% of human emissions – one and a half times as much as all the world’s cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes combined.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;15&#x2F;how-to-decarbonize-america-and-the-world&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;15&#x2F;how-to-decarbonize-america...</a><p>We need to start putting just as much research effort into these areas as went into renewables.')
