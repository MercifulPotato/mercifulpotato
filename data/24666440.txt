Your own source shows about a dozen areas going from the 5-8 band to the over-8 band since 1990. More than two dozen going from the 4-5 band or lower to the 5-8 band. When each multiple represents most of $100K. When the entire graph should ideally remain about the same color overall but is clearly getting worse. Buy hey, let&#x27;s look only at the top 10 out of 392 and ignore the fifth of the population that&#x27;s not in an MSA. That&#x27;s totally the way to &quot;systematically isolate root causes&quot; ... so long as the root causes are the ones we find convenient. Otherwise not.')
