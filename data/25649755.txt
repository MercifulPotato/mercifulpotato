Especially with the recent additions of pre-selecting the last device and stuff like that, I really appreciate those minor QOL improvements.<p>If I compare it to how RTX voice works, it&#x27;s _slightly_ more complicated to setup (currently no distribution through standard package managers&#x2F;simply downloading a file and clicking it to start everything) and it doesn&#x27;t autostart like RTX voice does on windows startup. But jugding from your issues [0] I understand the decision and I&#x27;ll set it up manually.<p>It might be an idea to allow for autostart for users who don&#x27;t care about the CPU impact because their CPUs are big enough or whatever.<p>Nevertheless, your solution is actually very close to what OP is describing: &quot;install an app and click a button to turn on&quot;. So thanks for maintaining, I use it daily!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lawl&#x2F;NoiseTorch&#x2F;issues&#x2F;6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lawl&#x2F;NoiseTorch&#x2F;issues&#x2F;6</a>')
