A lot of the people who end up committing murder or are nailed for egregious drug offences are only in the position they&#x27;re in because of bad policy. This is something that can be directly acted upon and changed.<p>I am very, very sceptical of the idea of a &quot;conviction&quot; for a non-crime. Racism, though deplorable, is not a crime, and it shouldn&#x27;t be. Thought and speech are necessarily divorced from action in the &quot;world of atoms&quot;. These classes of offence are very, very different.<p>My argument isn&#x27;t that racism should be ignored, either. Rather, I don&#x27;t think that <i>any</i> of the &quot;cancel culture&quot; that seems so prevalent actually does anything positive. It doesn&#x27;t change views, it further polarizes and solidifies what you refer to as &quot;ingrained racism&quot;.<p>There is a strain of thought that some murder is justified in the name of political liberation (take Assata Shakur for example). Many of these same people will try to persecute people for perceived racism. This is the world-view I&#x27;m referring to. If you&#x27;d like more tangible examples, I could dredge them up, but I don&#x27;t think it would be worth either of our time(s).<p>Edit: For that matter, how do you rehabilitate someone like Dick Costolo, who today tweeted &quot;Me-first capitalists who think you can separate society from business are going to be the first people lined up against the wall and shot in the revolution. I&#x27;ll happily provide video commentary.&quot; in response to Brian Armstrong of Coinbase choosing an apolitical company approach?<p>Edit 2: Can&#x27;t reply to the child comment. I don&#x27;t have the solutions, but I would propose:<p>1) Reworking or regulating social media to be less polarizing (see The Social Dilemma, a film that just came out on this).<p>2) Criminal justice reform and drug decriminalization, so violent crimes and murder become less commonplace, especially such crimes that could be easily prevented by better policy. Also, clear the criminal records of those convicted for non-violent offences.<p>3) Establish &quot;free speech zones&quot; or something similar on university campuses, to allow space to refute heinous ideas in open discussion (ala Chomsky).')
