Schools are closed because teachers are (rightly) concerned about getting the virus<p>Schools in the UK have been open since September. Typically if there&#x27;s a positive case then they isolate and typically their closest contacts isolate, if there&#x27;s more than one then the entire class isolates.<p>There&#x27;s no evidence that teachers are any more likely to die from covid than many other essential workers who aren&#x27;t working from home.<p>There&#x27;s no evidence that these vaccines stop spread, so there&#x27;s little point in prioritising vaccination of children who - even if they did catch covid - are practically immune. Same with the majority of teachers. Makes far more sense to vaccinate older people who are at serious risk (with IFR in the 5, 10, 15% range) - then they don&#x27;t need to worry about the kids bringing the virus home.')
