The popular ones now like obsidian.md, roam research, etc. are all leveraging a graph database.<p>The market is super saturated and I wonder how much of them are fads.  Productivity apps are fun to work on because the developer&#x27;s can actually use the app without any network effects.<p>Good luck to you!')
