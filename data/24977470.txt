Restrictions are all mostly lifted within these countries and life is mostly back to normal.<p>They key to their responses is not that they are awful dictatorships. They were prepared, they have taken strong and necessary measures and their population <i>voluntarily</i> made efforts for the benefit of all even if that meant some personal sacrifices.<p>The relative failures of many Western countries is due to, I think, lack of preparation, lack of leadership, and misguided refusal by many to make the necessary and quite limited personal sacrifices on the false pretext that they are a threat to personal liberties.')
