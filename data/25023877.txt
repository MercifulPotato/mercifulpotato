This means if you don&#x27;t turn up they can still charge you for (e.g.) the first night of your trip. A pre-authorization wouldn&#x27;t work as these typically only last for 30 days, and as I understand can still be declined in some cases. I assume hotels would prefer to use their own credit card terminal, vs Booking.com et al as they get better rates, so even charging for the first night wouldn&#x27;t be great. I&#x27;m not saying this is right, but there are good reasons behind it.')
