Currently, there&#x27;s only a single vaccine that&#x27;s probably going to hit the market in Europe soon, and that&#x27;s the Biontech&#x2F;Pfizer one. They said they&#x27;ll have 50 million doses available in December, but that&#x27;s for both the US as well as the EU and the UK (which means 25 million people can get vaccinated in total). How is that possibly enough for health-care workers and care-home residents in the UK as well as people aged 80 or over?<p>And it&#x27;s going to be a similar situation in January and February, sure Bntch&#x2F;Pfizer will produce a decent amount of vaccines specifically for the European market in Belgium and Germany, but again that&#x27;s going to be hardly enough for everyone over the age of 18 in the UK - especially given the fact that those doses will have to be shared with all other European nations.')
