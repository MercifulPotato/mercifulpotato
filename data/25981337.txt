I have a lightweight JS server that handles ingestion of HN data and parses book references into a Postgres db.  Site is built with Python using Starlette.  There is quite a bit of caching with Redis and Cloudflare. There are a couple scheduled processes for ranking and digests.  Spacy and vaderSentiment Python packages are used for text processing.  There is no&#x2F;minimal JS on the site except for hCaptcha.  It&#x27;s gone through a few iterations - the first version was just a one-off static site generation.')
