Then, if you didn&#x27;t make some kind of management UI you&#x27;ll have to create one or write scripts&#x2F;queries to try to repair the damage.<p>This is one of many reasons first switched to wordpress before going static and using disqus. I switched to wordpress because I got tired of having to add features to my blog software (whatever the must have feature of the day was, RSS, Atom, Trackback, etc etc etc..) and because I got spammed and had only written the code for posting comments, not for managing.  Wordpress&#x27;s anti-spam Akismet, failed for me though. Too much spam came through adding to my workload. So I switched to disqus.<p>At the time, and maybe this is still true, disqus would put the comments in your wordpress database so if you ever decided to quit disqus you still had the comments.<p>Then eventually I got tired of the extra work of wordpress itself (having to update monthly) and went static + disqus.<p>I get the entire point is you probably don&#x27;t like disqus because you&#x27;re being tracked and&#x2F;or want a different UX etc, and you should do whatever you want. There is enjoyment making your own systems. I wanted to blog to share things though and maintaining a comment system was time not writing posts.')
