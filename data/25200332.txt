Water would get in and leach away any soluble isotopes, poisoning the surrounding area for millennia. Anything you tried to heat using the nuclear pile would become radioactive, because ancient societies don&#x27;t have a way to transport heat. (In the modern world we use high pressure pipes and heat exchangers. Then, if anything more than household heating is desired, you need generators to convert the energy into an industrially useful form.) They would have to put whatever they wanted to warm up directly inside the reactor. So, you would quickly end up with uninhabitable cities, and everything made in the &quot;cursed furnaces,&quot; would slowly kill the owner. The only reason nuclear power is safe is because engineers have figured out how to contain it.')
