A language to define interfaces, i.e. contracts. Whatever you make of them or with them. And whatever you make your server do on them.<p>How well you do it, is.. up to you. Languages and making them are extremely powerful tools, ehm, if you master them.\nAnd in any case, one can abuse any thing, by lazyness or by misunderstanding, and grind it into snailing or halt. Anything.<p>Here, defining and implementing something like graphcool exposing interesting part of (django) query-ORM into a simple language, took about 3-4k lines server side, +under 1k client-side, mostly utility stuff. Except graphene&#x2F;graphql&#x2F;django on python on server, nothing else is needed. Zero libraries in client. And now one can talk in <i>that</i> &quot;language&quot; in client, not worry about what server thinks of it, and&#x2F;or switch the server into another platform&#x2F;language any time - the contract is defined..')
