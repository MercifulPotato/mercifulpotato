I&#x27;ve always hated how pointlessly long screens 1080p screens were. It&#x27;s not long enough to fit a second window at the side comfortably and on Windows there wasn&#x27;t enough space vertically. On MacOS I move my Dock to the side but Windows taskbar just look <i>horrible</i> when docked to the side. Good riddance.')
