The operating system detects the error-correction capability in the memory controller, and errors are properly detected (tested by reducing the memory timings slightly below stable values).<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a mass-market laptop with ECC support, but AMD&#x27;s desktop CPUs have supported ECC for as long as I can remember. That being said, it&#x27;s been an optional feature that is up to the motherboard maker to implement, and not all do.')
