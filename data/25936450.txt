Discord welcomes a broad variety of personal finance discussions, from investment clubs and day traders to college students and professional financial advisors. We are monitoring this situation and in the event there are allegations of illegal activities, we will cooperate with authorities as appropriate.<p>-<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.me&#x2F;server&#x2F;join&#x2F;protected&#x2F;c3fe5f4361" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.me&#x2F;server&#x2F;join&#x2F;protected&#x2F;c3fe5f4361</a><p>That server was vile.

Discord said they were banned from getting tons of reports.<p>There&#x27;s no proof for a narrative where Discord self-censors over an intentionally vague tweet about social media and stocks.<p>&quot;We deleted the server to not implicate ourselves in a tool of securities fraud&quot; would have been a pretty damn good reason by itself... no need to lie about that.<p>-<p>Edit reply:<p>If enough upset people crying over their banned cesspool downvote you, you can&#x27;t reply to comments anymore :)<p>I guess in the face of your lack of even &quot;proof&quot;, I&#x27;m brazenly suggesting that having an admin saying ni*er hundreds of times will get your server banned.')
