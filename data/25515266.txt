It&#x27;s sort-of-but-not-really a wealth tax. 0% income tax, 0% gains tax, and only people who hold commodities over a certain threshold are taxed (meaning the poor are exempted). Gold and silver holdings for example are taxed at 2.5%, with a different percentage for cattle and produce.<p>As to your example, you won&#x27;t pay a wealth tax on your car if you increase its value under Zakat. Now if you want to use it as a currency (start flipping cars) then it&#x27;s different.')
