By all means, continue to use votes for sorting, and perhaps continue greying out items once they fall below some threshold (ideally -2 or worse, not zero). But what value does the visible score provide? And does that value outweigh the negatives? From observation of myself and others, having the score visible leads to some unhealthy behaviour.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=239058')
