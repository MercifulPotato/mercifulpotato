In UK tipping is seen [in my view correctly] as a reward for good service. So, if a taxi driver or waiter &#x2F; waitress is especially friendly &amp; helpful, you might leave them a tip.<p>In other countries, it&#x27;s seen as almost obligatory. Personal example:<p>Many moons ago, I was in charge of a large party of students who went to Budapest on an exchange visit. On our first night there, we found a quiet pub near our hostel and settled in for the night. There were only one or two other customers, so we were contributing to them having a really good night, with the kind of takings they&#x27;d probably only see on a weekend, usually. We weren&#x27;t being overly loud or misbehaving, either.<p>In spite of this, the bar manager and his staff were glaring at us and being really sullen, every time we ordered drinks. I thought it might be because they didn&#x27;t like &#x27;foreigners&#x27; but then one of the locals, who spoke English, told me <i>&quot;They think you&#x27;re really rude because you&#x27;re not giving them tips&quot;</i>.  He went on to explain and it did indeed transpire that the norm in Hungary [or Budapest, anyway] is to give a 10% tip on practically anything you buy, regardless of whether you&#x27;re served with a smile, or have your food &#x2F;booze &#x2F; shopping &#x2F; whatever slammed down in front of you with barely a glance.<p>I actually found it quite annoying after a while. If you saw something at XXXX forints, you&#x27;d have to mentally add on 10% to the price each time, to work out what you were expected to pay for it.  I just thought <i>&quot;If you want 3300 forints for it, then price it at 3300 forints, not 3000!&quot;</i>')
