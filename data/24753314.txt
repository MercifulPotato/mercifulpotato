The Glitter Band put out some excellent songs both when fronted my Mr G and without him, but none of their material gets played on retro music radio stations nowadays.<p>I think the trigger for my comment was &quot;[...] but management totally screwed up his presentation, he reminded me of the Gary Glitter of rap at his heights&quot; - the article makes it clear how much damage was caused to Vanilla Ice by his management&#x27;s one page &quot;resume&quot;, alongside other decisions. Whereas GG&#x27;s (scandalously overdue) downfall was entirely his own fault.<p>&gt; I am not a fan of cancelling people&#x27;s creative output because of criminality. The work - by many showbiz people - stands.<p>Agreed!')
