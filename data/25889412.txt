That said, watching perl trying to kill perl5 with perl6 (unsuccessful) and python trying to kill python 2 with python 3 (more successful) it struck me how ridiculous it is that open source languages have to put up with this. Clearly &quot;major&quot; numbers are insufficient, the only real answer is to rename the entire freaking language when you make incompatible changes to it.')
