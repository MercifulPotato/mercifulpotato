Do you mean this morally (like, &quot;you gave your word&quot;), practically (&quot;if consumers defaulted in high numbers, it would cause economic ruin&quot;), or something else?<p>As Graeber points out, many ancient societies had a notion of jubilee years, where all outstanding debts were forgiven and debt-servitude eliminated. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a fundamental reason why personal debt should be somehow fixed.<p>Or did you mean that all just practically: in the US (??), one ought to avoid debt, because it&#x27;s hard to escape in the current legal regime? (Which I&#x27;m not entirely sure I agree with; personal bankruptcy is quite common, but, sure, it wouldn&#x27;t be my <i>first</i> choice.)')
