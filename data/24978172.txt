And as the article astutely points out, there is an undiscussed problem with UNIX skills loss across the industry. AWS provides GUIs and Linux doesn&#x27;t - accepted.<p>However for the many, many people who do already have those skills, and for the many pieces of software that are basically web servers + databases, the overhead of bare metal vs cloud VMs or services is basically a bit of Linux sysadmin work. People are acting like you have to hire a full time wizard to even consider using anything other than high cost AWS services but that is wrong: AWS requires learning too, people who understand UNIX are plentiful even if apparently not as plentiful as they once were, and a well run setup will not require constant sysadmin work. A well rounded developer will often be able to do the ops work as well.<p>Also &quot;bare metal&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean running your own datacenter. You can buy hardware, send it to a colo and they&#x27;ll rack it and run the network for you. That&#x27;s why I say it&#x27;s mostly a matter of understanding RAID: when the hardware fails (almost always disk or less commonly, RAM units), you file a ticket, blink the HDD LED and some remote hands go and swap out the part for you. Those &quot;hands as a service&quot; come cheap compared to AWS.')
