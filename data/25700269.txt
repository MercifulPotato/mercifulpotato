Category Theory is the underlying since theory, but do you need to know about mechanics and gears to drive a car?<p>There are explanations of Monads which are much much easier to understand for most people (people not having much to do with Category Theory).<p>E.g. by now the concept of map, flat_map is fairly wide spread in most programming languages and you can teach about Monads in terms of that fairly easy.  And <i>then</i> add the additional abstraction layer used in context of Monads like abstracting over the &quot;external world state&quot; (IO) and &quot;combining computation descriptions&quot;.')
