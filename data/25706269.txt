Another thing about our current system that I only realized after talking with folks who do politics for a living about what they do: the fact that elections are close to 50&#x2F;50 isn&#x27;t a sign of a deep and fundamental divide in our country, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s financially not worth getting much past 50&#x2F;50. If you are currently at 48%, it&#x27;s worth changing your platform a bit to get 51% of the population; if you&#x27;re at 51%, it&#x27;s not worth changing your platform to get 55%.<p>More directly, if you&#x27;re polling well in 40% of districts, poorly in 40% of districts, and competitively in the rest, it&#x27;s worth focusing your attention <i>only</i> on the competitive districts, until you get to 50%. It&#x27;s not worth paying any attention to the ones you&#x27;re not competitive in.<p>Other voting methods (approval or ranked-choice) will reduce this effect and make political parties more representative of what people actually believe, instead of <i>designing</i> the system such that we have two parties that do the worst possible job of each representing 50% of the people.')
