I doubt it personally, more like they got a film crew there.<p>But the article gives the distinct impression that Colombians (including the indigenous people of the amazon basin) themselves aren&#x27;t capable of discovering anything, but require an &quot;expedition&quot; from the UK and an associated channel 4 film crew to discover it for them. You&#x27;d have thought we left that sort of patronising colonial fantasy stuff behind when we left the 19th century. The Indiana Jones-lite anecdote about the fucking snake they encountered? It sounds brainless even by the standards of an evening documentary to show on British TV, but to plaster it on the front page of the Guardian is even more ridiculous, especially considering the Guardian&#x27;s politics and the great anglophone lurch wokeward of 2020.')
