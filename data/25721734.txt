That was cheap of me and I apologise.<p>Actually that is what I&#x27;m saying. Was the average insurrectionist more planning than that in this case?<p>I know some bombs were found, leaving them out this seems like a mob with guns. They coordinated the date and location and just winged it from there it seems.<p>If someone has a complex plan, you can&#x27;t be sure they&#x27;ll go through with it till they&#x27;ve taken significant action.<p>If the plan is &quot;meet in Washington on Tuesday, bring a gun so we can shoot democrats,see you there&quot; then it seems you can arrest that plotter as soon as he has a gun and a plane ticket.<p>I think so many people either have public profiles or wore ID or literally spelt their name out to reporters, they can&#x27;t have been actual planning, prepared criminals.<p>Edit:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;capitol-arrests.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;capitol-arres...</a><p>I picked the above up, it seems like 2 people Brough zip ties to take prisoners. 2 more were in possession of firearms when arrested. That&#x27;s the level of planning with these people, most of them seem to have just turned up.<p>I&#x27;m not at all saying that excuses their actions. Quite the opposite: it brings the bar for actual conspiracy down when the crime is simple.')
