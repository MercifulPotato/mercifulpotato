Start playing the video. He shows the first slide and explains a few things. I read the code in the slide, then go to a terminal and launch a Python interpreter, and write the code without looking at the screen, to cement the concept more than if I simply had copied it or, God forbid, just watched the video.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem: every slide shows some weird behavior or using something I use daily in a way I didn&#x27;t know it could be used, and I do read the Python language reference for <i>fun</i>. Next thing you know, I spent one hour on the first slide playing with the concept, and writing snippets to show how I could use it to solve problems I had faced before. The presentation is 60+ slides or the talk is 3 hours. More often than not live coding the whole thing.<p>He&#x27;s a sorcerer and must be stopped.')
