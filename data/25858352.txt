But it&#x27;s not black and white what the whole story is, and it&#x27;s not simple.<p>Label heads shouldn&#x27;t be providing false testimony about label benefits to maintain their edge, especially since they even control streaming services like Spotify (I didn&#x27;t see that mentioned in the article.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-spotify-listing-factbox&#x2F;factbox-spotify-opens-up-on-ownership-and-clients-in-listing-files-idUSKCN1GD5PX" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-spotify-listing-factbox&#x2F;f...</a><p>1) If you&#x27;re trying to be libertarian, understand that a 20 yo artist doesn&#x27;t have the legal resources to negotiate a contract against the labels&#x27; unyielding armies of lawyers.<p>2) Also, signing a contract is not the same as enforcing one. Labels don&#x27;t follow their own contract terms on payouts, so there is no good faith on their part.<p>3) If your second or third albums don&#x27;t sell well, labels often just stop answering your phone calls. Yet the artist is stuck in the terms of a zombie contract, and often that will block (end) their career.<p>The Goo Goo Dolls were advised by their first lawyer that, &quot;It&#x27;s slavery. Don&#x27;t sign it.&quot; After their first multi-platinum album, they still &quot;owed&quot; $300,000. &quot;Free markets&quot; or not, why is that allowed to continue for decades?<p>&quot;The band filed suit against Metal Blade, claiming they had not earned any royalties from their album&#x27;s sales, which was attributed to a &quot;grossly unfair, one-sided and unenforceable contract&quot; which had been signed by the band in 1987.&quot;<p>The Dolls won by refusing to record their next album until there was a contract that wouldn&#x27;t ruin them. They were ok sleeping together in one van, but not losing money despite massive sales.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goo_Goo_Dolls" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goo_Goo_Dolls</a>')
