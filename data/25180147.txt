In particular, please edit flamebait out of your posts, don&#x27;t fulminate, and don&#x27;t go on about downvotes. Yes they&#x27;re irritating, but there&#x27;s nothing new or interesting about lashing out against them. Doing that just emits fumes.<p>When downvoted, the thing to do is to consider what in your comment might have legitimately attracted downvotes. If you notice something, make adjustments for next time; if you don&#x27;t, chalk it up to the internet and move on. Don&#x27;t forget that misclicks are also a thing.')
