Businesses also get more features such as analytics, their phone contact details prominently displayed on their profile, etc.<p>Sensible limits on what users can do. New accounts can&#x27;t immediately upload media or post links and have to gain trust over time to try and limit spam.<p>Better moderation, not just for obviously illegal content but anything that&#x27;s predatory such as multi-level marketing schemes, quack &quot;alternative medicine&quot;, anti-vax and similar crap. Anyone posting or promoting this kind of content gets the boot after a few warnings.')
