This has always been the case: it&#x27;s just that now it&#x27;s become much more pathological and widespread on the platform. Partly it sounds like that&#x27;s due to changes in policy&#x2F;strategy on the part of Glassdoor, but I think it&#x27;s also because companies have realised that you can just ask Glassdoor to remove reviews and they will.<p>Do I feel bad about that specific review being taken down? Not at all, because it was absolutely slanderous to others this person had worked with. But the fact that it happened without any further process does point to an underlying problem.<p>It&#x27;s a long time since I&#x27;ve used the site but I believe companies might have the right to post public responses to reviews. Beyond this maybe some sort of dispute resolution process would be the way to go.<p>Still, I can&#x27;t really figure out how to make it work: if it&#x27;s cheap and easy for reviewers to post reviews, and cheap and easy for companies to get them taken down or otherwise manipulate them, you&#x27;re always going to end up with a review service that&#x27;s essentially worthless and can&#x27;t be trusted.')
