Item(by='danaris', descendants=None, kids=[24999809], score=None, time=1604591078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24998468, text='I admit I haven&#x27;t read the article yet, so it&#x27;s possible this is addressed there, but it seems to me that perhaps a question that needs to be answered before that posed by the headline is: What would it even mean for a society to &quot;collapse&quot; in the modern age?<p>In the far past, societies &quot;collapsed&quot; when they were sufficiently ravaged by disasters natural and man-made that they could no longer keep producing enough food to feed the people, and could no longer protect the people from raiders from outside, emboldened thieving groups within, and wild animals.<p>Short of a massive nuclear war that sees significant portions of the US being bombed or the entire surface of the planet unlivable without protective gear, we&#x27;re not going to stop being able to produce enough food to feed everyone in the US. There are no violent barbarians at our borders waiting to attack by land, and the wild animals left here are easy enough to keep in check with tools and weapons that are fairly basic to us now. The only thing on that list that I could see being even remotely plausible is a breakdown of law enforcement (or even &quot;law enforcement&quot; joining in) allowing roving groups of home-grown raiders to make trouble inside the country...but I have a very hard time believing that that would be permitted to go on for long enough, or spread far enough, to be able to meaningfully say that American society had <i>collapsed</i>.<p>The combination of having settled&#x2F;conquered essentially the entire land area of the continent (northern Canada notwithstanding), modern farming practices producing vast surpluses of food, and the level of interconnectedness that even the telegraph gave, let alone the modern mobile internet, means that the kinds of things that could have caused a societal collapse in earlier millennia just cause dents that get smoothed out over time.<p>My take on all of this: There isn&#x27;t going to be some grand Event that breaks everything and lets someone come in and pick up the pieces. There isn&#x27;t going to be a revolution, there isn&#x27;t going to be a collapse, there isn&#x27;t going to be a singularity. There&#x27;s just us, and what we do to move forward. We need to find ways to come together and work toward a future where we all take care of each other. We have the resources to do so multiple times over, so now what we need to do is stop accepting that some people get to hoard hundreds, thousands, or millions of times more of those resources than the median, while others starve on the street. It will take time, and work—lots and lots of hard work—but we need to work, step by step, on pulling our society away from a model built around scarcity, and around money as the central concept, and toward one built around abundance, with human life, dignity, and happiness as the central concepts.')
