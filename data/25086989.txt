LazySSH starts the machine for you when you connect, and shuts it down (some time after) you disconnect.<p>I would love for a capability like this to be extended to physical machines. I have a dozen SuperMicro servers with IPMI interfaces, an HP server with fully licensed ILO, and a Dell server with a BMC. Being able to control when these go on&#x2F;off would be very nice.')
