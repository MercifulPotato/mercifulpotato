I mean, the hypothesis is interesting and the math seems to work out, but at least according to that page there is no experimental evidence yet of it actually existing; we have some experiments that might provide some data about the existence of Hawking radiation in the future, but as of now it seems just an unfalsifiable hypothesis. Is there any observational data that <i>requires</i> Hawking radiation to explain it? It&#x27;s not my field, so I really don&#x27;t know and I&#x27;d be happy to be proven wrong.<p>Does it make sense to worry about paradoxes created by black holes evaporating, if we have no evidence that they actually do evaporate in our physical reality?')
