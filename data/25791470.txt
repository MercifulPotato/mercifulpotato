However, you are tied down to the apple ecosystem, and it still relies on files &#x2F; tags with no hierarchical organisation.<p>Supernotes is entirely web-based and responsive, as you can log on and access your notes from any device. We are working on desktop and mobile apps at the moment!<p>Similar to Bear Supernotes uses tags, but our note-cards are also nestable. For example, you can write a note-card with a brief summary on a book you are reading, and then add child note-cards which are quotes from that book.<p>Once you have written a few cards you can filter by tags, connect cards together with bi-directional links and even add those child cards into other parent cards â€“ we are the only PKM with a true multi-parent hierarchy!')
