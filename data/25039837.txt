Coupled with the poor search functionality and the increasing amount of &quot;sponsored&quot; stuff that&#x27;s inundated every page, I don&#x27;t have much confidence in my ability to find products that meet my search criteria anymore.  I feel increasingly like I&#x27;m at Best Buy--as soon as I enter, I&#x27;m accosted by sales pitches that are uninterested in actually helping me find what I want.  For a company that prides itself as &quot;customer obsessed&quot;, it seems like lip service these days.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t find this post very convincing at all.<p>&gt; I made a purchase...<p>&gt; So Amazon lets sellers pay for fake reviews...<p>Sorry this is an incoherent argument (generalizing from a single data point).  I&#x27;ve heard plenty of anecdotes of this stuff (maybe a couple dozen?) but even that&#x27;s not nearly enough for me to feel confidently say &quot;this is a widespread problem&quot;.  I realize the data may be hard to obtain, but until we have it, I don&#x27;t really think we can confidently make such a conclusion.')
