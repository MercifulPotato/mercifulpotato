Broadcast storms are very bad. There&#x27;s also the whole problem of tombstone-ing a proposed block if it doesn&#x27;t achieve consensus fast enough (which is basically impossible to do as a function of time so you end up doing it as a function of a monotonic counter which has other problems).<p>Anyways, I love all the byzantine stuff but very little of it is actually practical or fast.')
