So all my systems at home are getting an IPv6 (or multiple) using the &#x2F;64 dynamically allocated by my ISP.<p>And today I just discovered that my parents, who get service from Cincinnati Bell FTTH, are also getting IPv6!  They&#x27;re using an ISP-provided router, and everything is just working.<p>I am really happy that things are rolling out, albeit slowly.')
