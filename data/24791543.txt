I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m very worried that will happen, but I am mostly suggesting Hashicorp needs to be very careful post-launch to make sure people know this thing will be more of a Vagrant and less of an Otto :)<p>(And note that Vagrant was _extremely_ popular&#x2F;&#x27;hot&#x27; for a time. It&#x27;s still incredibly useful and widely used, even if it&#x27;s not a slick new JS-based tool that everyone fawns over these days.)<p>Nobody wants another Google in terms of product support over time!')
