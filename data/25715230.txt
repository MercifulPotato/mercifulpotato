[edit: I would think the UK Health Secretary should be pretty specifically focused on the growing health crisis at home rather than interviewing on topics outside his current role.]<p>In any case, regardless of who you are, if you violate the terms of service of platform, you can be terminated on that platform.<p>The platform makes the rules, within the context of the legal systems with which it is governed by.  When it comes to &quot;free speech&quot;, that is a very tricky subject.  More significantly, if even the local population cannot agree on whether certain speech should be allowed or not, then the government has no hope of regulating it either.')
