Our department has run its own Moodle for years, despite the university switching to Canvas. The university has exerted lots of pressure and this is the first semester in which all classes are primarily on Canvas. There has been no end to complaints about pedagogy that isn&#x27;t expressible in Canvas, resulting in bad compromises or huge amounts of labor for large classes.<p>Bottom line: if universities could contract for support and pay developers a fraction of what they currently pay for proprietary LMS, Moodle (or another open source platform currently starved for resources) would have much better usability and student data wouldn&#x27;t be in the hands of private equity firms.')
