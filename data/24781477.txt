The hardest part in hiring is figuring out which people are genuinely interested in coding and will learn on their own vs the folks who took a course (even uni!) because they heard the salary is good and have no real interest. Programming in the real world is so much about self-directed learning that if you can demonstrate that, you go way up the resume pile. I have hired several times, and if I got a CV from someone like you, I would give it top priority.<p>Now that said, you might well need to look for unusual companies, but this is honestly not that hard. When I decided to go work for others (after 10 years freelancing), I applied literally to about 140 places on stack overflow careers, knowing that the vast majority were going to see &quot;self-taught Canadian who only wants to work remotely half time&quot; and throw it in the bin. But I only needed 1, and it was no problem finding that within a week and a half. I treated it like a sales gig: 20 applications a day for a bit over a week and I had interviews.<p>My tips for you as an adult: Be clear about what your value proposition is and what your constraints are, get your hobby work in a format you can show and be ready to talk about, and then fire out a boatload of applications clearing stating your position, <i>regardless</i> of what the job ad says. There are lots of small companies out there who would love a responsible, experienced-in-life adult as a part time junior coder, and very frequently the &quot;needs&quot; on the job add are bendable. It&#x27;s really a numbers game of finding the place for whom your constraints are a good match with their needs. I was totally self taught, started at age 30 after only hobby hacking, and now 16 years later, I&#x27;m able to work part-time, from home, and earn a very comfortable salary.')
