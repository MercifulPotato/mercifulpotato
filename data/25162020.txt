Or you can use a standalone profiler which understands the relevant debug info.<p>An advantage of using profiling is that you get dynamic insight into what may be relatively obscure control flow linkages. The disadvantage, of course, is that it&#x27;s not complete, if your profiling run didn&#x27;t include the call, it won&#x27;t be in the tree.')
