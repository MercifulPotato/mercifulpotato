All of us on HN can say “well yeah that’s obvious” but signal keeps telling everyone their app is “secure” without caveats that your keyboard could be leaking everything you type, making the system not secure. Saying “well that’s not my department” isn’t acceptable when people are being put at real risk here.<p>EDIT: The specific request in TFA is to detect users using a third party IME and give them a security warning. Seems pretty reasonable.')
