You mean the static HUD isn&#x27;t doing anything for you zooming in the board.  That&#x27;s an oversight on my part, thanks for the report.<p>Edit: also, you should be able to zoom in on the tiles, but, you&#x27;re possibly running into an untested edge case, of which there are tons.  Mac and mobile is under-developed as I&#x27;m a firefox&#x2F;desktop curmudgeon.  As you and others have noted, there is some interface goofery, but otherwise a mousewheel should let you zoom in until you see a moire pattern on a crt.')
