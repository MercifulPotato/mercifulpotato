Anytime you buy a specialized product, you&#x27;re going to pay an arm and a leg. If you want to get a proper lab workbench (for just about any scientific&#x2F;engineering discipline; that&#x27;s not a generic thing), a proper studio desk, or what-not, you&#x27;re going to pay an arm and a leg. That&#x27;s not buying you a mahogany desk, so much as something well-suited to an esoteric task.<p>Compared to commercial, what he&#x27;s got is:<p>1. Lighter (2x4s are light)<p>2. More robust (2x4s are tough)<p>3. Looks better (An off-the-shelf product would look better in a showroom, but this one fits his room exactly, and fits his equipment exactly; that makes a much bigger difference).<p>I&#x27;ll mention: That&#x27;s true for most of the crude furniture I make. I have fine woodworking, and I have not-so-fine woodworking. The fine woodworking pieces tend to be generic (e.g. a bookcase). The not-so-fine-ones tend to be special-purpose.
