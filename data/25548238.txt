This greatly complicates the design of the backend.<p>First, you have to maintain state in some kind of session on the app server.<p>Second, if you have more than one app server, you&#x27;ll have to share the sessions across them using Redis or Hazelcast or something.<p>Third, cursors have to be closed, which means you have to know when the user is done with the result set. This is impossible to know. The user could go to page 2 and then go to lunch. So you have to leave it open for a while, and then have some kind of timeout. Have a lot of users doing the same thing? Memory fills, both on the app server and in the database server.<p>Fourth, your cursor is going to leave a transaction open, which interferes with updates and all kinds of other things.<p>Fifth, most users never go to page 2 anyway. They run another search.<p>Keeping cursors open in a web app is a spectacularly bad idea.<p>UPDATE -- I am in error. The article does not recommend a normal database cursor. Disregard my comment.')
