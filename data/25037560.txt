Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604944877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25037400, text='&gt; Why do you find print better than an electronic version of the same thing?<p>Because it converts desk-space into &quot;screen space&quot;, so to speak.<p>&gt; easy editing<p>A lot of things don&#x27;t really change when you&#x27;re coding. For example, APIs, or &quot;vocabulary objects&quot; of your code. But if you really need to edit some object that&#x27;s changed, pull out a pencil and write it into the margins.<p>Or print out the new page, and stick it into your book. No need to reprint everything. 2-hole punch + prong binder is easy to disassemble and reassemble. Comb-binder is a bit harder, but its a superior binding if you care about that.<p>3-hole punch is pretty much designed for easy editing: very easy to add and&#x2F;or remove pages. But in all honesty, 3-hole punch is a terrible reading experience so I still prefer 2-hole punch and&#x2F;or comb binders (even if they&#x27;re harder to edit).<p>&gt; search<p>You don&#x27;t use the paper version to &quot;search&quot;. (Though crude methods exist: dog-earing common pages or putting sticky notes &#x2F; literal physical bookmarks into some pages).<p>If you need to search, search on the computer for the material. Then, open up to the page you need in the physical book. Bam, now you have a reference and can use the screen-space on your monitor for something else.<p>----------<p>A dedicated reference page (such as OpenMP Reference Cards: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openmp.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;OpenMP-4.0-C.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openmp.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;OpenMP-4.0-C.pdf</a>) is of course best.<p>Doxygen -&gt; Latex isn&#x27;t the best at automated layout, but it does get the job done. I mention it mostly because its &quot;low effort&quot; to convert code into a physical paper reference copy.<p>If you really need a reference sheet, you should manually craft a nice reference sheet in MS Word, or HTML5, and print it out. Nothing beats hand-crafted effort, but the low-effort methodologies are still worth knowing.')
