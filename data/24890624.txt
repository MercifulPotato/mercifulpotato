I hate infinite scrolling and algorithmic surfacing. It&#x27;s maximizing engagement and not giving me content I care about. I don&#x27;t care for the dopamine rush.<p>2. I want to leverage visual memory, you know what you&#x27;ve seen even over a few days, and it&#x27;s easy to scan through a list of peoples&#x27; last posts to know you&#x27;ve already seen it. A quick scan with positional context that doesn&#x27;t mutate every 30 seconds trying to keep you from bouncing.<p>Imagine reading a newspaper where the columns reloaded every 30 seconds.<p>This tries to be precisely the opposite of that, though individual user columns will update if they post, that&#x27;s part of Twitter&#x27;s iframe JS though, so out of my hands.')
