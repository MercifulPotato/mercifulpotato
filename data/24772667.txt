But why would they. As you yourself said:<p>&gt; <i>Rates will be set by market forces, not any concept of &quot;fairness.&quot;</i><p>Ie, companies are going to pay you as little as they can get away with. If the market-price for a good SF developer is $200k, and the market-price for an equally good Las Vegas developer is $100k, then your pay will trend towards $100k as soon as you move from SF to LV. Maybe inertia and your manager&#x27;s largess will prevent it from being an overnight change, but that&#x27;s the long-term trajectory you can expect.')
