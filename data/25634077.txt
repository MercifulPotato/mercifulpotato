Item(by='mbesto', descendants=None, kids=[25634180], score=None, time=1609779537, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25633212, text='There are two aspects of &quot;money&quot; - store of value and medium of exchange.<p>&gt; Trying to simplify it into a narrower definition of currency is like trying to fit a tesseract shaped object through a sphere shaped hole.<p>Which is funny because that&#x27;s exactly what you did. You only compared it to store of value (&quot;asset class&quot;) and ignored the &quot;medium of exchange&quot; part...which is the characteristic people are using for the comparison to fiat currency.<p>You can accept that BTC has a store of value and still be critical that its use for a medium of exchange is limited.')
