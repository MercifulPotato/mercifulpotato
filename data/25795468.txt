Since it works for healthy people as well, you can describe what changes more directly.  It also captures that not all conditions are identical.  For a healthy person, getting out of bed in the morning is maybe a level 1; making dinner is a level 2; going to the bathroom is a cantrip; maybe going to work is a level 3.<p>Now you have a chronic medical condition.  With your particular condition, getting out of bed a level 3, you have no cantrips, and you need to spend 2-3 level 2&#x27;s per week going to the doctor (rather than 2-3 per year).  Now, you&#x27;ve used up your level 3&#x27;s just by getting out of bed and going to work, you need to use level 1&#x27;s to go to the bathroom, and you used a level 2 on a doctor appointment (so you&#x27;re out of them by dinnertime).<p>Someone else may have no more difficulty getting out of bed, and may not need so many doctor appointments, but randomly once a month they just don&#x27;t get any slots back in the morning.  So, they need to keep that extra level 3 in reserve to go to work tomorrow in case that happens.')
