They did exactly what they were permitted to. And, therefore, I&#x27;m guessing that if you <i>wanted</i> to take your vacation, you wouldn&#x27;t have too much trouble finding time to take it, and nobody would complain that you did.<p>If there&#x27;s unlimited vacation, and someone takes two weeks of vacation when the whole company tends to take one, and they were on vacation during a critical project, once time comes for performance reviews, people will say &quot;I&#x27;m not sure how committed they are to the company&quot; &#x2F; &quot;They don&#x27;t have a great work ethic&quot; &#x2F; etc. etc. Because it was their choice to decide that two weeks was reasonable, it&#x27;s easier to hold them responsible for the consequences of that choice.<p>So, everyone feels like they need to take at most as much vacation as average, possibly less.')
