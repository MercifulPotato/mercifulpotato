The computer games industry.<p>There you can be exploited labour to produce a $100m budget game which makes a 50% profit margin in its first weekend and then 5 years later still ask children for $70 per copy. Or, if they&#x27;re feeling charitable, they can pay you $150 to get a virtual horse or hat with the game.<p>If you don&#x27;t like how they play with the toy. You can just steal it right back out of their hands by banning them from playing it with their friends remotely.<p>You can use your profits to lobby for laws which imprison anyone who takes the tiniest dent out of your profits and have them thrown in to prison next to terrorists and serious criminals.<p>Or you can use it to just sue children who are curious about computers.
