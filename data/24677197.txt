The subtle difference is that none of these were in the films script in pre production so weren&#x27;t changes to the film in production, with the exception of fantasia.<p>Having worked in the animated film industry for a while, there&#x27;s so much that does get changed in both pre production and production that people don&#x27;t hear about.<p>Some of the best received animated films have been stinkers internally until something clicks. Whether that&#x27;s rewriting a critical character a few months from delivery to throwing out entire sequences.<p>Similarly many poorly received films were great in production but after focus testing and suits getting involved, they get diluted down. Sometimes entire finished sequences get cut leaving the remaining shots from making sense to an audience.<p>Film making is a very organic process, sometimes good and sometimes not. There&#x27;s this Illusion in public that what the public sees is the directors initial vision. But largely it&#x27;s the work of hundreds of people, morphing over time to try and find what will be right.')
