As an analogy, the sites that you visit are already providing one-party consent (all that is needed with current federal wiretapping laws) by including said intentional tracking.<p>In the case where non-essential sites are required to disclose what they track to the user, the user is arguably also providing consent on their end even if it&#x27;s mandatory. Nobody is forcing you to visit non-essential sites.')
