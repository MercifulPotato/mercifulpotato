I&#x27;ve accumulated enough that I can go back to previous year and see what I was doing that day. \nI rollerblade a lot, so I have a large amount of these clips. And overall, I seem to do a lot of the same things over and over. I don&#x27;t know if thats good or bad, but these clips definitely point out the patterns in my life. The interesting part I found looking them over is the day by day change of seasons. I now have a record of when the leaves fell off the trees, and when the first snow fell in my region. So I&#x27;m more aware when these changes will happen this year. I also seem to be fixing things a lot. So it made me more conscious of buying so many things, that will just break. \nBirthdays, and family dinners stand out as happy moments.')
