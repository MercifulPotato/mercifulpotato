This kind of makes sloppy programming far more tolerable in php than in other platforms.<p>In effect this has an impact on performance but it also helps in ensuring that a bad request can&#x27;t blow out the whole application from serving other requests like is common in platforms like nodejs where you need to be extra careful.\nNeedless to say this makes php becomes quite viable for production envs, and prevents a whole host of issues that need expertise and careful programming to fix.')
