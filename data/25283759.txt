You can use Urbit if you don&#x27;t have such an address, but you&#x27;re a subsidiary of whoever is giving you access to the rest of the network and you&#x27;re subject to censorship&#x2F;control by them. You can&#x27;t develop an independent identity that someone else can route traffic to.<p>Now, it&#x27;s true that the IPv4 internet also does this. But the IPv4 internet does this because they didn&#x27;t expect to run into the limit (far fewer than 2^32 IPs were originally usable), and then they started working (halfheartedly, but whatever) on IPv6. Urbit has the limit because, as a philosophical position, they believe the limit is a good thing, because there should not be more than four billion people with full human rights.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;urbit.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;common-objections-to-urbit&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;urbit.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;common-objections-to-urbit&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; <i>A 32-bit planet is a tool, not a toy. Like a car, it&#x27;s a device for a responsible and independent adult. There aren&#x27;t 4 billion cars in the world, nor 4 billion independent adults.</i><p>&gt; <i>If you aren&#x27;t an independent adult, and you don&#x27;t need or even shouldn&#x27;t have unconditional digital freedom (no one&#x27;s 8-year-old daughter needs unconditional digital freedom), a moon from someone else&#x27;s planet is fine. (Even most of today&#x27;s independent adults don&#x27;t complain enough about being Facebook&#x27;s moons.)</i><p>This was written by Yarvin in 2016, when there were over 5 billion people over the age of 18 in the world, so at least one billion adults then were unworthy of first-class citizenship in Urbit&#x27;s &quot;digital city,&quot; and even more today - not to mention the 8-year-old daughters or 12-year-old daughters or 16-year-old daughters who need conditions on their digital freedom.')
