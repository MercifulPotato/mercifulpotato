Lack of shift-and-sum instructions or equivalently addresses with shifted indexes is usually mitigated by optimization of induction variables in the compiler. They are nice to have (I have written code where I took advantage of x86&#x27;s ability to compute a+b*9 with a single instruction) but not particularly common with the massive inlining that is common in C++ or Rust.<p>The ugly parts are indeed all ugly, though they have now added hint instructions.')
