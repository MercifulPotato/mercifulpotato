The payment processor usually charges a fee to convert the currency. Stripe for example charges 2% to convert (which is worse than the 1.5% interchange fee increase, and is is additive to it). You are significantly worse off in this situation.<p>Also if you are a British consumer simply pay in Euros, and let your card do the conversion for you - you typically get the interbank rate with most modern banks.')
