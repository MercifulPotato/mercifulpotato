It&#x27;s a measure of output per capita. If you&#x27;re saying that productivity when up due to software, then output (per capita per hours worked) must have gone up somewhere due to using that software. And as a result it would be captured in GDP.<p>Imaging for example I sold a manual tool to tend the field when growing crops. If I suddenly invent a new tool that makes you twice as productive, then yes I may sell the exact same number of tools (so it&#x27;s not captured in GDP), but now every farmer buying it will be making twice a much crop which will be captured in GDP. Or they&#x27;ll be making the same amount of crop in half the time which would show up as reduced hours worked (which is not what we see).')
