But we’ve found so few ML researchers&#x2F;engineers are actually using these tools. This could either be that people aren’t aware of them yet, or that they’re not good enough.<p>I think it’s a mix of both, honestly, but we’re betting that there’s more of the latter in the mix. :)<p>I could do comparisons of each of these tools, and some of them are solving quite different problems, but the overarching difference is we’re just trying to do <i>less</i>. These systems might make sense if you’re setting up a company’s ML pipeline, but we found lots of individuals struggling to keep track of their work and store their models. They balked at the idea of setting up things like Kubeflow or MLflow.')
