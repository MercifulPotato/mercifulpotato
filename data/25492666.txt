It&#x27;s free, after all. There&#x27;s nothing stopping you from prioritizing QoL over money and _still_ getting all the benefits of the generous European welfare state.<p>And second; I don&#x27;t want to be in the shoes of European IT companies if (when?) the US implements Medicare for all. If top talent is willing to move from Europe to the US for higher salaries right _now_, what do you think will happen when Europe no longer has its biggest advantage - public healthcare?<p>EDIT:<p>I forgot to mention something important about #1 - that because of this, it&#x27;s disingenuous to say that you &quot;pay&quot; for free healthcare with higher taxes. You don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just that the cost of funding falls on your shoulders.')
