I just looked at my boss. &quot;How should I know?&quot;<p>&quot;Come up with your best answer.&quot; So I did. I gave him my best guess, plus some error bars. The error bars were promptly discarded. And while when I went over estimates I didn&#x27;t feel <i>bad</i>, there was obviously some static there from my boss when things went &quot;over estimate&quot;.<p>I have harbored a lot of suspicion towards the process of ticket estimation and &quot;story pointing&quot; and the like ever since.')
