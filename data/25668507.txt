I would want my existing money to go further. If you can make sure everyone relatively is poorer than you it&#x27;s much easier for you to gain status.<p>I think it&#x27;s weird how the video suggests that we should channel greed to good causes instead of money because you can just set up an economy that rewards good causes and achieve the same result.<p>There is also the suggestion of using taxation to &quot;take away their wealth&quot; yes you can do that or you can do something far worse. Lower unemployment(and underemployment) and cause income inflation. It will eat away at the wealth of the rich far faster than taxation would and they can&#x27;t run away because they would not only have to move themselves but also their companies.')
