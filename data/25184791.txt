Compare that to e.g. compiling hefty C++ projects on the Raspberry Pi where cross compilation on a fast x86 box is ideal (but still far from trivial).<p>For non-trivial projects you want CI anyway so it&#x27;s a better ROI of your time to just to add an additional VM, Docker or native  runner.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget you&#x27;ll also want to run your automated tests in the native environment.')
