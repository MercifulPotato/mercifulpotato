Item(by='notahacker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611924889, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25956026, text='&gt; I think Silicon Valley has the exact same proportion of Machiavellian executives and opportunist entrepreneurs as every other industry.<p>&gt; The only difference is that part of the marketing of a SV company inevitably includes the claim to &quot;make the world a better place&quot; and to &quot;be different&quot; in some way. Beyond this marketing claim, there is very little difference.<p>This. The reason why the &quot;good&quot; side isn&#x27;t outsmarting everyone else is because most entities that claim to be disrupting &quot;bad guys&quot; either aim to sell to the &quot;bad guys&quot; they&#x27;re &quot;disrupting&quot; or mimic their practices with a thin veneer of difference or do worse stuff of their own. Same goes for other less organised recent events. What got sold as &quot;getting revenge on Wall St&quot; is a bunch of novice traders convincing each other it&#x27;s really worth it even if they lose money as Citadel racks up enormous profits on market making and the 470 institutional funds invested in GME see a bump to their portfolio.')
