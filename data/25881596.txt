I might have been unclear with what I consider what. In my categorization, shirts are button down shirts. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hoverfalt.github.io&#x2F;shirts.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hoverfalt.github.io&#x2F;shirts.html</a> They are part of my &quot;uniform&quot; if you like as a consultant. They tend to last 38-43 times. Then they start looking a little too worn for work.<p>Shirts with print, for me, would fall under T-shirts and tanks. The few ones I have, definitely wear faster.<p>My underwear shirts are the ones that tend to last 20-25 times. After that, they are no longer fresh. And I don&#x27;t mean fresh as new, but rather unfresh to the extent of not being ok through a long day at work.<p>Some, I continue using as sportswear also :)')
