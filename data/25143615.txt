So, a handful of individual companies controlling what most of the people in the U.S. will see online is no problem. These companies being funded by a small group of SV investors and not serving the interest of its users (since users don&#x27;t pay for Google, Facebook or Twitter) is OK. These companies having a very strong incentive to help a certain political party, due to its lenience in antitrust and bailout matters is OK. These companies filtering ideas and conversations that could reduce the popularity of that party, where the country is already very divided, is also OK.<p>But India blocking a site relevant to a small fraction of its population is major threat to the Democracy.<p>Well, maybe that&#x27;s because had the authors published any other outcome, they would never find another job in Academia anymore, due to pressure from numerous activists. But the problem is Poland, of course.')
