Though you can grab the patches and get them working on 9front if your willing. (send patches and all that)<p>Though the gridchat is a very active, friendly place to talk. Lots of knowledgeable people on there. Grab the gridstart and chat scripts and run it on 9front or labs plan 9. You can also get the chat script running on plan9port.')
