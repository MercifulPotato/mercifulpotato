Feedback in performance reviews would always be &quot;it&#x27;s hard for people to see what you&#x27;re doing.&quot; In the end you have to find your own way to game the system to get appropriately recognised, but of course that kind of office politics isn&#x27;t really what you want to spend time either.<p>I&#x27;m doing more &#x27;new feature&#x27; style work now but I&#x27;m happy to not be tumbling through the waves of hype. We get a little bit of new hotness, because of course you need to embrace some aspect of that to avoid stagnating and getting too stuck in your ways, but not so much of it that the engineering team is incentivised to churn through half-assed features.')
