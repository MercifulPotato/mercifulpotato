And if you’re mid-20’s then you are looking at a 50+ year time horizon for your investments. That’s amazing!<p>If prudently invested in market funds, it is likely that your 10MM can grow to a very significant multiple of that over the next 40 years. You should be able to stop full time work now and live on the interest.<p>But you have to absolutely swear to yourself to never touch the principle under any circumstances.')
