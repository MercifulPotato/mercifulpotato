Instacart management has made themselves out to be anti-unionization (a common view by management in the US). If you&#x27;re an anti-union manager, and you&#x27;re about to make a massive, 2,000 person layoff declaration, you&#x27;re going to make sure the unionized group of 10 people is on that list. Can&#x27;t let that sort of thought spread to other locations, and this serves as a good example to those trying to organize in the future. It&#x27;s easy to avoid a NLRB loss if you bust the union as part of a larger layoff.<p>The only thing that would have been telling is if they had announced a huge layoff and NOT taken out the union shop.')
