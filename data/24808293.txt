Try to see a dentist without photo ID and proof of insurance.<p>- State issued ID with a bar code ensures rapid check-in to participate, minimizing lines, while maximizing <i>valid</i> voter participation.<p>- The nicest thing I have to say about the opposing arguments is they are far from compelling.<p>Database maintenance is hard. It is my hope that the results of the election next month are solid enough that the U.S. has a mandate to shore up the whole creaky mess and ensure every legal voter is treated equally, as they should be.')
