Maybe it was unclear when I didn&#x27;t mention it&#x27;ll max side to side too if the bar is on the bottom. If bar is on the side it&#x27;ll leave a gutter on the side.<p>TL;DR it&#x27;s a normal maximize--doesn&#x27;t cover the doc or menu bar and you can float windows in front of it since it&#x27;s not full screen mode.')
