But I don&#x27;t know. In order for an individual to commit voter fraud, they have to believe that the benefit is worth the risk them as an individual.<p>And, for the individual, voter fraud would only &quot;work&quot; to the extent that they think everyone else will do it too.<p>I intuitively feel that voter fraud is a much bigger bogeyman than people make it out to be.<p>I think the bigger fear is corruption of the election commission; such that they turn a blind eye to or even contribute to voter fraud.<p>Of course, no system is incorruptible, and the test for acceptance shouldn&#x27;t be perfection, but improvement over the status quo (this idea of iteration is the cornerstone of our constitution).<p>That being said, I&#x27;m not convinced that the voter fraud risk makes this proposal more corrupt than the system we currently have. Voter fraud is an easier problem to solve than voter suppression, IMO.')
