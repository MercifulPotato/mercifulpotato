Item(by='2-tpg', descendants=None, kids=[25234542], score=None, time=1606529380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25234191, text='<i>No edit, I just replied to you in my previous comment.</i><p>Are you under the impression that Coinbase makes Work-From-Home decisions based on the skin-color of their employees?<p>If yes (which it seems like to me), I&#x27;d like to learn more about that, and your reasoning. Am I oblivious to modern work-place racism? Imperceptive? Naive? Defending vile racists? I&#x27;d like to reconsider those questions on a more informed ground. My (and your) view kinda hinges on that impression and its truth.<p>I can understand why Black employees would have that impression, but if it&#x27;s not true, then I also see that as problematic.<p>&gt; I am under the impression that Coinbase demanded that the Black employees of the compliance group relocate to PDX so that the whole group could work out of the same office, and then exempted a white worker in the same group from that requirement.<p>Did it matter for this demand that one group was Black and the other was white? Or did this just happened to be the unfortunate outcome, which is bad optics if you focus on skin color attributes, and such bad optics should be avoided?<p>I am still not too sure. Can you remove &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; from your impression and still say the same thing, or is it essential to your impression, and telling of a problematic work environment?')
