Item(by='maxsilver', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610459563, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25745386, text='&gt;  But how you do actually position an organization to build products that people actually want to buy?<p>I wish that mattered, but I&#x27;m not sure it does. Many (more than half?) of all US business are either in non-competitive fields or have semi-locked in customer bases. These companies are effectively money-trees, they could do <i>almost</i> anything and never actually lose enough money to need to fix themselves.<p>Imagine AT&amp;T gets a bad CEO. Or Comcast. Or Ford. Or GE. Or WalMart. Or CVS. Or UnitedHealth. Or ExxonMobile. These companies basically <i>can&#x27;t</i> get into major trouble, no matter how many bad calls they make in the next 5 years.<p>If you are starting something new from scratch, then you have to worry about product (a new company, or a major new product in a new market, etc). But unless your doing that, your leadership-types often <i>never</i> have to learn <i>anything</i> about the business itself. They can pretend every business is just an identical spreadsheet of numbers, and even if they&#x27;re wildly wrong, they&#x27;ll almost never get punished for it (internally, or even by the market at large).<p>This is probably where MBA types get that impression from in the first place.<p>&gt;  Successful business leadership needs to make the right strategic decisions and that is not a trivial problem.<p>I wish this was true. But my experience has been that this is not nearly true enough. Terrible leadership can hang on for decades and never really get in any meaningful trouble for it.')
