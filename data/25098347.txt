Now when work is done, the sun is completely gone. A few weeks ago, there was at least a hint of it and an evening walk could be done during a sunset. Not so much anymore. It feels like I&#x27;m working even more now and I know I&#x27;m not even working that many hours physically. (Mentally tho...) I do know that I let more negative thoughts in as the night grows. It&#x27;s one of the reasons I hate short days and daylight savings. The more night, the more I&#x27;m inside wishing I could get out of this shit hole.<p>Felt depressive symptoms? Almost everyday for over a decade. Would I say I&#x27;m depressed though? No. And that&#x27;s not due to stigma of it or something. I see a therapist but I don&#x27;t feel <i>depressed</i> and he doesn&#x27;t seem to think I&#x27;m depressed. There&#x27;s something special about what I&#x27;d consider depression. Something where you&#x27;re depressed because there&#x27;s a hopelessness to your situation <i>and</i> it&#x27;s somewhat unreasonable to feel that way for as long as you have. I think of it like: &quot;Is someone who is being tortured everyday in a prison cell and know there&#x27;s no chance they&#x27;ll be able to escape depressed if they&#x27;re acting sad all the time?&quot; &lt;-- I feel that way in my life at times because that&#x27;s what I deal with. It isn&#x27;t physical torture but more of emotional and psychological. Knowing that you <i>could maybe</i> make it in an area but are not and might not ever... it&#x27;s draining. When you&#x27;re completely on your own for it and no one you&#x27;ve ever grown up with has ever gotten anywhere near where you&#x27;re at or done things like you&#x27;ve done... And the work is terrible and the people are horrible. And no one can support you except yourself...<p>It just... well, it&#x27;s draining. So, I feel drained most days. Depressed? Not really. Again, if the context was different, I&#x27;d feel fine and be quite happy day to day (give me money, give my a nice manager, give me decent work). It&#x27;s that the context is so bad. I tend to think of depression as... almost no matter the context, you&#x27;re gonna be sad and not enjoying things. I still enjoy stuff - it&#x27;s just that I have that nagging thought of how I need to keep pushing... I need to get further because I&#x27;m still so far behind from what I wanted to be. And I don&#x27;t know how to get there because I&#x27;ve never seen anyone like me do it.')
