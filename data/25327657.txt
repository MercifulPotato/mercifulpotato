I was specifically suggesting openness to information that goes against ones existing opinion, and the act of then changing that opinion. I would be very interested to read a study regarding this sort of situation.<p>The link you provided itself suggests that old frumpy (not open by some definition) people are correlated, and young open (by some definition) people are correlated. So at least one view of openness per se is allegedly thought by some papers to be only correlated when combined with another factor (age). However the link you provided only appears to be a library community-related website vaguely summarizing a very small selection of third party papers, which is basically equally as good as our random HN comments for citeability.')
