For example, how effective would the Soviet Union have been without lend lease materials from the USA?<p>&gt;According to the Russian historian Boris Vadimovich Sokolov, Lend-Lease had a crucial role in winning the war:<p>&gt;On the whole the following conclusion can be drawn: that without these Western shipments under Lend-Lease the Soviet Union not only would not have been able to win the Great Patriotic War, it would not have been able even to oppose the German invaders, since it could not itself produce sufficient quantities of arms and military equipment or adequate supplies of fuel and ammunition. The Soviet authorities were well aware of this dependency on Lend-Lease. Thus, Stalin told Harry Hopkins [FDR&#x27;s emissary to Moscow in July 1941] that the U.S.S.R. could not match Germany&#x27;s might as an occupier of Europe and its resources.<p>Nikita Khrushchev made the same point in his memoirs.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lend-Lease" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lend-Lease</a><p>(Or for that matter how would the events of WW II have been different without the Molotovâ€“Ribbentrop Pact?)<p>&gt;...People assume Nagasaki and Hiroshima convinced Japan to surrender, but it was actually the (surprise) Russian declaration of war...<p>The Soviet Union did not have the amphibious capability to invade Hokkaido.  Though before the declaration, Japan still had hopes the Soviet Union would help broker a peace agreement.  Knowing no one was going to help them negotiate with the allies, the emperor knew they had to surrender and as the emperor said:<p>&gt;...Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jewel_Voice_Broadcast" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jewel_Voice_Broadcast</a>')
