The apps I used were LumaFusion, Synthscaper, Fieldscaper, Defekt, FilterStack, Fragment, Kino Glitch, 8mm, Hyperspektiv, Plotagraph, and Virtual ANS.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lucidbeaming.com&#x2F;glitch&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lucidbeaming.com&#x2F;glitch&#x2F;</a><p>Here is a music video for U.K. metal band DAMIM that was made entirely on my phone.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=J6OZVXYamOQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=J6OZVXYamOQ</a><p>I have also used the phone as a movement based MIDI controller with AC Sabre and arpeggiator with Fugue Machine.<p>An old code project was to make a phone based web app to control Zynaddsubfx (synthesizer) running on a Raspberry Pi.
