Item(by='medntech', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608310562, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25468598, text='I can also confirm as a student doctor we&#x27;ve had &quot;used&quot; N95s for weeks at a time (that we might not even be sized for). Often being chastised for using an N95 instead of a surgical mask in efforts to &quot;save PPE&quot;. It&#x27;s difficult as a student seeing patients with covid daily as we&#x27;re given even less than staff. Some students even offered to buy their own PPE but we&#x27;re not allowed to use outside equipment. So, here I am with my surgical mask seeing patients that possibly have covid but haven&#x27;t been swabbed yet until I take a history.<p>Edit: Similarly to your partner, we are given paper bags for our face shields and kidney bean shaped plastic bins to hold our N95. They installed coat hooks to hang our masks at the end of a shift.')
