We launched Startup School as an online program in 2017, but it was only for founders who were already actively working on building their companies. Since then we&#x27;ve heard from many folks considering in starting a company in the future, and we realized that a modified version of Startup School could be helpful for them as well. This requires some curriculum tweaks like a much stronger focus on finding and vetting ideas as well as thinking about co-founders.<p>We decided to work on that, and just announced that you can register for the new course today. It&#x27;ll provide curriculum tailored for early founders as well as exercises to think through the decision to start a company or not.')
