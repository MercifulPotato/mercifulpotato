A correct statement is that the concept of &quot;speed through spacetime&quot;, which is what has to be split into &quot;speed through space&quot; and &quot;speed through time&quot; in the pop science statement, does not apply to a light ray.<p>In more technical language, the tangent vector to the light ray&#x27;s worldline is not a unit vector, it&#x27;s a null vector, and the concept of &quot;speed through spacetime&quot; only makes sense for a worldline whose tangent vector is a unit vector.')
