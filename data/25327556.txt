I was expecting a conclusion on the political comments, without finding it.<p>But, even if Paul Graham has been wrong about language design, it doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s been wrong about current affairs or the importance of startups in the coming future.<p>If anything, his bets have been largely successful and by openly sharing his thoughts he attracts some criticism from the different minded folks, like the author of this essay, who&#x27;s clearly a smart fellow.<p>I saw that piece from the NY Times about Coinbase and I feel that it&#x27;s reactionary to the announcement from Coinbase about not mingling into politics, which I support btw, I don&#x27;t like the politization of every aspect of our lives.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard a podcast with Brian Amrstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, and it&#x27;s not hard to get to the conclusion that he&#x27;s a great human being.<p>I may be wrong, but I distrust most of what the NY Times has been publishings in the past few years, particularly because of their focus on politization. I even feel repugnant by it. It feels like a stance that somebody that doesn&#x27;t believe in progress would take. Somebody that blames others for his problems and thinks that humans are inherently evil. Usually nihilistic.')
