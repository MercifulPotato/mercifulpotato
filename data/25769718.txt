But the argument was always &quot;If you don&#x27;t like it just build your own thing&quot;. So, sure, maybe the NYTimes didn&#x27;t have to publish you, but you could go buy a mimeograph or a printing press and put out your own newsletter, even if you had to stand on the street corner and hand it out yourself.<p>But now the companies that make printing presses won&#x27;t sell to you. The machine shops that make the parts to build printing presses also won&#x27;t work with you. Maybe you&#x27;re supposed to mine your own ore and refine your own metal to build your own printing press?<p>In the long run, we&#x27;re going to have to find a better way to deal with odious speech that by simply cutting people off and shutting them completely out of the public sphere. For one thing, this requires us to trust that the gatekeepers who control access are always going to be fair and just and only shut out genuinely bad actors. There&#x27;s needs to be a process where anyone who wants to can still see and inspect the banned speech to audit whether it was really worth banning or not.')
