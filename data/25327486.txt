I think we have a very different definition of very good. Could write a long rant on everything that was broken in Eclipse for C and C++ development.<p>One question on eclipse. Did eclipse finally sort out git&#x2F;svn support?<p>Here&#x27;s an interesting tidbit of history for those who don&#x27;t know. One of the main drivers for the decline of eclipse was the complete lack of support for source control, which is a pretty basic feature for an IDE.<p>You could try to get some plugins. There were 2 major plugins for SVN and neither worked half the time for no particular reasons. It was a complete shitshow. Don&#x27;t even think of doing that in a company where HTTP access must go through a proxy.<p>Developers eventually gave up and moved to JetBrains IDE. Source control worked out of the box.')
