Apple&#x27;s control over their App Store doesn&#x27;t prevent Android users from using the Google Play Store, whereas the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s ownership of freight terminals and rail lines prevents other people from building their own (because there are only so many places you can put a freight terminal or a rail line).')
