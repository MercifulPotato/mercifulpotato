So it is an objective law of nature that women are indeed physically weaker. (To compensate for that, they have unique abilities that men totally lack.)<p>&gt; therefore the assumption must be that women are paid less because of of this perceived difference<p>The assumption must be that everyone is paid as low as he&#x2F;she agrees to work for. It that amount is lower for women, it is only because they agree to work for less. Any rational employer should hire the candidate who asks for less money, and any boss who does not do that will likely go out of business soon, since he can&#x27;t make rational decisions.<p>By the way, it is also possible, that a person overestimates his&#x2F;hers real value to the employer, believing to be doing the same work as another colleague, but getting less pay, starting this fight for &#x27;justice&#x27;. In the reality it is most likely that a colleague is only perceived equal, but is somewhat superior in reality.<p>TL;DR: your salary is an objective value of your labour. if you think you it is worth more, negotiate a raise or go get a better paying job. If you don&#x27;t get it, you are not worth that pay.')
