Item(by='gpm', descendants=None, kids=[24716479], score=None, time=1602127186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24715145, text='&gt; You&#x27;re arguing that whether a particular form of speech is illegal or not should have no weight on deciding whether or not to protect that form of speech?<p>I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re arguing that, but I will argue that. Whether or not it is protected speech is a question you approach <i>before</i> you decide whether or not it is illegal.<p>For example, speech intended to cause someone to immediately assault you is not protected. It&#x27;s not protected <i>regardless</i> of whether or not the government chooses to make it illegal, it can both not be protected speech, and still be legal. On the other hand arguing for a political position (with the goal of advancing the political position, <i>not</i> &quot;arguing&quot; a political position in an attempt to get someone to immediately punch you) is protected. It&#x27;s protected regardless of whether or not congress passes a law forbidding it.<p>&gt; So straight up, do you believe that the government is infringing on people&#x27;s rights by banning child porn, yes or no?<p>This question misses the point, no, but I also wouldn&#x27;t believe it was protected speech if the government had just not passed a law against it. Rather I would continue to believe that by virtue of it&#x27;s lack of expressive nature and by virtue of how it harms people unable to consent that it is not protected speech.')
