I&#x27;m noticing how the show started off in traditional Trek format, with 100% individual episodes that were geared for syndication. A few seasons in, you start to get the big story arcs, like the Dominion War... and that&#x27;s when things really start to get good. BUT, it was cool every once in a while to have a side story that wasn&#x27;t part of the arc. It gave a lot of variety and depth to the show. It kind of makes you feel like there&#x27;s really a whole Trek universe. That not everybody was involved in the war, and that people still were trying to live their lives despite the war.')
