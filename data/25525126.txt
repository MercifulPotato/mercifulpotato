Is this actually true? Am I totally misunderstanding this?! Why does Spotify need my browsing history to play music?!<p>... I love Spotify as a service, I’ve had a family plan for years, and even if they are not selling my data, I don’t see why they need this and quite frankly leaves me feeling a bit violated if true.')
