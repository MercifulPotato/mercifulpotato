Item(by='rtpg', descendants=None, kids=[25526216], score=None, time=1608800761, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25525978, text='Japan doesn&#x27;t have low numbers because of immigration quotas (they are in fact _trying_ to bring in more people, for its own reasons), and they have no immigration quotas. So I think the system would be welcome to many people who want to go to the US and who can meet the college degree criteria.<p>Of course countries can do whatever they want (just from the notion of application of power). But I see immigration as a two way street. There&#x27;s an invitation to come into a society, and a request to participate in it. Other people in society get second chances, they get opportunities to improve... I feel like extending that to everyone is the logical conclusion of a just society.<p>And... yeah maybe there&#x27;s some abstract notions that underpin the US system. But when you look at the facts on the ground, I just don&#x27;t see how you justify the draconian decisions applied to people after they&#x27;ve been a part of society for so long. What&#x27;s the point of a bunch of theory if the practice turns into things like &quot;ICE can lock someone up for years without them being allowed to see a judge&quot;?<p>At least it&#x27;s not at Australia-level cruelty, I guess...')
