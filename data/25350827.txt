Reading numbers off the table at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Whaling#Whaling_catches_by_location" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Whaling#Whaling_catches_by_loc...</a> and cross-checking with the &quot;by country&quot; writeups below: Canada kills a thousand whales per year, about 2:1 narwhals to belugas, with &quot;subsistence&quot; amounts of bowheads. Greenland contributes about equal numbers of belugas and narwhals, and half as many minkes. Alaska contributes almost as many beluga kills, but also about a hundred bowheads a year. Faroese pilot whale kills number another ~800 per year. Any two of these four outstrip the scale of <i>all commercial whaling</i>.<p>Let&#x27;s dispense, too, with the delusion that these aboriginal peoples &quot;don&#x27;t take more than they need and they use the entire animal&quot;:<p>&gt; Hunters in Hudson&#x27;s Bay rarely eat beluga meat. They give a little to dogs, and leave the rest for wild animals.[15] Other areas may dry the meat for later consumption by humans. An average of one or two vertebrae and one or two teeth per beluga or narwhal are carved and sold.[15]<p>Aboriginal whaling is no less reprehensible than the commercial variety. Hell, at least commercial whaling is mostly constrained to operating at <i>profit</i>.')
