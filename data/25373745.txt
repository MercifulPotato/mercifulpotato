If you use an AWS service, you look at its pricing.<p>Take s3 for example: whenever you use it, you&#x27;ll pay for outgoing bandwidth, PUTs, GETs, and storage.<p>So you seek to minimize all of these:<p>1. Bandwidth: use cache layers. This also minimizes GETs.<p>2. PUTs: design your app in a way that doesn&#x27;t do unnecessary inserts into s3. Consider alternatives such as redis, postgres or filesystem depending on the need.<p>3. Storage: compress your objects if they compress well. If they aren&#x27;t often accessed, use storage classes and auto lifecycle management.<p>Pricing in AWS generally reflects some kind of engineering limitations you will face at scale in the first place, so it makes sense to go through this whole exercise either way.')
