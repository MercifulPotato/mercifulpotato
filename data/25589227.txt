However, even the if we talking about averages 50% of people are better than average. I would not feel to confident in a self driving car that is only approximately as good as 1 out of 2 drivers. I would want the car to be better than high upper percentile. Especially knowing an automated system can have reaction times that can put any humans reaction times to shame.<p>So yes equal safety is far from enough. Especially considering 50% would be better drivers than a self driving car that was only as good as the average driver. Your asking 50% of people and some percentage of people who overestimate their abilities to trust a car that would perform worse than them.')
