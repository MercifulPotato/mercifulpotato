My product is a specialized ML-cloud based service that none of my friends are qualified to be a co-founder in....<p>I couldn&#x27;t find an answer in quora or google (they say add your friends - which would be conspicuously false)... Should I leave blank spots &quot;to be filled soon&quot; or something so it&#x27;s not as silly? Or a team of robots with my face plaster on all of them (probably asinine)?<p>Thank you if you can suggest something you&#x27;ve seen successfully work before...')
