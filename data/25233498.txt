Let them be. It&#x27;s fine. In most cases, I don&#x27;t think they feel bad. They simply express their opinion and are fine with expressing a negative one. You can especially tell when  people reply to those people. While discussion may get polarized, it&#x27;s still interesting to read on an intellectual level.<p>I think voicing your opinion and having food for thought is more valued on HN than most other communities I see. Whether that food is negative or positive, is simply another flavor.<p>While I voiced my disagreements with this article, I value the discussion (and to some extent the article). Whether I view an article as good or bad, in most cases I value the discussion much more than the article :P<p>I&#x27;m happy you submitted it :)')
