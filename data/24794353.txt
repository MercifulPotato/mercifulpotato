They don&#x27;t believe authorities anymore, be it government, church or others. They make decisions, some of them can be stupid, it is impossible to be an expert in everything.<p>Social media, specially Facebook and Reddit, promote group think and writing posts that are liked, not that provoke discussion. If you go to a subreddit and you disagree with people there you get downvoted, that you avoid.<p>We need a social media that makes you think. We need information that we disagree with. Without it we will be fools. We need to promote effort, not likeability. Reading only thinks we agree with is a mental masturbation.')
