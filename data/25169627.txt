From my experience, they are engineers that understand both product&#x2F;business as well as the technical side such that they can drop requirements that add a very small amount of improvement and in turn it significantly reduces implementation cost&#x2F;complexity. They have the ability to instantly visualize system design and architecture for any features&#x2F;new items enabling to quickly make these realizations and move fast.  At the end of the day the ROI is what matters and SDE resourcing&#x2F;capacity is the most limited resource.  I have seen 100 SDE week projects turned into 4 weeks from individuals with this skillset.')
