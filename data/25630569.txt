Worse, anyone can access targeted bits of it for free. How?<p>Facebook allows any new account to use Facebook for 24 hours without email verification. As a consequence, anyone can register with your email address (provided you don&#x27;t use that address for Facebook), and use Facebook for 24h. They will be getting various &quot;friend&quot; suggestions picked from people having you (with that email address) in their address book.<p>No big deal? Story time. My name is John Smith. A lonely person also named John Smith, from a different country, decides to seek love on Facebook. He creates an account and, having no email, randomly puts johnsmith@gmail.com in the field. Bad luck for me, I am johnsmith@gmail.com, and I do not use that email for Facebook: I use it for work. John decides to befriend all female &quot;people-you-may-know&quot; suggestions. I suppose those start with people who have emailed me at some point. It starts with my boss&#x27;s wife (my boss and I had had a family barbecue previously) and the graph quickly expands from there on to people I had no direct contact with. The first few new &quot;friends&quot; have no reason to refuse the request, since it is attached to my name and they don&#x27;t have me on Facebook already (I don&#x27;t add colleagues on Facebook). The next &quot;friends&quot; see people they trust as &quot;friends-in-common&quot;. Ten hours later, my boss texts me that something fishy is going on. I check that email address, see the Facebook verification email, reset the password, log in, and discover the many fortunately-tame but still-embarrassing attempts of poor John Smith.<p>I believe this was not an impersonation attempt, but one does not need much imagination to see the many funny and not-so-funny application of this &quot;feature&quot;. Pick a time when the target is in a different timezone (hence won&#x27;t get a chance to see the verification email immediately) for added fun. Then, enjoy Facebook&#x27;s creepy social graph data for up to 24h.')
