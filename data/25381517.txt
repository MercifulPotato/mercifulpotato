It feels like it is trying to rewrite history to suit its narrative.<p>It implies that developers used to be able to create whatever programs they wanted thanks to Cydia prior to the App Store. This was never the case, the Cydia ecosystem was based on unintended buggy behavior.<p>In the beginning Apple was clear that there were no native apps, only web apps or whatever they called them. They eventually reversed course and implemented the App Store for native apps but was that because of Cydia? That&#x27;s just speculation.<p>Personally I always speculated that they weren&#x27;t ready and in classic Apple fashion pretended the idea of native apps was stupid until they were ready.<p>Should Apple be forced to support other app stores or side loading? I don&#x27;t know. I do feel like there are good arguments for it but they should be allowed to stand on there own merit without skewing the narrative.')
