But at the same time you say that this scenario has to become regulated.<p>Why? If the end result is the same, what&#x27;s the argument for regulating it?<p>Also, there&#x27;s a hilarious near-unanimous political backlash <i>against</i> the brokers that interfered or halted with their customers&#x27; ability to trade GME these past couple of days.<p>&gt; If nothing else, this incident has shown that maverick investment could be dangerous to our financial systems.<p>In the 2008 financial crisis, the actors who caused it suffered absolutely zero consequences, while the losses were socialized, and regular people suffered consequences in the form of recession and unemployment.<p>The hypocrisy is staggering, if anything, the large actors in the financial systems are dangerous to ordinary people!<p>&gt; Their actions could hurt a lot of innocent people as well<p>&quot;Won&#x27;t somebody please think of the children!!!&quot;<p>Yeah, no.
