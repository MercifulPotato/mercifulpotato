The broad point is China has too many people for current development models. Unless you think my argument is something else.<p>My point is that demographic decline is not a blessing at all. Manufacturing is leaving China for all kinds of reasons, econo-demographic factors included.<p>China had a chance to continue a much longer road on the path increasing industrialisation, but its journey seem to have ended so much earlier than anybody expected.<p>I worked in OEM goods since around 2007, my first job. I can say that light industries in China peaked at around 2010, and been on decline ever since. I&#x27;d say there only 1&#x2F;3 as much factories left in the immediate vicinity of Shenzhen as there were in 2010. The situation is not as dramatic further inland, the decline is still very visible.<p>No robots, automation, or informatisation will save the Chinese industry, or anybody&#x27;s else, and anybody saying that they will likely have zero hands-on experience with manufacturing.<p>China ran out of cheap, and high quality labour force. Middle age people don&#x27;t spend, because they save for their retirement, and as the labour force get thinner, everything get more expensive, requiring people to save even more.<p>Business suffers from that too as much as everybody. Land prices reach extremes, skilled labour costs almost as much as in US, and you get worse, and worse workers for the same money.<p>The promise of domestic market taking off was empty. Few of the 600M people locked away in inland China will ever manage to up themselves on the economic ladder when the ship of industrial expansion has already sailed. Most of China&#x27;s poor can nor earn, nor spend. Middle class don&#x27;t spend, unless on a new apartment. And higher classes do spend, but not in China, or leave the country altogether, and take their capital, and skills with them.')
