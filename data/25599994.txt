If I mod my own single player game to change things or use hacks to cheat there’s no way whatsoever I’m violating copyright any more than if I decided to intentionally scratch my records. Buying pre-made mods and patches that don’t bundle  copyrighted assets should spiritually be no different. Outside of exceptional cases  the rule is that if I can do it myself I can pay someone to do it for me.<p>With multiplayer games cheating is definitely a TOS violation but again not copyright infringement.')
