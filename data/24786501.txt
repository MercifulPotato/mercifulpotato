Without separate I&#x2F;D caches the fetch bandwidth and data bandwidth would otherwise conflict.  That&#x27;s why you see dedicated memcpy, strlen, etc instructions on the more complete CISC designs.  The RISC movement in general was very much a recognition of how ISAs could change with gate counts that allowed guaranteed caches.<p>As you note, it&#x27;s a place were ARM shows itself to be a hybrid RISC&#x2F;CISC design, required because the ARM1 didn&#x27;t have caches.')
