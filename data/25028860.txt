That&#x27;s part of their problem. But it&#x27;s interesting that you would pick a country with a long-running inter-cartel drug war, rampant police corruption, extremely weak enforcement, and less than a quarter the average household income as somehow directly being comparable to the US. The more remarkable question we should be asking is, with all that going on, how on earth is the US struggling to do any better than <i>Mexico</i>?<p>Try that comparison with literally any of the other G7 nations.<p>&gt; You may think removing guns solves gun crimes. Mexico stands blatantly against that.<p>No, what Mexico shows is that gun control legislation is pointless if you can&#x27;t enforce it.  I&#x27;m not arguing that gun control legislation <i>alone</i> is some panacea; that would be absurd. It needs to have teeth.<p>&gt; You may think violence stops when guns disappear, then you see knife and other brutal attacks.<p>Yep. That&#x27;s a reasonable tradeoff. Apart from anything else, it means the police can de-escalate themselves from assuming that they might get shot during any encounter to assuming that if they don&#x27;t get close enough to get stabbed, they&#x27;re less likely to be in immediate danger. That&#x27;s a good thing.<p>&gt; The second you the victim of some violent crime, or lose a family member you&#x27;ll change your tune<p>It seems reasonable to you that your position requires me to undergo an experience so traumatic as to prevent rational thought? Think I&#x27;ll pass.')
