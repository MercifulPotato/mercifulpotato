Item(by='ksaj', descendants=None, kids=[25541697], score=None, time=1608959087, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25541105, text='&gt; There&#x27;s not a whole lot of evidence that illegal border crossings from Canada are a major driver of the spread in the US.<p>Ironically it&#x27;s the other way around, too. Our borders are shut to tourists, but they keep showing up in Canmore and Banff anyway. And now Alberta has a serious problem with Covid spread, and a friend of my sister&#x27;s just died a couple days ago from it. They have 1&#x2F;3 the population of Ontario, yet close to the same numbers of daily cases and hospitalizations, which suggests triple the velocity.<p>There are compounding reasons as well, but everyone I know that lives there is complaining about all the Americans constantly showing up.')
