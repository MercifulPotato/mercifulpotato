Unfortunately it I wouldnt really recommend it, or would at least recommend something else. The size of the top is great, but ergonomically it sucks, its far too high and non adjustable, and the supports for the top get in the way of a good sitting position, will be switching out to a large sit stand desk eventually, hopefully using the same worktop.')
