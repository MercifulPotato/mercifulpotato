You see the same thing when there&#x27;s &#x27;uncommon&#x27; ascii characters in urls, like a trailing period, or commas or exclamation points. The proper thing to do is to enclose links in &lt;&gt;, as was done in well-formed email, but that wasn&#x27;t super consistent either, and it hasn&#x27;t transitioned to the world conciousness.')
