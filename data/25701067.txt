IMHO it is a nearly flawless service for the problem it aims to solve, and I wish it many many years of success before it crumbles under the weight of a buyout offer and VC fuckery, feature creep, or NSA letters. It truly is a &quot;too-good-to-be-true&quot; service (and severely under priced in my opinion). They say software is never finished but SL feels that way and I hope they don&#x27;t get stretched too thin with bells and whistles.')
