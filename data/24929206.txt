And instead of starting from scratch like an infant, you already have a lot of things going for you. If you were a close friend, I&#x27;d have badgered you relentlessly to believe in yourself. I hope as an internet stranger, I can plant a seed of belief in your mind.<p>Most people are capable of far more than they believe. Good luck!')
