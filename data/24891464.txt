They just couldn&#x27;t handle the sustained load, even with external fans aimed at their air intake areas.<p>I&#x27;ve always used self-built desktop towers.  When it&#x27;s time to upgrade we build them five or ten at a time so every system matches.  It makes for a much simpler build and bring-up experience.<p>In this case I needed to continue working, and so I decided to task two HP laptops on the network as external processors for the FEA tool.  I have to say, they worked great for about four weeks.  During that time they experienced about 18 hours per day of continuous processing.  Fun while it lasted.')
