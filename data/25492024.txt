Item(by='dsiah', descendants=1, kids=[25492527], score=1, time=1608523367, title='Recommendations for Learning API Design', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ve been working in industry for a little over half a decade now and while I continuously find great books on improving code quality, I&#x27;ve found it difficult to find standout books that address API Design. \nYou could assume my error may be that I am looking for a book that people recommend in the same breath as &quot;Refactoring&quot; or &quot;Design Patterns&quot; however that is not the case. Just looking for some good resources to share with teammates or sit down to reassess my approach to API design since I&#x27;ve only spent a good deal of my career in RESTful API design and would like a read that is a little more open ended and general (rather than say a cookbook).')
