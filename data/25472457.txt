The Post link suggests that their approach has worked, as long as you value a human life at no more than $1.1m. They are approaching 8k deaths and their approach is suggested to have added 5k to that.<p>“ Assume that the differential Swedish approach dampens the GDP fall this year by 1 percentage point. This represents a gain of approximately $5.6 billion. Also suppose that the approach has caused 5,000 extra deaths — a reasonable guess from comparisons with other Nordic countries. How could one estimate that loss of life in economic terms? The value of a statistical life, used by the Swedish Transport Administration in its cost-benefit analyses of investment in traffic security, is approximately $4.6 million. Using this number, the economic cost of lost lives would be as high as $22.9 billion — clearly outweighing the benefits from the smaller GDP fall. One might argue that the value of lost lives should be set much lower, as the vast majority of deaths have been among elderly people, with fewer years left to enjoy life: 89 percent of the dead in Sweden have been above 70 years of age, and 67 percent above 80. One reaches the break-even point in my calculation if one lowers the value of an average life lost to $1.12 million. For the Swedish approach to be “profitable,” the average life lost must be valued lower than that.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;outlook&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;20&#x2F;sweden-economy-pandemic-strategy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;outlook&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;20&#x2F;sweden-eco...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covid19.who.int&#x2F;region&#x2F;euro&#x2F;country&#x2F;se" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covid19.who.int&#x2F;region&#x2F;euro&#x2F;country&#x2F;se</a>')
