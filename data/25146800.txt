That makes more sense. I think it&#x27;s hard to come up with solid arguments either way, because we only have a poor understanding of genetics and hence we can only give very rough estimates on the amount of complexity needed, and how much can be introduced in a given unit of time.<p>I&#x27;m not very well versed on that topic, but as for speciation, that happens very easily. For example even relatively short term separation of populations can stop interbreedability, e.g. by changing mating behavior. Once that happens it&#x27;s just a matter of a few million years of random walks to grow feathers where there has once been fur.')
