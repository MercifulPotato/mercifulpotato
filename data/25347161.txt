From the top down, the culture at Sony is, &quot;it&#x27;s good enough for 90%&quot;. And getting that extra 10% isn&#x27;t going to be worth the investment. Those folks can go buy Apple.<p>I have dealt with SO many (and worked for some) software companies that live by this axiom. Get an MVP to market, who cares if its riddled with bugs and hobbles along with duct-tape and paperclips holding it together. &quot;We&#x27;re just going to throw it away and rewrite it later&quot;. Devs spend all their days fixing little bugs with more band-aids - dreaming of the day when they can re-arch it properly. But the truth is, that day is never coming. Why? Because think of the expense vs the gain. It literally is not worth it to have a better experience. The crappy version is already making money. Customer Service agents are cheap. Achieving Apple-level polish is simply not worth it to most companies. That&#x27;s why you have Chrysler mini-vans dying after 5 years vs Honda mini-vans lasting 15 years.')
