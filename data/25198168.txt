What people support is extending that to private sales but with the caveat that it preserve the privacy of private sales.  When you start talking about requirements like recording serial numbers and keeping records (both of which are required for commercial sales) support drops massively.<p>We could have universal background checks.  It&#x27;s not the NRA that&#x27;s standing in the way.  It&#x27;s the legislators that propose background checks in ways that ensure they are a backhanded means of creating a registry that ensure those bills are stillborn.')
