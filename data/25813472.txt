Not _all_ misinformation dropped.<p>Correct.<p>Before they change it, the title: <i>&quot;Misinformation dropped dramatically the week after Twitter banned Trump&quot;</i> as you pointed out is very misleading. Title should be <i>&quot;Election misinformation dropped dramatically the week after Twitter banned Trump&quot;</i> It obviously now gives them the idea that they should have banned them earlier.<p>They&#x27;re quick to declare victory of 1 mis-information metric, yet the Twitter, Instagram and Facebook mis-information bots are <i>still</i> running around on their platforms spreading the same fake news on their platforms.<p>But for them it&#x27;s fine to report with misleading clickbait headlines, since Trump and their supporters are now swept under the rug. Right?')
