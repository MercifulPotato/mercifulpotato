They even got a subsidy from the government for it. Back then, their house cost a total of $20,000 USD. Today, that house is for sale for a little over $400,000 USD.<p>Marriage was a largely stress-free happening of little consequence, except for your pastor and direct family. It served as a somewhat trivial proof of love and dedication, or something. Divorce was rare because you&#x27;d be judged by society for it. Nobody wants grandma to judge you for it, especially if grandma is only 45 years old and will live to whine about it for another 45.<p>Fast forward to the past decade (or two) and today. Out of high school we can&#x27;t really (very rarely) find valuable career employment, we need a university degree. Depending on where you live in the world (ahem, USA) you go into a lot of debt studying for what is hopefully a marketable degree.<p>Then you start with an income of $30,000 USD per year if you&#x27;re lucky. That house you would like to start a family in apparently costs $400k nowadays, and you can&#x27;t possibly get a mortgage for it.<p>Also, you&#x27;re still $30k (US average) in educational debts.<p>Honestly, you can&#x27;t even afford to date and eat out (food, perv), you can barely afford a car to get to work. So you live at home until you&#x27;re in your 30s. If you&#x27;re lucky you can stick around in some seedy apartment with a bunch of roommates.<p>Your career is growing strong, your responsibilities are growing stronger, dating-apps make it easier to find a new partner, you don&#x27;t have the energy to deal with all the difficulties a relationship brings along with it, and you&#x27;re still paying off your university degree (and car).<p>You&#x27;re in your early to mid thirties now, moving into your first own place. A small apartment still, but it&#x27;s your own. At $300k it is laughably expensive for such a small and old apartment, though... it&#x27;s yours! Finally, your own tiny slice of heaven!<p>You finally find that one parter that you feel safe and comfortable around, you love them. You even consider children and marriage.<p>But by now you&#x27;ve learned to do the math first. You open your Google Sheets document and tally up your expenses and incomes. Well, let&#x27;s find out how much a child costs.<p>If you&#x27;re in the USA, just birthing a child in a hospital sets you back $15,000 USD. You&#x27;ll need a bigger apartment in due time to give the child their own bedroom. You need a car that&#x27;s safe for a child. Clothing, medical care, insurances, food, toys, schoolbooks, and so much more.<p>And since both you and your partner (need to) work, you also need to figure out how expensive daycare is.<p>Well, you can&#x27;t afford to have a child just yet.<p>How about marriage?<p>HOLY SH-- I mean, obviously diamonds are a De Beers monopoly and their prices are inflated nonsense. But a decent ring will set you back quite a hefty price for the both of you. What&#x27;s that, an ENGAGEMENT RING? Is that different from a marriage ring? On average that will set you back 1 month worth of salary in total, and nobody will be impressed by what you came up with.<p>Gosh.<p>Okay, what&#x27;s next. Wedding party. On average that will set you back $23,000 USD.<p>Well, you know what? Let&#x27;s wait a few years. That&#x27;s only smart. We can save up for all of this.<p>Then you&#x27;re celebrating your 40th birthday. Your debts are mostly paid off, except your mortgage and cars of course, and it&#x27;s getting a bit late to have children. You and your partner may have decided against it entirely by now. That leaves marriage. Those elderly family members who were always asking and pressuring you about it have all died by now, or suffer dementia.<p>You know what?<p>Let&#x27;s skip it.')
