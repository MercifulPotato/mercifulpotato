I simply wanted to point out that framing the argument as &quot;Matrix vs $PROPRIETARY_SERVICE&quot; is unhelpful at best.<p>As an actual user of XMPP who has managed to get (some) of my contacts to join me in this brave old world of federation, I get frustrated when the conversation turns to &quot;Matrix vs $CENTRALIZED_SERVICE_OF_THE_DAY&quot; -- it&#x27;s a false dichotomy that ignores that fact that <i>20 years later</i> XMPP is still here and still hasn&#x27;t died.  IRC and SMTP are the only other standards for messaging that can claim that kind of longevity.<p>Of course XMPP is not perfect.  But it&#x27;s what we have to work with, and throwing our hands up in defeat and crawling back to the centralized platforms that keep letting us down <i>is not the way forward</i>.')
