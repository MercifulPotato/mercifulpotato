When I&#x27;m using Vim remotely on a hundred different systems I admin, then having a good grasp of of being comfortable using the defaults is extremely useful, and it feels painful to try to use something that&#x27;s not enabled by default that is my preference.  When I&#x27;m doing developing something more complex, I definitely appreciate more customization.<p>Vim (or at least some vi derivative) is semi-unique among many of the more complex tools we use in that it exists by default on just about every Unix host you connect to, so it has sort of a dual life in that respect.  It&#x27;s many people&#x27;s go-to tool for local development, but it&#x27;s also the default tool you can rely on for text editing remotely.  Those use cases have somewhat separate pressures they place on how people use it.')
