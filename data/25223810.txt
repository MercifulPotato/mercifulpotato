The concept of selling yourself as a prepackaged, easy to comprehend commodity is soul crushing. You are trying to convince other people to exploit your labor. Be flexible and use the term that the person you are selling yourself to wants to hear and don&#x27;t let it define you. Don&#x27;t allow yourself to get married to it. Its a label to use for other people&#x27;s benefit.')
