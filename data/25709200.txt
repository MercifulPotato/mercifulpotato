The decision to host content that could get their entire company shut down by the US government is not anything close to the same as the decision to host content that is critical of their company.<p>But yes, if they wanted to make that decision, it would be completely within their rights.  It would be a dumb decision, as it would turn away a huge number of their customers, but it would be within their rights.  (Comparatively, the decision to turn away violent hate speech will deter very few of their customers on a global scale)')
