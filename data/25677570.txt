I can go to any ATM and I will get reimbursed for the fee.<p>I was once behind on a payment to the State of California but due to moving multiple times in a short period of time they were unable to get the notice to me. I had no idea that I owed them such a big chunk of cash (taxes). Chase took the money out of my account on their behalf and charged me an additional fee. Smaller banks don&#x27;t do it - but the big banks make a ton of profit fom things like this. Suffice to say I closed my account with Chase more or less immediately afterwards. I felt violated, frankly.<p>For a while I was making close to 2% return which is pretty impressive for a regular free checking account. Once interest rates went to hell that stopped, though.<p>Citi, Chase, Wells, BoA, USBank, they are all the worst.')
