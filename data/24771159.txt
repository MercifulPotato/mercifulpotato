It&#x27;s much more complicated than that.<p>I had a 6S and I couldn&#x27;t stand the battery life (or size). &quot;Down&quot;graded to a 2016 SE and the battery life was leaps and bounds better -- plus, it didn&#x27;t shut itself off outside on cold days.<p>Based on Apple&#x27;s spec page, it does look like the Mini has worse battery life than the 12. The real question is:<p>- how is standby battery life?<p>and<p>- what kind of impact does 5G have?<p>The number&#x27;s on Apple&#x27;s site are a great deal better than the 2020 SE&#x27;s battery life, so I think we might have a good balance here. Hopefully.')
