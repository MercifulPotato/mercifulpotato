The elephant in the procgen room is the &quot;1000 bowls of oatmean&quot; problem[1] ie: perceptual uniqueness. Many procgen practitioners want to maximize serendipity but don&#x27;t see a path toward that. I expect that methods explored in academia will filter down to practitioners, but the speed at which this occurs is largely modulated by the number of people with a foot in each world and willing to communicate with both sides. The same kind of gap exists within programming language theory and design, though because it is a bigger field, it benefits from network effects to a greater extent.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;galaxykate0.tumblr.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;139774965871&#x2F;so-you-want-to-build-a-generator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;galaxykate0.tumblr.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;139774965871&#x2F;so-you-want...</a>')
