How many of the 36 above were similar situations?</i><p>Perhaps your signals are different, but in my area a &quot;red walk sign&quot; means &quot;Do Not Walk&quot;.<p>Your comment to me sounds like you&#x27;re talking about a white walk sign, which would in fact be mostly attributable to inattentive drivers.<p>But if the sign is red, then while driver inattentiveness may be involved, it&#x27;s not the primary culprit.')
