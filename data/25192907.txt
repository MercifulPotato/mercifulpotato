WFH contracts can have royalties, and it&#x27;s my understanding that Marvel and DC&#x27;s WFH contracts all have royalty-like provisions, because their authors and artists are generally providing significant new&#x2F;creative IP, but the royalties in those contracts are simply royalty-like payments that they call &quot;participation&quot; because they&#x27;re not legally royalties. They&#x27;re similar, but similar is not same. Royalty-like payments do not have the same legal force that royalties; they&#x27;re enforced through the normal means of resolving contract disputes rather than through the application of copyright law.<p>It&#x27;s extremely rare for WFH novelizations of movies to provide for royalties, because authors of novelizations are generally not creating significant (if any) new creative IP; in most cases, they&#x27;re simply converting a script to prose format.<p>ADF might have such terms in his contract, since movie studios were more generous about these things back then, but he&#x27;s had the power to show us this part of his contract for almost a week now and he&#x27;s chosen not to. Nor, for that matter, has the SFWA, which has similarly had access to at least one of those contracts.')
