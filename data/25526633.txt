That confuses fish since it now believes that nothing will fit on a line. Fish expects to be running inside a terminal emulator (xterm, konsole, iTerm2, etc.) which sets the tty width and height to the correct values.<p>So it&#x27;s not only old hardware. It applies to modern hardware when you&#x27;re using console to access a Linux server, which is not at all uncommon for data centers or headless servers.')
