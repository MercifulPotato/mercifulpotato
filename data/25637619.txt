Item(by='Hamuko', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609793053, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25636902, text='You should be paying VAT if you order from the UK to the EU.<p>I just tried out checking out an item on Amazon.co.uk with Finland as the destination. On the checkout page I have four different charges: items, postage &amp; packaging, import fees deposit, and exchange rate guarantee fee.<p>So looks like Amazon is removing the VAT from the item (it was £39.99 on the item page and it drops to £33.32 on the checkout page) and then charging your local VAT as an up-front deposit. So if it&#x27;s anything like my Amazon.co.jp orders, you just throw money at Amazon and you get the item in your hands without any customs hassle.')
