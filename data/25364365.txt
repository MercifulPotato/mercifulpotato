I started my first comment by playing devil&#x27;s advocate with myself. I&#x27;m almost a free speech absolutist, but I also really hate all the crazy, conspiratorial thinking that is so common these days. It puts me odds with myself. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m sad when crazy and dangerous ideas are removed from the internet. However, I think it&#x27;s clear to see how this could be abused. A system where the &quot;right&quot; ideas are allowed depends on the people in charge having the &quot;right&quot; ideas. When such things are possible, the pendulum swings quickly. (ie, if the government could really truly censor, imagine how the kind of censorship would differ between a red and blue administration.)<p>And, this is part of the problem: can you trust the government to decide what sort of speech is appropriate. I don&#x27;t mean now, with regards to this particular issue. I mean every time this problem crops up for the next 50 to 100 years. It relies on the same theoretical. What if instead, it&#x27;s the company which is telling the truth, but the government which is malicious, and wants to censor them?')
