UNO seems to be at a point where the Unity game engine was about 5 years ago in their asm.js&#x2F;WASM efforts. In the end they realized that it&#x27;s impossible to get the .NET runtime small enough for the web (at least for typical C# code which uses common standard library features).<p>The way Unity solves this is by creating their own C# dialect, compiler and minimal runtime (without GC etc). Sort of a brute-force approach, but until the standard .NET ecosystem solves the bloat problem it would have been better to build on a different language ecosystem.')
