Contracting&#x2F;consulting avoids a lot of that. You&#x27;re not a worker bee that the company &quot;owns&#x2F;rents&quot;, you are a vendor providing a service. It&#x27;s usually fairly concrete what you&#x27;re providing, and it&#x27;s fairly clear if they are satisfied (if they aren&#x27;t, they stop paying you). As a bonus, it&#x27;s expected that you set your schedule (as a 1099 requirement), so you get a lot of flexibility.<p>Of course, if you&#x27;re contracting for a company that thinks in terms of &quot;resources&quot; that will trickle down into contractors, too. Sometimes team perks like the quarterly see-a-random-movie are &quot;members-only&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t feel great. But then, nobody complains much if you take three weeks off to go hiking.')
