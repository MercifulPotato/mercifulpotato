That seems unlikely to me as we are likely to be vaccinating as many people as we can manufacture doses during that period and the difference is &quot;which&quot; rather than &quot;how many&quot;.<p>I leave my house about once a week, wearing a mask, to spend 20 minutes grocery shopping. My risk of contracting, contracting and dying from, or contracting and spreading the disease is extremely low and quite possibly lower than leaving that dose for someone else who is leaving their house and being around people more than 4 hours in those 3 months. Bonus is that someone at higher risk gets &quot;my&quot; dose and I get 3 additional months of population-wide study of safety, side-effects, and efficacy.')
