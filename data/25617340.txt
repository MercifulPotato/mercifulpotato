I wish I had a more sophisticated answer, but everything I do is fairly low-tech. First, memory: this works for nearly everything in my case. Second, a whiteboard for grocery items, which I update as needed. Third, just keeping momentum going for my goals.<p>For what I might term &quot;loftier&quot; aspirations (diet, fitness, etc), I just make sure I am being consistent. Those things have to be built into your lifestyle, or at least, that is the only way I can get it to work. There was a time, for instance, when I did track my nutrition with a spreadsheet. But after a few months I realized I could manage it all within my head: I had gauged my daily macro needs, and could largely judge by eye, and it has worked for years since.<p>I have tried todo-style apps, as an example of where I have tried a more explicit approach. I find that they are just procrastination and delay lists for me. If I am not actively doing it already, with exceptions, it probably won&#x27;t be done at all.')
