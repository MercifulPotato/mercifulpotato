So in this case, an originalist would rule based on the Amendment, not the just Constitution&#x27;s original text.<p>And this display a crucial point, there is a legal process to amend the Constitution not relying on a few scholars re-re-re-interpretation. I&#x27;m all for a Constitutional Amendment on abortion, as long as it&#x27;s the Will of the People, not the Will of a few jurists. If you can get a Constitutional Amendment for the prohibition of intoxicating beverages, you can certainly get a Constitutional Amendment behind abortion... unless it&#x27;s less of a consensus as you make it seems. Also, using one&#x27;s 14th Amendment Right to privacy to &quot;legalize&quot; abortion is a pretty weak argument.')
