That probably wouldn&#x27;t work as the recording might not fit on the record without it. Quoting from Wikipedia:<p>&gt; The purposes of the equalization are to permit greater recording times (by decreasing the mean width of each groove), to improve sound quality, and to reduce the groove damage that would otherwise arise during playback.')
