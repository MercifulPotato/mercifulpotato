A ton of designers have figured out how to use TTS enough to get their prototypes working in here and then have online virtual playtest nights using it. Also publishers can also use it to playtest games, or to see a virtual pitch.<p>TTS is actually very powerful once you dig into it. I was annoyed by it at first, but once I sat down and watched some videos, sat in on other people&#x27;s playtests and gotten ideas for things I can do in my own prototypes, I&#x27;ve discovered just how powerful it is. I haven&#x27;t dug into the scripting aspect of it yet, but I will before too much longer.<p>I&#x27;m actually going to use it for pitching one of my games to publishers during an event next weekend (a simple abstract game called Cake Walk, I actually have it up on the Steam Workshop so anyone can try it). It&#x27;s at the link below if you own TTS and you&#x27;re curious.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steamcommunity.com&#x2F;sharedfiles&#x2F;filedetails&#x2F;?id=2217344915" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steamcommunity.com&#x2F;sharedfiles&#x2F;filedetails&#x2F;?id=22173...</a><p>I know there&#x27;s also Tabletopia, which is free up front, but that requires you to pay a monthly fee if you want to set up more than one game, and if you&#x27;re a designer like me, I&#x27;ve got like 10 active prototypes at any given time. It&#x27;s still good for people running Kickstarters to let people try out their game during a campaign though.<p>If any of you own this and like the idea of playtesting games in progress, there&#x27;s a group that happens pretty much every day of the week. Most meet via Discord, since it&#x27;s more stable for audio and will stay up even when switching servers. Here&#x27;s a list below if anyone is interested. I&#x27;ve mostly stuck with the Chicago group, but you might see me in the others at some point:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardboardedison.com&#x2F;playtest-groups" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardboardedison.com&#x2F;playtest-groups</a>')
