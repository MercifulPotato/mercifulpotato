This might cut text in the header&#x2F;footer eg the page number. Optionally crop odd &amp; even pages differently.<p>- turn the iPad landscape and with 2 fingers pinch to zoom the text until the margins snap to the sides of the screen. Now with a single finger scroll down to read the text from top to bottom. Flip to the next page by swiping with a single finger to the left and Goodreader will conveiniently start at the top of the next page.<p>In my experience for most portrait pages this enlarges the text big enough. As a bonus you can use the iPad Smart Cover as a stand in either position. I use this trick since the original iPad1 as Goodreader has been there since day 1.')
