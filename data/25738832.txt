Normally we recommend &gt;75% for a credible article.<p>If you click on the rating you&#x27;ll see details on the four factors we rate for each article: site reputation (historical score), author&#x27;s topical expertise, diversity of sources, neutrality of tone. Collectively these produce a probability of being credible. So we don&#x27;t fact check individual statements (very difficult to do via an algorithm) but rather we assess the likelihood of an article being credible in aggregate.')
