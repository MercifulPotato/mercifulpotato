You get massive Biden support in one city and massive Trump support in another rural county - it&#x27;s not surprising at all. There&#x27;s also differences in when the ballots arrived: some states could process ballots ahead of time so the late counted ones are only those that arrived late and may be more or less D&#x2F;R leaning. And different states have different voter registration policies; that&#x27;s why Arizona has had relatively good Trump performance on the later counts since there are a large number of Republican voters using vote-by-mail and there always have been in Arizona. There is boundless discussion of the specifics of this on twitter, etc. I don&#x27;t think swing state&#x2F;non-swing state is a useful categorization here. Just look at the where the ballots are coming from directly.')
