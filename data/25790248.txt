Laziness, in a way, is a driver of efficiency. You want to do something in a way that requires less effort.<p>It is learning, though, that gives you the tools you need to be &quot;lazy&quot; (if we agree on reading &quot;lazy&quot; as a desire to do less, as opposed to a desire to not doing anything at all - there could be debate here). In turn, finding a way to do less work takes work itself.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that these complaints could hold some validity, it&#x27;s just a shame that the author doesn&#x27;t seem like the type to do anything about it.')
