Bringing California problems, whether it be zoning laws, riots, real estate prices, unbreathable air due to foolish politically driven forestry management, water shortages, tent cities, traffic jams, electrical blackouts, people shitting in the streets or whatever charming advancements you may come up with next to Austin, Montana, Kuala Lumpur or Des Moines: you people should be treated as the pariahs you are.')
