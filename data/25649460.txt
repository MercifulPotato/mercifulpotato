Instead, everywhere it seems that people got sucked into debates on privacy, &quot;innovative solutions&quot;, and governments&#x27; involvement, with private companies without any prior experience of the domain (public health and infectious disease management) developing their own apps in a completely haphazard way and with a great lack of political courage from governments.<p>I had predicted many months ago these apps would end up nowhere for the reasons above and, unfortunately that&#x27;s exactly what happened.<p>We could have looked at how China did it for example. But then one of the issues politically is that anyone suggesting that would be pilloried for wanting to &quot;<i>turn the country into a tyranny</i>&quot;...<p>Regarding your point about technical issues, they may be an &quot;innovative startup&quot; but what is their experience about large scale systems? This did not require to be innovative, it required a large scale, robust, and centralised system in order to deliver the most results in terms of public health.<p>I feel this was the moment idealism crashed into reality.')
