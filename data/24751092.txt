This notion that we&#x27;re being forced out of software jobs because we don&#x27;t have side-projects just hasn&#x27;t manifested anywhere that I&#x27;ve seen. It very much feels like an argument that you should be able to advance in your career with 40 hours&#x2F;wk as much as the person willing to spend 50.<p>So, you have kids, great! Spend time with them, enjoy your life. Presumably you&#x27;re a software engineer so you&#x27;re making more money than the vast majority of the world. Enjoy that, but do you feel entitled to go as far in your career as someone who dedicates more of their life to their career? Should those people be punished by being displaced by someone like you who presumably has less expertise due to spending less time on your career? I&#x27;m not trying to put words in your mouth, but I&#x27;m struggling to understand why our current system should change to cater to your lifestyle choices of having kids.')
