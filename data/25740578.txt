There is a subtle difference between that statement and &quot;neutrons are waves&quot; that, again, is glossed over.<p>The wave-like properties of all fermions can be explained with any variant of the many-worlds interpretation (MWI) that you prefer.<p>Essentially in MWI each neutron in each universe is a point (actually three because of the quarks), but that point is not in the same place in all universes. The &quot;closer&quot; a parallel universe is, the closer the neutrons are to each other spatially. The universes aren&#x27;t discrete, they form a continuum that is locally smooth, forming a differentiable manifold.<p>It&#x27;s the distribution <i>across</i> the parallel universes that&#x27;s continuous and wave-like, not the individual neutrons! The wave mechanics of QM is simply a description of the cross-universe distribution of neutrons interacting with the cross-universe distribution of other particles.<p>This was <i>not</i> the initial mental model developed in the early days of quantum mechanics. The founders of the theory flatly rejected MWI based on largely <i>religious</i> objections. It&#x27;s absurd if you think about it, but the weird and complex mathematics of QM is simply a product of these people pretending parallel worlds don&#x27;t exist.<p>It&#x27;s a way of pretending functions can have multiple values in one place without actually admitting that this requires additional dimensions, otherwise they&#x27;re not mathematical functions!<p>They also like to pretend that scalars have probability distributions... except sometimes when interacting with other probability distributions that magically stop being distributed at the same time.<p>In computer terms: This is like someone pretending that arrays are passed into a function using a CPU register that can have many values at the same time. It&#x27;s just absurd.')
