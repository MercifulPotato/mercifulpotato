The endless cycles of reencoding doesn&#x27;t do a good thing to videos. I would even argue that my 10 year old YouTube videos decreased more than some of my 25 year old VHS tapes.\nSo engrave your video bits in platinum to make sure it withstand time. Don&#x27;t forget to add the decoder algorithm as well. It might not exist anymore in 30 years from now.')
