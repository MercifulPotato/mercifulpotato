Item(by='fmajid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604218696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24953071, text='&gt; the low-caste Indians who converted to Islam to get out of the caste system<p>Sadly Muslims were not much better in this regard and created their own caste system of sorts, with descendants of foreign invaders given more status than descendants of local converts (Afghan good, Middle Eastern better), who were assumed to be low-caste fleeing oppression for that specific reason. I&#x27;ve heard the same from a Christian Indian from Mangalore. Perhaps that&#x27;s why Dr. Ambedkar opted for Buddhism rather than Islam or Christianity as his recommended path forward for the Dalits (former untouchables).')
