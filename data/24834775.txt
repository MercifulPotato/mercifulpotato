Item(by='smsm42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603179483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24833206, text='&gt; School is probably the best public invention to systematically distribute knowledge<p>But is it? There are many schools that fail spectacularly at the task, to the point of graduating people who are functionally illiterate. Maybe school alone is not enough for that.<p>&gt;  Not all parents are good teachers.<p>True. Unfortunately, even more teachers aren&#x27;t good teachers. Out of all teachers I had, I have maybe one really great teacher I could name and two or three decent ones. The rest were nearly useless at best, and actively harmful at worst. And there were much more of those than good ones. Fortunately, school is not the only place one can find good teachers...<p>&gt; School&#x27;s purpose is not to teach obedience<p>Are you sure? Because everything I&#x27;ve heard about schools suggests it is. At least if we&#x27;re talking about standard government-issue school, not special fancy educational project or independent private establishment.<p>&gt;  It is there to teach us critical thinking<p>Maybe in theory. In practice maybe 1% of teachers could deal with actual critical thinking from the students, and even less would like to. And most &quot;critical thinking&quot; education I&#x27;ve encountered was &quot;question those other authorities in a way we prescribe to you as your only and true authority which you don&#x27;t dare to question&quot;.<p>&gt; An educated population is also less prone to fall into totalitarianism<p>Given the absolutely disastrous state of the American academia, I don&#x27;t think this argument holds any water. Yes, Cultural Revolution despised educated people. But turns out there&#x27;s more than one way to indoctrination and totalitarian thought control. And being educated in never letting a dissenting opinion to be heard is no better than being not educated at all, at least when we talk about preventing totalitarianism.')
