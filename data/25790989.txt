Regardless of Musk&#x27;s promises, EV battery pack manufacture takes a lot of energy. Given tat you say hydrocarbon fuels (which are typically what power all of the manufacturing processes in question) have their own energy cost, they also need to be added to the <i>EV</i> side of the equation.<p>I also prefer, in general, to stick to measurements of energy usage, and not CO2e or dollars, because energy usage is what matters. The rest can be manipulated by legislation, and leave too much to interpretation. If I burn some coal to power my manufacturing plant, that&#x27;s a lot of CO2. If I burn a load of timber from a virgin rainforest to do the same, that&#x27;s zero CO2, because that is defined as &quot;sustainable&quot;.')
