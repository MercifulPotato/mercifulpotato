A very small change in the initial guess can be the difference between success and a blowup for numerical algorithms; particularly rootfinding algorithms.<p>Sometimes this is implementation specific, and is numerical instability. Sometimes this is endemic to the algorithm regardless of implementation, like Runge&#x27;s phenomenon. Often there is no fix, or the fix would be inordinately complicated or only generalize poorly, etc.<p>In this situation scipy should probably just pop a warning.')
