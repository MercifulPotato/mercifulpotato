You imply there are a lot of people willing to buy for the current price. I think the scenario is different.<p>A professional trader is happy if he makes 10% or 20% a year. This is considered for most a great achievement.<p>The average Joe whose friend told him that he can get rich buying Tesla stocks will only sell for 200%, 300% or even 1000%+ on his micro shares.<p>We got a market full of people which go in and buy for whatever is there and try to sell for a lot more. Sometimes they panic and sometimes they forget about it.<p>Additionally we currently have a lot of index funds forced to buy because of the inclusion. Which is genius move of Musk&#x2F;Mizuno and others.<p>It&#x27;s hard to predict where Tesla, Zoom and others will end up. I wouldn&#x27;t dare to make any prediction. They might grow into their evaluations given time or a lot of average Joe&#x27;s might decide its time to pay rent or even buy a house. Let&#x27;s wait and see.')
