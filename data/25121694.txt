Item(by='gspr', descendants=None, kids=[25122964], score=None, time=1605605312, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121416, text='First of all, I&#x27;m sure the author knows more about git than I do, so I don&#x27;t wanna come across as trying to lecture an expert. But I do feel that his main point misses the mark. It seems to be centered around the idea that a lot of reasonable people are surprised by things git won&#x27;t let them do (or, more accurately, strongly advices against doing). The problem is that most of these things are only &quot;reasonable&quot; from the point of view of someone who hasn&#x27;t thoroughly thought through what a DVCS has to do. A lot of the &quot;reasonable&quot; questions are raised from the point of view of &quot;this is a tool for sharing changes to code&quot;. But that is just a nice side-effect of what a DVCS aims to do â€“ it is not the goal.<p>I too have had to clean up git mistakes of collaborators for years, almost all of them rooted in a misunderstanding of what git does, or carelessness (amplified by git&#x27;s arguably less-than-stellar naming conventions). But is there really any chance that any DVCS will be &quot;easy&quot; (or &quot;not too hard&quot;) for someone who hasn&#x27;t thought about and internalized what the goal of a DVCS is? It seems a bit like a person who only ever spreads butter complaining that knives are needlessly sharp.<p>PS: My greatest success rate at converting people from &quot;just hammer git commands until my code is on GitHub&quot; to actually understanding what problem git tries to solve, and how to interact with it, has been from Mary Cook&#x27;s wonderful <i>Git from the inside out</i> (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codewords.recurse.com&#x2F;issues&#x2F;two&#x2F;git-from-the-inside-out" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codewords.recurse.com&#x2F;issues&#x2F;two&#x2F;git-from-the-inside...</a>)')
