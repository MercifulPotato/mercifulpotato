They are incorporated. I should have done a simple search before posting my original comment.<p>That said, I now mostly agree with the comment I was originally replying to.<p>&gt; What does limited liability have to do with a corporation being owned by one person?<p>Correct, nothing. To clarify:<p>My position is that an entity enjoying limited liability (which in the US includes an LLC or corporation owned by a single person) has exchanged &quot;rights&quot; for indemnity and therefore can be compelled to - for example - bake a cake or not censor content hosted on their servers, but that a sole proprietor can do whatever they want re: refusing service or moderating content.')
