Item(by='orwin', descendants=None, kids=[25210340], score=None, time=1606313283, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25206012, text='Most economists, &quot;orthodox&quot; or Neo-keynesian, have the same issues: they don&#x27;t understand physics.<p>I&#x27;ll develop: GDP growth is `(population growth) * (productivity gains) * ÃŸ` basically, right? So GDP per capita is productivity gain. Any person&#x2F;economist with a better view on this is welcome, i mostly took that from economics 101 (or equivalent) in my first year, when i still did not know what i wanted to do.<p>Is the human body more productive than 20 years ago? is the human mind more productive than 20 years ago? No, not really, but we had two thing that helped us: more energy, and Moore&#x27;s Law. Once our Carnot machines were optimized and our electric motors available, productivity gains caused by efficiency became marginal, and the best way to increase productivity was to install more machines. There is a hard 100% limit that physic impose us on electric motors, and a hard 64% Carnot&#x27;s law impose us on thermic motors anyway, so no efficiency gains here.<p>The same way, Moore&#x27;s law will stop one day. I&#x27;ll be optimist and believe we will have CPU enter the nano dimension. And as smaller size equal smaller energy use, let&#x27;s say this will be *10 efficiency (smaller mean they will break more easily too). Really unlikely, but let&#x27;s assume that.<p>So GDP growth will be driven&#x2F;limitied by energy output in the forseeable future, once we will recover from Covid.')
