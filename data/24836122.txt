Item(by='kdtop', descendants=None, kids=[24836244], score=None, time=1603193080, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24834552, text='The problem with chatbots is one of an unfulfilled promise, an unrealistic setting of user expectations.  An empty Google search window doesn&#x27;t pretend to be a human being -- although it is actually very powerful.  Clippy, on the other hand, has a human face and pretends to be an intelligent agent, only to fail.  So chatbots, when seeming to act like a human via natural language, are held in the user&#x27;s mind to a higher standard.  Siri, in my iPhone, seems to strike a better balance.  It takes my spoken input and gives replies (albeit not great replies).  But I never get the feeling that it is trying to carry on an extended conversation with me.')
