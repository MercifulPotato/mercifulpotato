And Twitter users themselves tend to be more political than the general population. So what you see on Twitter is representative of the more hardcore partisans, not the mainstream.<p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The left (at least, the internet left) do this here in the UK too. Twitter seems to think all Tory voters are rich white men who want the poor to suffer.<p>On a similar note, most conservatives that I talk to think that everyone on the left is a social justice warrior who wants white men to suffer. I suspect a big part of the problem is that our views of the other side are based on the most extreme people from that side. This is certainly the view that&#x27;ll be formed if one tries to &quot;get a balance of views from both sides on social media&quot; (you can&#x27;t get a balanced view if you&#x27;re only seeing extremists from both sides).')
