Saving around 10KB.<p>Would you be able to offer the feature I mentioned? Load only enough CSS + JS to show the chat widget circle then load the rest after the user clicks? It would need less than 10KB of code total before compression, and then optimising the size of the full widget wouldn&#x27;t be as critical.<p>I know you can trigger the Crisp chat pop-up programmatically so I guess it&#x27;s something a user could implement but it would be a feature I would really appreciate since I&#x27;m always optimising the page speed of websites I help with.')
