Of course you can find a job in any part of the world. You have one of the most desired and in demand professions in the world. No one argues about that.<p>But being in privileged position like yours and saying 4 freedoms don&#x27;t benefit _regular people_?!<p>No one cares if you personally are proud or not that EU nationals have equal rights, but these equal rights exist, regardless of what you think or feel, because it&#x27;s a fact and a law which along with other 3 freedoms have been playing huge role in shaping the European Union. And it benefits everyone of almost 500 million EU nationals today, including whoever you mean by _regular people_.<p>This discussion is about you saying &quot;None of the 4 freedoms of the EU is actually beneficial to regular people&quot;.<p>Saying that, you either:<p>1) Don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about<p>2) Or you&#x27;re delusional<p>I will assume you&#x27;re not delusional, but a logical person, since you&#x27;re on Hacker News and you can understand rational argument.<p>So please, research what free movement of goods, capital, services and labour actually means and has done for everyone in Europe, including _regular people_. Saying they&#x27;re not beneficial is nonsense, and means you haven&#x27;t done your homework.')
