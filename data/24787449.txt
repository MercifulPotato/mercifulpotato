Now I wrote it again...<p>My hope for the &quot;modern desktop&quot; is actually having a hybrid system that offers UX automation for the most used tasks, but allows efficient interaction when users are power users of it.<p>With things happening lately around purism&#x27;s phosh shell, and pinephone being on the verge of having a full convergence desktop...I think we are finally getting very close to actually implementing it.<p>What the ecosystem around phosh now needs is apps, apps that can replace that proprietary shit that is forced upon users. Libhandy was&#x2F;is a huge step forward to have a responsive AND adaptive layouting in native apps.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether we actually can use GTK here, or whether it turns out that HTML&#x2F;CSS like concepts are the way to go then, because it&#x27;s a transferable concept across multiple platforms (and data endpoints, like print or braille stylesheets) but I really hope that it gets easier to write offline ready apps in the future for both mobile and desktop without having to go the react native BS route that always turns out to duplicate codebases anyways.')
