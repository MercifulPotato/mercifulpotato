You would have to know they were still being used though, so you would need a time-sensitive encryption that calls home to activate, and if used in multiple instances you&#x27;d know that too. But reverse engineering the encryption to get the secret sauce sounds like a workaround. It could be made difficult for average folk, but not impossible. The real advantage would be micro&#x2F;nano-payments and fee-less transactions since the device is the &quot;miner&quot;, ie. by not using BTC&#x2F;ETH etc.<p>At the end of the day a subscription model is probably easier.')
