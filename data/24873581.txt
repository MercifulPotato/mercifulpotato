He made a tool for Win32 platform years ago [2].<p>I play (hobby) harmonica and I feel them differently. I like dark tone of G (blues in D), bright and someone neutral tone of C, I have A and don&#x27;t play it much. How can one explain this?<p>Do you experience Doppler effect on ski elevator? It was devastating. Can it be that harmonica trains ears to find a hole and bend notes? But any fretles instrument should have same requirement (violin).<p>Some people claim adults can&#x27;t learn languages, while in reality we lack not neuron plasticity but time, patience, culture. Maybe skill learned by adult and child is different but serves same function. It is fine by me to learn &quot;perfect ear equivalent&quot;. At least I can train myself and play with a kid, maybe he would acquire this skill in full potential.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aruffo.com&#x2F;eartraining&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aruffo.com&#x2F;eartraining&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aruffo.com&#x2F;eartraining&#x2F;software&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aruffo.com&#x2F;eartraining&#x2F;software&#x2F;</a>')
