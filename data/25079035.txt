You can choose to ignore such DMCA requests if they decide to send one to your self-hosted website, but not honoring it means you think you&#x27;re not infringing on their copyright and are willing to go to court over it. If they don&#x27;t want to go this far, or you try to not include contact info, they&#x27;ll probably first send a DMCA to your web host&#x2F;registrar who will suspend your hosting&#x2F;website unless you counter-notice, which still means you&#x27;ve got to be ready to fight a lawsuit (note that Cloudflare forwards DMCA requests to your web host company, so you can&#x27;t hide behind CF).')
