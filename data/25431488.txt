It could also be said that the decode unit is so complex that it takes as much die space as <i>all</i> the integer ports <i>put together</i>.<p>SRAM may use most of the die, but it isn&#x27;t using huge amounts of power most of the time as it&#x27;s static. Those big SIMD units are also powered off when not used (no doubt it&#x27;s the same with the other ALUs).<p>In contrast, the entire 5% of the die that makes up the decoder never power gates and is always running flat out. By size it&#x27;s the same as leaving all your integer cores running full-out all the time.<p>The bigger issue seems to be that neither AMD nor Intel have been able to make those units much wider over the years which puts a hard limit on total throughput (they&#x27;ve hinted that the power cost on widening the decoder is very big which would mean loads of power used for diminishing returns).')
