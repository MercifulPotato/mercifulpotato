I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time painting portraits, yet still cannot remember the faces of my friends and family.<p>I also have a hard time  comprehending audio speech when spoken at a normal talking speed. I need it sped up to be able to easily understand it.<p>On the other, I realized recently that I have a sense of smell far exceeding that of a normal person. I can often smell scent trails of people, even distinguishing them from each other. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m following a &quot;path&quot; where I can tell they&#x27;ve walked. The other day I walked into the men&#x27;s restroom and knew without even looking who was inside before I&#x27;d opened the door, then who was in each stall without checking shoes. I wasn&#x27;t walking around sniffing, just walked in to wash my hands and had an errant thought that I needed to talk to Jim, and lo, here he was in stall two. This struck me as odd, so I started asking and realized that this is unusual.<p>Likewise, I can remember a person&#x27;s speaking voice so clearly as to be able to usually detect a person from a single word. And even actors I&#x27;ve only seen in one movie a decade ago, I&#x27;ll pause a cartoon after a single sentence, then mentally flip through a voice match in my head before remembering where I&#x27;ve heard them before.<p>I suspect both are this way because I have absolutely terrible vision from my father&#x27;s side. It started when I was very little, yet due to some unusual circumstances I didn&#x27;t get glasses for six months or so when I first needed them. I wonder if that time of near blindness while developing caused my brain to grow into these other senses as compensation.')
