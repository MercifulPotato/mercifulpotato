I doubt anyone would dispute that?<p>The idea here is that the most profitable thing tends to be more upmarket than the locals can typically afford. The area gets gentrified and rents go up.<p>I am nowhere near an economist, but that doesn&#x27;t immediately seem wrong to me. There are plenty of real world examples where this has happened.<p>A socialist would say that if the market fails to provide solutions for core needs of people (health, housing, etc) it is up to the government to provide those. Some things are simply either unprofitable or not suited for a profit driven approach (e.g. private prisons where the companies running them are actively incentivised to see repeat offenders).<p>You can argue that having the government build low cost housing is not the correct solution, but I think the propostion that <i>some</i> housing raises rents is actually not that crazy.')
