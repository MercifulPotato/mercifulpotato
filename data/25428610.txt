Big South East Asia countries are  generally cursed with natural resources[0], they have oil, timber and whatnot, and yet their GDPs dwarfed compared to Singapore and lag behind in virtually all the indexes measuring good living like corruption index, a tiny SEA country with absolutely zero natural resources.<p>Stop people from destroying the rainforest comes first before giving them their livehood, not after.<p>[0]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Resource_curse" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Resource_curse</a>')
