Item(by='snapetom', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606517530, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25233136, text='+1 on Reveal.  My last job required a fair amount of lessons with Jupyter.  Reveal let me stay in the browser for both slides and code, and since it&#x27;s all HTML, let me programmatically and quickly style the slides instead of WYSIWYGing in Keynote&#x2F;PowerPoint.<p>Plus, I just ran the thing running in Docker with the actual slide HTML file in different host directories.  Starting a presentation was just docker run -v.')
