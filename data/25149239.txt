The first version of Notepad++ was published in 2003.<p>Neil Hodgson also maintains the multiplatform editor called SciTE<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SciTE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SciTE</a><p>which uses the same engine, and which, from my perspective, has some important advantages over the Notepad++ (it&#x27;s multiplatform, and, for me, more &quot;hacker oriented&quot; and more &quot;hackable&quot; (e.g. having Lua as its scripting engine)).<p>Edit: regarding the &quot;UX&quot; mentioned in the responses -- the configuration of SciTE is performed by editing text files, whereas the configuration of Notepad++ is done by the dialogs. That&#x27;s exactly why I consider SciTE more &quot;hacker oriented&quot;. I&#x27;ve also mentioned the integration of Lua in SciTE. That&#x27;s the UX that, for better or worse, matched my needs. I&#x27;ve never claimed that SciTE has &quot;better dialogs&quot; or something like that. Regarding &quot;more LOC&quot; claim, I claim that Scintilla is very carefully written, and that the LOC aren&#x27;t the reflection of unnecessary abstractions, but correspond to the real non-trivial problems solved by the code. Whoever disagree should should demonstrate where the LOC could be reduced.')
