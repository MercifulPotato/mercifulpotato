I know when I was a kid my library card was constantly maxed out on how many books I could have out simultaneously, I think like 20 or 30? We’d go to the library pretty much weekly and bring back ones I’d read, along with the occasional book I’d decided to not finish, or ones I’d just never started on, and I’d get about that many new-to-me ones out.')
