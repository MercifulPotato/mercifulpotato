Plus emacs (and most linux-first editors, for that matter) is lightyears faster on wsl than on the native windows builds.<p>The only issue is with WSL I&#x27;m limited to console apps, so if I want to build an OpenGL or Vulkan or GUI project, I have to use Visual Studio or VSCode if I want a good development experience, and even then, it&#x27;s not quite as comfy.<p>I can only hope that with better GUI support comes some kind of GPU passthrough, but a woman can only hope.')
