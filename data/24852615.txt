I don&#x27;t believe in &quot;low-level offenses&quot; as anything but tools to perpetuate inequality and would love to see the concept eliminated. Any offense benign enough to be considered &quot;low-level&quot; is not indicative of bad intention to me, because I assume any person choosing to do evil will go big or go home :)')
