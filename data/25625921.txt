I consider hobbies, reading books, going on walks and things like that as productive and tried to reduce time I spent mindlessly scrolling social media.<p>I&#x27;m also doing my PhD so by trying to increase my at-work productivity I&#x27;m trying to make sure that I don&#x27;t waste too much of taxpayer&#x27;s money.<p>But I agree that optimising productivity too much could be anxiety-inducing and I was trying to be mindful of that while looking at my data and deciding what to change in my life based on it.')
