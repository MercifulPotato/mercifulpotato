Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611051587, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25831455, text='&gt; Weekly church attendance in the U.S. is far higher than in Western Europe<p>Yes, but we were talking about western Europe, like Poland and Hungary.<p>&gt; The U.S. isn&#x27;t a &quot;secular nation&quot; either. The &quot;Establishment Clause&quot; prohibits Congress from establishing a national church, just like Article 137 of the Weimar Constitution in Germany<p>Yes, but we were talking about Poland and Hungary, not Germany. Poland and Hungary&#x27;s constitutions establish national religious law. I would consider Germany to be secular, like the US, as opposed to Poland or Hungary, which are not.<p>&gt; Justice Story made clear in 1830 that the constitution was not understood to prohibit non-preferential government support of religion<p>However, throughout the later 1800s, a majority of states (and nearly the nation as a whole) passed Blaine amendments, banning the use of public funds for private religious schools. Now this might have been driven in part by anti-catholic sentiment, but no, I don&#x27;t think you can claim that the court adopting an interpretation that most states already had adopted was a &quot;dramatic departure&quot;. Perhaps legally, but not in terms of popular support&#x2F;understanding.<p>&gt; particularly due to the Supreme Court taking various decisions on social issues away from the electorate, the laws in the U.S. with respect to churches, abortion, etc.<p>Right, and this is unambiguously a good thing. Laws shouldn&#x27;t be based on religious ethics.<p>&gt; And does that give us any insight into the current situation in the US?<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t see how it does. Trump&#x27;s brand of populism isn&#x27;t particularly religious. His appeal to the religious right wasn&#x27;t much beyond &quot;I&#x27;ll appoint conservative judges&quot;. It&#x27;s much more nationalist than religious (and I&#x27;ll grant you that those two things are often intertwined, but that seems to be more because conservatives are often the ones stoking nationalist sentiment, and also they&#x27;re usually more religious, I don&#x27;t think religion necessitates nationalism).')
