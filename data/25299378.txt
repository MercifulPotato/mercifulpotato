I did end up tweaking the files though to change up some keybinds and indicate fan speed + thermals in the bar. So it ended up being mostly 1) just a config starter (incl. most bar widgets you&#x27;d want) that I can also maybe rebase on if they update upstream in a way that matters 2) a way to get very consistent system theming across i3 setup and GTK.')
