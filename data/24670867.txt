All of the contributions I have planned have had open issues for a while and I&#x27;ve discussed them with the maintainers for sometimes months. Now none of them will count towards the shirt.<p>And I want that god damn shirt! I know it&#x27;s stupid, but it was really nice to get something sorta-exclusive for doing something good for the open-source community, even if my contributions weren&#x27;t particularly groundbreaking. I&#x27;d gladly pay shipping costs if necessary (actually, I think that would be a good anti-spam measure). But now I&#x27;ll have to spend more time looking for tagged projects to contribute to and probably end up not finishing some of my planned PRs.')
