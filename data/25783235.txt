Nobody’s going to build another coal-fired power plant in America. No one’s going to build another oil-fired plant in America. They’re going to move to renewable energy.&quot;<p>If Biden promises to increase subsidies for renewables (which, as I understand, he plans to do), and that causes disinvestment away from say gas-fired plants, isn&#x27;t it reasonable for folks in places like Pennsylvania and Texas where fracking is a huge part of the economy to oppose such measures?<p>If &quot;the market&quot; is going to make it so nobody builds new gas-fired plants (I agree the market won&#x27;t build new coal or oil plants) why is Biden proposing $2 trillion in subsidies for renewables?<p>To be clear, I think Biden&#x27;s renewables plan is basically the correct one, but its going to be bad for currently prosperous middle class parts of Pennsylvania, Texas, etc., that rely heavily on gas extraction.')
