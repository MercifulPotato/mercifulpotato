Why does that matter? There were white people fighting in the civil rights movement for black rights, is that somehow lesser? Why is fighting for others a problem?<p>* Climate change already has, in fact, displayed <i>some</i> impact on most people by now.<p>* The fight over climate change is focused on the future, it&#x27;s focused on prevention of larger harms, we&#x27;re talking about a timeline that includes decades. Waiting until things are already a total, unmitigated disaster and <i>then</i> doing something about it would obviously be deeply stupid.<p>* Social justice issues actually do affect tons of people -- my wife, being a woman, is affected by various problems of sexism. Women and girls comprise half the population, add in basically any ethnicity or sexual minority and you&#x27;re already at a majority of people.<p>* Again, even if you&#x27;re personally the whitest, straightest, cis-est, male-st person possible, what&#x27;s wrong with standing up for the rights of others? How is that disturbing in the least? I think you may be confusing &quot;disturbing&quot; with &quot;encouraging&quot; or &quot;inspiring&quot;.<p>&gt; Interestingly, most of them do have one thing in common: lack of highly marketable skills or professional weight.<p>Imagine someone making an identical argument for MLK&#x27;s march on Washington DC, or for the broader civil rights movement at large. This is basically a character attack designed to deflect from the actual problems they&#x27;re protesting. &quot;These people only protest because they&#x27;re losers!&quot; is basically the message you&#x27;re sending here.<p>If you look at social conservatism as a whole, this is basically always the argument, the way that history is rationalized. As soon as they lose one fight -- women being able to vote, civil rights movement, gay marriage, etc. -- the mantra suddenly goes from &quot;okay okay, fine, [last change] was totally a good thing after all, but [new change] is completely crazy! For <i>real</i> this time!&quot;')
