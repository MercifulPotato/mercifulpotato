But one day i got internet, then I spent next 10 years playing video games, and watching youtube. So there is certainly an opportunity that was lost somewhere. It helped me learn programming for sure. But could I have watched 5000 hours fewer of youtube videos and spent 9000 hours less on multiplayers games and instead focused on something else? who knows, but i can&#x27;t rule it out.')
