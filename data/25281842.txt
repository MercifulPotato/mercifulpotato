What are you are asking for them to do?<p>You pre-paid for $10k of usage, with an agreement to roll-over unused credits into next year&#x27;s contract. The plain definition of roll-over includes the fact that you&#x27;d have an active future account. Otherwise, they&#x27;d just say &quot;prepay credits never expire&quot;. Imagine trying to use roll-over minutes on a phone plan where you cancelled the phone.<p>$1k&#x2F;yr seems like a very low minimum which will serve as basis to roll your $9k of existing credits into.<p>Sounds to me like you just didn&#x27;t think about or budget for this. Doesn&#x27;t sound like any misrepresentation to me.')
