Item(by='qayxc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607854171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25404862, text='&gt; Having a programming language that mirrors our everyday communication is an important step forward in making the innovations from software broadly available.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case at all. Mathematics developed a formalised non-natural language precisely because human language is completely unsuitable for expressing abstract concepts in a concise and unambiguous fashion.<p>You will find that even in non-technical fields language will quickly converge to a well-defined, coarse and highly coded subset of regular human language when efficiency and correctness are key. You can observe this in the different branches of military, medicine, and trades.<p>We use programming to formalise algorithms, processes, and models. Those are abstract concepts and the difficulty doesn&#x27;t lie in expressing them verbally. This has been shown time and again by fruitless efforts to create localised dialects of more accessible programming languages like BASIC or Pascal.<p>Turns out it doesn&#x27;t matter whether keywords are written in your native language or if you could write natural language-like sentences: the difficult part remained formalising the abstract concept and ideas in a meaningful, logical and sound way.<p>What I <i>do</i> think will help tremendously, however, is using system such as GPT-3 to create another level of abstraction. There are many descriptive tasks that don&#x27;t need to be put into code manually. The structure and behaviour of UIs comes to mind.')
