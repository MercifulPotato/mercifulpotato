Further, he&#x27;s deeply conspiratorial and not in dialog with the medical system or much of mainstream anything. He&#x27;s also quite forgetful in areas that are alarming for someone his age (early 30&#x27;s). Anyone have ideas on how they would approach a friend or act as appropriate council to try to make sure he can continue to age appropriately? No one else in his immediate circle is really as health aware or conscious as I, so I feel like the onus falls particularly on me to try to be proactive if there are any steps that can be taken. Further, surprisingly to me, former football players are in little if any dialog with the teams they played on so I don&#x27;t expect great advice to come from those organizations either.')
