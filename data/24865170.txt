Houdini&#x27;s modelling toolset now at least rivals if not surpasses what is available in Maya out of the box, however there is a massive amount of inertia in this department. Modellers seem to get a bit stuck on specific tools, so things don&#x27;t tend to change until new modellers start coming in, bringing the new tools with them.')
