Before Covid, I have never experienced anxiety or panic, in my life, ever.<p>The anxiety attacks are pretty much: My nose is clogged, I might have covid, can I breath, oh my god, my breathing is constricted a little. Are my fingers turning blue? Can you look at my face and tell me if my face is drooping? Can I still smell things? (pulls out super strength Oregano Oil - OMG it&#x27;s not as strong any more - am I losing my smell).<p>I&#x27;m a man. I&#x27;m 40 years old (soon 41). All my life I&#x27;ve been super healthy - no problems. I would never have predicted I would be this scared of something in my life.<p>My wife and I are planning on trying to go back to normal soon. We&#x27;re going to start getting take-out food to start, still washing hands. I don&#x27;t want to live the rest of my life like this, and I think now is the time to go closer to how life was before - just with some modifications. Just not as many modifications as we&#x27;re under now.<p>If I don&#x27;t change, the anxiety may kill me.')
