Having the experience to spot common pitfalls or &#x27;weak&#x27; looking stats is key. Like any craft, there is no easy way to learn this other than experience.<p>Whenever I&#x27;m advising rising data analysts&#x2F;scientists, I tell them to understand three areas of background knowledge that will multiply their ability to pull out an insight. They&#x27;ll help them connect disparate ideas together.<p>Stats is easy but connecting ideas is hard. That&#x27;s where the real magic happens. Plus, computers have a hard time automating this, for now.<p>1) Product Knowledge - How well do you know the product? This is easy for a simple app, but for large enterprise apps there are many features to keep track of. If you don&#x27;t know the full context of your product, how could you frame your analysis in a larger picture?<p>2) Stakeholder Empathy - Whether you like it or not, as a data person you&#x27;re advancing a business cause&#x2F;mission. This means you need to fully understand where the business has been and where it is going. The basic question is - what are your stakeholders priorities? Why do they matter?<p>3) Customer Empathy - Arguable the most important of them all, how well do you know the customer? I encourage data scientists to get away from the computer and in front of the customer. Hear user research calls and ask questions. Drive as a Lyft driver, deliver food [1], etc.<p>Unfortunately these three areas are soft skills and you won&#x27;t know you&#x27;ve improved until you find yourself reciting a fact. Usually you&#x27;ll think &quot;well duh, because the customer thinks this.&quot; It&#x27;ll seem obvious, but it is only because you went through the trenches to learn that fact.<p>[1] Tony Xu (DoorDash) delivering pizzas to understand product and customer - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.listennotes.com&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;how-i-built-this&#x2F;doordash-tony-xu-0y-HQASURB3&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.listennotes.com&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;how-i-built-this&#x2F;doorda...</a>')
