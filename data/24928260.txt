There was plenty of it by western countries during WWII and the Cold War.<p>It&#x27;s that this propaganda contained false information on both the source and the details that is problematic. Black propaganda is wrong. We don&#x27;t need it to win, and when it is exposed it undermines our credibility, which undermines our white propaganda and efforts to contrast our values with the values of our adversaries.<p>I take a similar stand with politicians. I&#x27;d rather vote for an honest person that I disagree with on a majority of issues than a dishonest one that shares my political party. For especially honest politicians I go out of my way to vote for them. Trust in government is paramount. The rest breeds corruption and eventual democratic decline.')
