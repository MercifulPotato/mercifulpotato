A lot of people go by the &quot;not pink&quot; or &quot;clear juices&quot; rules of thumb, which work well enough for typical grocery store &#x27;industrial&#x27; packaged meat, but may not be good enough for more &#x27;uncontrolled&#x27; meat.<p>A 6.5- to 7.0-log_10 reduction in pathogens (salmonella) is generally hit at 158F&#x2F;70C (with beef) where there is &#x27;instantaneous&#x27; destruction of the pathogen(s), but lower temperatures can also be reached as long as they are held for longer periods of time, e.g., 140F&#x2F;60C for 12 minutes. Poultry has slightly different numbers, also dependent on the fat content, but a similar principal of a time&#x2F;temperature &#x27;curve&#x27;. Ditto for fish†, pork, etc.<p>If you mess up the temperature you can have a really bad day.<p>† And the type of fish can mean different temperatures. The fat content of wild versus farmed salmon means few degrees&#x27; difference could result in a dry versus juicy result:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1WSGjYMHF60" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1WSGjYMHF60</a>')
