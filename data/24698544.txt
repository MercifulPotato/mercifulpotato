I’m not saying it can&#x27;t be caused by a lingering infection or the result of an infection, I’m just saying it’s not like “scarring” or “breathlessness” — it’s hugely subjective. IMO the fact there’s no correlation to disease severity points more towards this being a red herring.<p>[edit] To downvoters, consider that the placebo effect is <i>incredibly</i> strong, much stronger than you give it credit for most likely, and has gotten stronger over time as our faith in medicine has.<p>A 2014 study showed that placebo was 50% as effective as real migraine medication in treating pain after migraines [1].<p>Similarly for the nocebo effect. A study showed that 20% of people getting placebo drugs in a clinical trial <i>developed side-effects</i>. The nocebo effect may be even stronger than placebo. [2,3].<p>I&#x27;m not minimizing COVID and I&#x27;m not saying these people are &quot;making it up.&quot; I&#x27;m saying, humans aren&#x27;t computers, and human viruses aren&#x27;t computer viruses. It&#x27;s not a case of X happens to you and the result is deterministically Y. There&#x27;s a lot more to your subjective experience. Generally the more strongly you believe in a potential range of outcomes, the more likely you are to, basically, get them. COVID anxiety is huge, and some of these &quot;long-haulers&quot; symptoms could easily be nocebo.<p>If this long-haul syndrome really is nocebo, it opens up potential avenues for treatment.<p>We need to keep an open mind.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.health.harvard.edu&#x2F;mental-health&#x2F;the-power-of-the-placebo-effect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.health.harvard.edu&#x2F;mental-health&#x2F;the-power-of-th...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.health.harvard.edu&#x2F;newsletter_article&#x2F;The_nocebo_response" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.health.harvard.edu&#x2F;newsletter_article&#x2F;The_nocebo...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4804316&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4804316&#x2F;</a>')
