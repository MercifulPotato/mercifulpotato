For the sake of argument, let&#x27;s say they mixed up the ratio in their split filing. Instead of doing a reverse split, they do a forward split, replacing each share of old stock (10¢) with 350 shares of new stock (about one third of a cent, each). The shares trade at a somewhat high volume, because each share is worth a fraction of a cent.<p>Simpson notices that, after a 350:1 reverse split, Global Links ought to have about 1M shares outstanding.¹ He also notices that the current trading price is a fraction of a cent. Small enough to make this a worthwhile experiment. He acquires about 1.2M shares without moving the price too much. He also doesn&#x27;t question how this was possible to happen within a day or two.<p>After the split, Global Links has some 100B shares outstanding. Simpson&#x27;s position of 1.2M is less than one percent of that, so the shares continue trading as before.<p>¹ He might be combining multiple sources of information here. Perhaps his brokerage doesn&#x27;t show reference data, so he combines the price he sees in his brokerage&#x27;s app with reference data from Yahoo!finance or something.')
