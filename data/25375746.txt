Thanks for sharing!<p>It&#x27;s interesting to me that the author feels that things were great with Uber in 2016 pre-Trump and that Trump&#x27;s election was the catalyst for the negative sentiment.  Susan Fowler&#x27;s famous post was early 2017, and maybe _posting_ it was catalyzed by the issues surrounding Trump, but clearly the serious cultural problems she described at Uber had been going on for some time before that.<p>I&#x27;m trying to figure out what to make about a lot of these mis-steps.  On the one hand, many of them seem preventable: you could imagine identifying ahead of time that load time and binary size might be risks for the new app and scale-testing these very early in the process to de-risk it.  You could imagine testing the new app long enough (and widely enough) to discover the location issues (drivers going to the wrong blocks, etc.).  You could imagine foreseeing users being upset about suddenly needing their location data when they&#x27;re not using the app.  Obviously hindsight is 20&#x2F;20, but is there also a pattern (that we see all the time, especially in Silicon Valley it seems) of not really thinking through the consequences of a lot of decisions, especially where things like user privacy are concerned?')
