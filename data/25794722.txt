Item(by='Infinitesimus', descendants=None, kids=[25807563], score=None, time=1610737192, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25794370, text='Thanks for the extra context - I should have been more clear. CPI does capture OER and rental costs as you show.<p>I get that mortgage costs and the like aren&#x27;t considered as consumption ( rightly so ) but that makes the measure inaccurate when assessing prices people pay to live day to day. Rental prices are generally a more applicable indicator for most of the population as the BLS says but the rising costs of houses and mortgage costs by extension imo should be captures because it signals how money is flowing.<p>Is there another metric perhaps that captures both consumption costs and housing beyond rent&#x2F;rent equivalents?')
