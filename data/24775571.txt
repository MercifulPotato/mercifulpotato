It also enjoys power. I agree that Turkey&#x27;s genocide against Armenians is evil. It&#x27;s taken too long to acknowledge that. I&#x27;m not too clear on the Saudi Arabia accusation, but I think you&#x27;re referencing Yemen.<p>Still, imagine you&#x27;re German and you&#x27;ve received an education, growing up, completely condemning the evil that the WWII Nazis committed against the Jewish people. Imagine that to refute the history of that evil is, in fact, a crime â€” a crime of speech and ideology. Then imagine learning that the Jewish state made available by partitioning land has grown, considerably, since its initial allocation post-WWII. Imagine learning that the growth exactly resembles of actions of WWII Nazis against Jews, only now by Zionist Jews against Palestinians.<p>Israel has all the makings of a great country. In my mind, it has succeeded thoroughly. Despite my above criticism, I wish it success. I hope it makes humanitarian strides to acknowledge its wrongdoing and make reparations. I&#x27;d only point out that its specific actions against Palestinians did happen and continue to happen today and it is an evil. If you&#x27;re German, you might feel especially emotional about it, given the shared history.')
