For example, I&#x27;m glad they put computer architecture in the first year, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any reason to go through the entire set of Carnegie Mellon lessons on computer architecture for a computer science curriculum.<p>I think a more subtle approach of introducing the basics, say, for computer architecture, a simplified CPU model of an arithmetic logic unit, registers, and flags, so you have a feel of what your programs are running on. Then get back to programming concepts. Go deeper into computer architecture later.<p>If you really want a curriculum, you have to take the broad topics, present the introductory lectures, then create sections for more specialized topics with links to lectures that go into more depth, and maybe add prerequisites to those sections.<p>update for clarity.')
