I mostly blame Red Hat for the very poor delivery, but tech people are not immune to the tendency for dramatizing, misrepresenting, and polarizing.  Please stop spreading this.  CentOS is <i>NOT</i> dead.  CentOS is changing, but not all that much (yes, really).<p>I&#x27;ll do my best to answer questions here, but I&#x27;m also going to rush a blog post to try and get it out ASAP that corrects a lot of this.<p>Edit:  Here&#x27;s the blog post.  Excuse typos and other things, I rushed this ;-)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedomben.medium.com&#x2F;centos-is-not-dead-please-stop-saying-it-is-at-least-until-you-read-this-4b26b5c44877?sk=e500c2f16403d634ff8a4ea17d705252" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedomben.medium.com&#x2F;centos-is-not-dead-please-stop...</a>')
