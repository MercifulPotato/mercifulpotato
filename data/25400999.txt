I mostly blame Red Hat for the very poor delivery, but tech people are not immune to the tendency for dramatizing, misrepresenting, and polarizing.  Please stop spreading this.  CentOS is <i>NOT</i> dead.  CentOS is changing, but not all that much (yes, really).<p>I&#x27;ll do my best to answer questions here, but I&#x27;m also going to rush a blog post to try and get it out ASAP that corrects a lot of this.')
