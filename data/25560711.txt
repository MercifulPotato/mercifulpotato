Fertility rates being very high is only a problem is developing nations, where infrastructure and sanitation can&#x27;t support the rapidly growing population.<p>Look at a developed economy. Look at Japan. Their economy has been struggling for almost three decades, their central bank struggles to create a healthy level of inflation (it is historically too low), frighteningly large swathes of their population between the ages of 18 and 35 have little interest, time, or money for dating, marriage, and having children. Their fertility rate is well below replacement rate. And all of these things are interconnected (too expensive to have kids = no kids = fewer workers = fewer taxpayers and contracting economy etc).<p>Modern economies are still largely a Ponzi scheme that relies in there being more younger people than older. Technology is changing this to a small degree, but not enough and not fast enough.<p>If the US doesn&#x27;t want a Lost Decade of their own, we&#x27;re going to need to look hard at how we can keep our fertility rate at least at replacement.<p>Immigration is a potential solution but relies on being able to import the labor at all skill levels, and unfortunately at the higher end, I worry the US&#x27;s monopoly on foreign university students is beginning to wane too.')
