I&#x27;m not going to spend days debugging a prototype made of spaghetti, it&#x27;ll have served its purpose and I&#x27;ll start over with optimization in mind and refine the idea. If you wanted a programming language that would be a real win for game development you&#x27;d choose something that had the option of no type or memory safety and no boilerplate for prototyping with an option to turn those options on for when you actually integrate the feature with the rest of the code.')
