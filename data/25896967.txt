Like I said, I think that written description is simply wrong.  It wouldn&#x27;t be the first time a journalist misreported the details of some technology, eh?<p>I just watched the video again with the playback speed at 1&#x2F;4 (thanks Youtube!) and at 0:46 ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;z-h56N_A3rY?t=45" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;z-h56N_A3rY?t=45</a> ) when the car hits the bumper I can clearly see the driver lean forward due to inertia.  Of course you still need to wear a seatbelt, this isn&#x27;t magic.  (You know on Star Trek how the Klingon disruptors make a person disintegrate, clothes and all, yeah?  How does the disintegration process know to stop at the floor?  What is it about the interface between boots and floor which stops the disintegration?  Could you use that to make disintegration-proof armour?)  I get what you&#x27;re saying.  I do.<p>The point is not that the driver magically didn&#x27;t feel inertia (he did, and you can clearly see it in the video) it&#x27;s that the car didn&#x27;t crumple.  The kinetic energy given up by the stopping car went into the flywheel rather than into violent deformation of the physical structure of the car.  I.e. it works (if it works at all, I don&#x27;t deny that it <i>might</i> be a hoax) like a &quot;crumple zone&quot; without the crumple:<p>&gt; Crumple zones are designed to increase the time over which the total force from the change in momentum is applied to an occupant ...<p>~ <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crumple_zone" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crumple_zone</a>')
