Item(by='kashyapc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609169216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25541964, text='<i>Behave—The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst</i>, by Robert Sapolsky.<p>I spent a good four months immersing myself in this magnum opus. It&#x27;s a 720-page tome, and has an &quot;avalanche of information&quot;, as Sapolsky himself calls it.  As ever, the patient reader gets handsomely rewarded.<p>The narrative structure of the book is extremely appealing—Sapolsky starts off by examining a behaviour in the present moment and gradually zooms out. Starting with exploring what happened one second before the said behaviour occurred—the realm of neurobiology[+].  Then slightly zooms back to the prior seconds to minutes, and then back to what happened hours to days before—territory of hormones and endocrinology[+].  Followed by what events from days to months that shaped the behaviour; adolescence, and all the way back to evolutionary factors from a millennia ago.<p>[+] The appendices in the book contain a helpful primers on neuroscience,  endocrinology, and protein basics.  <i>Don&#x27;t</i> skip them!<p><pre><code>            • • •\n</code></pre>\nThe most important idea in the book: &quot;when you explain a behaviour with one of the various disciplines [biology, psychology, culture, et al], you are implicitly invoking all the disciplines [...] A &#x27;neurobiological&#x27; or &#x27;genetic&#x27; or &#x27;developmental&#x27; explanation for a behaviour is just a shorthand for temporarily approaching the whole multifactorial arc from a particular perspective.&quot;<p>Six hundred pages later, Sapolsky restates the central thesis: &quot;the biology of human behaviours that interest us, in all cases, is &quot;multifactorial&quot;.  What does it mean?  There&#x27;s a <i>dizzying</i> array of factors that influence our behaviour; too many enumerate, but a quick few: blood glucose levels; the socio-economic status of your family of birth; sleep quality and quantity; prenatal environment; stress and glucocorticoid [a key stress-signaller] levels; if you live in an individualist or a collectivist culture, and so on.<p><pre><code>            • • •\n</code></pre>\nAs I noted in an earlier HN thread[1], my only quibble—Sapolsky quotes the infamous &quot;priming&quot; research by Daniel Kahneman and others.  As some here already know, Kahneman has admitted[2] elsewhere that he &quot;placed too much faith in underpowered studies&quot; when a researcher failed to replicate the said priming-related experiments.<p>My theory for forgiving this: Kahneman&#x27;s admission (Feb 2017) and the public release of Behave (May 2017) were way too close for Sapolsky to have noticed it in time.  Otherwise, I bet he would&#x27;ve put in a word of caution.  On what basis do I make this bet?  Elsewhere in the book, Sapolsky cautions when studies did not replicate.<p><pre><code>            • • •\n</code></pre>\nAn icing on the cake (for me): Saposky speaks positively of virtue ethics-based philosophy (e.g. Stoicism—he doesn&#x27;t name this, but speaks of &quot;virtue ethics&quot; in general).  Not because of his personal beliefs, but based on experimental evidence.  I was naturally delighted, because I spent quite some time studying virtue ethics-based philosophy in the last couple of years.  So reading the experimental evidence on how virtue ethics &quot;sneaks through the back door&quot; to facilitate doing the harder thing, when it&#x27;s the right thing to do, was a sweet harmonic note.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25148588" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25148588</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retractionwatch.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;20&#x2F;placed-much-faith-underpowered-studies-nobel-prize-winner-admits-mistakes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retractionwatch.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;20&#x2F;placed-much-faith-und...</a>')
