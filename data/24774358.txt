I switched in the height of the northern summer -  so no need for a wetsuit when I started, water was up to 26degC. As the weather has worsened though, the water temperature has gradually declined and I&#x27;ve just kept swimming. Down thorugh 22, 20, 18, 16 and on to 13.8 the other day.<p>I&#x27;m finally going to put my wetsuit on, as the other day was VERY intense, but the benefits of being in cold water are incredible. I am an absolute convert. The high is comparable to certain A class drugs, it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve done in years, and you get to stay fit as well.')
