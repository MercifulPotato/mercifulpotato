They have a Bluetooth module you can install to get data to other devices (phone, etc).<p>The programs Aviron offers look cool, but I would never trade out a working rower for a new one just for the workout programs.  Families like mine are probably part your target market, but I suspect our current rower will last 10+ years.  If you could connect to existing rowing machines and have the programs display on a laptop or tablet, we would definitely give it a serious look!')
