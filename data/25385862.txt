It&#x27;s also newsfeeds that pull in stuff you didn&#x27;t specifically express an interest in. It starts with showing you stuff your friends merely liked or commented on, but didn&#x27;t repost. Then it&#x27;s things that they merely looked at, and groups that overlap with ones you&#x27;re already in. Then posts that share some arbitrary characteristic with those you&#x27;ve read or liked. And so on. If I were only shown things that my friends actually posted, I&#x27;d be mostly OK with ranking them except that the ranking seems unstable and ends up reshuffling everything all the time. Not pulling in random crap would also slow or reduce the spread of disinformation. It would still exist, certainly, but without being able to exploit the Facebook equivalent of SEO it might not have quite the toxic effects that it does currently.<p>Fortunately, I know a trick that makes my feed better behaved in all of these ways. Some day they&#x27;re going to kill it (they briefly did break it once already due to sheer incompetence) and then Facebook will become unusable again.')
