Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603472716, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24867128, text='&gt; I&#x27;m reasonably sure that it was a pottery class (or study) in which students&#x2F;study participants were asked to produce either the best piece they could think of or as many as possible. I think it was actually a study that I read about.<p>&gt; It might need some internet sleuthing to find it. I&#x27;ll try later.<p>The earliest reference I am aware of is the 1985 book &quot;Art and Fear&quot;, at the beginning of the section on perfection:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books?id=yGf6CAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;vq=ceramics&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books?id=yGf6CAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;vq=c...</a><p>The book doesn&#x27;t have footnotes or a bibliography, unfortunately.<p>I think people take away only part of the lesson from this anecdote, and miss the implication that, since getting an &quot;A&quot; was trivial for the &quot;grade by quantity&quot; group, students were not just encouraged to practice, but were also free to experiment without fear of failure (after all, they could easily make up any shortfall by firing a few unworked lumps of clay to get to 50 lbs).<p>But I wish we had data on the number of students, distribution of grades, number of pieces each student made, etc. because it should be obvious that we can&#x27;t extrapolate too much from the fact that some data points on the &quot;high quality&quot; end of the distribution were all from one group. The three best? Ten best? The best half? What was the size of the class anyway? <i>Did</i> anyone try to game the system by just firing 50 one-pound lumps?<p>In some sense, this is a bit like evaluating software based on SLOC, and we all know how that ends up.<p>It should also be obvious that none of the students had any particular incentive to explore the &quot;delicate&quot; end of the possible artistic design space, although at least the &quot;quantity&quot; group wasn&#x27;t penalized for doing so. So, if no students cottoned on to the &quot;50 1-pound lumps&quot; hack, I would expect to see coffee mugs rather than teacups in their work.')
