(...) Startup companies spun out of IV, including Kymeta, Echodyne, and TerraPower, have developed commercial products from IV&#x27;s inventions. Through its Global Good unit, which Myhrvold founded in collaboration with Bill Gates, IV has also invented and produced commercial products, such as improved vaccine coolers and milking cans, aimed at low-income markets in Africa and Asia.<p>The company&#x27;s business practices have caused controversy, however, with some deprecating the firm as a patent troll. Myhrvold has publicly defended his firm&#x27;s practices, arguing that they foster innovation by serving as a marketplace for intellectual property. He has noted that many of the largest companies in Silicon Valley, including Google, Apple, and Facebook, have also bought large patent portfolios and used litigation to protect them, but he has criticized them as focusing too much on creating &quot;tools or toys for rich people.&quot;<p>Myhrvold is vice chairman of TerraPower, a spin-out of Intellectual Ventures that is developing a new kind of nuclear reactor, known as a traveling-wave reactor, that is designed to be safer, cheaper, and cleaner than current nuclear power plants.')
