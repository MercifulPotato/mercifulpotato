Do you anticipate typing private info, backspacing, then replacing it with some bland query about switching internet plans? The only time I might have minded true real-time chat was in grade school talking to girls I fancied, but other than that, it makes a lot of sense. Saves time for the support agent and if they get a computer illiterate customer typing at 1 WPM who doesn&#x27;t know to use enter to send, they can at least try to help.<p>Now, if it were a normal web form, I&#x27;d feel differently, but if I&#x27;ve opened a support chat session, it&#x27;s because I want to send the things I type to support.')
