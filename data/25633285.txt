It took 185+ years to eradicate smallpox (mostly from a big WHO push in the 60s&#x2F;70s). It&#x27;s still not possible to eradicate Polio. Even with a massive push, it&#x27;s not like a vaccine will make this go away.<p>We have a lot of information now about how to treat and not treat this virus. A bunch of early deaths were due to overuse of high pressure ventilators and the Governess of NY and Michigan putting sick elderly people with healthy elderly people in nursing homes without adequate isolation (most had 2 or more people per room) killed a lot of people in the first three months. We overreacted to the virus, like a social auto-immune response.<p>We also know the fatalities are 95% over 55. This virus has mostly reduced our life expectancy. By 5 years? 1 year? That&#x27;s difficult to determine at this point. Everyone is going on about &quot;long covid&quot; now, but if you actually read the papers, the whole things starts to break down to a couple of case studies of 40~50 people each. There may be long term effects for heavily exposed people (health care workers) and the elderly, but the &quot;long covid&quot; narrative is another one if abuse and fear; not grounded in hard science and accurate risk analysis.<p>For things to go back to normal, the vaccine is not the solution. The solution is to stop spreading constant fear. The Great Barrington deceleration has been shunned and dismissed by all major media outlets, yet it&#x27;s signed by many doctors, academics and professionals and it makes a lot of sense.<p>Humanity has a new virus and we need to learn to live with that. The countries who have avoided it can keep shut down, but at some point it&#x27;s no longer going to be feasible to do so.')
