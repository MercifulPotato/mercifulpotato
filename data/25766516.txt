It&#x27;s an important distinction because even if you assume any given UFO sighting was not just a hallucination or misinterpretation but something real and unprecedented, assuming it&#x27;s aliens from space is still a wild leap. A leap people tend to make because we&#x27;re so primed to think &quot;aliens&quot; when we hear &quot;UFO&quot;.')
