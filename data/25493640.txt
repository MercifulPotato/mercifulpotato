Golfing notes:<p>• Your `win` variable is unnecessary: window is approximately the global object (look into globalThis for the subtleties of how window isn’t <i>quite</i> the global object), so you can drop your “win.” every time, e.g. win.c.removeChild(b) can be just c.removeChild(b).<p>• parent.appendChild(child) → parent.append(child) and parent.removeChild(child) → child.remove(), using newer, shorter DOM methods.<p>• Skip quotes on attribute values, and trailing slashes are 100% superfluous in HTML (they’re explicitly ignored, as an XHTML compatibility mechanism; I reckon they’re actually a slightly bad thing rather than harmless).')
