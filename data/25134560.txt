And they charge fast enough that it&#x27;s not terribly dissimilar from hitting the gas station, which currently is perhaps a 10 minute affair for gas.  Bumping that to ~20min isn&#x27;t a dealbreaker.  It&#x27;s feasible, if a little bit annoying, to have a refueling story for them that&#x27;s similar to that of gas cars.<p>I think this idea of electrics desperately needing to charge every time they&#x27;re parked - it&#x27;s not <i>wrong</i>, but it&#x27;s getting pretty close to being an anachronism, and I expect it actually will be on in 5ish years, certainly 10.')
