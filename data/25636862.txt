It’s a cluster of disparate standards, and it’s overwhelming. I’m sure it’s doable if you have the time to invest, but it’s not straightforward if you’ve never done it before.<p>Matrix is pretty straightforward on the server side of things, but the client UX is invariably mediocre. Vector—the official client—exemplifies everything that is wrong with Electron apps. Slow, clunky, poor UI, poor platform integration. With the default home server, it can take seconds for a message to go through. At least it’s far more customizable than Slack; it has an option for everything, which, as a power user, I quite like.<p>I haven’t tried Mattermost, but it looks like some of the important features aren’t FOSS, at which point it’s just another Slack as far as I’m concerned. I’ll gladly pay for support, but for SSO? Meh, might as well stick with Slack; at least everyone and their dog knows how to use it. (This is, of course, an opinion that stems partially from ignorance; I haven’t actually tried Mattermost, and if I do, I might fall in love with it. But my time is limited, and I can only evaluate so many products in a day.)<p>Not that Slack is much better here: their threading system has so many UI&#x2F;UX issues. Ever had a thread with hundreds of messages? For your own sanity, I hope you haven’t. Ever tried to send an image to a thread from iOS? It’s possible, but only by pasting the image into the text field; the normal attachment button isn’t available, and Share buttons in other apps can’t send to threads. And, of course, the recent uptime issues.')
