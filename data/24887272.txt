Exempting unique IP addresses becomes annoying, but if needed possible.<p>It also cuts down on the other side of the house of security related incidents, which, if your company offers a product interested by people in that state, or, has news that can be taken in a dim light, prevents ddos and other annoying things.<p>Not perfect, but one reason why there&#x27;s &#x27;over compliance&#x27;.<p>&gt; It does not speak well of the United States justice system if someone could be prosecuted for failure to block Iranian IPs. If this were required, the law should be clear. Otherwise, the US citizens deserve not to be in fear of prosecution.<p>Cheap insurance, especially if you have no intentions of doing business from there.')
