Right now, I&#x27;m getting way more bang for my buck. (faster cpu, faster gpu, normal priced ram+storage)<p>With apple silicon, I hope they release a decent &#x27;mac pro&#x27; or something that is good enough for me. Prices won&#x27;t go down obviously, so here&#x27;s hoping we can at least install third-party ram + storage.')
