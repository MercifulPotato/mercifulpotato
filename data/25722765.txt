For anyone whose development environment is appropriate for its use, I honestly cannot recommend it highly enough. I generally can only use it when I&#x27;m running the full &quot;Professional&quot; license version, however.<p>This uses SSH and SCP to automatically deploy the code to the remote environment and run it with the interpreter on that machine, rather than your own local laptop&#x2F;desktop. One advantage is that it does not require any special software to be installed on the remote server. VS Code&#x27;s solution requires a pretty hefty installation consisting of basically an entire copy of VSCode onto the remote server.<p>The downside of JetBrain&#x27;s approach... I believe that it requires a local copy of the files in order to perform the &quot;LSP&quot;-like syntax error highlighting &#x2F; suggestion functionality that JetBrains software is so lauded for. This could be difficult&#x2F;inconvenient if your codebase is particularly enormous, or if you aren&#x27;t allowed to mirror it locally.<p>However, given the amount of support that JetBrains has for this kind of setup, I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked to see an additional future option for something more in the style of &quot;VS Code Remote Development&quot;<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetbrains.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;pycharm&#x2F;configuring-remote-interpreters-via-ssh.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetbrains.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;pycharm&#x2F;configuring-remote-in...</a>')
