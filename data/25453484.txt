Everyone who learns how to program doesn&#x27;t need to A.) be god&#x27;s gift to the science of computing and B.) have the same level of understanding&#x2F;fluency in what they&#x27;re doing.<p>It&#x27;s like saying the only way to teach <i>any</i> amount of a language is to require 6 months of total immersion. There is value in someone taking on year of a language and learning a few phrases, and moving on. Ultimately, people have <i>practical</i> and <i>immediate</i> concerns, like getting paid and putting food on the table. We aren&#x27;t all programming for the same reasons, and sometimes getting the job done is all people have time <i>or even the inclination</i> to do. And we shouldn&#x27;t judge them for that.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that he is entirely wrong, but reading things that sound like proselytizing just make me sad. There is so much room to educate and come to mutual understandings. Some people might think they&#x27;ve found a better route or a deeper understanding, but treating the rest like idiots is the best way to make sure they <i>never</i> get your message.')
