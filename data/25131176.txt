This seems like a different situation than is being described with using iron oxide as a sort of &quot;battery&quot;, that will have to later be recharged (reduced away from iron oxide).  Thus it seems more like a mechanism for utilizing previously stored energy than as a readily available energy source waiting for exploitation.')
