I was hired on October 2007 as a designer.  They had plenty of designers.  After 3 months of doing very little work I was reassigned to a developer position and told to figure it out.  I figured it out because I wanted to remain employed so that I could continue to pay my rent and feed my children.<p>In hindsight this experience has proven problematic.  Many people who perform front-end development never seem to figure it out.  They are dependent upon a collection of tools to do large portions of their job for them.  This is incredibly frustrating because it exposes a very extreme and immediate sense of dependency that quickly leads to insecurity, which is a polite way of saying hand-holding possibly infantile.  That is a wildly different perspective that often results in friction and sometimes hostility.')
