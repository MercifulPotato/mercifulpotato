At the same time, if team wanted to go full remote, or cowork we&#x27;d support that. Sort of like how Apple used to take over buildings for a project.<p>Another idea i had about this was we could also consider RE investment. If we had the cash and the investment made sense, we&#x27;d actually buy the floor or whatever, and once our project no longer needed it, we&#x27;d rent. I like the idea that overtime the business converts some of its cash into RE, that can act as a buffer for the rest of our income.')
