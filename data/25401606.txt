At first we called it Cambridge Seed. But that name never saw the light of day, because by the time we announced it a few days later, we&#x27;d changed the name to Y Combinator. We realized early on that what we were doing could be national in scope and we didn&#x27;t want a name that tied us to one place.</i><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;ycstart.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;ycstart.html</a><p>Why did you choose the name “Y Combinator?”<p><i>The Y combinator is one of the coolest ideas in computer science.

But I&#x27;m super short of sleep and can&#x27;t be arsed to go digging for more explanations&#x2F;citations for why it got the name it got as random crap to do on a Saturday afternoon while failing to be productive due to the aforementioned lack of sleep.')
