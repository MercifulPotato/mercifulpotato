I have a 15hp motor kicking around that dwarfs a Tesla motor in every way except output.  That kind of stuff is monumentally inefficient for any non-stationary use.<p>3yr and you&#x27;re done sounds about right for consumer battery degradation in hard use.  How long a battery lasts is basically a reflection of how nice you are to it in terms of charge and discharge cycles and how much reserve capacity you want to tote around.<p>We&#x27;ve got electric motors pretty much down and can build them for just about any use case but for a given longevity vs power output batteries are still pretty bulky for the output you get.')
