Bitcoin is insanely volatile. That&#x27;s not a sign of a stable investment. Gold is better, but not a lot, because like Bitcoin, it doesn&#x27;t represent intrinsic economic value, it only represents people&#x27;s trust in it, and that can change. Not as dramatically as Bitcoin, because gold is much more established, but in the end, it&#x27;s still just a shiny metal.<p>ETF and land represent real production value. Land most directly of course, and that&#x27;s about the most stable as you can get: even if literally the entire economy collapsed, at least you still have land you can farm.<p>ETFs are a bit indirect; to be more direct, you&#x27;d have to buy shares of the individual companies represented in them, but for most people that&#x27;s a lot of work. ETFs get you the same thing. Their composition might change, but only slowly and tied to a whole bunch of criteria. And in the end, they do represent the economic value of real companies that produce things.')
