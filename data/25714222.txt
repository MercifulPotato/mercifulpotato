In russia, all of the party&#x27;s officials are complicit stooges going along with the narrative that threy totally won by 92%, where as im the US even the VP is acknowledging his loss.<p>There are no markers or evidence of any kind. Nobody can even come up with plausible stories nevermind facts.<p>So should we really be making the comparison to two of the most obviously corrupt states on earth?
