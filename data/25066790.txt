I still have a MacBook Pro, but I barely use it any more as I&#x27;ve tried to limit the amount of time on a computer outside of working hours.<p>I use Linux Mint with Cinnamon and for the most part, there is a lot of similarity. I use Guake for my drop down terminal like I have with iTerm2 and I use Chrome as my browser just because I&#x27;ve never bothered to transfer my stuff to Firefox.<p>But I do miss Safari. I truly find it better and faster. I use Bitwarden for password management and it works for both.<p>But for the most part, they are the same experiences. The true miss is the hardware, the battery life and the keyboard comfort of the MacBook.<p>I&#x27;m on my MacBook now and I get 8 plus hours on a single charge, I can type comfortable on a couch for hours and the trackpad just works perfectly so I never yearn for a mouse.<p>For work I have a ThinkPad P52 and the Linux support is lacking. Poor Power management allows me to get maybe 3-4 hours of battery, the trackpad sucks and needs a hack to work after kernel 5.4.26 for some reason, sound works but not well and the Nvidia driver sucks (official) glitches all over the place and waking from sleep requires a log out and log in to fix artifacts.<p>But in all honestly, I&#x27;m not sure what I would miss of linux if I only had a MacBook again. There just isn&#x27;t anything I can do on Linux that I can&#x27;t do on Mac, but there is plenty I can&#x27;t do with Linux that I can with a Mac, simple things like airdrop and copy-paste sync with my iPhone, text messages on my laptop. I&#x27;m sure if I had an android I might regain some of those things, but it&#x27;s just all so seamless on Mac OOTB.<p>I use docker and an Ubuntu image when I need linux to test things. Brew gives me access to almost every linux app I can think of and there is just a better amount of top quality paid and free app on the Mac in comparison to Linux.<p>Anyway, not sure any of that helps, but that&#x27;s my 2 cents.')
