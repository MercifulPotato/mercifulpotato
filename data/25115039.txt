They&#x27;re an annoying and mostly useless.<p>I haven&#x27;t bothered to look in a long time, but the reviews I&#x27;ve seen are obviously bad. I can find menus on the restaurant&#x27;s real page. The locality views are worse than, say, Apple maps. There&#x27;s just no reason to use them.<p>Add in that they harm the livelihood of restaurants owned by people I like, and yeah, they&#x27;re another crap site that continues to be annoying by trying to get in between me and someone who wants to feed me.')
