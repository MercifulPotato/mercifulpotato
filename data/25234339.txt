We have it with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;icons8.com&#x2F;upscaler" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;icons8.com&#x2F;upscaler</a> ; it’s a bit of work and expense.<p>Additionally, you have to make it a paid service. Any ideas who could pay for that?

I&#x27;ve googled his hair situation so you don&#x27;t have to. He most probably has gray hair, dyed dark, then highlighted.<p>That&#x27;s a challenge huh! As a result, you can feel some of these guys manipulated hair color: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;bC6AxXO.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;bC6AxXO.jpg</a><p>Anyway, I had better luck with Angelina Jolie. Hairwise, her hair looks also toned, but our dataset has way more colored women: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;WmTzRAZ.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;WmTzRAZ.jpg</a><p><i>Spam bots have a new face</i><p>On the boring side, it’s probably not worth it. Generated photography is detectable. A trained eye could spot it; big social media have models trained to a lot it.<p>Scraping a real life dataset makes more sense to me. Moreover, there are tons of ready ones.<p>Instead, here are are some of the other uses invented by our customers <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;generated.photos&#x2F;use-cases" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;generated.photos&#x2F;use-cases</a>')
