But I&#x27;m still too ignorant of Urbit to be sure that it&#x27;s simply pretentious (and fundamentally unimportant except as a fundraiser), rather than a sincere attempt to further Yarvin&#x27;s political project. His political writing is manipulative, but I think at some level he genuinely means it, and it has influenced a lot of people. And while he plays the character of an outsider genius in a very annoying way, in reality he is clearly at least quite smart. I have no idea how Urbit is supposed to help bring about his neoreactionary utopia, but I worry that dismissing it out of hand might be too complacent. Some of the weirdness <i>could</i> be genuinely strategic, rather than purely the marketing arm of a scam&#x2F;hype-trap.')
