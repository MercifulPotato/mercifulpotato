How the hell do residents outside the cities stand up against that in any way but force.<p>By having a Constitution that protects a basic model of government and requires a supermajority of states to consent to changes.<p>People having unequal representation in the national legislature or Presidential elections doesn&#x27;t help that and isn&#x27;t useful too it (well, the general problem. It might help specifically against unwelcome government supported by large-population states, but only by magnifying the risk of such when supported by small population states.)<p>Urban&#x2F;rural isn&#x27;t really the divide the Senate&#x2F;EC works on.
