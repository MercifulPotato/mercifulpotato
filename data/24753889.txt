So with a solid state peltier device the 30 watt device sucks 1.5 watts of heat out of the fridge and dumps 31.5 watts into the heatsink (your room, eventually).  A pumped freon unit like the one in your kitchen would suck 300 watts of heat out of the fridge and dump 330 watts into your room.<p>Anyway the definition of a BTU can&#x27;t be more accurate than 1% for a bunch of boring thermodynamic reasons, but a good engineering estimate is one BTU is 1&#x2F;3 of a watt-hour.  So running your cooler will suck about 5 or so BTU out of the fridge every hour.<p>A BTU unit is very convenient as it changes the temp of one pound of water by one degree.  And to one sig fig a 20 oz soda bottle is about a pound.  So one bottle in an otherwise empty cooler should drop about 5 degrees per hour in your cooler.  Figure a &quot;few&quot; bottles means they&#x27;ll drop about one degree per hour.  Yeah its gonna take &quot;a couple hours&quot; as you state to cool it down.<p>A pumped freon fridge could cool your soda close to 200 times faster than your cooler.  That seems &quot;about right&quot; as a case of beer takes a couple hours to be drinkable.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if there are any residential &quot;convection fridges&quot; on the market.  I&#x27;m sure the moving parts fan would increase future sales figures.  Another interesting idea would be something like &quot;NEST&quot; thermostat to control the cooler temp while using as little power as possible.  Might make some interesting startup ideas.')
