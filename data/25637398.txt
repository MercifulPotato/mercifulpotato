Our customers are car dealers who had to close their showrooms and move their business online when the pandemic hit. Now we have thousands of customers who are selling online using Roadster: we host the consumer website, list vehicle details, quote up-front prices, gather your credit, and our dealers deliver new or used cars to your home. As the showrooms reopen, we are running on iPads and kiosks and bring the same modern experience into the store. Buyers save hours and dealers sell more cars with fewer sales agents.<p>Roadster is looking for full-stack and backend software engineers to join our team of 12 developers in a 120+ person company. We focus obsessively on both the consumer experience as well as building the most complete and accurate content and workflow for automotive transactions. If you love to ship product with a small friendly team, own features, and contribute to a successful growing business, we&#x27;d like to talk.<p>Our stack is built on Rails, VueJS, Elastic, Postgres and Redis. You have a CS degree and 2+ years of experience shipping quality web apps.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roadster.com&#x2F;jobs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roadster.com&#x2F;jobs</a> and email us at ellen.stevens@roadster.com to apply.')
