The respect is for the body of evidence not the interpretation of that evidence.  The way the coastlines of South American line up with Africa isn’t some words from on high, you can see it for yourself.  People still get wigged out by relativity let alone quantum mechanics weirdness while acknowledging how useful those models are.  The innate feelings that models are wrong rather than data isn’t religious any more than a babies understanding that dropped balls fall.<p>Even before language develops people internalize the idea of cause and effect being linked.  That’s the only assumption made by science everything else is observation and math.  As such observation can always beat any theory no matter how old.  It’s simply accepted that the most well known and perhaps most useful scientific law “F=MA” is wrong.  No breakaway groups holding up such a sacred tenet, just a quiet understanding that nope that’s not quite how the universe works.')
