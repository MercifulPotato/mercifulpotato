Over that time I&#x27;ve had multiple options grants and some have vested already. My employer recently offered a buy back for a portion of my vested options.<p>How do I find someone for professional advice on this? Someone familiar with startup options and shares for employees. I have questions like: How do my options affect my personal tax situation? Does accepting the buy back change anything? Should I just treat the buy back like capital gain?')
