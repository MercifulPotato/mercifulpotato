For example, even though the piano is a limited instrument (frequency wise) it&#x27;s perfectly possible for a violin player to practice &quot;against&quot; a piano. In the end, whatever the violinist plays is never going to be perfect.\nThere are basically 3strategies to cope with that: micro-adjustments (correcting), add vibrato (masking) and stop playing that note and move to another note.')
