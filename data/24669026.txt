Item(by='arcticbull', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601692423, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24668843, text='&gt; Crypto mining is unique because it is the first thing that requires no infrastructure.<p>That could not be more wrong. It requires piles of infrastructure: energy generation, transmission, cooling for miners, miners themselves, and so on.<p>&gt; The entire story that crypto is “taking away” is wrong when it is giving in more cases than not because its the only economical way to mine.<p>Literally if people stopped wasting a country of power, generating stations would go offline.<p>&gt; This goes hand in hand with the e-waste fallacy. The hardware doesn&#x27;t go obsolete if the power costs are low enough, and at the remote power source it is low enough. There is a robust trade of “obsolete” hardware from people that have higher power costs to people that have lower power costs.<p>Absolutely not a fallacy. People literally throw out old miners and replace them with new miners to get a leg up on their peers. This is the waste. You can&#x27;t pretend this away. 107 grams worth per transaction.')
