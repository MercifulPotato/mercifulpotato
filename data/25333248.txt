They&#x27;re part of a culture war that they helped create surrounding Mac vs PC, iOS vs Android.<p>Steve Jobs even created these types of wars in-house. (e.g. the new Mac team vs everybody else - see The Pirates of Silicon Valley) Business is war.<p>People choose sides and they must defend their choice out of pride. It&#x27;s like Ford vs Chevy.<p>Beyond that - Apple is very much against putting general computing freedom in the hands of users especially in iOS but also definitely in macOS. Lots of people hate a tyrant and don&#x27;t want to work with them and will try to convince people who don&#x27;t care about that to join them. And of course there are people who disagree.<p>So that&#x27;s basically where you get all the anti&#x2F;pro Apple argumentation.')
