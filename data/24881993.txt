The code is heavily commented, and hopefully somewhat readable. I think the main benefit I found was that it was trivial to snapshot states and replay as needed. That made debugging easier, and might have simplified something like a save&#x2F;reload feature. Although I didn’t go there for this toy project, I’d argue that testability might be another consideration.<p>More generally, I’ve seen over the years that global state tends to be painful in unforseen ways. At one point, I was considering a fork of putty to add support for tabs. It has a lot of global state, so I had to abandon that idea. If the same state had been wrapped up in a state struct and passed around, it’d have been easy.')
