When you have a bunch of likes, giving them away sounds like a good idea, but in reality it means a) reducing your own value (unfairly), and b) increasing someone else&#x27;s value (unfairly).<p>I personally have another solution, that I&#x27;ve never heard articulated, which I call &quot;The Enough Number&quot;. It&#x27;s a number you individually decide is enough for you, after which you will choose not to work any further (at least, not for money). This achieves a kind of <i>de facto</i> redistribution since, theoretically, someone else will step in to make the money the retiree is no longer making. Another way to put it is that it creates an artificial scarcity of competence, or it means that competence-for-hire <i>decays</i> over time in a way that is beneficial to society.<p>The only way for this to work, IMHO, is if you get some social status at Davos (free VIP entry for life? A medal?) for having a achieved Enough. Or maybe a publisher can arise, called &quot;Enough Press&quot; where such people can get a book deal.<p>FWIW my own Enough Number is $10M. This is still quite high but it reflects my upper-middle class sensibilities. This would be enough for a beautiful 1500 ft^2 house in Laguna Beach, a 30&#x27; wooden sailboat I partner on with a couple of neighbors, and I&#x27;d probably spend my time teaching neighborhood kids how to program and make things in a beautiful, sunny space filled with all kinds of very cool and dangerous components.<p>Politically, this helps focus me on the desired outcome, where the Earth is populated by people who routinely achieve Enough at 30, and spend most of their lives raising their kids, traveling, telling stories, eating good food, reading and writing. The really duty driven folk would find longer-term work at the EPA or the Justice Department or on space projects, etc. I would expect intellectuals to have the easiest time of it, because they could become adjunct professors. Celebrities and business people would struggle, I think, because the attention <i>is</i> the juice, and you can&#x27;t every really have Enough!')
