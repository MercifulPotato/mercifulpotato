Item(by='dane-pgp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611576097, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25898736, text='&gt; Email is centralized because <i>every time I send an email</i>, I&#x27;m doing a DNS lookup.<p>And <i>every time the Signal app connects to its centralized servers</i>, you&#x27;re doing a DNS lookup too.<p>&gt; By contrast, if I use a true P2P solution, I never need to do a DNS lookup. My chats in Signal can&#x27;t be disrupted by a change in MX records.<p>But Signal isn&#x27;t a true P2P solution.  As your linked description of the Signal Protocol states:<p>&quot;It does not provide anonymity preservation and requires servers for the relaying of messages and storing of public key material.&quot;<p>&gt; It&#x27;s like telling people that the WWW is decentralized as long as you use .onion addresses. That&#x27;s not true because as soon as you get off of public domains, you&#x27;re not on the WWW anymore.<p>If you&#x27;re using HTTP and HTML and hyperlinks and URIs, then you are using the WWW.  I suppose you could say that .onion addresses are the Dark Web, but saying they are not part of the web is pointless gatekeeping, like saying that HTTPS sites aren&#x27;t part of the web because some web clients don&#x27;t support TLS.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think you understand this topic.<p>That makes two of us then.<p>&gt; There are protocols with encryption schemes built into them. Email is not one of those.<p>Again, this is an unhelpful observation.  HTTP is a protocol that doesn&#x27;t have encryption schemes built into it, but we didn&#x27;t decide to throw it away in order to make the web secure.  Similarly we don&#x27;t need to throw away all existing email protocols and clients in order to have secure messaging.<p>&gt; That is in contrast to Signal Protocol[1], where all clients&#x27; E2EE are compatible with each other as long as they&#x27;re using the same protocol.<p>No, email is exactly the same as the Signal Protocol in that regard, since all email clients&#x27; E2EE are compatible with each other as long as they&#x27;re using the same (encryption) protocol.  The fact that an SMTP server doesn&#x27;t reject an email that isn&#x27;t PGP encrypted is a feature, not a bug.')
