This is the same model that I used as a kid. I think my Mom purchased mine second-hand and I obtained and used it sometime around 1986. The one I have now was purchased on eBay about 10 years ago for $1.75.<p>I would like to put the computer into a working display, perhaps just on a desk somewhere. What should I do to protect it so that it can run for as long as possible?<p>For starters, I suspect I should condition the power to protect it from spikes. Is a decent surge protector enough?<p>What are the things that are most likely to kill the machine if I set it up and use it regularly?')
