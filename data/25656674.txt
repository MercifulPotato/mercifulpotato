Seven American Nights is one of my favorite works of literature, it had a huge impact of me when I read it back in high school.  I still re-read it occasionally.  In my opinion it&#x27;s more approachable than Fifth Head Of Cerberus and even Book of the New Sun, it condenses all of Wolfe&#x27;s style and usual tricks into a single tight package.')
