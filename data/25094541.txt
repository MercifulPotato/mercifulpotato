It seems like the real problem is that there aren&#x27;t less-extreme responders, which this initiative is trying to fix. I want there to be <i>only</i> 911, and I want them to figure out who to send. People shouldn&#x27;t be second guessing who to call, they should call the &quot;I need help&quot; number.<p>I could see where having something like a 311 might make sense, but it should just redirect to the same call center too. It&#x27;d help remove hesitation on calling.')
