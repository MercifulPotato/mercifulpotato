This is a bit of a different tangent, but as someone who worked for one of the first Bitcoin &#x2F; Ethereum transaction tracing startups a few years back - I think many of the people pointing to &quot;privacy&quot; in digital currencies are misguided.  Right now, there are private companies already getting in on the consumer tx tracing business in crypto.  The real clever ones charge the government and exchanges as &quot;compliance&quot; providers.  Ironically, many of these new companies are directly related to or bankrolled by existing data-broker giants.')
