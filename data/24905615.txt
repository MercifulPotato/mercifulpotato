You could have limitless(?) FM receivers tuned to the same transmitter. Imagine adding 20 discreet powered speakers to your living room, being able to place them anywhere you like... a woofer in each corner, a full-range unit on the coffee table, two floor standers playing left and right channel respectively, and a bunch of smaller speakers dotted around the kitchen, bathroom etc. The only hassle would be &#x27;changing the channel&#x27;, but you would work that out I&#x27;m sure.
