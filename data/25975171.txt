In my city of Grand Rapids the DeVos funded Michigan Freedom Fund brought militias to my streets calling Whitmer a tyrant. They stood on stage with law enforcement making these screeds.<p>Fast forward, thousands and thousands of deaths later, a DeVos facility is going to be used for mass vaccination.<p>These people are seeking return on their investment and in some cases succeeding wildly. All it cost was thousands of deaths and insurrectionist plots to take over places like my state capitol building.<p>Later another plot to take over the national capitol building.<p>This has gone on too far. I literally had militants in my streets. I&#x27;m tired of it. I&#x27;m tired of families like the Mercers funding things like Cambridge Analytica, raising Trump to power. Then later funding things like Parler, which along with properties like thedonald dot win were apparently pivotal to a lot of the militant&#x27;s plans.<p>The people knee-jerk rushing to defend their incitement to political and biological as being free speech are just as tiresome as the gunmen are. And there are plenty of those on this site.')
