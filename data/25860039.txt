This is a real foreign policy conundrum since both parties are following relevant local regulations. It&#x27;s a asymmetry of values, and I was always curious if west would find solutions without adopting similar anti-values of Chinese censorship. But they&#x27;re converging more and more every year.<p>Up till now, Twitter labels foreign missions &#x2F; media as warning (though biasedly, i.e. CGTN is labelled state media where BBC is not). Regardless, wholesale deplatforming of a foreign mission is a line that even China has not crossed on weibo. Occasional posts will be removed or shadowbanned, but nothing on this scale. Let that sink in.<p>This is tantamount to private company influencing foreign policy, or further validation of Chinese censorship policy. Either way this reaffirms the Chinese model. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s going to be much rationalization and wank over differences between private and government control and muh liberal values. But IMO it&#x27;s perfunctory. When pro democracy activists and Merkel who grew up in east Germany commented recent deplatforms are going too far, maybe listen.')
