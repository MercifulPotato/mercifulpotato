I recommend looking into the data gathered by the Voter Integrity Fund (I linked a video from an individual presenting their findings) to have a place to start.<p>You picked the one high-profile case where an individual who <i>did not vote in a specific state</i> somehow had a signature verified ballot cast in their name.
