Build&#x2F;render times are a fraction with Hugo. But my main issue with Pelican was git submodules for plugins. With Hugo I just find a theme I like and then everything works.<p>For the record, I use Python daily and I’ve never written a line in Go. But with these static site generators, most people won’t ever need to look under the hood.<p>Edit: I see the main feature for Pelican 4.5 is namespace plugins, which should prevent some headaches.')
