Equivocating it with Washington is an absurd statement that lacks any historical context or nuance.<p>And again Trump the thinking that itâ€™s okay to protest and give support to Neo nazis by protesting with them, is a racist incredibly privileged stance to take. How do you watch this speech and come away thinking Trump is not racist here?<p>I will fully agree that tearing down a statue of Ulysses Grant is ridiculous. But Robert E Lee was a man who  was willing to lead a nation into a civil war for the right to own black people. And Trump thinks the people who want a statue to this man to commemorate him are very fine people?')
