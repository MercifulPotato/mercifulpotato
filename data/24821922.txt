People often ask leading questions with the Socratic approach. For the vast majority of folks, their experience with leading questions involves either:<p>1. A trap<p>2. Someone who <i>wants</i> to tell them something but insists on doing it via questions.<p>3. Both<p>An example of 2 above is when A (e.g. a manager) is upset at B (an employee), but won&#x27;t go into the details, but instead keeps asking &quot;You did X. What do you think person Y thinks of this?&quot; and a lot of &quot;Why&quot; questions. In practice, this has a high failure rate: B is often annoyed, and A failed to adequately express the problem.<p>I&#x27;ve been guilty of doing this, and I&#x27;ve often had people tell me after I ask a question &quot;It sounds like you have something on your mind. Why don&#x27;t you express it?&quot; Less polite people (including me) have said &quot;I&#x27;m interested in a dialogue, not a one-way set of questions. I have better things to do than answer questions. If you have something to say, I suggest you start saying it. &quot;<p>Communications and negotiations books universally tell you not to ask leading questions. Ask questions only for clarification or out of genuine curiosity. For everything else, express concerns openly - don&#x27;t ask questions.<p>Anyway - the point of this side note is: Often when people use the Socratic method, they use leading questions.')
