As the user has decided to disconnect their association, the data remains in the hands of the organization for analysis, look-a-like modeling, etc etc.<p>Scenario 1 -  Insta didn&#x27;t fully delete the associations according to policy and thus one of their processes is still linking the contacts.\nScenario 2 - Even with disconnected data associations, the ability of Insta to re-identify you was too easy and thus the contacts are showing up.<p>Either scenario shouldn&#x27;t be viable under GDPR.  If you&#x27;re in the US, you&#x27;re SOL (CCPA isn&#x27;t as robust as GDPR and focuses more on &#x27;data sale&#x27; and less on data privacy &amp; protection).')
