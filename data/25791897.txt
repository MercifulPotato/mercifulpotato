Item(by='wim', descendants=None, kids=[25792183], score=None, time=1610723919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25791639, text='Oh definitely, totally agree the status quo of duplicating logic is unnecessary.<p>And I realize this is using websockets, and that the payloads are tiny, but you can&#x27;t fight the speed of light ;), so it&#x27;s more of a latency concern (vs bandwidth). So in order to truly keep all the state and rendering with the server, even the smallest UI interaction would require a round-trip, and unless you&#x27;ll have end nodes all across the country, that seems like it will noticeable.<p>With some actions like &quot;search&quot;, &quot;save&quot; or &quot;reload&quot; I would expect a spinner and delay anyway, so that&#x27;s not a problem. But if opening a dropdown menu or adding an item to a list (like in the example) feels slow that might not be the best user experience. But perhaps it&#x27;s not a problem in practice, I haven&#x27;t seen too many examples.')
