Laying&#x2F;tapping undersea cables, for example; or shipping and escorting classified cargo and workers to set up bases and outposts<p>Think of it like: an Army Engineering Corps is just a bunch of skilled labor that can march around. A Naval Engineering Corps, meanwhile, is a bunch of skilled labor <i>and</i> a handy, defended floating base full of heavy equipment and building material.<p>The Navy hasn&#x27;t been about &quot;gun boats&quot; in the sense of &quot;boats that themselves project power&quot; for a while; but the Navy&#x27;s boats <i>do</i> still need to be &quot;gun boats&quot; in the sense of being fortresses that can defend themselves from a nation-state trying to claim the big pools of mobile resources they house.')
