So, you can make a lot of changes to the schema without any &quot;table migration&quot; or downtime. For example, switching from int to datetime to string, adding fields, removing fields, adding relationships between types, all of this stuff needs no &quot;DB work.&quot;<p>So, schema migrations are really easy with Dgraph, because it is a graph storage model, which allows for sparse properties to any data type (as opposed to the rigid table model enforced by SQL DBs).')
