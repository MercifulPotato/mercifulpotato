This is definitely not how you are supposed to operate.<p>If you need to ensure the sequantiality of a write followed by a read on S3, the idiomatic way is to enable versioning on your bucket, issue a write, and provide the version ID to whoever need to read after that write.<p>Not only will that transparently ensure that you will not read deprecated data, but it will even ensure that you actually read the result of that particular write, and not any consecutive write that could have happened in between.<p>This pattern is very easy to implement for sequential operations in a single function, like:<p><pre><code>    version = s3.put_object(...)\n    data = s3.get_object(version_id=version, ...)\n</code></pre>\nI agree that when you deal with various processes it can become messy.<p>In practice it never bothered me too much though. I prefer having explicit synchronization through versions, rather than having a blocking write waiting for all caches to be synchronized.<p>Also, this should only be necessary if you write to an already existing object. New keys will always trigger a cache invalidation from my understanding.')
