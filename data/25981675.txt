This creates very dense code - which can improve code understanding.<p>One thing I would recommend to put extra effort into macros, especially with these aspects:<p>One should write documentation what the macro expects and what it does. This way this has not to be inferred from reading the often quite complex code. Document the implemented syntax.<p>The macro should check the syntax of the forms. Provide error messages for rejected forms.')
