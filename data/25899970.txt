My cameras don&#x27;t function when it&#x27;s snowing or there&#x27;s snow in the ground. Or there&#x27;s snow banks around the road. My dash is lit with the &quot;some cameras are blocked&quot; 24&#x2F;7 for the whole winter time. And proximity readings are blinking those yellow &#x2F; red lights all the time from the right side as it thinks the snow bank next to the road is too close. Or the system thinks the camera is blocked because the light reflexes from the snow.<p>Seriously, if they can&#x27;t solve even simple problems, how are they going to solve something more complex? I&#x27;d be happy for even a implementation of a removal of these warnings when the system doesn&#x27;t understand what it&#x27;s doing, but I don&#x27;t think they know when it doesn&#x27;t function correctly.')
