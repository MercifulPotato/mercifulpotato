If you want to convince me about the graphics&#x2F;ML capabilities, compare it to a 3090 RTX using running Vulkan&#x2F;Cuda.<p>These are chips for their low end, entry level products. Why on earth would you think that would be an appropriate comparison? That&#x27;s absolutely absurd. They aren&#x27;t putting these in iMacs or Mac Pros.<p>They aren&#x27;t putting these in their high end MacBook Pros (they put it in their low end 13&quot; pro, which has always been only a minor step up from the Air - the higher end 13&quot; pro was more powerful, which they haven&#x27;t replaced yet.)<p>Apple&#x27;s &quot;faster than 98% of laptops sold&quot; line is obviously nonsense, like I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s technically correct - most laptops sold are cheap, low end things - but that&#x27;s not a particularly huge achievement.
