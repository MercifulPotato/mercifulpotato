To say nothing of charting &amp; reporting...<p>And at that point...the usefulness of plain-text-ness seems quite diminished. It becomes more like a data-entry format than anything else.<p>That said, I continue to use a plain-text accounting system because the alternatives aren&#x27;t really any better at this point and often come with their own issues.')
