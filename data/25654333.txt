Then as time went on, it turned out you could do advanced FP in Scala, despite its warts, with principled libraries like Cats and the Typelevel stack (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;typelevel.org&#x2F;cats&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;typelevel.org&#x2F;cats&#x2F;</a>). Companies could then use Scala as a &quot;better Java&quot; or squint-and-it&#x27;s-almost-Haskell. Or like you said they could just ditch Scala and use something less powerful but easier to learn and work with.')
