The companies that distribute anime in Japan never tried to sell into the US, they just assumed we weren&#x27;t interested.  Crunchyroll could then show up, say they had some customers willing to pay, and decided $LOW was better than $FREE.<p>It&#x27;s still this way; you can buy anime box sets in the US for an entire series that costs less than a single episode in Japan.  (They segment the markets by burning English subtitles into the actual video.  No self-respecting Japanese person would buy that, right?  Ironically region codes don&#x27;t work because Japan and the US are in the same region!  DRM fails again.)')
