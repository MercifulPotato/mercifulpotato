Item(by='Ntrails', descendants=None, kids=[25553656], score=None, time=1609091239, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25551460, text='Thoughts:<p>You&#x27;ve missed some obvious issues around balancing range,  special moves etc.  All of which are hard to price and balance.  Also, some things will not scale linearly, I expect.  A particularly strong mob might only be attackable by 8 melee mobs at once.  If it&#x27;s a 16x strength mob itself, then maybe it wins an even &quot;points&quot; battle.<p>How damage is applied is also interesting, for example.  Slow big hits vs fast small hits.  Obviously continuous damage is far easier to balance, but plays un-engagingly.<p>Finally, whilst you could argue that health and damage are interchangable.  How do you balance speed vs health?  What are reasonable distributions of numbers?  At what point do you create a fast ranged unit which can kite melee indefinitely etc.<p>basically even in a boring game, there&#x27;s a lot to think about - and your playerbase if you get one will jsut be better than your devs at finding power spikes&#x2F;discontinuities.')
