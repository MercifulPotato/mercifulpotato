I never hear anyone talk about physical directories. When people are talking about resolving sym links they talk about absolute versus relative paths. Seems like a good historical research topic to understand why the canonical usage is &quot;physical&quot; that no one uses versus relative&#x2F;absolute paths that are actually used.')
