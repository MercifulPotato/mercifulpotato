Not even “I’m sorry to hear this” or “sorry that you had this experience.” You just go straight into defence mode instead of genuinely wanting to understand the posters experience. Sorry, but you don’t get brownie points just for responding as the CEO, when it’s evident in this response and others that you don’t truly care about the people that you are serving. You are much more interested in managing the reputational risk of your business.')
