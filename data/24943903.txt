I almost walked into the side of a Cruise vehicle a few years back because the car did a double stop at a stop sign when I expected it to keep moving forward after the first stop.  There was no other traffic and I wasn’t distracted - but it just stopped in the middle of the crosswalk after starting to go forward.<p>Pedestrians assume certain things that are not necessarily true for self-driving vehicles, just as if I started acting erratically as a pedestrian it would really mess with cars.<p>All in all, though, I’d much rather take that failure case (At least when walking) over the human failure case of hitting me while turning.')
