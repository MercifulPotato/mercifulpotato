Although note the distinction between merely good ideas, versus ideas that you actually <i>know</i> are good, since the work of turning the former into the latter was what I assumed they were attributing to execution.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think his claim was just epistemological the way you&#x27;re interpreting it, and if it was, then I will withdraw since it&#x27;s not the idea I meant to engage with.<p>Fair enough; I&#x27;m not sure we even have a disagreement over facts so much as over how we&#x27;re categorizing things and the terminology therefor.<p>0: Eg, &quot;writing&quot; or &quot;general-purpose computers&quot; are almost <i>incalculably</i> valuable ideas, but they&#x27;re not worth anything in a supply-and-demand sense because everyone in the world already knows about them.')
