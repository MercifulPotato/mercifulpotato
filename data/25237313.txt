October self-inflicted deaths were up 600 year on year, with female suicides, about a third of the total, surging over 80%.&quot;<p>that&#x27;s an increase from 110 people in a month to 200 roughly,   if the 80% is of the rise in the percentage of the female suicides and not of the total amount, if I read right. Overall it doesn&#x27;t seem like suicide has exploded, just that Japan had a downwards trend that reversed back up to old levels.<p>Not very newsworthy at all, imo.')
