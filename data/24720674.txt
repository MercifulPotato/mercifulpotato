My other data point is Google, with 10,000s of engineers and a bespoke VCS. I&#x27;m not sure how things work in the middle (1000s of engineers), but I think you can solve that problem when you get to it, and Bazel has some features (look at the git_repository rule) to help you split a big repo if you need to.<p>You may also want a service like Artifactory for hosting binary blobs that feed into the build process.')
