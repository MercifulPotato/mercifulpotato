I use for a side project (electronic music blog) because I&#x27;m trying to log in from a new device&#x2F;country&#x2F;IP.<p>Alright then, I&#x27;ll try to recover the account with the security question or the recovery email.<p>Nope, Google doesn&#x27;t even let me enter the recovery process because of the same error. I can&#x27;t do anything because of a stupid flag on the account.<p>The best part? Everytime I&#x27;m trying to log into my account, I get a security alert email sent to my recovery email. I can say to Google that I don&#x27;t recognize the connexion (AccountDisavow) but I have NO OPTION to allow it. What&#x27;s the point of having a recovery email?<p>Can&#x27;t Google see that it&#x27;s the same IP trying to log in and trying to access the &quot;Review activity&quot; from the security alert email?<p>If any Google employee is reading this, I&#x27;d love some help!')
