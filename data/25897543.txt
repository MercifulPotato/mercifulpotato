You have the ability to enable or disable access to such services. By enabling location settings on your device, you are permitting applications on your device to use LBS through software, widgets or peripheral components you choose to download, add or attach to your wireless device or through web access, messaging capabilities or other means, and you are authorizing Verizon Wireless to collect, use and disclose your Location Information as appropriate to provide you with any location services that you enabled. To limit potential unauthorized access to your Location Information, Verizon Wireless offers various mechanisms and settings to manage access to location data. You should review each application’s settings to determine whether you want to enable LBS for that application.&quot; [1]<p>From 2018. The wording says &quot;as appropriate&quot; to provide you with services. I&#x27;m not seeing anything here about collecting your location to resell. Does anyone have an explicit wording in a contract they can refer me to?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.verizonwireless.com&#x2F;dam&#x2F;support&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;collateral&#x2F;ConsumerBrochure_EN_11-7-18.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.verizonwireless.com&#x2F;dam&#x2F;support&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;collateral&#x2F;C...</a>')
