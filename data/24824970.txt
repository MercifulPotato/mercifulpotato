Using an unasked-for nickname feels condescending and even like infantilization - which admittedly is in line with the tone of the your response. The HN guidelines request that we &quot;Be kind. Don&#x27;t be snarky. ... Please don&#x27;t sneer, including at the rest of the community.&quot;<p>As I wrote in the comment you replied to, &quot;Of course there&#x27;s better ability to detect cases.&quot; I thought that was obvious enough to not need further elaboration. I seem to have been wrong, so I will further clarify.<p>June is roughly when covid screening was available to everyone. Eg, the local pharmacy offers antibody testing. You&#x27;ll see that&#x27;s when the number of known cases went up even though the intensive care and death rates decreased.<p>Thus, it makes no sense to compare as you did October&#x27;s reported case incidence - when widespread testing was available - directly with April&#x27;s - when it was not.<p>In addition, the question I replied to was &quot;has the spike in cases corresponded with a spike in hospitalizations?&quot; The answer is still &quot;yes&quot;. There has been a roughly four-fold increase in reported cases over the last six weeks, and there has been a roughly four-fold increase in the number of intensive care cases over the same period of time. That&#x27;s by eyeball, so increases might not match that precisely, but it&#x27;s still a correspondence.<p>Since the lockdown we have is no longer effective at keeping the rates low, it makes sense to &quot;sharpen&quot; the recommendations.<p>Tell me how I&#x27;m wrong that that&#x27;s not a correspondence. And hopefully with less snark.')
