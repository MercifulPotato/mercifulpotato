If anything I surf one star and two star reviews of products I am buying and factor in the date of the review to see if a product improved or got worse.<p>Now what I do find inexcusable are reviews that are obviously not for the product I am looking at. I will report abuse on those but I do admit that I do not go back and check if they removed')
