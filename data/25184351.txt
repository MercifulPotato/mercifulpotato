Now that it&#x27;s installed I can&#x27;t build my project without recompiling some dependencies so will be some time before I can properly compare it to my Intel 13&quot; MBP on things that matter to me (compile-run-iterate on iOS apps).<p>If you have any specific questions about software or task speed I&#x27;m happy to answer though!')
