All translations are at least to some degree &quot;an interpretation of the underlying meaning&quot;.<p>As someone who was raised bilingual, I always struggle when asked to translate a specific phrase between languages because literal translations are often less useful or accurate than the &quot;interpreted&quot; translation. I would be very suspicious of anyone who claims they have translated something someone else said without changing its meaning at all.')
