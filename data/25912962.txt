Item(by='axelsvensson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611639825, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25904957, text='I would not sign your initiative since I believe it is dangerous and would make the web worse. Here&#x27;s why:<p>You propose to make web protocols&#x2F;standards and national laws tightly coupled for the long run, to solve a usability problem in the short run. That&#x27;s the wrong hammer for this delicate ceramic vase. Can you imagine what it would take to evolve web standards if they have to do so in tandem with the laws of dozens of different countries? If the law says cookie acceptance can be a browser setting without giving details, that&#x27;s not too little detail. Even mentioning cookies might be too much detail for a law.<p>I am annoyed too, but I direct my annoyance at the entity that made the wrong usability and privacy decision, which is the organisation behind the website in question. Website owners (should) have every incentive not to annoy their users. Designing websites without cookie consent pop-ups is possible, legal, and a competitive advantage. As a user, removing the pop-ups automatically is also fairly simple. Let it play out. It&#x27;s gotten worse before it gets better, but I believe GDPR is ultimately a force for good.')
