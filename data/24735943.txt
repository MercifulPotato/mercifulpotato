This is just the typical bad reading of Orwell that Americans have tried to squeeze out of the book because of their free speech fetish.<p>The central key issue of the book isn&#x27;t a big scary guy with a mustache stealing your newspaper, it&#x27;s reality inversion, it&#x27;s the inability of everyone in society to distinguish between what is real and what is fiction, which is the <i>basis</i> for, not the consequence of totalitarianism. It&#x27;s the moment when someone blatantly tells a lie, and everyone eats it up, when the world starts to feel unreal and like a bad movie.<p>The real Orwellian phenomenon is not some kind of scary gatekeeper separating truth from fiction, which is actually a productive use of authority and necessary in any civilisation that doesn&#x27;t want to turn into a clowncar. What&#x27;s Orwellian is people going to Facebook, reading blatant lies and untruths, and being unable to distinguish that from what is real. And that is actually caused by the disappearance of gatekeepers, who play a vital role in maintaining liberal institutions.')
