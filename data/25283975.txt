This is brutal and it&#x27;s capitalism - if you&#x27;re a staunch libretarian you probably don&#x27;t mind that those who didn&#x27;t adapt are outed as losers but... these sorts of technological revolutions have a lot of spare efficiency that&#x27;s brought along with them.  That spare efficiency can be taxed and used to help fund education and small business loans to try and preserve prosperity.<p>When it comes to the international scene I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that the &quot;haves&quot; coming will have strong reasons to make sure that the &quot;have-nots&quot; aren&#x27;t devolving into anarchy since that causes global problems.  Whether they act intelligently isn&#x27;t something I can comment on - but there are clear benefits to everyone involved.')
