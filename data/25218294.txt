If you mean &quot;the people who like to simplify thing&quot; mentioned in the GP, then it depends on your definition of simplicity more than anything. I&#x27;d say from my experience if a person prefers C to C++ or Java, that&#x27;s a good indication - but it could also mean they learned C in 1990 and didn&#x27;t bother learning anything else since....<p>From my experience: (apologies if this looks like a flame; purely personal experience, with no offense intended).<p>- Python attracts all kinds of people.<p>- Java attracts people who prefer rigid structure, specified down to minute detail (which non Java people will often consider unneeded bureaucracy)<p>- C++ attracts people who like brain teaser challenges with lots of details and steps. The compiler is both their colleague and adversary in reaching the optimal speed goal (their &quot;frenemy&quot;)<p>- C attracts people with more experience who just wants &quot;the simple thing that works&quot; without giving up the low-level control that they would have to give up using e.g. Python or Java.<p>- K&#x2F;J&#x2F;APL attract people who like brain teaser with short elegant solutions, even (and perhaps especially) if reaching and understanding that solution takes nontrivial effort -- which is basically also people who like math for math&#x27;s sake.<p>- COBOL attracts people who like job security, good income, don&#x27;t care much about job satisfaction or recent advances made in the last 30-40 years, and want everyone to get off their lawn :)')
