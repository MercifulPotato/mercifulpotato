I wish people like you replace the sales people I deal with almost on a daily basis. It’s like a bunch of vultures trying to rip into my wallet. This is in B2B context with $1M+ sales accounts.<p>Sales people need to get the fuck off of my lawn. I hate every single one of them on a personal visceral level since they’ve ruined the quality of my professional life. I am forced to deal with these half-baked professionals because we have no choice. Stop aggressively trying to sell shit. Your metrics are probably better, but you’re a nuisance to otherwise kind, calm business conduct.')
