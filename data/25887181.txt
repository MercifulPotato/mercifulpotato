While it&#x27;s imperfect:<p>* It can still be bridged to Matrix, ensuring you don&#x27;t have to use Telegram if you don&#x27;t want to<p>* There are open-source Telegram clients (at least for Android)<p>* It doesn&#x27;t sound like too much more effort: One extra message weekly (for sales), and one extra message daily (truck location)<p>* Using one doesn&#x27;t preclude you from using the other - you don&#x27;t reduce his exposure or sales, and help him reach customers who hate FB as much as your Snap-On dealer.<p>* It reduces everyone&#x27;s dependence on Facebook<p>All that said, my Snap-On dealer just has his cell number available, and follows a predictable route - we know he stops by every other Monday, and we can text him if we need something swapped out. It works for us, but I won&#x27;t pretend to know your guys business better than him.')
