When tariffs, barriers, and subsidies are removed from agriculture, prices fall, and the people eat.<p>This isn&#x27;t some abstract argument.  If you want to talk about India, notwithstanding that India is so vast and complex a nation that only the unwary say &quot;India this&quot; or &quot;India that&quot; broadly, the country had a decades-long history of protectionism since independence, trying to get by with very low levels of international trade, and this being a crucial factor in the 1991 economic crisis: the government had no foreign currency reserves at time when the balance of trade was catastrophic due to rising global oil prices and the demand for modern goods from abroad.<p>Liberalization of trade is not without its problems - in particular, increasing wealth inequities, and cultural imperialism by economic means. Nevertheless, the subsequent lowering of barriers corrected the crises and has defined India&#x27;s catapult to the top levels of international manufacturing and service provision.')
