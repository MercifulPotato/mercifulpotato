Not sure really what&#x27;s the issue. I am doing some IP translation to have kind of an alias subnet for my home network when going through the VPN. So maybe that&#x27;s the issue. I did note that the CPU was getting hit hard when I was running iperf, so I&#x27;ve assumed that my bottleneck is there.<p>I think I was hitting 60+ Mbps though, so it wasn&#x27;t all bad. However my home connection is 1000&#x2F;100, so going above 100+ isn&#x27;t going to mean much. Which is why I&#x27;ve been too cheap to invest in a Pi 4; not too great of an improvement for 55+ EUR investment.')
