There&#x27;s also probably a bit of selection bias when seeing what HN users think of it; a high percentage of users likely have (at least) decent writing skills and probably read things fairly often (even if it&#x27;s just blog posts&#x2F;emails&#x2F;chats).<p>If you read&#x2F;write very rarely and speak very often, these kinds of misspellings may seem pretty natural. But if you write a lot - perhaps even a lot more than you speak - they may stick out like a sore thumb and your brain might flag them as highly unnatural and a potential sign of hidden meaning. (I&#x27;m probably like 99.5% writing 0.5% speaking, myself, and I bet many people reading this are, too.)<p>Then combine it with one of the most mysterious and analyzed crime stories in US history, with a cryptic, megalomaniacal serial killer who loved to use ciphers and symbology to toy with the press, public, and police. I can definitely see why people might suspect something deeper to the spelling, but the null hypothesis always needs to be carefully considered, first.<p>And a side note: does anyone know what the trends over the decades are like for less &quot;hodgepodge-y&quot; languages, like Spanish and German? They seem to have rules for pronouncing based on spelling and spelling based on pronunciation that are a lot more predictable and consistent than English&#x27;s. I would guess that the popularization of spellcheck&#x2F;autocorrect might be less significant for such languages, though I&#x27;d also love to be proven wrong.')
