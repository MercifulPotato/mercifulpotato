RHEL &#x2F; CentOS is basically a hardened snapshot of Fedora taken every few years, with a few bespoke changes on top.  So in that sense you could argue that Fedora is a front-runner for &quot;the next RHEL&quot; but at any point in time it is too far ahead of the current RHEL to be a useful testbed in any respect for those users.  Although I guess you could argue that it helps knock down bugs in packages like GNOME that do get updated regularly in RHEL.<p>CentOS Stream is basically &quot;the next x.y release of RHEL&quot;. Some updates, like GNOME updates and new hardware enablement, will be present in CentOS Stream a few months before they are released to RHEL and CentOS as part of a new x.y-release.')
