I worked in Boeing engineering 40 years ago and the &quot;no single component failure causing a crash&quot; was the rule and literally the law.<p>(A lesson Boeing had to relearn with the 737MAX MCAS system.)<p>Nuclear reactors (Fukishima) and drilling rigs (Deepwater Horizon) are far behind, too.')
