FB ads aren&#x27;t perfect, but IME they&#x27;re a lot better than anything else â€” the only purchases I&#x27;ve made off ads in the last few years have been from targeted IG&#x2F;FB ads, and quite a few friends have mentioned the same.<p>Sort of ironic how the Intercept is apparently capable of believing both that:<p>* FB is completely incompetent at targeting &quot;to the point of being fraudulent,&quot; and can&#x27;t hit the broad side of a barn with a targeted ad buy, and<p>* FB is filled with malicious targeting geniuses, whose ability to pinpoint target ads to anyone with incredible precision has made a mockery of democracy.<p>(Disclaimer: I recently left IG, although I didn&#x27;t work on anything ads-related.)')
