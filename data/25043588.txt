In fact, the choice of words sounds suspiciously like those corona denier articles floating around, expecting the audience to just eat up their words and copy the intended opinion. Now I believe the EFF to at least be fighting for a good cause (though its methods are sometimes criticised), but articles like these make it harder to believe.<p>I see that the central claim is correct (the formerly free ink plan now indeed costs $0.99 per month on HP&#x27;s website). However, had they taken a more fact-based, and less opinion-based, approach to writing the article, I would actually have more than skimmed it.<p>EDIT: My main frustration is that I expected &quot;us&quot; to do better than the manipulative text that large companies continuously put out.
