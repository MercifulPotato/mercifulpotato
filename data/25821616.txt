A few years back I was convinced that there should be one global Internet.<p>Nowadays I&#x27;m leaning towards balkanization in a sense that big economic powerhouses should have their own &quot;tech giants&quot;. Don&#x27;t block small websites, but if the big ones aren&#x27;t being fully cooperative, fuck em. Block em, invest in local alternatives, build your own Linux distros for public administration, regain your sense of sovereignty.<p>In other words: Facebook forking itself into an EU version that actually takes local context into account, employing people in the EU, and keeping the data within the EU = okay. One global Facebook that follows little to no rules and doesn&#x27;t give anything back to local communities = not okay.')
