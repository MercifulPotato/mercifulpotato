When Democrat supporters demand more more more via the politicians who promise more more more, where did they think the money would come from?<p>Believe it or not, the bottom ~50% don&#x27;t have enough money to tax. The next 30-40% have some but not enough to raise enough money to help. The taxes have to be focused on the top 10% and more likely the top 1-3% to raise enough to meet these demands.<p>I think the biggest problem will be trying to enact this on people who aren&#x27;t California (or even US) residents who are now out of state. You can tax visitors for actions they take while they&#x27;re in your state (sales tax, hotel taxes, even income) but when they&#x27;re not there and haven&#x27;t been there for years?<p>The State of California may get a rude awakening on this one.')
