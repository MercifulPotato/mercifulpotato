Item(by='zamadatix', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612116330, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25979874, text='I wouldn&#x27;t be too worried about it unless you&#x27;re working on something at the level you know why to be worried about it (i.e. you&#x27;re mixing audio as part of the what you&#x27;re doing not because you just need the audio output to work). For instance I&#x27;d take missing comfort noise 10 times before everyone hearing my water heater kick up once on a conference call or while playing a team shooter.<p>That being said RNNoise isn&#x27;t that great at actually filtering background noise as much as guessing when to drop the levels and as you mention it really doesn&#x27;t block much when it detects you&#x27;re speaking rather just lets most everything through until you stop.<p>RTX voice made the gold standard in filtering IMO though and as amazing a feat RNNoise is (I certainly couldn&#x27;t do better) it&#x27;s just not that good in comparison. I&#x27;m not sure what they did to make their model so good but I can use a boom mic set to omni, run a fan at high speed into the mic, bang on the desk repeatedly with one hand, have the water heater making noise, my phone vibrating on the table, a car alarm going in the background, the cat scratching a post, and so on and as long as I remember to talk at a normal volume it&#x27;s damn near indistinguishable from talking in a quiet room. It may sound preposterous or like I&#x27;m exaggerating for effect but I&#x27;ll be damned it actually filters that well. I didn&#x27;t believe it until I tried. It finally gets &quot;bad&quot; when the noise is so bad and loud on the microphone your voice starts to sound a bit distorted but it&#x27;s still isolated. Does let cat meows through, though that is technically voice and I&#x27;m not sure how you could identify it was a meow without massive latency to hear the whole thing first.<p>That being said they seem to have completely fucked something up porting it to Nvidia Broadcast as the mic filtering in that leaks to the point it was like it wasn&#x27;t even on.')
