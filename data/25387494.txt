As soon as the government gets cash, when is it &quot;redistributed?&quot;  Aside from 1) waiting on charity from the rich or 2) forcing people to yield more of their resources to the government that may or may not [history leans to not] do what you suggest, there is likely a plethora of ways, at the very least a third way.  I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t give people money, but I am saying it&#x27;s naive to assume the government can do it.  Demanding that we involve government is similar to children demanding parents come resolve their disputes and affairs.  There must be a way forward without resorting to shouting &quot;mom! dad!&quot;')
