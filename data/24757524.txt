The fast compile&#x2F;iteration time is the main reason. But it has it&#x27;s downsides (code review is largely impractical, no merging, physically much bigger and longer to read than equivalent C++).<p>Imposters and IK are actually both things that Unreal has built-in, but the built-in versions are limited or poor quality. Unreal has two-bone IK, and more recently, a FABRIK solver, but it didn&#x27;t support multiple end-effectors or joint constraints. So basically, if you wanted something like a multiplayer VR game where the character poses somewhat realistically to match the positions of the headset and hands of the player, you couldn&#x27;t do that. The main use for Unreal&#x27;s two-bone IK (which was the only built-in IK for a long time) is for smaller tweaks like adjusting the position of a characters foot to be in contact with the ground.<p>UE5 looks very cool. I&#x27;m looking forward to its release.')
