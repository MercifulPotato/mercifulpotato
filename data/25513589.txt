Bigger by lines of code than most operating systems! Things like the JVM become small and lightweight compared to a modern browser.<p>And still, it&#x27;s not a &quot;great application runtime&quot; - as people still not even <i>found out</i> how to use it &quot;properly&quot; as one (as again: that&#x27;s the point of the article we&#x27;re discussing).<p>That people everywhere do irrational stuff all the time is also no prove that anything of that stuff makes any sense at all. Things don&#x27;t become smart only because there are more people out there doing the same thing. Actually the mass isn&#x27;t doing the smartes things at all usually. So that&#x27;s imho a quite bad benchmark for anything anyway. ;-)')
