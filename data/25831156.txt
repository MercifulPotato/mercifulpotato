I wish I read some of these points a couple of weeks ago, but ok, can&#x27;t complain.<p>You are right, especially about user-research. I will do that.<p>I got some people interested, but again, you are right, feels like a blind date.<p>And of course it feels really weird to just publish everything. So, how would you tackle it? Just publish and hope nobody does it?<p>Thanks again!')
