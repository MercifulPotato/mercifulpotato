There&#x27;s no official arm package cache so you have to cross compile everything. Unfortunately, with nix this means running an ARM compiler inside an emulator, so it is very slow.<p>When I finally got an image built the performance was much worse than rasbian or ubuntu. Kodi was basically unusable.<p>I hope these issues eventually get fixed. Being able to build an sdcard image from a nix config would be a great way to manage a bunch of Raspberry Pis.')
