My wife has a printer (Epson) for her home business, and I&#x27;ll have her print me something occasionally, but <i>for a business</i> I&#x27;m willing to make some allowances.  For personal use, I&#x27;ve been so disgusted with the printer market for decades that removing those companies from all aspects except manufacturing and initial purchase is the only thing that makes that purchase palatable.<p>So, the question becomes, what&#x27;s the cost of removing those companies and their supply chains&#x2F;software after purchase?  If it&#x27;s well trusted software that doesn&#x27;t require constant attention, that&#x27;s attractive.  If it&#x27;s random people providing binaries in a country that I may or may not have any chance of getting recourse if they harm me (that is, trajan horse or exploit, not accidental hardware bricking&#x2F;breakage), then I&#x27;m left wondering whether it&#x27;s worth it.')
