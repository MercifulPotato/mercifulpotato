Then &#x27;Chaos and Confusion&#x27;.&quot;<p>The subhead gives a better description of what the article is about &quot;Come spring, Americans may have their choice of several so-so coronavirus vaccines — with no way of knowing which one is best.&quot; The article is centered on conversations with experts on what that will mean for individuals.<p>&gt; &quot;The comments from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff came after the White House tripped over itself on the issue of Afghanistan troop levels in recent days.&quot;<p>This is an article reporting on comments made by a high-level government official.<p>&gt; &quot;Rooted in Faith, Barrett Presents a New Conservatism&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;She is a stark departure from traditional Supreme Court Nominees.&quot;<p>These are both from the same entry&#x2F;article, about Amy Coney Barrett&#x27;s background and resumé.<p>---<p>None of these articles are completely devoid from the reporter&#x27;s opinions. However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to explain these issues in a completely neutral way.<p>Let&#x27;s take that last article, since you quoted it twice. The statement that Amy Coney Barrett is &quot;a stark departure from traditional Supreme Court Nominees.&quot; is not a scientific fact. However, the article goes on to detail the ways in which she&#x27;s unusual—she&#x27;s young, for starters, and from the south, and she&#x27;s spent much of her career teaching rather than working in governmental positions. That is <i>unusual</i> for supreme court justices, and I think it should be reported on.<p>The NYT&#x27;s actual editorials are written in a distinctly different manner, which I think will become obvious if you spend a a few moments reading them. The article&#x27;s goal is explicitly to advocate for one position.')
