Lambda, at this point, feels to me like doing a php project without using any framework. You are doing it all yourself, all the tedious stuff.<p>I have started to mix Zappa and Django to get the best of both Django and Serverless. So far, I like it. I have not hit any considerable scale yet, so I wonder if Django is too heavy, or just right. It seems fine so far. The other plus - it’s all open source tech, so it’s easy to move away from Lambda if I need to.<p>It’s even better, too, because you CAN break out some more isolated functionality into stand alone lambdas when they start to get clumsy inside a typical Django proj.')
