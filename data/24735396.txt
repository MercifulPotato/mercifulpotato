It’s a small library providing unified file interface in python for local or cloud storage without fuse. It can already support seaweedfs using S3 API, it will be nicer to just directly have a driver for seaweedfs removing S3 translations.<p>I like dried crispy seaweed wafers, they do produce umami flavours, so it is a good name, reminding them. The quality of software isn’t based on name but by what it does, so don’t bother about people talking about name.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.pyfilesystem.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.pyfilesystem.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;</a>')
