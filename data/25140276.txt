It&#x27;s either too good and will steal our jobs, or not good enough for critical tasks, or evil and will turn against us. We&#x27;re obsessed with regulation and an &quot;arrogance&quot; that wants to teach the rest of the world what is ethical and trustworthy, he says. We should, says Uszkoreit, focus more on protecting people and saving lives, than protecting and saving their data.')
