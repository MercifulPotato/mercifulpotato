If you don&#x27;t have a car you can maybe make due during the spring and fall months where the temperatures are reasonable. But it&#x27;s going to be hell during winter (gets cold enough and there&#x27;s enough snow a bike won&#x27;t work for you) and during summer it gets too hot.<p>I&#x27;m a 5 minute drive to the nearest grocery store. For a walk, that&#x27;s about 3-ish miles. On a bike, not so bad, but also keep in mind there&#x27;s no bike lane or anything so you&#x27;re sharing the road with cars. There&#x27;s some added risk to that.<p>A car isn&#x27;t a requirement, but it makes a massive difference in your ability to live.')
