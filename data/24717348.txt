To keep it clean only posts with a score of 50 or higher are shown. (I might change this number though, if people would like to see less popular posts)<p>E.g. the main page is always &#x27;yesterday&#x27;, so for me it shows the posts that were posted between 00:00 and 23:59 on Wednesday, but if its already Friday where you are it will show the top posts of Thursday.')
