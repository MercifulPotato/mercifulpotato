F<p>I disagree. Under close examination, the best engineers contribute a greater multiple than is apparent at a superficial analysis (and the best engineers under close examination may not even be the same ones as stand out under superficial examination.)<p>The superficial “best” contributions tends to measured by the reciprocal of time to complete a task of a given complexity to team standards.<p>But a lot of the best engineers contributions will be in unsticking (or preventing) other engineers impediments, contributing to process improvement, design critique that avoids the team taking long walks down paths that need to be undone later, and otherwise improving velocity on tasks that other people are doing concurrently or down the road from their action.')
