I believe in full, unabridged, unbridled speech from all sides. I believe that full, equal speech from all view points squash the extreme stupid viewpoints by nature of evolution and competition. As a Polish-American with a good amount of my family being Jewish, yes, that means all sides of the argument must be heard equally and discussed equally. Even the sides I wish I could strangle. It&#x27;s the willy-nilly censoring and suppression of certain viewpoints that amplifies that exact viewpoint&#x27;s power to extreme levels. Historically, it&#x27;s never worked to suppress speech. It has always backfired. Radical, violent viewpoints only gain strength and acceptance when they are suppressed. Let them air out their viewpoints and face an equal scrutiny in a public, fair battlefield of wit.<p>There&#x27;s also a question of general ethics when it comes to the conversations in the public sphere. As an example, I believe we can all agree detention, concentration and reeducation camps are evil, anyone who promotes them in a position of power should be made publicly aware of and face the backlash. Let&#x27;s take literally yesterday Michael Beller, a PBS attorney, was saying children of Republican supporters should be taken from their families and be put in reeducation camps. While PBS is distancing themselves and he resigned, major media is silent on the matter. Hell, Washington Post mentions it, but their super short article focused on the fact this was a supposed sting operation orchestrated by conservatives. It doesn&#x27;t matter! The dude is videoed saying he&#x27;s okay with abducting children, reeducation camps and having large swaths of Americans die from Covid because he doesn&#x27;t agree with their politics. But because it&#x27;s despicable actions against &quot;the other tribe&quot;, it&#x27;s okay. If a republican said the exact same thing about democrats, word for word, what kind of uproar would there be? Hate to say it, anyone who says that the media and big tech are suppressing their speech, you can&#x27;t dismiss it at all. At this point, the cat is out of the bag and there is no turning back. To argue against extremism is now harder because of the childish games these companies have played.<p>In the end, I can appreciate the international political class&#x27; response. Their power is threatened. Who wouldn&#x27;t freak out if they find their voice is easily undermined? Who wouldn&#x27;t cry foul when their opinion is not equally heard in public discourse, when arbitrary rules are applied to them? Then the opposing opinion has free reign to say and do what they want, along with get artificial inflated publicity. It&#x27;s just funny now because the politicians are more in line with the populace more than ever, all because the &quot;do no evil&quot; brainwashers of Silicon Valley are showing their true colors. Big tech wasn&#x27;t the savior to humanity that we were all told the past 20 years. Time to give up that ghost.')
