MCAS did not exist because the 737 Max was unsafe, just different.</i><p>This is a common miss conception, planes can behave quite differently, they already do depending on loading. Then you have common type ratings, e.g. A330, A340 and A350 or 777 and 787 which only requires a short difference training to move between types.<p>The real reason is that the aircraft does not comply with stick force regulations when approaching stalls.<p><i>The LEAP engine nacelles are larger and had to be mounted slightly higher and further forward from the previous NG CFM56-7 engines to give the necessary ground clearance. This new location and larger size of nacelle cause the vortex flow off the nacelle body to produce lift at high AoA. As the nacelle is ahead of the C of G, this lift causes a slight pitch-up effect (ie a reducing stick force) which could lead the pilot to inadvertently pull the yoke further aft than intended bringing the aircraft closer towards the stall. This abnormal nose-up pitching is not allowable under 14CFR ยง25.203(a) &quot;Stall characteristics&quot;. Several aerodynamic solutions were introduced such as revising the leading edge stall strip and modifying the leading edge vortilons but they were insufficient to pass regulation. MCAS was therefore introduced to give an automatic nose down stabilizer input during elevated AoA when flaps are up.</i><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.b737.org.uk&#x2F;mcas.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.b737.org.uk&#x2F;mcas.htm</a>')
