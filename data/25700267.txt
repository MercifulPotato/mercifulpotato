Even as someone who&#x27;s written relatively little Haskell compared to Python, knowing that I can run it and it&#x27;s not going to break in some weird, unexpected way is a fantastic feeling. If I had to write something that needed to be logically &quot;bulletproof&quot; and correct, I&#x27;d feel orders-of-magnitude more comfortable writing it in Haskell&#x2F;Rust than Python. Python has too much magic, too many ways to do something unchecked, too many ways to work-around some issue. It&#x27;s too easy to write poor, difficult-to-comprehend&#x2F;maintain code in Python, at least with Haskell&#x2F;Rust I can re-factor something and _know_ that I didn&#x27;t break anything or change any behaviour - the latter especially is straight up not a guarantee I could make with Python in my experience.')
