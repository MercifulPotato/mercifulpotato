I will clarify I am an American who was raised in a Christian household.<p>My comment was based purely on my own worldview and is in no way meant to imply other people should emulate me.  I edited that line to say <i>I</i> re-evaluate  the relationship instead of <i>you</i>, which sounded prescriptive.<p>Fair callout that I could be excluding others but I never refuse being “paid back” and I never expect others to forgive a favor or debt.<p>I thjnk my philosophy would still be compatible  with making Slavic friends :)')
