They can deny anyone access to publish software and they have exhibited everything that is obviously anti-competitive.<p>Now, they&#x27;re bringing it to laptops.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t see anything happening to Apple anytime soon. They&#x27;re way too well off and they have very important government officials in their pockets. The best thing that may happen will probably come from the outside... like the EU antitrust investigation that is going on. Even so, it&#x27;s not going to stop, not anytime soon anyway.')
