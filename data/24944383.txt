It&#x27;s just a matter of choosing the right kind of intervention.\nFacebook wouldn&#x27;t exist without government support and expansionary monetary policy.<p>We can go to an extreme and point out that to properly decouple state from economics, we&#x27;d have to abolish corporate personhood first.\nWe would need to abolish &#x27;limited liability&#x27; legal entities; the real purpose of these entities is to allow individuals to repudiate responsibility for their actions by deflecting blame towards these abstract legal entities. This doesn&#x27;t make any sense aside from facilitating criminal activity.\nWhenever a corporation commits a crime and isn&#x27;t shut down (which is 100% of the time), that is government interference of the worst kind.')
