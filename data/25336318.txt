After years of being screwed over and passed over, I don&#x27;t really have the drive&#x2F;hope to get to that level since it wasn&#x27;t rewarded the first time. Also, the work is very boring now and isn&#x27;t transferrable to other groups or companies, so I don&#x27;t have any interest in being an expert just to throw away that knowledge (like I was forced to do in the past).')
