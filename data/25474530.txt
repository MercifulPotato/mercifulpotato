Peoples’ livelihoods are destroyed. You’re talking about “sensible policies” but then reference China as though welding people in their houses is just common sense.<p>Every “enlightened” country in Europe that people reference otherwise for their political benefit has fared poorly.

It’s a strange authoritarian impulse that resents anyone who’s not constantly aggrieved or devoted to some technocratic utopian vision where everyone’s sacrificing themselves for the cause.<p>Traditionally the conservatives were the censorious grumps who wanted to control everyone’s immoral profligate lifestyle, but now it’s the norm on the left - blaming every ill of society on the wickedness and sinful ways of people who disagree with them politically.')
