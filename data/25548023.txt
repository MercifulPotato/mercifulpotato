If you have a performance advantage you&#x27;ve moved out of the commodity space. I&#x27;ve no doubt Apple could sell billions of M1 chips if it wanted, with considerable profit (huge margins even after design costs), but it won&#x27;t because it can use them to differentiate (and not just to sell overpriced RAM). (And because for decades Apple has suffered from press about its chips being slower than competitors&#x27;.)<p>There is no processor feature of a modern CPU that doesn&#x27;t give advantage to all the operating systems that use it. VT-x virtualisation, AVX, AES-NI, ARM Neon: all are used by MacOS, Linux and Windows.<p>TEEs (SGX+MEE&#x2F;TrustZone&#x2F;SEV, Google Titan, Apple T2) serve similar purposes and have similar flaws (like permanent exploits) and trade-offs (same CPU -&gt; side channels, uarch complexity problems, different CPU -&gt; cost; separate chip -&gt; heterogeneity, cost). It seems like the Titan&#x2F;T2 approach leads to higher security, but I&#x27;m not sure that is settled yet. A new arch like RISC-V could do better (though it doesn&#x27;t look like RISC-V will do that). I would love to see hardware support for micro&#x2F;nano kernels, but that seems as far away as ever.<p>Obviously it is good to have a guaranteed client for your chips, but I can&#x27;t see it stopping Intel if shoestring outfits can build something like RISC-V.')
