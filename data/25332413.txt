This is very subjective again, most of the deletes can be legit deletes. There is a difference in the mistakes that are deleted and deletes that arise because of a thorough process change. I digress, but to a routine observer the person typing fast appears like a pro, someone who is really good at their job. While this can be true of other professions like a carpenter being good at his craft will be extremely fast, am not sure the same holds true for the typing speed of programmers.<p>If you are a trial and error type of programmer then of course speed matters a lot because it has a direct correlation on how fast you can iterate and increase your sample space of trials. The frequency of commits and PRs can be seen in the same light.<p>So IMO it&#x27;s hard to find a true universal measure to identify the top programmers.')
