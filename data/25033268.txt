I no longer think that end-to-end encryption is the right solution to human rights problems. If citizens are reduced to sneaking around and denying their activities to survive, their governmental system is way past due for fixing.<p>You&#x27;re arguing with a point that nobody is making. End-to-end encryption is not a guaranteed solution to human rights problems. The <i>absence</i> of it increases the probability of human right violations. There&#x27;s a big difference.<p>In the rest of your post you&#x27;re just plugging your own work and mixing up terms like crypto and encryption and all of that is so irrelevant that it seems that you aren&#x27;t interested in talking about end-to-end encryption after all.')
