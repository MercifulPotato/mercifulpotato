How can they do this?! The previous model could be upgraded to 64GB, had 4 USB-C connectors (instead of now 2) and the option for faster ethernet. It really sounds like this new mac mini is a downgrade from the previous model. I wonder if the new M1 chip&#x2F;architecture really makes that much difference to make up for the downgrade of the rest.')
