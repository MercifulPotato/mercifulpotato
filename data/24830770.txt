(power button + either volume key, 2 seconds later the biometrics are locked out.)<p>It&#x27;s <i>much</i> harder to fake the biometrics in that very brief window of time (maximum 48 hours) than it is to shoulder surf a password.<p>Unless your threat model includes State Level Actors, biometric bypass is a very remote concern.<p>If your threat model includes State Level Actors, you&#x27;re probably screwed either way, since they can easily afford to shoulder surf you.<p>For everyone else, the main concern is that someone not physically present will manage to acquire your password and log into your services. Passwords <i>suck</i> at this threat model. FIDO2 makes this scenario impossible without that remote person managing to execute a Secure Enclave 0day on your personal device... and even then, it&#x27;s still way harder than acquiring your password. Not even the website you&#x27;re authenticating against receives your FIDO2 key... websites always receive your password, which is awful for security.<p>Some related info here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24830642" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24830642</a>')
