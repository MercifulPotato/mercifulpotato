It&#x27;s a hard thing to do.</i><p>I suspect it&#x27;s actually an <i>impossible</i> thing for a new language to do on its own, because it&#x27;s not really a technical problem in the first place. It needs a new language with a &quot;killer feature&quot; and serious resources backing it to break through. Several of the relatively success new(ish) languages have combined those two attributes, with the language being in some sense the favoured one for writing software that runs on a certain platform.')
