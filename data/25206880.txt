Many people believe it is a foundational element of democracy. I am one of them and I am “upset&#x2F;perturbed” at the news media’s decline. You seem to accept that it is in decline but say that’s just “a reflection of humanity.” Isn’t that something to be upset about? If the media can become more polarised and less factual, couldn’t it also move in the other direction? Can’t we be upset that this is not happening, and propose political solutions, in the same way that we reform other political institutions?')
