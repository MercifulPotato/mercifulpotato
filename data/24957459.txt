The responses in these threads always devolve to &quot;But I have to drive my car, and if I can&#x27;t do it safely, then people are just going to have to die.&quot;<p>If you really can&#x27;t drive slowly enough, then avoid streets like that, ride a bike, walk, bus, cab, etc. In these kinds of crowded, pedestrian-filled areas, I&#x27;ll drive 10 mph. I don&#x27;t care. That&#x27;s the speed I feel is right and safe for me and my neighbors. Speed limits really are limits. I _can_ drive slow enough.')
