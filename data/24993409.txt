I recall reading the developers&#x27; rationale for their decision to do multiple documents and sharing at the document level. They argued that it simplified the mental model, and I&#x27;d tend to agree: when I use shared docs I want to be careful with what&#x27;s private and what&#x27;s shared, and the UI (the document list on the left) make it easy to do that. Almost every time I&#x27;ve shared something, it&#x27;s been intended for sharing from the start, so creating a new document is natural. (And the one time that wasn&#x27;t true, cut and paste into a new doc was just a few clicks.)<p>One problem with Workflowy for me was that the mobile app(s) were not very good. Dynalist&#x27;s isn&#x27;t great either but it&#x27;s better.<p>Anyway, the products are more similar than they are different.')
