It&#x27;s only my speculation that this is what draws men to libertarianism.<p>&gt;&quot;fair&quot; is defined as something that adheres to the libertarian&#x27;s personal definition of what is rational.<p>Do you have any kind of scientific evidence supporting this hypothesis, or is it just speculation based on intuition and observations of personal acquaintances?<p>&gt;&gt;When you can define anything you personally believe in to be rational, all your opponents automatically become irrational because they disagree with your enlightened position.<p>It&#x27;s tautological that a person will view beliefs that they personally view as rational&#x2F;right, as rational&#x2F;right. This is irrespective of their political ideology.<p>As for arrogance, I think &quot;live and let live&quot; is the least arrogant political philosophy one can hold, and that&#x27;s the defining ethos of libertarianism. I think that lack of pretence&#x2F;arrogance in this ethos is what draws people to libertarianism.<p>Any non-libertarian political persuasion will advocate for all manner of government measures that use force against peaceful people to force compliance with a larger social plan.<p>I personally don&#x27;t see how the person opposing this sort of mandate is arrogant, while the person advocating for it is not. But I guess these issues are subjective.<p>&gt;&gt;Believing that it makes you impervious to emotional arguments just makes it even more arrogant.<p>From what I recall, the study found that libertarians are less likely to pay attention and give weight to peripheral cues that appeal to emotion, and be more focused on substance.')
