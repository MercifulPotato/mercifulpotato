I had my Sony α6100 overheat within 20 minutes on mere 1080p video when the ambient temperature was at least 45°C. When these things run hot, it’s easy to feel where the hottest areas of the body are, and attaching a heatsink is obvious, and at that time, dumping heat to the tripod mount was the first thing that occurred to me when I contemplated how I might do it.')
