I&#x27;m no lawyer, but to me it sounds like that might be a conflict of interests.<p>By preventing people from buying shares, the short-sellers have less competition to buy the available shares, and will have an easier time getting them, while paying less for them. Robinhood seems to be manipulating the market to make it easier for Melvin Capital to cut their substantial losses.')
