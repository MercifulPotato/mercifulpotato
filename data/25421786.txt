Meaning it went the wrong way.  Which, because it&#x27;s the 60s in the hypothetical example, is fitting. The next revolution is the quantum of transportation: the electric scooter. I jest, but only a little. It gets me to work just fine, gets me there in only five minutes more than the car, and I don&#x27;t have to pedal. And I can power it with the 400W of solar panels on the roof of our RV. Seeing how fast one can dump fuel into an engine in 2020 isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d call a &quot;revolution&quot;.')
