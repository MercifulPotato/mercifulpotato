Has an LED on it so you can see whether it&#x27;s talking to a headset (blue), playing audio with mic umuted (green), or playing audio with mic muted (red).  (Amazing feature for Zoom calls!)<p>The retail price of it seems a bit high at $56, but you can find them used with Jabra Evolve 65 headsets on eBay for $45-$60 as a bundle.  (The headset sound is pretty good, actually.  Fragile if you don&#x27;t pack it flat in a backpack, alas.)<p>Sorry I sound like a commercial, but it really makes life easier.  Seems like the frustration saved was worth the $$$.')
