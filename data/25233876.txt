It&#x27;s a labour issue, if it&#x27;s an &quot;issue&quot; regardless of unions.<p>Second is unions aren&#x27;t really about &quot;minimum wages.&quot; If the game is lower minimum wages or automation... that game is long lost as a viable way of making a living.<p>Amazon is already highly automated relative to the malls it replaces. Still, it&#x27;s one of the worlds biggest employers.<p>There&#x27;s another way of thinking about automation. Automation raises labour efficiency, by definition.

Amazon will always prefer to automate than to hire. But they&#x27;ll also prefer to pay high wages than have disruptive labour disputes.')
