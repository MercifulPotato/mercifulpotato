In certain radiation environments, shielding makes things <i>worse</i>, as an energetic particle can cause a knock-on flood of even more damaging particles to be emitted if strikes an atom in the shield.  Ultimately more mass does help, but we&#x27;re talking meters-thick, not just another few cm.<p>The details are a lot more complicated than that.  It&#x27;s just worth keeping in mind that for any given radiation environment, there may be times when either more <i>or</i> less shielding would be a better choice, as counterintuitive as that may seem.')
