There are tons of people who join bc of significant others or friends, it’s a good place to work.<p>* $$$ - There are only a few companies at that level of total comp. FB stock has climbed a lot in the last two years.<p>* Benefits - if you’re starting a family, FB gives the most leave of any big tech. I’m a dad and currently taking my 4 month fully paid paternity leave, after already taking 10 weeks paid COVID leave this year to take care of my two year old. We’ll be getting 10 more weeks of COVID leave for H1 2021 also.<p>* Culture - say what you will about the FAANG interview culture, but top tier companies have really good people and high standards. I’ve gotten pushed more in the last two years than any job before that. If you’re a high performer, the ceiling is insanely high, both in comp and responsibility.<p>* FB has tons of projects that have nothing to do with the things HN hates about FB. There is a massive chunk of the company working on awesome products that get used by billions of people.<p>* (flame war incoming) Not everyone agrees with the HN stance that selling ads based on user data is fundamentally evil.<p>* FB has done sketchy things in the past, but there’s so much government regulation and increased scrutiny, none of that would fly in 2020.')
