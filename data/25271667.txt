You&#x27;ll probably need fifty people to specifically want to be janitors to support that one person. Five hundred to be generic crewmen. A few to CxO. Fifty to be middle managers. And so on.<p>I&#x27;m not sure the ratios work out the way you&#x27;d expect. For every person who <i>wants</i> to be a captain, you need an army to support him, and I&#x27;m not sure you have so few people who want to be in charge (take any high school group activity: someone always pops out at the &quot;leader&quot; -- by choice or necessity -- even in groups as small as 3. Those groups that don&#x27;t gain a leader inevitably fail, due to disorder and chaos).<p>And if such a population ratio does not exist, and the man who wants to be captain cannot be captain, then you have scarcity, and politic.<p>Even among the &quot;hardcore engineers&quot;, who revel in their non-leadership roles, that only holds as long as the system itself does; a bad manager, captain, etc, can completely kill the joy of such engineering, at which point, you find a new leader, or an engineer attempts to become a leader by (perceived) necessity.')
