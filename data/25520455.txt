Whereas you&#x27;re merely making the point that other RH is delivering a worse customer experience than other payment-for-order-flow venues.<p>That&#x27;s an orthogonal criticism. But the point is the same regardless. Even if RH customers see smaller price improvement, they&#x27;re still better off than at a hypothetical brokerage that eschews payment-for-order flow. Because in that case they&#x27;d see <i>zero</i> price improvement (plus pay public exchange fees and commissions).')
