Item(by='function_seven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606186875, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25194028, text='&gt; <i>A flaw in the legal process to easy &amp; rapidly return assets to those found innocent does not make all seizures theft.</i><p>How does it not? This is not just &quot;a flaw&quot;, it&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s designed. If you&#x27;re traveling with $5k in cash, a trooper somewhere on I-35 can seize it with the rationale that (1) I-35 is a notorious drug trafficking corridor, (2) your car is from out of state, (3) there&#x27;s no legitimate reason to cross state lines with that amount of cash, other than illicit activity, and (4) &quot;you appeared nervous&quot;<p>They seize the cash, let you continue on your way, and never file any charges at all.<p>When you ask for it back, they say, &quot;Nah, you have to prove your innocence first&quot;. Oh, and that would be a civil case, so you have to pony up for a lawyer and sue for it. No guarantee that you&#x27;ll recover attorney&#x27;s fees, so even if you win, you lose.<p>If they do charge you with a crime, you can be acquitted of the crime and <i>still</i> they keep the property. (It&#x27;s &quot;civil&quot; forfeiture, your acquittal isn&#x27;t enough to get your money back)<p>Okay, so no, it doesn&#x27;t make <i>all</i> seizures theft, but it also has no reason to exist as a policy if you can seize assets of charged individuals anyway.<p>There should, 100%, never be an asset seizure without a related criminal charge. I&#x27;m usually not one for absolutes, but I am in this regard.')
