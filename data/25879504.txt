Then there’s the question of what people in rural areas or trade jobs or other situations will do, given their needs may be different (working vehicles like pickups may see different adoption rates or constraints). There’s also the question of whether the power grid is ready. And finally I wonder if all the mass mining of lithium and other metals will create its own problems. If all things are better in moderation I wonder if a mixed end state with ICE, EVs, and PHEVs all available is the best equilibrium. Personally I think aggressive bans on gasoline vehicles may be short sighted, apart from being another reduction of individual freedoms.')
