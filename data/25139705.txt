To add:<p>I felt like an imposter in prior jobs (product&#x2F;bus-dev) until I built my own startup. Then I learned the hard challenge of building a reliable product that is used regularly, and is profitable. I know now that I am not the best at any of the steps involved but I know what it takes to be successful and can appreciate when others do so.<p>In sum: I was an imposter before because I achieved titles largely due to my general competence, work ethic, and academic qualifications. I stopped being an imposter when I deeply understood a specific field and gained key insights through much experimentation.<p>So - it&#x27;s good that you pick up new things fast. Now focus on a problem you care about deeply and spend a few years working on it. That gets rid of imposter syndrome.')
