The vast majority of Americans&#x27; tax revenue goes to the federal government, not to state or local governments, even in wealthy, high-tax states like California. And state governments, unlike the federal government, don&#x27;t have access to effectively unlimited borrowing capacity at &lt;2% interest. Also, California can&#x27;t shut down its border to Floridians - or prevent Californians from traveling to Florida and then returning - to stop the virus from being carried from Florida to California.')
