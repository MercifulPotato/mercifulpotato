Much of the value in the test is showing that the old revision fails it. If I were fixing this bug, first thing I would do is write the test and make sure the existing code fails. If it doesn&#x27;t fail, that means I don&#x27;t understand the problem yet. Then I fix the problem and commit both the fix and the test. I don&#x27;t just discard the test, because it is valuable to know that in the future nobody re-introduces the exact same flaw (this regularly happens in open source projects).')
