Then, a div is being started, and the &lt;&#x2F;form&gt; end tag set the form element pointer to null. Because it’s null, the next form with id=&quot;inner&quot; can be created; and because we’re currently within div, we effectively have a form nested in form.<p>---------<p>I was under the impression that a closing tag automatically also closed any tags that were currently open, but contained within the tag being closed. Is it not a bug that, when the &lt;&#x2F;form&gt; tag is encountered, the open &lt;div&gt; tag isn&#x27;t closed at that point?')
