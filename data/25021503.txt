Many issues are partisan and many more bi partisan.<p>Instead of pitting 2 or more parties against each other, why can’t select the issues we want to be implemented and politicians with no party affiliations to implement them?<p>This way we can have elections maybe even once a year for issues rather than for parties and we can track issues. Spokesperson can be a rotating head of state.<p>Isn’t it a better way to govern ourselves?')
