(Until retirement). [1] The natural extension of this is... always buy.  Buy now.  Buy.<p>-  Keep a pool of cash on the side (whatever you can afford) to be ready to capitalize on any &quot;fire sale&quot; of stocks.  This should be about 10% of your portfolio as a very liquid non-volatile asset (cash).<p>[1]  Obviously life hits you hard sometimes and you HAVE to sell to cover unexpected bills.  I am obviously not suggesting in those situations that you hold your stock to the detriment of your healthy, of a family members health, etc.')
