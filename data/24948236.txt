They don&#x27;t want to publish articles that will rock the boat<p>Here&#x27;s how Frederik deBoer puts it (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fredrikdeboer.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;30&#x2F;only-the-club-remains&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fredrikdeboer.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;30&#x2F;only-the-club-remains&#x2F;</a>):<p>&quot;The social capture of media plays a huge role in how media operates, dictating what gets reported and which voices are heard. To some degree this is overt – if you you have drinks with the right people in media, that improves your ability to get published. That’s a fact; just a fact, a plain fact. And if you retweet the right people’s tweets that helps too. But there’s a deeper and subtler element to this. What you must show is not that you are talented, or that you’re principled, or that you’re hard working, or even that your arguments are correct. You have to show that you are one of them. You have to have the right social and cultural signifiers. They are innumerable and stretch from performing the right woke posturing and commenting on the correct TV shows to (especially, especially) telling the same kind of shitty, inside-dealing jokes, the kind that say to everyone “I am a member of a club, and it is very important.” Professional, political, and moral considerations have been consumed. There is only idenitification with the group, now. The sole criterion for having a successful career in media today is the degree to which you can signal to the crowd that you are one of them, that you share their values and petty obsessions.&quot;')
