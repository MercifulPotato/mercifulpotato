Have you noticed that the very challenge elevated Lee Sedol&#x27;s game who found a strange adversary and was pushed into uncharted territory leading him to make a strange move himself that threw off AlphaGo and lead Lee Sedol to win the game?<p>I think that, on the contrary, finding new challengers with different styles pushes us to explore further, expand our envelope, and grow.<p>Imagine AlphaGo&#x27;s impact on people who may not have playing partners. People could be able to enjoy the game whenever they want to and improve and come up with original moves when stressed, just as Lee Sedol came up with a move when stressed.<p>Clinging onto comfort zones seldom leads to progress or growth.')
