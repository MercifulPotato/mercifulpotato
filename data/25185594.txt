I know there have been “surveys” done  but everyone keeps citing the same one, and who knows how accurate that is.<p>And even if 50% of all users use voice search, that doesn’t mean 50% of all queries are voice search. Maybe you only want to use it for very specific use cases like weather, and directions.<p>Personally many websites don’t even have great site search, let alone voice. You should focus on improving that before addressing the 1% of people who would like to use voice search.')
