I find it easier to configure although I have much more experience with Linux. Things I don&#x27;t link on Linux are systemd, pulseaudio, hundreds of packets managers that make it not always straight forward how to patch a package.<p>What I like with FreeBSD is the slower pace of evolution, so there is less breaking change per unit of time, that makes me spend less time fixing things while being up to date, and when it break there is always a good documentation available. Things I like in FreebSD: pf, zfs, bhyve, rc.d, good separation between user configuration changes and system configuration.')
