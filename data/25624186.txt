Data with a lot of churn could churn on, but clients would see a consistent view until they return to the point of entry.<p>Obviously this has some potential caveats if that churn is also likely to quickly invalidate data, or revoke sensitive information. Time limits for historical data retrieval can be imposed to help mitigate this. And individual records can be revised (eg with bitemporal modeling) without altering the set of referenced records.')
