Performant raytracing on SNES hardware would be (to my understanding) pure magic - SNES modes may have been good, but none of them were <i>that</i> good. Just reimplementing raytracing in software on a SNES would also not really be that interesting technically. It can already do any kind of calculation, if slowly.<p>Expansion cards are established ways to improve the SNES&#x27;s hardware capabilities, as many cartridges did, especially toward the end of the console&#x27;s lifetime. It&#x27;s not dishonest to describe using one as doing something &quot;on the SNES&quot; - especially when part of the writeup is about technical challenges interfacing the expansion chip with the actual console.')
