Then I am quantifying how well that feature is implemented within the product, hopefully extrapolate that to the whole category, essentially a ranking system for the features. To do that, I need to collect and normalize those feature sets.<p>W.r.t. treemap, I am trying different visualization techniques and seems like treemap is pretty good in answering these questions quickly:<p>1. Which product is a dominant product in a particular category?<p>2. Which feature dominates a product&#x2F;category?<p>After doing a few user interviews people honestly don&#x27;t care about the ranking or a better framework to search for software. They mostly care about how can software evaluation and procurement can be less painful.<p>Thanks for the comment and sharing the link of eoc. That&#x27;s pretty much what I am trying to do for apps.<p>I hope to extend this to libraries&#x2F;packages which can be very helpful in knowing what are the strengths of a particular library or package in a snapshot.')
