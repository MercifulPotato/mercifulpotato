I was at Intel many years ago, quit mainly because the work got boring, the pay stagnant, and competitors offered me more. I was pleasantly surprise to land at a place where internal politics was lower, work more fun, and pay better. I have switched since to yet another great place to work. I will probably never go back to Intel again.')
