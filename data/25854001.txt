Like if you could wear meaningful compute that is powered with body kinetic energy or some flexible solar thing, I think that unlocks computing to happen in many places with many physical and virtual things working in concert. ESP-32 on BLE sleep can sip tiny amounts of energy, but cannot do any meaningful compute, and a low top end speed. I want a chip that can burst to 5GHZ and rest at 0.05mha. That can make generating or streaming a massive bitrate from a wearable. Then you can do sick-ass offline-first edge compute and be able to drive one of these haptics devices, projectors, VR, whatever with a tiny machine or local cluster. Wearable k3s if you will. If you could drive any display from your person, with local and remote indexes and objects of everything you want or need, interfaces to people and things, replay of everything, totally offline as you want or need.<p>If it was fast enough, and didnâ€™t require a whole backpack to drive and power it, then I think a computer like that would feel like a superpower.')
