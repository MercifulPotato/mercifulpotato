Item(by='genocidicbunny', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610088107, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25679652, text='&gt; I&#x27;m a Brit so I&#x27;m not familiar with Highway 1 but a quick search seems to show it is a CA road. My first virtual run on it shows three lanes on both sides, so I&#x27;ll head north to SF. OK one lane. It&#x27;s a provincial coastal road with adjustments.<p>It is a CA road, and the section that the GP is talking about is specifically the coastal part between Santa Cruz and San Francisco, or south of Monterey. These areas are one lane in each direction.<p>&gt; Either get a car with a massive acceleration and overtake or enjoy the view.<p>It is frequently impossible to overtake. Both directions of traffic tend to be fairly steady, and there&#x27;s enough turns and blind spots that safely passing is not possible. The turnout sections are often too short for more than a single car to overtake the lead car, and only if its right behind the lead car -- if you&#x27;re a couple cars back there&#x27;s no chance.<p>We&#x27;re not even talking about insane speeds here. Doing 50 or 55mph on the 1 in those scenic parts is wonderful. That happens to also be just about the speed limit. But far too often there will be someone either taking in the scenery a little too much, or too scared to go any faster. Then you end up in a caravan of cars all doing 35-40mph on the road, and little chance to pass. \nAt that point, it becomes hard to &#x27;calm down and enjoy the view&#x27; -- you&#x27;re no longer driving for pleasure, you&#x27;re effectively stuck in heavy traffic.')
