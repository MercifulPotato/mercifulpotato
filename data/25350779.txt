POSIX is effectively a 50-year old API, and there are definitely places where the API it provides is far from optimal.<p>For something that interests me personally, the POSIX idea of ptrace and signals for debugging is a fundamentally broken and obtuse API that just don&#x27;t work very well with how modern software is designed, and requires a decent amount of hacks to do anything rational with hardware traps. I did think a little bit about what kind of API I wanted if I were designing de novo, and happened to pop through Fuchsia&#x27;s API at a glance to see what it decided... and it was exactly the kind of way I&#x27;d have thought about this space.')
