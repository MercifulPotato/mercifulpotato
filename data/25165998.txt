Anybody equipped with a moderate knowledge of Seoul Standard should see immediately the significant differences between Seoul speech and Soviet\nKorean, and those with a moderate knowledge of Middle Korean will also see the many direct similarities between 15th- and 16th-century Korean and these data. All in all, the impression is of significant divergence. However, more often than not, the locus of &quot;radical change&quot; has been Seoul Standard and not Soviet Korean: in language change it is usually the center, and not the periphery, that changes &quot;the fastest and the mostest&quot;.</i>')
