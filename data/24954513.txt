It&#x27;s probably not a trivial process.  A lot of thought and consideration (especially in today&#x27;s world) is likely going into these decisions.  There almost certainly had to be emails sent warning of such violations.  I am not on Facebook but would imagine there&#x27;d be quite an uproar if there was no notice BEFORE being cut off.<p>So my hunch would be that either (a) your girlfriend is actually doing things that violate Facebook&#x27;s community standards, or (b) her account has been hacked, but even that would probably be obvious based on IP addresses, etc, Finally (c) it&#x27;s possible her computer&#x2F;phone was hacked, which means there&#x27;s probably no way for Facebook to determine whether or not she&#x27;s the culprit or the hacker is.')
