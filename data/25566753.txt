It&#x27;s another symptom of the min&#x2F;maxing culture this article is taking aim at. There&#x27;s a culture shift that&#x27;s taken place in the last few years which says no one&#x27;s allowed to complain unless they have a better solution. Seen it rearing it&#x27;s head more recently in very rigid ways. From my observations, it kills creativity in it&#x27;s tracks and instead of making everyone carefully consider what they complain about and solve problems better, it quashes anyone&#x27;s ambition to say anything for fear of becoming a target. I&#x27;ve seen the targeting happen in such childish ways too. &quot;If YOU think it&#x27;s so shit, then YOU fix it.&quot;')
