On the flip side, it seems like even in Tailwind it seems like there are opportunities to create a mess.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of the utility level of abstraction Tailwind is at, but I see the value. It seems wrong to view Tailwind as a CSS solution though, since in my opinion it&#x27;s actually a design system solution.')
