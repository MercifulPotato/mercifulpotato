If your wage is $60&#x2F;hour, that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re &quot;losing money&quot; if you clean your house rather than pay someone $30&#x2F;hour to do it. For most people, cleaning their house doesn&#x27;t have any impact on their income. If you&#x27;re broke, it may very well make sense to clean your house yourself even if someone else is willing to do it for $1&#x2F;hour and you make $20&#x2F;hour.')
