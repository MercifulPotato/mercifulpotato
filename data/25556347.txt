Sure! But fully half the company is composed of folks who will never, ever log in to GitHub.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started on issues. For personal stuff I&#x27;m GH all the way, but for planning a year&#x27;s worth of development? It just doesn&#x27;t fly. I&#x27;m looking at Linear now because I dislike JIRA&#x27;s UX, and GitHub&#x2F;GitLab both are too lightweight for my needs.<p>As someone who is beginning to live in financial spreadsheets, I&#x27;m damn well happy to pay for SaaS that totals less than a FTE dev and also allows my entire company to move faster as a result.
