Streissand effect .. I for one have found it very intriguing to go through the archive and see what all the fuss was about.<p>It seems that the US doesn&#x27;t really want to have an honest conversation about its history of sanctions against Iran, nor can it tolerate anyone discussing the 37 million refugees from its wars.<p>I hope the Iranian government will put the same info up, properly identified and complying with US&#x27; requirements .. because honestly, the content of these sites needs to be discussed openly and honestly.<p>EDIT: after further reading, it seems that the archived content doesn&#x27;t necessarily contain anything demonstrably false - but the motivation for seizing the domains is more like &quot;these sites didn&#x27;t properly identify themselves as being authored by the government of Iran, therefore they don&#x27;t deserve to exist&quot;.  Because, so far, I haven&#x27;t seen anything in the wayback machine to indicate that anything previously published on these sites is false.  They definitely do not paint a pretty picture of American imperialism, however - and they do provide a counter narrative to the great American war propaganda that currently embroils the west.<p>EDIT2: Just so its clear, I&#x27;m still reading through the archives, and I see nothing in these sites that makes the &#x27;holocaust denial&#x27; claims or any other such nonsense.  Just lots of articles detailing America&#x27;s illegal wars and its crimes against humanity.<p>I can see why American&#x27;s want that off the &#x27;net, and why any attempt to discuss it must be censored into oblivion.  The facts on the ground of America&#x27;s war insanity are pretty heinous, to be honest.')
