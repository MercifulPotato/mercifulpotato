If anything, what the article shows is a regression to the long-term political mean, not a move left.<p>It shows the political swing over 25+ years capturing clinton, bush, and obama presidencies. We see that during bush and clinton the democrats were quite stable. Only at around 2011 did the graph start seeing a shift where 2017 has the democrats having moved far left on average.<p>This data is available from other sources. The other reality is that I can personally see it. The democrats used to have a strong moderate base, they are gone.<p>There are many many people writing on how the political divide is so bad that it feels like never before.<p>The reality is that Obama(first black president) was doomed to identity politics. Which has created this much division.<p>&gt;A great example I happen to have favorited on YouTube, check out the healthcare debate in 1971 [0]. It’s essentially Medicare for all (D) vs practically Obamacare (but from an R).<p>Not available in my country. 1971 is much to old to properly compare to today&#x27;s political climate.')
