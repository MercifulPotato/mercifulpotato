A problem I encountered was that while I could remember words and expressions in the Anki environment, I couldn&#x27;t do it outside of it. Or I could memorize an expression exactly as it was written down, but if I saw a little variation then it was useless.<p>For language learning I found it works way better to use another technique: ridiculous imagery and word association. Higher initial time investment (have to spend some time for each new word in the first time I see) but after that I don&#x27;t EVER need to recall it again. It just sticks. I also used that to memorize different alphabets and it&#x27;s WAY easier and does feel like a superpower as opposed to just brute force memorize something by repetition and recall with no other brain connections between what we&#x27;re memorizing and what we already know.')
