Now that is anecdotal but I have not heard many of the elderly I know voice fear over the situation. Concern maybe but not fear. It also helps to frame what we term as old I am not talking about someone in their 60&#x27;s still fit and able to enjoy life. My frame of reference has been my very elderly grandparents and the friends that they have left. I have heard more complaints about loneliness from them than fear of death. Now I have heard them express that they would rather not go out by COVID as it seems like a pretty crappy way to go.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone ever truly gets over the fear of the process of death. I know that while I do not fear it, if I imagine myself burning to death or falling to my death in a plane crash with other people around me screaming in futility. I can give myself that oh crap I hope I does not go down like that feeling, but that is different than being terrified of being dead.')
