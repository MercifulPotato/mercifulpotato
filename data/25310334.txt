Intel&#x27;s IGPs have been good enough to do NTLM in a few minutes for a few years, so being able to crack NetNTLM handshakes locally would be nice.<p>Nvidia&#x27;s Tegra stuff <i>is</i> really impressive though. I had a shot at playing with hashcat on a nintendo switch a while back, and even though that&#x27;s several gens old and has very limited VRAM, it did surprisingly well. The newer SoCs must really fly.')
