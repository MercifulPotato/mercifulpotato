The different programs all have significant differences in usability, and have clever ideas behind  them, but unfortunately automatic speech recognition is still bad enough that the primary factor is which has a better ASR engine. Caster supports Dragon Naturally Speaking, which is expensive, but enough better to make it worthwhile.<p>There are moments where I think this is going to be the future of programming, since code as text is only the easiest for as long as typing is the easiest way to record things unambiguously.<p>But for the most part it’s still pretty frustrating. If ASR systems can get the sentence error rate down by an order of magnitude or two, I sincerely think this will take off not just for accessibility, but for normal use.<p>Until then, it’s a PITA that is saving my career nonetheless.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caster.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caster.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;</a>')
