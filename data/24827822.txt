I almost always use full sentences and correct punctuation in all forms of communication.  But I make sure to always write correctly when I&#x27;m communicating with non-native speakers.  I am doing them a disservice, otherwise.  And it&#x27;s also frustrating to me when I&#x27;m learning a language and what I&#x27;m reading from native speakers is below even my capability.<p>Also, I think there&#x27;s a difference between making mistakes in a foreign language, and being lazy or not caring.  For example, capitalizing the first letter of a sentence or the word &quot;I&quot; is something that 99% of people know they should do.  So that mistake is not usually due to lack of fluency in a language.')
