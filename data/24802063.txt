For a large portion of the social elite, these views are shaped by their education and by the class views espoused in publications like the New Yorker, NYT, etc.<p>These prestige publications no longer have the influence they once had on other social classes because these social classes have access to a wide variety of new media enabled by the internet, and this loss of control is what&#x27;s shocking to the political&#x2F;social elite.<p>I think something along these lines must be what&#x27;s happening because in terms of actual policy, Trump isn&#x27;t that different from someone like Pat Buchanan.')
