I work at Twilio and this is our official statement on the enforcement of our AUP with Parler.<p>---<p>With regards to reports of cyber security issues Parler experienced and have been attributed to Twilio, our security team investigated the claims and found no evidence indicating their security issues were related to Twilio or our products. Per our Website [0], Twilio has not issued any press releases pertaining to or referencing Parler.<p>Furthermore, Parler was using Twilio to send out identity verification codes for new downloads or password resets. Once a user was verified, security protocols were independently handled by Parler and did not involve Twilio or its products. On Friday, January 8th, we sent Parler a letter informing them they were in violation of our Acceptable Use Policy [1] and notifying them that we would suspend their account if they did not make efforts to remediate multiple calls for violence on their platform. Shortly after receiving our letter, Parler informed us they had already turned off their integration with Twilio.<p>Any cyber security issues experienced by Parler were completely unrelated to Twilio or any of its products.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twilio.com&#x2F;press&#x2F;releases" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twilio.com&#x2F;press&#x2F;releases</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twilio.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;aup" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twilio.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;aup</a>')
