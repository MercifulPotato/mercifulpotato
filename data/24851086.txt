Perhaps I stumble upon these threads sometimes when they&#x27;re still being authored, but my experience has been:<p>-&gt; See a tweet in my primary twitter feed<p>-&gt; Click &quot;Show this thread&quot;<p>-&gt; Now I&#x27;m in the middle of a thread, probably at the most liked tweet<p>-&gt; Scroll up to the top<p>-&gt; Read through each tweet scrolling down, with the author&#x27;s profile picture, display name and twitter handle repeated every 100-280 characters.<p>-&gt; At the bottom, if there are new tweets I usually resort to clicking on the tweet itself to load new replies, even if they&#x27;re a continuation of the thread by the same author.<p>Not a great UX for me. Given that most of these threads end with a commenter invoking a bot like threadreader to &quot;unroll&quot; the thread and post it to another website, I&#x27;m certainly not alone in this.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;daily-202-it-is-probably-too-late-senate-republicans-distance-themselves-trump&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;daily-202...</a>')
