First, they would be fighting diminishing returns since there is only so much reduce-able cost.  Second, they might in reality only be able to do a small cost reduction, then they are doubly screwed as they will reach diminishing returns faster.  If the company mandates cost reduction executives will just fire a few hundred or thousand employees because that is deterministic, easy, and instant savings.  They will just restaff when the cost reduction campaign is over.')
