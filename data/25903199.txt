Any comparison with existing banking systems is moot.<p>&gt; If the &quot;things that need to be worked on before&quot; don&#x27;t include any of these cases, what do they include?<p>- How to get the systems safer to use, so that people can reduce their dependence on existing banking&#x2F;financial structure.<p>- How to create other use-cases beyond transmitting value: to create credit systems (along with credit ratings, insurance instruments), to eliminate notaries and have blockchain be also used as a record of private property, deeds, etc.<p>- How to find a better point in the trade-off decentralization&#x2F;permissionless&#x2F;operational cost x centralization&#x2F;permissioned&#x2F;economies of scale. That is what Layer-2 solutions are about.<p>- How to develop and architect applications that make use of this technology without destroying value.<p>Do you need more?')
