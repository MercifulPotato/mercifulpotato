I think you guys have done an amazing job creating a very powerful GraphQL client. However, to me &quot;smart&quot; GraphQL clients don&#x27;t make much sense. My approach with WunderGraph is the following: You write down all your Operations using GraphiQL. We automatically persist them on the server (WunderNode) and generate a &quot;dumb&quot; typesafe client. This client feels like GraphQL and behaves like GraphQL but is not using GraphQL at all. It&#x27;s just RPC. This makes using GraphQL more performant and secure at the same time. Additionally it&#x27;s a lot less code and a smaller client because those RPC&#x27;s are a lot simpler.')
