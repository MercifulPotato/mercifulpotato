We have ActivityPub and WebMentions now, but they all require accounts, hosting and management... and they don&#x27;t come with original content creation.<p>If you put every creator in their own silo (under their own domain name, say), they won&#x27;t feel so connected, unless that domain also provides near-instant access to the feeds from all their contacts. Facebook and Insta give you a feed of your whole village plus the folks from the village over that you like, instantly. I&#x27;m sure the IndieWeb crew <i>do</i> feel connected, but how much effort have they all made to join that party? LOADS, compared with your mum on Facebook.<p>So sure, modern Frontpage, but also <i></i>easy<i></i> RSS&#x2F;Atom + WebMentions + ActivityPub (or equivalent).<p>Personally, I <i></i>really<i></i> like Scuttlebutt for this. It has all this stuff, and is offline-first, and will work with interplanetary travel, and you can build calendars and events and stuff on top of it. But it&#x27;s yet another protocol (and a complex one at that), and getting into the network is a big hurdle still.')
