Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606246758, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25200306, text='&gt; Hawaii - this should be the best remote tech hub, but it isnâ€™t yet. Beautiful place, not that expensive (relatively). But you gotta work remote (not much tech locally) and wait a week for Amazon.<p>Under this reasoning, don&#x27;t overlook the similar lifestyle benefits of the US Virgin Islands, if you can work remote. Some of them are already the paper headquarters for tax dodge reasons of some of the companies you could potentially remote for. (Maybe they would appreciate the irony of actually having a workforce in their &quot;headquarters&quot;.)<p>Also, too, San Juan (Puerto Rico) is a major, densely populous and diverse US city with most of what that implies in terms of amenities and such (book shops, coffee shops, fast food, etc), if you don&#x27;t mind learning at least a little bit more Spanish.')
