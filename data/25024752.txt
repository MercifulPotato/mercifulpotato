I did find a story from NJ [2] and one from KY [2] about USPS dumping mail in the trash, and some of that mail was empty ballots being sent out to voters. Do you have the specific story you are talking about?<p>The PA employee wasn’t asked to backdate ballots, he was asked to collect ballots arriving after Nov 3 in a separate bin, and he feared that his bosses would backdate them [4]. This was also in a town of 5000 people. Here is what he said:<p>“On Wednesday the fourth, we checked in at the time clock,” the anonymous postal worker told Project Veritas chief James O’Keefe. “The postmaster then told us that if we were to find any ballots on our routes that day, we were to collect them, keep them separate in a hod, which is what we call our plastic bins, bring them back, and then we would put them in another hod and then they would send them to be counted.”<p>“The postmaster (James Malia) and the supervisor (William Wood) did not say that we’re going to, we’re going to backdate them,” the whistleblower clarifies, but “I was firmly of the belief that they were going to be backdated. We’re always hit with the Hatch Act. You know, you can’t talk about politics, you can’t influence people. On one occasion, the postmaster James Malia had gone, had attacked a carrier who had expressed support for Trump.”<p>...says he overheard Malia chide Wood for having “postmarked one of the ballots for the fourth, instead of the third, because they were supposed to put them for third”.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;new-york-mailman-allegedly-kept-813-pieces-mail-including-3-n1246646" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;new-york-mailman-allege...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;07&#x2F;usps-worker-charged-after-nj-ballots-found-in-trash&#x2F;5917124002&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;07&#x2F;usps...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wlky.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-postal-worker-fired-after-more-than-100-jefferson-county-ballots-dumped-in-trash&#x2F;34396053" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wlky.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-postal-worker-fired-after-mo...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lifesitenews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;another-whistleblower-alleges-usps-backdated-late-ballots-in-pennsylvania" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lifesitenews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;another-whistleblower-alle...</a>')
