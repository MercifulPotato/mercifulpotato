I have worked hard over the years to maintain friendships and have discovered my efforts aren&#x27;t always recipricated. Stop contacting certain friends and you will find very quickly that they don&#x27;t get in touch. I have decided to spend much less time on friendships which are not mutual.<p>If you have 2 or 3 close friends you are doing well. My tips are to listen more and don&#x27;t just contact people when you are bored. Respond to people when they reach out to you, even if don&#x27;t feel like it.<p>When you are feeling sorry for yourself call someone less better off than yourself. I have an older, infirm friend and when I feel sorry for myself I often give him a call. This reminds my problems are just feelings, not real problems.<p>Finally, my best friend is my wife. Don&#x27;t ever take your partner for granted if you have one. There are very few people in the world who will ever be actively interested in you.')
