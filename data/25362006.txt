Item(by='wyldfire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607538668, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25360046, text='&gt; It&#x27;s unfortunate that Elon is leaving California given that the state has really lifted him to the pedestal he is on ... That was paid for on the backs of the people. Funny how short his memory is.<p>It would be great if he recognized this when deciding where to establish future production&#x2F;design centers.  But as an individual, I don&#x27;t think he owes any state or government an allegiance.  If you had found career success in New York State, would you feel any obligation to NYS if you had family or a new opportunity in California?  I should think not.  Nor should Musk.<p>It is interesting that Tesla is expanding with a new factory in Texas and that could be a big factor in his move.  Regardless, it&#x27;s up to him where he wants to live.<p>&gt; he doesn&#x27;t want to pay a large tax bill for the success that he has had (hence selling all property in CA).<p>I like to think I&#x27;m pretty progressive and the wealthy should definitely have a significant tax obligation.  But if he has been taxed on his wealth up until now, why would he continue to owe California?  If he wanted to leave California on terms that you would find more legitimate, how long would he have to stay or how much would he owe to leave?')
