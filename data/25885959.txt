You have to remove the engine, the gas tank, and exhaust system, and probably the transmission and swap in a motor, route battery cables, install some electronics, probably replace the engine ECU, and so on.  Probably a several day project for someone who knows exactly what they&#x27;re doing and has all the right tools and has done it many times before.<p>I think that&#x27;s okay.  It employs mechanics, who are going to have less to do as low maintenance EVs replace high maintenance gas cars.  It&#x27;s scalable in the sense that someone just has to make a kit available and if someone wants it in their car they can hire their preferred mechanic to install it.<p>Considering that we currently have a $7500 federal tax credit for new EVs and some states add a couple thousand more, if that were extended to conversions as well as new vehicles it could cover most of the cost.  If batteries get significantly cheaper such a subsidy could cover the whole cost.')
