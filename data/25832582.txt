Perhaps even to land at different spots on the runway on different landings?<p>I know it sounds far-fetched, but my mom who was the &quot;Cultural Affairs Officer&quot; at the US Embassy in San Jose Costa Rica was instructed to take a different route from home to the embassy and back every day, and to try to depart at slightly different times each trip.  This was in the late 80s when Costa Rica was a relatively safe place (it&#x27;s even safer today).')
