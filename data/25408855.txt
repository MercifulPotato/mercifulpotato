You have to loosen regulations, and importantly, you have to do massive tariffs &#x2F; sanctions on China for the next decade.<p>Part of the problem here is that the existence of some kind of universal &quot;more regulations &#x2F; less regulations&quot; slider is an illusion. It allows the problem to be cast in partisan terms when that isn&#x27;t the problem at all, because the problem isn&#x27;t more or less lines of regulatory code but rather higher or lower regulatory efficiency.<p>Some regulations save a thousand lives at a 0.02% increase in costs. Repealing those is bad. Enacting them is good. Some regulations save two lives at a 5000% increase in cost, which could equally be saved by some less expensive regulation. Enacting those is bad. Repealing them is good.<p>The real problem is that politicians lack the qualifications and incentives to do this well. If good rules don&#x27;t exist, then someone gets hurt and there is a call for &quot;more rules&quot; rather than &quot;better rules&quot;. Politicians who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing pass bad rules. The bad rules cause costs to exceed what they are in China, so manufacturing moves to China. Then the local lobby for improving the rules evaporates because there are no longer local manufacturers to propose or lobby for more efficient rules, and the continued existence of those rules on the books causes no more to form.<p>We clearly need to throw away the existing rules -- they&#x27;re not working -- the question is, how do we actually get better ones?')
