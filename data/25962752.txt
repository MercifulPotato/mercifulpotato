Yes, they are in trouble with the SEC over it).<p>3) Robinhood isn&#x27;t transparent with their users about the risks of trading options and trading on margin. Some of the barriers they&#x27;ve removed for their users to make risky bets were there for regulatory reasons, it&#x27;s not just a matter of their app being over-gamified.')
