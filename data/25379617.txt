A body is moving in a known elliptical orbit, and you would like to know where it is at any given time - eg a quarter of the way through its orbit (so going from &#x27;mean anomaly&#x27; to &#x27;eccentric anomaly&#x27;). The starting point is a handful of simple equations, of motion and gravitation. But there is no analytical expression that answers the question - you have to solve it numerically, or approximate it with a sufficiently accurate Taylor series.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kepler&#x27;s_equation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kepler&#x27;s_equation</a>')
