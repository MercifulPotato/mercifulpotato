Individuals not. Currently still ironing out things and seeking feedback so at the moment free to all so I can get maximum feedback :)<p>btw, we dont actually have any of the user&#x27;s data. We literally do not have a user database. All we have is a link to a public repo. It currently works only on public repos. So no danger of Django Doctor doing anything odd with your code because the code is already public. No risk of Django Doctor doing anything strange with your personal data because we don&#x27;t have any :)')
