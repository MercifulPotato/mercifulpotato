More trusting of authority? Less skeptical?<p>As it turns out it&#x27;s moot. The claim was the high end of a range starting at 5M. If your range is that wide you really have no business calling it an estimate. It&#x27;s a WAG - a wild ass guess. I was right to be skeptical.<p>They may as well have just said we don&#x27;t know how bad it&#x27;s going to be, but it won&#x27;t be good. And leave it there.')
