However, people who like these frameworks don&#x27;t seem to be aware that they can <i>more easily</i> compose their object graph using the structures available in most general purpose languages (literals for lists, maps, structs, etc as well as function calls and so on).<p>Arguably there&#x27;s some repetition in constructing an object graph (initializing a list of objects that vary only slightly) that one might want to DRY up, but we already know how to do that with helper functions in host languages, and anyway this is just boilerplate--it&#x27;s almost certainly not where your bugs are, and it&#x27;s not where your developers are spending their time. A framework introduces a bunch of complexity at the top level (near main()) i.e., the stuff that <i>everyone</i> from developers to testers to operators&#x2F;sysadmins will probably need to dig into at some point, and all that for no material advantage to anyone.')
