He said that the political class is dishonest, because they do take money out of the taxpayer&#x27;s pocket via inflation.<p>Presumably the grandparent sees this conduct as more dishonest than what was discussed earlier, because it does not require a accompanying public statement, which states explicitly that money is taken out of taxpayer&#x27;s pockets.')
