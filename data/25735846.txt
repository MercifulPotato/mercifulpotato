I don&#x27;t like seeing rioting and vandalism as much as the next person, but I also recognize where it came from. I&#x27;m having a tough time reconciling the capitol storming in the same manner. The only similar emotion I have is pity toward people who were clearly lied to and who have insulated themselves from rational thought.<p>To be clear I don&#x27;t ever want to see guns or explosives at a protest, nor do I want to see riots, but I also understood the anger last summer and found it difficult to condemn it when the people most affected were at their wit&#x27;s end. I get the sense that last week&#x27;s protestors were in a similar mindset, but their reasoning was highly flawed and easily debunked.<p>I&#x27;m sure anyone coming at this from a different perspective would see my view as hypocritical and I recognize that, but there&#x27;s a feeling in my heart I can&#x27;t shake about what happened last summer when it came to police brutality, one that can&#x27;t easily be broken by a whataboutism.')
