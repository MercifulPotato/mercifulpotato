When talking about vaccines or other things that generally benefit everyone, I certainly don&#x27;t have an agenda, and I expect that genuine researchers (probably most of them, just that we don&#x27;t necessarily know which) are the same. Well, unless you consider decreasing worldsuck to be an agenda.<p>Actively exposing yourself is also not something I expect to be helpful. I dove into the 5G conspiracy theory and it&#x27;s not like the statements or the people are retarded. They will bring reasonable-sounding arguments and respond to you in proper language. I needed to dig rather deep and have a really decent understanding of radio-related topics to know that there isn&#x27;t a grain of truth to it. For example, digging into sources of sources of sources, you discover that the trail runs cold. Does that mean a statement was made up, or that you just can&#x27;t find it? It&#x27;s rather hard to prove that a certain paper does <i>not</i> exist (some of the court-submitted documents referenced papers published by reputable organisations and I figured &quot;surely they don&#x27;t lie to the court, this has to be somewhere?!&quot; It&#x27;s a huge time sink and I even got help from one of the believers in digging up the reference, but I never found it and they never got back to me). And even if you find the source, how can you tell if it&#x27;s real if you don&#x27;t have a basic understanding of the topic yourself? Exposing yourself to the other side mainly helps when you currently believe the conspiracy theory, which is exactly what you&#x27;re trying to prevent in the first place. If you&#x27;re susceptible to this sort of thing, I&#x27;d not be surprised if this advice gets more people sucked into the wrong things.')
