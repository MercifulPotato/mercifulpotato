Yes its inexpensive, but say you want to run freenas (or another nas distro, or a hypervisor with a NAS). I don&#x27;t think you get out of the box support for random OSs on this device because it doesn&#x27;t adhere to any of the arm platform standards.<p>So, at this price point your probably better off with a rpi4 and a USB3 disk enclosure. The nice thing about that solution is that the RPI is slowly gaining full out of the box OS support (vmware, windows, *bsds, along with the various linux&#x27;s), it has much better cores (a72&#x27;s), and the end user isn&#x27;t limited to a 2 disk solution as there are a number of 1&#x2F;2&#x2F;4&#x2F;5&#x2F;etc bay USB3 enclosures. The end result is a flexable solution which can saturate the 1Gbit ethernet on the rpi4.')
