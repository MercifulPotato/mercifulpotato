But, since you are using your &quot;friend&quot; as an emotional appeal in an online discussion, I must propose: Maybe they weren&#x27;t as healthy as you assumed.<p>&gt; in Europe, not in a broken-healthcare country like the US.<p>So, I live in a country with a &quot;broken&quot; healthcare system... And yet, I know nobody who has had even a lengthy bout with COVID-19 upon testing positive - let alone, died from it. On top of that, I live in THE COVID-19 GROUND ZERO in North America. You come from, supposedly, a &quot;not broken&quot; healthcare system and know a 30-year-old person that died.<p>Perhaps you need to check your premise, rather than being needlessly mean to me.')
