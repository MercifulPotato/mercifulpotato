The assumption of uniform physical laws is used when theories are compared to see which is the best explanation for the evidence.<p>&gt; The idea, for example, that physical constants change over time is very much a hypothesis that is given serious consideration. It just turns out that there&#x27;s no evidence for it.<p>In fact the hypothesis that the speed of light changes over time is a component of several heterodox physical theories that have appeared over the years. Whether or not there is evidence for a theory depends entirely on the assumptions used when attempting to explain a phenomenon.')
