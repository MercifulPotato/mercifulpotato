And Spacing between Keys although I could cope with that a little easier. I find Most people who like the new M1 &#x2F; Magic Keyboard are either<p>a) Those that actually like &#x2F; have no problem with the butterfly keyboard ( Macbook 2016-2019 )but much prefer to have the reliability of old scissor ( Macbook Pre 2015 )<p>b) Those that didn&#x27;t like butterfly Keyboard but was forced to use it for work, and got a new scissors &#x2F; Magic Keyboard ( 2020 &#x2F; M1 ) would find it to be so much better than butterfly.<p>But then if you have an old scissors to compare to the key travel is just so much better.<p>Butterfly Keyboard - 0.7mm\nNew Magic Keyboard - 1.0mm\nOld Scissors Key   - 1.3mm<p>( Key Travel means the distance pressed downwards before the keystroke is recognised )<p>It is not like I didn&#x27;t spend time trying the Butterfly and the New Magic Keyboard at work. And it just didn&#x27;t work out. My MacBook Pro at home is Pre 2015. And the old scissors just give me so much more responsive feedback for only a <i>cost</i> of 0.3mm thickness.')
