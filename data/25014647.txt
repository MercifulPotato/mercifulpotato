Looking at e.g. Milwaukee county data (which can be scraped from the web), there&#x27;s at least one thing for which I don&#x27;t know the explanation: low turnout precincts seem to overwhelmingly vote for Biden, and the lower the turnout, the more pronounced the effect. Why that is I do not know, but the pattern is pretty obvious. At the same time it&#x27;s difficult to compare this with other locales because every single locale insists on having their own election results website with their own formatting. Hardly any of them have CSV data. Miami Dade county which could be used as an example of a county which Trump won, only publishes turnout stats in the form of a gigantic PDF file. I&#x27;m sure people will be looking into this for years, but in year 2020 there&#x27;s no excuse to not provide this data for free in a machine-readable format, seconds after votes are entered.')
