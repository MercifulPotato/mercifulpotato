Packages are downloaded in parallel. This means dramatically quicker dependency resolution and download times.<p>2. Packages can be separated for development versions production environments.<p>3. Poetry only pins the packages you actually care about, unlike a pip freeze. One application I work on has 15 dependencies, which yields a little over 115 packages download. pip freeze makes it impossible to track actual dependencies, whereas poetry tracks my dependencies - and the non-pinned packages are in the poetry.lock file.<p>The rest is nice, but the above is essential.')
