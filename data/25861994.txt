If you think Substack&#x27;s role is just infrastructural, you would blame the author. But if you think Substack has to provide value by cultivating good, high-quality newsletters, then you blame Substack.<p>But in either case, if you&#x27;re looking for an ad-free experience, an increase in ads will frustrate you. Even if you don&#x27;t think Substack is responsible for ads, you may be using it specifically to find ad-free content creators. The moment that guarantee vanishes from the Substack marketplace, the service becomes less valuable to you.<p>&gt;Also, newspapers have a mix of subscription and ads for decades,<p>Substack&#x27;s business model is predicated on its dissimilarity to existing publishing forms. By choosing their own subscriptions and receiving them in their inbox, a Substack customer is doing the complete opposite to going out and buying a particular broadsheet printed by someone else. I doubt any Substack customer who is paying for an ad-free experience would appreciate the comparison to a newspaper.')
