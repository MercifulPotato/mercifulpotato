Item(by='jessriedel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608136270, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25444073, text='&gt; it costs them maybe $20K to send six months worth of clothes to the ISS per astronaut on a Dragon 2<p>Maybe true now, but this wasn&#x27;t the case when this 2003 NASA article was written. It quotes &gt;$5k&#x2F;lbs for the Shuttle.  Six months of clothes for a single person wearing each article for a week is still going to run, what, at least 40lbs, or &gt;$200k.  With six people on the ISS, that&#x27;s at least few million bucks per year, and likely more.  The ISS must have been planned to last minimum 10 years (without anything cheap like Dragon on the horizon), so I think it&#x27;s still a valid question why they didn&#x27;t design a small washing machine.')
