Airbnb continues to refuse to take security seriously and won&#x27;t fulfill their host guarantee in the event that a guest causes thousands of dollars in damages. They should be an easy company to beat for long term rentals since they&#x27;re so poorly run in many ways. I don&#x27;t think they have any serious competition for very short term housing rentals ( not talking about hotels).')
