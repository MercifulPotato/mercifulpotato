He can shred with anyone, but also can do incredibly delicate picking work, and can play in the context of almost any genre you could name - blues, folk, jazz. His blending of techniques goes way beyond EVH (but undoubtedly bears some debt too). This is probably Govan&#x27;s most famous single-take solo, but he has oodles of other work at this level (though not necessarily in this style);<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IaH2C2Qe97Y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IaH2C2Qe97Y</a><p>Before him, Shawn Lane (RIP) was technically far beyond EVH, but ditched the southern speed metal he came up playing and got interested in indian classical music. Lane died young in 2003, but leaves behind an interesting legacy of work for those us interested in something far outside of &quot;rock&quot;, but ultimately strongly indebted to it.<p>You can find old videos of him shredding in the late 1990s when he was often said to be the fastest ever. This is from his work with Jonas Hellborg and two indian percussionists. The first link is to one of his more melodic sections, the second is more virtuosic and microtonal:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;8gTSCXur8rA?t=68" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;8gTSCXur8rA?t=68</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;8gTSCXur8rA?t=377" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;8gTSCXur8rA?t=377</a><p>Also, shout out to Tosin Abasi:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OTi9y2-VnNY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OTi9y2-VnNY</a><p>he&#x27;s definitely more directly indebted to EVH, but more modern and arguably more technique, technology and maybe just a shade more jazz.<p>Further, or maybe differently, outside the of &quot;rock&quot; scope, and on acoustic guitar, people like Kaki King have taken the &quot;extended technique&quot; approach of Michael Hedges and run with it. She is off-the scale talented, although to be fair a lot of her music doesn&#x27;t connect with me.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Os6-0_uYAq8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Os6-0_uYAq8</a>')
