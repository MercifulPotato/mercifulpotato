Chinese lives don&#x27;t matter much, they are not Americans. Commies live on scraps. Such acts of othering make it easy to circumvent your conscience, this is the foundation of all war and crimes against humanity.<p>Then, of course, there are also the real bastards, those without conscience, who couldn&#x27;t care less. They also don&#x27;t care about American lives, or even their friends or family for that matter. The dumb ones end up in jail and the smart bastards end up running a company.<p>The rest of us just goes along with what everybody else does, we are too busy anyway to really reflect on our behavior. Need to buy more presents for the holidays!')
