My understanding is that the squad came up with without the consent of the party establishment by running an exceptional ground game during their primaries, in districts that were safe blue, and had politicians who&#x27;d become too comfortable where they were at.<p>They were an unknown threat before.<p>Caruso-Cabrera did raise quite a bit of money to unseat AOC, but most of the endorsements I can find seem to be from conservative organizations looking to score some kind of moral victory against the Justice Dems. My estimate is that a political novice with (some) name recognition tried to take her down of her own accord, and AOC&#x27;s pissed off enough corporations and conservatives that she incidentally (or deliberately) walked into a money pit in doing so.<p>I may have missed it, but I haven&#x27;t seen anything to indicate that the DNC has spun up its machinery to truly run a full-throated opposition opp against her.<p>I&#x27;d have to do more research on the rest of them, but I don&#x27;t believe the squad&#x27;s faced the kind of push-back that the party&#x27;s capable of yet.')
