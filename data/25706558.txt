Far more time is spent on maintaining code than on initial development, and anyway, typing speed isn&#x27;t the bottleneck for writing new code.<p>Code review? You&#x27;re in the business of reading code. Fixing bugs? You&#x27;re in the business of reading code. Modifying&#x2F;extending&#x2F;porting an existing codebase? You&#x27;re in the business of reading code.<p>If you&#x27;re writing trivial single-use &#x27;throwaway&#x27; code that needs no review, then readability doesn&#x27;t much matter, but it&#x27;s an important factor for just about all serious codebases.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s also the question of whether Ada&#x27;s specific syntax really succeeds in being more readable. It makes extensive use of English words in ways that are sometimes awkward and unnatural. I&#x27;m not a fan of its <i>and then</i> &#x2F; <i>or else</i> short-circuit operators, for instance, and think they should just have gone with something like C&#x27;s <i>&amp;&amp;</i> &#x2F; <i>||</i> operators. Neither syntax is self-explanatory to someone who doesn&#x27;t know the language, but at least C&#x27;s syntax doesn&#x27;t counterintuitively collide with English.')
