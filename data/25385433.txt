Item(by='gjulianm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607693216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25385076, text='&gt; You are not discussing what a lie is<p>That&#x27;s precisely the point I&#x27;m making, nobody needs to decide what is a lie or what is not. Social media amplifies lies not by knowing what is a lie, but because of their nature. Lies generate more controversy and more discussion, true facts generate agreement but not a lot of discussion and engagement. Reduce the importance of &quot;engagement metrics&quot; in the algorithms that show you content, make them as straightforward as possible (chronological order for example), reduce or eliminate suggestions of &quot;content you might like&quot; and only show content you explicitly subscribed to. At no point anyone needs to say &quot;this is a lie&#x2F;truth&quot;, you just need to change incentives.')
