That said, I’d hesitate call it the ultimate no-code tool mostly for mundane reasons: no version control, no comments, unconstrained with multiple ways to do something, limited scalability past a certain size or data, no user facing “front end” (e.g. an online form). I’m therefore very hesitant to say that excel is the best we can do. In fact I’m quite sure there’s a multi hundred billion dollar low code product waiting to be built and no shortage of people trying to figure out what it is.')
