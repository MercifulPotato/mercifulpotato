It is white antiracist perspective and also kind of propaganda for anti violent racism.<p>It is not the only white perspective, white are various. But, it lacks any perspective but white. It has no black person with agency or personality. No actual personality. Victim is super clear victim, not even ability to do crime is there. Victim is not threatening or uncomfortable to whites, he could not possibly be less clear model victim.<p>The book actually made political impact. In historical context, it is and was actual thing. But not necessary same impact for 2020 black student. And even this discussion lacks discussion about actual back then politics. Because that actually feels bad. Because people don&#x27;t actually want to teach 13 years old about postcards with lynching victims being popular.')
