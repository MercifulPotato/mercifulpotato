But after a while I managed to get over that as well.<p>It was practice, that&#x27;s all. It got easier after a while.<p>There were two things that helped quite a lot (besides that I worked for decent people the entire time)<p>First, I told a few people who would contact me after hours frequently thay I wouldn&#x27;t reply after office hours but that they&#x27;re free to contact me and I&#x27;d get back to them first thing. And I always did. I also told them not to call unless shit is on fire. When they did call if things were on fire I&#x27;d fix them immediately, but if they weren&#x27;t I&#x27;d repeat to not call me and told them I&#x27;d handle it tomorrow.<p>Second was to make a dedicated work area. In the beginning I was in a small shared apartment and the desk was next to my bed. After I&#x27;d moved  to a bigger place I had a spot in the living room made up as my &quot;office&quot;. I&#x27;d not use that space for anything else. It was just the corner where there desk and the chair were but I&#x27;d not sit at the desk or use that chair other than while at work.<p>I&#x27;d guess it took about a six months for this to be normal but it survived changing jobs.')
