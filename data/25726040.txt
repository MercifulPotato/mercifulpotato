Both sound more harsh than regular suspension and both sound less harsh than permanently banned.  Neither one tells you exactly what they&#x27;ve done in terms of the amount of effort required to re-instate him if they change their mind.  Both signal that they&#x27;re unlikely to change their minds any time soon.<p>With a physical location, &quot;banned&quot; sometimes implies they&#x27;ve been declared a persona non grata, and the police will be called if they return.  Clearly that doesn&#x27;t apply to an online platform.')
