More input is basically a substitute for studying grammar, or even superior, because the brain is phenomenal at pattern matching. Bad grammar will sound &quot;off&quot; well before you understand the rule in your own language, same thing happens when learning new languages, given sufficient input.<p>It takes a leap of faith but learning grammar almost exclusively through example sentences is actually really efficient.<p>Krashen, Khatzumoto, Matt vs. Japan, and Antimoon are all worth reading if you want to go down this rabbit hole.<p>How you absorb the grammar of a language is a separate question from when you should do conversations though.<p>Some folks advocate conversation day one, but most pro-input folks do recommend waiting until you have a sense of how things work and can make fewer mistakes.<p>EDIT: One of the best articles explaining this anti-rule view: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.antimoon.com&#x2F;how&#x2F;input-gramrules.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.antimoon.com&#x2F;how&#x2F;input-gramrules.htm</a>')
