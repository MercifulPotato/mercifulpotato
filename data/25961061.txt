That assumes they didn&#x27;t increase exposure as the price went up and it ignores the borrow cost.<p>They then lost a bunch of money on options the exact amount of which we don&#x27;t know. They also lost a whole bunch of money on other positions going against them which we don&#x27;t know but can guess at.<p>To get to a 3bn loss (which btw is just a guessed number based on how much new capital they took)you probably only need to assume they are down around 10% on the rest of the short book (ex GME) which under the circumstances is entirely plausible. That assumes they run something like 200% gross exposure with an evenly balanced book with 12.5bn aum.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where the conspiracy is here. 3bn is a huge number to lose in a week but it looks roughly right given what happened and it&#x27;s not exactly unprecedented either.')
