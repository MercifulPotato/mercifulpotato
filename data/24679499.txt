Repaving a mile of third avenue in Seattle costs a lot more than a mile of downtown Wendell, Idaho which will cost a lot more than chip sealing a mile of dirt road just two miles away from the center of Wendell. Salaries are more expensive in big cities. The job is more complex as the amount of infrastructure beneath the road surface, which requires ongoing access, so lots of man holes. Repaving in a dense urban center requires removing the old pavement, in a rural setting it’ll just be piled on top until it’s been layered four or five times.')
