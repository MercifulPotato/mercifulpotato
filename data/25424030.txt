The depression has deeper roots and should have come anyway but hasn&#x27;t been recognized by mainstream Western economical science b&#x2F;c of its decades long monoculture of sorts. Economics only recognizes recessions, the cyclic crises, but has no models or even a suitable language for describing another type of crises. This type of crisis was known in the USSR as the fall of capital effectiveness.<p>The problem is that the dominant global economical model has the limit which has been reached. The limiting factor is supply chain length which at some point inevitably makes investments too risky.
