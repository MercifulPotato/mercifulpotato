When I was in the EU in summer 2019 (I&#x27;m American), their AI decided it didn&#x27;t likWrye my new location. It also kindly emailed me, asking me to verify that this &quot;suspicious sign-in attempt&quot; was actually me. Which, of course, required me to sign in. I will leave you to guess whether the token in the url from the email was sufficient proof that it really was me, or whether this sign-in was also flagged, generating a new email, etc.')
