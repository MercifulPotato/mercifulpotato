Item(by='onassar', descendants=1, kids=[25903976], score=9, time=1611587398, title='Show HN: Retrospective on having my “Show HN” on the front-page', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I was lucky enough to have my site trending on Friday (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25872922). It’s an icon site that lists open source icons.<p>I wanted to share some stats on the results after 3 days. Worth noting was that I submitted it on a Friday morning (at which point I went for a walk and a coffee; eek).<p>- 24,997 page views.\n I (embarrassingly) didn’t have GA set up when I first submitted it, so this is probably missing a few hundred page views<p>- 21 “feedback” emails (half of which were spam).\n I assume such a high percentage of these were spam because my Feedback form didn’t require email addresses.<p>- 5 note-worthy emails from people which may result in some sort of collaboration<p>- 10 mailing list subscriber sign ups.\nRunning through MailChimp, and it’s not emphasized <i>at all</i> (eg. just a link in the footer). Purposefully not email-gating people to download, since I want this to be a very developer-centric site, and it feels a bit unsettling to email-gate other people’s digital content.<p>- 2,670 icon downloads<p>- 74 comments.\n A big caveat to this one: I replied to almost every comment. The thinking is that if someone took the time to comment (even just a “thanks”), I wanted to take the time to reply to them as well.<p>Also, I purposefully didn’t reply to people who were commenting on their own alternative services. Perhaps a tad uncouth, but I didn’t want to shine a light on a comment that was designed to detract from my submission. I would have made an exception if there was substance to those comments beyond the detraction.<p>- One founder from a related (and leading) service (Flaticon) jumping into the comments.\nI really appreciated this. Similar to how Patrick Collison (of Stripe) is often seen replying to comments on Stripe-related posts. This founder submitted thoughtful replies to people’s criticisms, which I thought was quite considerate.')
