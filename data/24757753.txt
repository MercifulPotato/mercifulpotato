But it can&#x27;t be used as an excuse to pay talent poorly. For their part, my current employer made my pay about 10% less when I went from working in Seattle to going remote in Cincinnati, and that felt more or less OK since it worked out to a slight raise thanks to lower expenses. Had they gone with the &quot;market rate&quot; for an engineer here though, I would have gotten easily a 50% pay cut since there aren&#x27;t any &quot;big tech&quot; companies around here. It&#x27;s a tricky balancing act.')
