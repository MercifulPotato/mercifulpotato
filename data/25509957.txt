The definition of a legitimate regime (going back to Locke&#x27;s treatise on government) is one that has consent of the people. Democracy (as a whole system in its many diverse forms) and elections (as <i>part</i> of that system to sample the people directly), and self-government itself: where you and your ordinary civilian neighbors are physically involved in the governance of your locality, rather than cadres sent from the central government -- the confluence of all of this is legitimacy.')
