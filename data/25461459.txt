Those are two fundamentally different things.<p>I’m not saying you should hide the fact that you’re doing it. I’m saying it should be stated in the privacy policy.<p>Also remember that there is a big difference between ‘personally identifiable information’ and ‘sensitive information’ which are clearly separated concepts in GDPR. Not all collection of data requires active consent.<p>I did read my EU state’s guideline on GDPR in full, but I’m not an expert. I would suggest reading up on the ePrivacy Directive though, which is still in effect.')
