It&#x27;s fair to say that I was mostly dismissed. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25058952" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25058952</a><p>And this is why I won&#x27;t be moving to Apple silicon. Apple already has the ability to restrict whats apps I can run (they can simply toggle a switch for all users to &quot;no unsigned binaries&quot;), and congrats! Apple is the sole decider of what we get to use on our computers.<p>Of course Apple&#x27;s Craig Federighi assures us that the people making such assertions are &quot;tools&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Hg9F1Qjv3iU?t=3177" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Hg9F1Qjv3iU?t=3177</a> , timestamp 53:33) and they have no intention whatsoever of taking away our ability to do general compute on the machines we buy and own.<p>Except...<p>Apple can already decide what binaries you can execute. Should they choose to.<p>Apple is now restricting what other OSes you can boot into. As they&#x27;ve chosen to.<p>Apple can now make their machine reject a new, third-party repair part like a bad transplant. Should they choose to.<p>It&#x27;s clear where they&#x27;re going. And I&#x27;m jumping ship. It&#x27;s painful to do so, given how invested I am in the ecosystem, but we&#x27;re already beyond the threshold that many of us would have left earlier in the decade.<p>---<p>edit - It&#x27;s also really hard as a designer + developer + would-be researcher in the making to find a good computer. Most non-Apple laptops don&#x27;t have very good color accuracy. They also don&#x27;t have good trackpads, and their keyboard + trackpad alignment is wonky (it&#x27;s off-center in a lot of cases! How weird is that???)<p>I&#x27;m trying to find a laptop with good build quality, long battery life, a good display that I can design on, a good trackpad so that I don&#x27;t have to carry around a mouse, good speakers would be a plus, and light enough that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m lifting weights while working on my laptop. And this package should ideally come with 512GB of SSD storage and, at least, 16GB to 32GB of RAM.<p>Oh and it shouldn&#x27;t be <i>more</i> expensive than a Mac as many of these laptops are!<p>Any suggestions?')
