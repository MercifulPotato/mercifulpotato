That was a fun time. I happened to have Firefox and an IRC Client opened. I tried a few different things (on the advice of others in an IRC channel I happened to be in), but eventually a friend created a VM of the same Linux Distro and then compressed his &#x2F;bin and sent it to me -- along with a few required programs to uncompress it just in case. That was a fun day or two. Taught me a few important things though!')
