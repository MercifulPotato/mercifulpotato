Why should digital platforms be any different?<p>The vaunted Arab Spring in this plea had a pretty mixed outcome. Libya is a messs, Egypt ended up with another dictator after overthrowing a democratically elected organization (which the west didnt want, but was the only viable party after the same said west pushed for quick elections), and Syria ended up with a civil war, ISIS and same regime after every western and digital platform insisted for years that the regime was on its last legs.<p>The only platform that didnâ€™t restrict Trump was twitter. Even (most of) Fox opposed him until it was clear he was going to mop up the primaries. He may be mainstream now, \nbut the states and platforms have closed that loophole for now.')
