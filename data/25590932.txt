But that&#x27;s a good thing, since Trump&#x27;s populism and China policy is widely hailed by anybody knowledgeable as not only a good start, but done in a remarkably (unbelievably) short timespan.<p>Sadly, the CCP&#x27;s 9-dashed line policy has caused the biggest international arms race in Asia since WW2.<p>Even Japan is militarizing on all axes and will probably build nuclear ICBMs to defend themself against China&#x2F;N. Korea. (They make ICBMs, they just need to add warheads.)<p>There is a very high risk of war with China until the CCP will accept &quot;No.&quot; as an answer from other countries. Xi is an uneducated thug, and historically that means bombing cities to remove thugs from power.<p>(The CCP can be neutralized by the West decoupling, and the US revoking their capital market access, which was done to the Soviet Union.)<p>Happy New Year to Mr. Pompeo and family - I didn&#x27;t know a big guy had that much energy (he did more earth orbits than an astronaut in the past year for meetings with partners and rebuilding of coalition members after the Obama foreign policy wasteland.)')
