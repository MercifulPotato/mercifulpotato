Generally agree with the above but would add:<p><pre><code>   - NLP applications, many practitioners and judges may not trust the software especially if implemented by a hobbyist and prefer many paralegals review manually.  I&#x27;d pursue this more out of interest or to solve a personal workflow issue but be wary of generalising unless it becomes your main focus.\n   - Integrations with word&#x2F;excel can definitely be useful. I wrote a bunch of simple VBA add-ons in Excel to help with mundane parts of managing a large e-discovery. But I found it a real slog to learn the word&#x2F;excel specific stuff, so wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a first hobbyist project.\n   - Learning how to ingest various docs and do regex saved me the most time. If you do a lot of e-discovery and your firm&#x27;s platform of choice supports regex just learning that grammar is probably the best bang for buck.  Downloading and searching a smaller number if files locally can also be good. Was always disappointed when the files I wanted were in a &quot;secure&quot; dealroom so I couldn&#x27;t legitimately download or scrape them.</code></pre>')
