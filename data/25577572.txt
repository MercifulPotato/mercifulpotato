In my familly, it&#x27;s the polite and sensitive way to eat. Same expectation when visiting friends. Really few are overweight.<p>Since I moved to Japan, I learned that here too food is treated with the same deference : &quot;you shall not let a grain of rice left in your bowl&quot; is basic table decency.
