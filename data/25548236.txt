The Delock 26297 (which needs to be imported from Germany) can hit about 250 MHz, which is enough for most uses.  Unfortunately, the connector is total rubbish and causes serious signal integrity issues.  I have two and one of them can barely hit 150 MHz.<p>There is a USB-C option which can supposedly hit 300 MHz.<p>RAMDACs hit 400 MHz.  It’s a real shame they’re not in new cards.  Hence my point: VGA is dead because it isn’t in new hardware.')
