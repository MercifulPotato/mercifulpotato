Moreover, it&#x27;s fairly easy to explicitly target demographics.<p>If TikTok ads were being seen by quite a lot of 35 year old men, then this was part of TikTok&#x27;s strategy.<p>It&#x27;s foolish to spend a lot of money on such ads without having some measure of their effectiveness and FB and Google actually do give tons of data.<p>Compare this to TV or print, wherein advertisers have only a very crude idea of who is seeing their ads.<p>As someone who buys ads myself, Facebook is frankly probably the best platform in terms of being able to access large audiences with decent data, and frankly getting decent activity from the ads.<p>Google keywords are good for only specific things and most banner ad networks are worthless.')
