They had to compete mightily over comparative trump change for an upgrade to an electron-ion collider? (RHIC won but JLAB will contribute)<p>There are plenty of other areas of real research that are still nominally &#x27;particle&#x27; physics that are actually able to put to paper real goals for what they expect to achieve.<p>There are also facilities like NSLS II that are heavily subscribed and doing research that is both very real world and pie in the sky.<p>Keep this in mind too - the Tevatron at FNAL would have had the Higgs discovery if they could have run another 3-5 years - they already had data order 3 sigma IIRC.  Likewise, they would have had a lot more data on the top, something LHC has been gathering since the confirmation of the Higgs.  This would have come at a fraction of the cost of the  Higgs.  Beyond that, has Higgs done anything more than add to the already known to be narrow avenues left for SUSY?<p>She is absolutely correct that the particle physics community needs their feet held to the fire to justify such an enormous single outlay and being a jobs program for a few thousand physicists is not one of them.')
