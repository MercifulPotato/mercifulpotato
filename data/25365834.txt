Rubio is the head chair of the committee that drafted the report. The report agreed with him.<p>&gt;You are not addressing the central point of the SIC volume 5 report: Trump and his campaign engaged in criminal and unethical activity with Russian ex-spies, agents run by Russia and oligarchs.<p>Except it says the exact opposite of that...')
