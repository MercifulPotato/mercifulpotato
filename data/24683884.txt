For electiric&#x27;s it&#x27;s not as much about speed but battery. Maybe having hyper-miler distance races that aren&#x27;t speed oriented is the sort of pivot F1 should be doing? I know it&#x27;s not sexy like a fast car moving nimbly among the pack but if car companies can get their tech focused on getting the most distance from a battery then there&#x27;s the cross over development that can flow to the mainstream.<p>But I know, watching a slow race is a big ask.')
