The problem is the amplification of that speech by algorithms optimizing for &quot;engagement&quot; which practically speaking ends up being synonymous with &quot;conflict&quot;. The medium lends itself to spreading bullshit and outrage, not quiet reflection, empathy and &#x27;thinking for yourself&#x27;. Lies simply scale better than truth, outrage scales better than understanding and clickbait scales better than accurate headlines. As if that&#x27;s not bad enough on its own, authoritarian states have realized the potential in this, and weaponized it, by using sock puppet accounts and targeted advertisement to further amplify division and conspiracy theories, as a concerted attack on the electorate of western democracies.')
