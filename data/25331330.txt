For example in combinatorics, some people define 0^0 = 1, so that lots of formulas with &quot;if x == 0 then this else that&quot; just collapse into &quot;that&quot;. (Other people insist on inventing a different symbol for this &quot;special exponentiation&quot;, but I think that&#x27;s unnecessary myself.)<p>For the same reason, an empty sum is defined as 0 and an empty product as 1, so your base cases of some inductions don&#x27;t require an extra &quot;if&quot;.')
