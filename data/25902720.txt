It&#x27;s unclear why they&#x27;re not showing on record; we initially understood it to be due to Covid delays, but we&#x27;re now chasing the accountants to out find the specifics.  If there turn out to be any fines due to late filing, these would not come out of donations, but whoever&#x27;s fault it actually is for the delay (i.e. the accountants).<p>Sorry for the drama, but this is not reason for panic.<p>(Separately we need to publish a summary of the accounts for <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;foundation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;foundation</a>, which we are indeed running late on: it&#x27;s been hard to prioritise it when we&#x27;re on fire trying to improve Matrix&#x27;s mass-market usability, given stuff like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25812536" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25812536</a>).')
