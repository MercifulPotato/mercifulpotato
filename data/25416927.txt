But, in a molten-salt reactor, the vessel and heat exchangers are equivalent to fuel assemblies. Dispose the vessel and heat exchangers similar to Zr-clad million dollar fuel assemblies.(PWR&#x2F;BWR reload costs $60-100 million per 12-18 months.)<p>Material wise Zr clad is way more expensive than stainless 3XX &amp; graphite combined. Even if Ni-alloy is used in disposable MSRs Ni-alloy+graphite will be slightly cheaper. (Base metal costs:\nZr metal: ~$22,700&#x2F;ton\nNi metal: ~$13,100&#x2F;ton)<p>Many actinides have volatile fluorides. Fluoride volatility is a proven process used to enrich uranium for LWRs. Fuel salt can be disposed after recovering U &amp; Pu. Vacuum distillation is physical separation, which can also be used to further recover expensive base salt FLi7Be. No vacuum distillation is necessary if inexpensive salt is used.')
