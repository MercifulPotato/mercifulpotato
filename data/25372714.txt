The information was also not provided when he or she clicked on the button “Access now”.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Wow. I though those reminders were about some updated policy, I didn&#x27;t realise they were supposed to ask for consent.<p>Could someone try standing with a sign saying &quot;A reminder from me&quot; in the google offices reception for 2 minutes and then walk out with whatever wasn&#x27;t bolted down to see if they themselves consider that an adequate way to ask for consent?')
