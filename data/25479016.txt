I&#x27;m a big fan of other similar-ish games like Deus Ex, Fallout, and Borderlands, and I can say Cyberpunk has done a great job of delivering some of the best components of each of those.  There are a few bugs, the worst of which caused me to lose 10 min of progress, having to load back a save.  But there were plenty of bugs in Fallout New Vegas and that is easily one of my favorite RPGs.')
