I managed to rebuild my entire application—all of the work I&#x27;d done over the past few weeks—in a few hours with Nexus. Perhaps it was my specific use case, or because I&#x27;m a front-end dev primarily, but it really felt like one of those &quot;this is what I&#x27;ve been looking for&quot; moments at the time, similar to how I remember feeling about Vue.js back in 2015. I really like what I see from the Prisma team and I hope I get more chances to use Nexus in future. Congratulations on the release!')
