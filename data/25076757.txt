I have a Mac and was unable to do any work for around an hour, had no idea why. Windows has smart screen, but if the service is unreachable you get a popup. This is just completely unacceptable, if it&#x27;s possible that a server issue could cause all apps to fail locally, there should at least be a popup explaining that&#x27;s why nothing is working. I&#x27;m fed up with far more than just this. I&#x27;m saying any temptation I had for an M1 Mac is now gone.')
