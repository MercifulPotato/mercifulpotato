You are aware the &quot;60 lawsuits being dismissed&quot; is a lie right? Trump campaign only filed 5 lawsuits. The Georgia lawsuit still hasn&#x27;t even had a judge assigned even though it was filed on December 4th. The TX lawsuit to the SCOTUS - they refused to even hear it.<p>So how exactly can you say &quot;illegitimate claims been promoted as legitimate&quot;?<p>Thousands of dead people, illegals, underage voters, poll watchers getting kicked out etc and they still want people to believe everything is normal?<p>Here&#x27;s an entire list of dead voters from Michigan alone and their obituaries:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justpaste.it&#x2F;8zt04" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justpaste.it&#x2F;8zt04</a><p>Can easily be verified here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mvic.sos.state.mi.us&#x2F;Voter&#x2F;Index&#x2F;#yourclerk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mvic.sos.state.mi.us&#x2F;Voter&#x2F;Index&#x2F;#yourclerk</a><p>--------<p>EDIT:<p>It seems like HN has banned me from commenting replies to the reply to this comment.<p>They have deleted the evidence now. 1 month ago when I tested this, it worked and it specifically gave me this:<p>CATHERINE,KELLY,1915,48708<p>Month: April<p>and it worked:<p>Absentee ballot\nElection date\n11&#x2F;3&#x2F;2020<p>Application received\n10&#x2F;6&#x2F;2020<p>Ballot sent\n10&#x2F;6&#x2F;2020<p>Ballot received\n10&#x2F;13&#x2F;2020<p>Here&#x27;s the obituary:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legacy.com&#x2F;obituaries&#x2F;name&#x2F;catherine-kelly-obituary?pid=182910219" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legacy.com&#x2F;obituaries&#x2F;name&#x2F;catherine-kelly-obitu...</a><p>It sounds like MI has now purged the data to hide evidence. Here&#x27;s the data which was even retrieved using a script.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;XEi5Uy6t" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;XEi5Uy6t</a><p>I even have saved messages of me showing this to multiple friends of mine.<p>No, the two dead voters you mentioned is firstly NOT from Michigan, it&#x27;s from Georgia. Also that two dead voters is also wrong. It&#x27;s thousands in Georgia but the SOS (who is a Trump hater) refused to even give the list of voters. So they expect the public to just take their word without showing the actual voter rolls. &quot;Trust me, everything&#x27;s fine, nothing to see here, move along&quot;.')
