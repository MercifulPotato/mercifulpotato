Most large state universities in the US are likely to have different physics &#x2F; chemistry &#x2F; math courses for students heading in different directons.  Not all intro physics courses will be calculus-based, yet some of the students in those courses will still have to take calculus.<p>Many US medical schools, for example, silll require 1 semester calculus and some physics, but I don&#x27;t think the physics course needs to be calculus-based.  Many used to require a second calculus, but I think that has largely shifted to biostatistics instead.')
