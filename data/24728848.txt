It&#x27;s a prebuilt from Escom with Intel 486, 256MB disk, not sure about RAM, and combined with HP Deskjet 510 printer. The only thing it needs from time to time is to replace the CMOS battery and unclog the ink cartridge (there&#x27;s a bottle of liquor right next to the printer). It&#x27;s used almost daily and has outlived several generations of other PCs in the office.')
