Constantly showing off his wealth to his viewers (live streaming on yatches, showing them his waitresses and his catered meals). His motives are correct but I wouldn&#x27;t trust EVERYTHING he says. I would take a lot of things he says with a grain of salt. He&#x27;s a chinese Alex Jones... He&#x27;s spread some pretty ridiculous claims, such as saying Biden won&#x27;t be inagurated come inaguration day that it&#x27;ll still either be Trump or the Nancy Pelosi.... I&#x27;ve had family members listen to him and they&#x27;ve slowly gone down a rabbit hole full or ridiculous conspiracy theories')
