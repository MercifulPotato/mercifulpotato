If things change around you when you change the past, then by definition some events will have happened, and others not (otherwise NOTHING would change, including your arrival in the past, and therefore time travel cannot occur). After all, a single breath you took at a specific point in time is an event. Waking up 2 seconds later is an event. Using your left foot first as you walked out of the house that day instead of the right is an event. So who decides which events are &quot;important&quot; enough that &quot;forces bring Past Event X into being&quot;? You&#x27;d need some kind of omniscient, omnipotent intelligence in order to accomplish that.<p>The very logic behind this idea is a contradiction.')
