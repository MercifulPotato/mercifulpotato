This is because I want companies to be able to use the software for their internal use but not be able to create a user-facing product out of it.<p>That&#x27;s the whole point of the AGPL, isn&#x27;t it?  This license solves <i>exactly</i> the problem that you want to solve.  They can use your AGPL software internally as much as they want, without restrictions.  But if they create a user-facing product out of it, they must make their modifications available to everybody under the same terms.<p>(EDIT: changed you&#x2F;they on the second paragraph)')
