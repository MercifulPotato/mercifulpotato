So i might as well type two and maintain hand memory consistency.<p>So as far as i’m concerned, it’s a no-op in practice.  For myself i learned two-space long ago, my hands are unlikely to retrain themselves to type otherwise, and it’s probably a slight legibility help in docstrings and latex source.<p>edit: as i edit this on my phone i realize that one place this doesn’t work is on an on-screen keyboard. There, typing the second space too quickly usually inserts another period!')
