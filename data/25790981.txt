The strange thing is, I can only remember the numbers but not the true feeling. It is kind of surreal. I should be grateful every day that I am not in that condition and have much more juice&#x2F;spoons available. Another thing is, no matter how many spoons you have, there is always Parkinsons law to burn through them in an unreasonable way.')
