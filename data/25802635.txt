As outlined in the article, &quot;reality&quot; varies based on where you get what you consider &quot;information.&quot;<p>One perspective is that centuries of systemic racism lead to Black Lives Matter protests, which were largely peaceful. Social media was a tool used to organize the protests, but did not lead to them.<p>One perspective is that decades of polarization has led to more extreme views further from an objective reality, which was further enabled and amplified by social media.<p>One of those realities argues that a massive conspiracy coordinated a secret interference with the election, so that Joe Biden won (but Republicans were allowed to gain quite a few seats in Congress.)<p>(Yes you can tell which reality I believe, and I can&#x27;t quite figure out what reality is believed by those that support the invasion of the Capitol building. Perhaps someone can educate me.)<p>If you cannot agree on some of the above perspectives, then we aren&#x27;t starting from a shared reality in which we can debate which comments are justified, which are biased, which are uninformed.')
