I know about the real world, costs and pragmatism etc. No actual scientist should ever be proud to refuse any replication attempts to allow verification. Its that simple. Fundamentally that should be enough to initiate various investigation towards disciplinary proceedings. Its that serious a offence, eg a form of corruption.<p>Fake scientists, charlatans, &quot;science believers&quot;, science authoritarians... sure. But who wants them around?<p>Admitting a mistake is actually good science.')
