It wasn&#x27;t even worse than the average desert dust levels I deal with regularly in the high desert around JT, which are a far cry from BRC playa.<p>There&#x27;s just more moisture&#x2F;humidity in general around the Salton Sea, that goes a long way towards keeping dust clumpy and on the ground.<p>BRC is next level misery in this department.  I attended once in 2012 and left with my first ever sinus infection, that took a month to clear, and for at least a <i>year</i> afterwards every time I got a cold or otherwise congested (which newly became common) my snot would taste of playa dust.  It&#x27;s fucking awful.  I&#x27;m convinced the dust in BRC dust storms shorten life expectancy of those breathing it.<p>If you&#x27;re lucky enough to attend BRC after a recent good rain, then it&#x27;s a much better situation.  But that&#x27;s moot; the same is true for Salton Sea or any desert region.  The Salton Sea enjoys the advantage of a persistent local moisture reservoir, for now.  The nearby agriculture responsible for the effluent sustaining the Salton Sea also humidifies the air.')
