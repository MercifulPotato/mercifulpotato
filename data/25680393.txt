A lot of national monuments, reserve areas, national parks, etc... have the same issue where they have their smaller police that never does anything and only patrols inside.<p>If there&#x27;s evidence that you broke into a building anywhere in Washington, like, your face or outfit matching 100% the one of someone that was seen on national TV desecrating the building, the Metro police has cause to arrest you anywhere in Washington. There&#x27;s so much precedent to this it&#x27;s completely mind-blowing they didn&#x27;t do anything. If it was so easy to get away with storming the Capitol we would already have a hippie commune in there. The Capitol Police is a joke.')
