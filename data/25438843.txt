In theory Firefox could do the resolution as normal and then if it doesn&#x27;t come back as loopback replace it with 127.0.0.1. That would be perfectly within the letter of the RFC, since noneo f the stuff above it MUST-level requirements, but probably not really within its spirit, since it would violate the &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot; bit.<p>Could a check to see if the name is &quot;localhost&quot; or &quot;*.localhost&quot; suffice to satisfy the &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot; requirement?<p>From the bugzilla comment:<p>&gt; It seems reasonable to extend that to support any &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts assertions that fall into 127.0.0.0&#x2F;8, but that&#x27;s not something we&#x27;ve heard a whole lot of interest in, though there have certainly been one-off requests.<p>That does seem reasonable to me, and it covers more than just &quot;localhost&quot; names.<p>I do understand that most uses probably do not require resolution of localhost names to other than 127.0.0.1. I may also be a little annoyed that I&#x27;ll have to make some changes to something I&#x27;ve been doing for a long time.<p>Thank you for your research and your replies.')
