As expected of it being a Google phone, the software is very good and you get updates before anyone else. The camera is also good, especially the software, but I miss not having a wide angle lens and manual ISO&#x2F;focus&#x2F;exposure controls. Battery life isn&#x27;t great compared to other phones but I charge overnight so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I also like the form factor a lot, it&#x27;s quite thin which makes it much easier to use one-handed.')
