Now it&#x27;s the dev branch of RHEL. And it won&#x27;t even benefit from being the dev branch, there is no way RedHat is releasing security updates in it before RHEL gets them.<p>So all updates and bugfixes will be pushed to CentOS Stream first, but they&#x27;ll go out of their way to circumvent this for security patches. Just because of their paying customers.<p>Makes sense but it&#x27;s kinda funny.<p>The OP is mostly about being a Debian fanboy.<p>It doesn&#x27;t even consider that Fedora uses pretty much the same level of packages that Debian has and offers stable release upgrades for 6 years now.<p>Because Fedora has no such thing as LTS. But is that really necessary if you treat it like a rolling release?<p>I&#x27;m of course a RHEL fanboy and I love stuff like SElinux and yum&#x2F;dnf too much to go back to Debian.')
