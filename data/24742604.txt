For example the camera clocks at 60fps, but the image processing is a few frames late, the gyroscope clocks at 4kHz, the accelerometer way slower, lidar is a slug, etc. Then you have to get all that stuff in your kalman filter to estimate the state and the central question is: “when did you collect this data?” I guess “no clue it comes from USB then disappeared into a GPU pipeline” is not a scientifically sound answer, you want to know if it goes before or after sample no 3864 of the gyroscope.<p>Long story short, that’s good, you’ve used a neural net to avoid using a human or an animal as a pose estimation datum, how do you correlate that to the rest of the sensor suite?')
