The parent comment pointed out some hard facts about nutrient density and farming logistics, and how the current model for vertical farming won&#x27;t solve world hunger, on a nutritional level.<p>You respond with a qualitative argument that you can grow a business and&#x2F;or industry and maje better technologies if you have profit.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t that the technology isn&#x27;t good enough, it&#x27;s that there isn&#x27;t as many nutrients (as in soil) in a city or apartment to grow highly nutritional food. You&#x27;d have to truck in bags of soil to do this, which isn&#x27;t nearly as efficient as leaving the soil where it is and growing it there.')
