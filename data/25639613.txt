Supports my cost of living and higher than most people my age, but a little underpaid compared to most Software Engineers in the US.<p>The thing I don&#x27;t like is my actual work. From the day I got here (3 years ago) I&#x27;ve found the work to be really boring 90% of the time. I would prefer to work somewhere that I can work on an actual product from start to finish. And also work on products that have some actual value to them. I don&#x27;t really care much for the code, I&#x27;m more interested in building products and optimizing them and learning along the way.&quot;<p>Pretty much my same situation, but I hate my job due to doublespeak and being screwed over. Basically, I&#x27;ve learned to accept it. We can&#x27;t all be astronauts etc. I think the Japanese have a cultural understanding that it&#x27;s best to hope that your child is average. Makes sense when you consider standard distribution etc. I&#x27;ll try to work and save so I can retire someday.')
