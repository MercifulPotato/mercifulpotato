However, I believe there are a reasonable number of people on both sides of this. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t think going completely remote is an obvious move. Not having offices will eliminate some people from the applicant pool. Not offering remote positions will eliminate other people from the applicant pool. It&#x27;s okay for a company to do either of these but I don&#x27;t agree that the choice to go remote only is obvious.')
