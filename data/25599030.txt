They’re pretty unique&#x2F;developed with both their acquisition and DevOps practices.<p>It kind of sucks being on the bidding end, as their tech challenges cost a ton on top of the normal costs with a proposal. But I can understand why they do it and from an acquisition perspective, it makes total sense. I think they will need to strike a balance at some point though - some of their tech challenges are too complicated for the timelines provided.<p>In terms of development practices, it is pretty much all DevSecOps and they make heavy use of independent verification and validation&#x2F;QA, and even more importantly, are pretty mature in their adoption of it.<p>So to answer your question, you guys are pretty far outside the norm in a good way :-).<p>Not sure the best way for you to be able to learn more other than to do some networking in the DC area (post COVID). If you get the opportunity, there’s a ton of great meetups in the DC area, although if you’re taking the MARC those can be a challenge to attend after work due to train schedule limitations. Other than that, move around to&#x2F;visit different agencies and get exposure to their work. Work with your PM to see if you can do some site visits to other agencies&#x2F;organizations as part of professional development and such.')
