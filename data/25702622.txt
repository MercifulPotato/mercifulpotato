It appears the colors on the site are largely either similar to solarized-light or solarized-dark, depending on whether the user&#x27;s browser has a dark-preference or not.<p>The OP comment evidently looks at the light version (which is grey text on tan background, and which I also find  a bit annoying to read). I would guess that the parent comment is seeing the dark-mode version.')
