Compare that to someone who makes 8 million USD cash through labour. They have to pay <i>way</i> more in taxes, around 1 million according to this calculator: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smartasset.com&#x2F;taxes&#x2F;california-tax-calculator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smartasset.com&#x2F;taxes&#x2F;california-tax-calculator</a><p>Edit: just found out that in California capital gains are regarded as normal income.
