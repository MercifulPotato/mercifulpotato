Not the GPU itself. Even in OoO CPU’s the ordering by HW doesn’t affect FP results. As a rule of thumb shaders in graphics are compiled as if one had passed -ffast-math to the compiler. Works perfectly in most cases, but not everywhere.<p>Nowadays MS has actually published the spec for DX that was closed previously. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;microsoft.github.io&#x2F;DirectX-Specs&#x2F;d3d&#x2F;archive&#x2F;D3D11_3_FunctionalSpec.htm#FloatingPointRules" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;microsoft.github.io&#x2F;DirectX-Specs&#x2F;d3d&#x2F;archive&#x2F;D3D11_...</a> for differences of strict IEEE behaviour. In Cuda and OpenCL one can get way closer. As an example for performance reasons one might want to flush denorms to zero. But DX mandates that. So no denormals for you. In CL and Cuda they’re usable by default.<p>As for the command queues. I’ve often used them in Cuda. Just to get overlap between kernel executions. In DX12 one can do that by omitting barriers. DX11 allows no such feat.')
