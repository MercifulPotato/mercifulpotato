Why are you not OK with rules that are intended to reduce the risk of people unnecessarily spreading fatal infectious droplets in public?<p>Your right to shoot firearms ends at my body. Why should your right to spread a fatal disease extend into my lungs?<p>And, before you say that I should take some &#x27;<i>personal responsibility</i>&#x27; to protect myself against infection, should that premise extend to wearing type IV body armor in public just so others can shoot guns in populated areas?')
