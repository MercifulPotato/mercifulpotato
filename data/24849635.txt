Poker would also be valid or sudoku or many others but there&#x27;s usually a certain amount of chance involved in most other games and the impact of that chance is hard to estimate.<p>I appreciated them focusing on chess exactly because of the third point you mentioned. It&#x27;s a fairly even playing field in terms of learning opportunities.')
