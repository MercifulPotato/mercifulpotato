The idea with Git is that the data model is simple enough that you can basically manually fix issues that come up. That unfortunately means that you have to take the time to understand Git&#x27;s data model and not just memorize the interface and a <i>lot</i> of people have complained about that over the years. I think the idea with Anu is that issues don&#x27;t come up in the first place and that it&#x27;s hopefully more intuitive to use in the long run.')
