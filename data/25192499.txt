Item(by='azangru', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606169116, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25188529, text='&gt; Why does the West think the world is their snow globe to ogle?<p>&gt; I have a hard time feeling like this can approach anything resembling honest debate if weâ€™re going to point at the behavior of ephemeral, external objects and ignore how we individually organize our daily life.<p>How can these two sentences coexist in the same message? If you argue in favour of focusing exclusively on our personal daily lives rather than on amorphous imaginary entities (fine), then how can you write in an adjacent sentence about &quot;the West&quot;, which &quot;thinks&quot;? And what&#x27;s wrong with watching the world from afar, as if it were a snow globe, anyway?')
