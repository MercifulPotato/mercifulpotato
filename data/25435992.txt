The <i>intention</i> of the library is definitely to cater to people who don&#x27;t know anything about crypto.<p>My naive guess, without knowing exactly what the sticking point is for you, is that Orion could do a better job on the modules page [1] explaining exactly what each module is for and when to use it.<p>Right now, I&#x27;d say the <i>state</i> of the library, rather than its <i>intention</i>, is that it&#x27;s extremely usable for people who pretty much know what they want, and fairly hard for the average developer to misuse.<p>But I believe the author would be very interested in something that makes the library cater better to people who don&#x27;t want to learn crypto, but just want to get things done using it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;orion&#x2F;0.15.5&#x2F;orion&#x2F;index.html#modules" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;orion&#x2F;0.15.5&#x2F;orion&#x2F;index.html#modules</a><p>EDIT: After some thought, I think I would say that the API for Orion is maybe an 8&#x2F;10 for beginners, but the documentation is still at maybe 5&#x2F;10 or 6&#x2F;10 for beginners. Someone who is familiar with crypto would probably be able to look at the documentation and know what they&#x27;re doing, but for someone unfamiliar with crypto, I can see how there isn&#x27;t a ton in the way of explanation of the various primitives. That would be a good area for improvement for the library.')
