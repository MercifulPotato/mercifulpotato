I&#x27;ve re-read the original message now.<p>Here are two thoughts for your consideration:<p>- This is a discussion about FLOSS projects&#x27; lives and their maintainers&#x27; experiences. Given that your approach is an outlier, your observations don&#x27;t have a lot of relevance to an average FLOSS project. Nor, as a consequence, does the opinion of &quot;who owes who&quot;.<p>- Consider, in abstract, two projects. One has only bug reports from actual, motivated users. Another has 10% of bug reports from its users and 90% of &quot;drive-by&quot; bug reports. Starting with a certain size, I think you can imagine how the second project might have the maintainer overwhelmed, unmotivated, and&#x2F;or spending a lot of time on code that is almost never run in production.<p>Software is not math; there are always parts that are more used, and always some bugs that are ignored because they&#x27;re non-trivial to fix, and the tradeoffs are not worth the developer&#x27;s time. Unless you&#x27;re DJB, I guess.')
