I used vscode for a while in vim-mode but it&#x27;s not as ergonomic as my neovim configuration.<p>I can get documentation for a function by pressing K and jump to the definition or do a global rename using some other key combination. I work on a few tens of languages but have language servers integrated for them all and have installed syntax highlighting for everything in existence.<p>Overall it&#x27;s easy to manage and modify, and performs well.')
