Really just comes down to having each link on the multi-link page listed with a number beside its title.<p>---\nTypically[1] i&#x27;ll put numbers inline[2] for each reference I make[3].  And then at the bottom of the comment just list them as so:<p>[1] www.typical.com<p>[2] www.inline.com<p>[3] www.make.com<p>---<p>But if I replace the listed references with a single link at the bottom of the page to your site:<p><pre><code>     References can be found here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;multy.me&#x2F;M9MU0A\n</code></pre>\nThen it would be nice if the individual numbers (1,2,and 3) were obvious on that linked page beside each reference.  But it&#x27;s not a huge difference, it was just an initial thought when I first tried out your site.  It&#x27;s still useful even without numbered links, and I can&#x27;t guess how many people would use them.')
