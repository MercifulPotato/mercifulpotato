They managed to do two really hard things which most developers flirt with at some time or another.<p>1. Create a new editor&#x2F;IDE that&#x27;s actually <i>better</i> not just different. I think everyone has had shower thoughts about making a better IDE and many have tried and failed. Jetbrains succeeded.<p>2. Creating a useful abstraction. IntelliJ was a great Java IDE but what&#x27;s truly impressive is how they&#x27;ve been able to repeat the formula for almost any language out there. Everything from Go to JavaScript has a great Jetbrains IDE. They seem to have somewhat solved the general problem, which is normally a folly but in this case the key to a multibillion dollar company.<p>So again, congratulations!')
