Most of the issues vanish if you use high-end cables&#x2F;adapters from reputable manufacturers. This is a departure from the world of Micro USB where <i>most</i> cheap cables worked just as good as &quot;high end&quot; cables.<p>There are caveats. For example, my Nintendo Switch, a major electronics device from a major company, doesn&#x27;t fully comply with the full USB-C PD spec. As a result, you can&#x27;t assume any power adapter will work.<p>It&#x27;s these caveats that are the real downfall... for those of us in the technology world, it&#x27;s easy for us to be aware of them. For everyone else, it&#x27;s not. There&#x27;s also the whole Thunderbolt 3 &amp; 4 using USB-C thing. I do feel bad for non-technology people trying to wrap their heads around this one.<p>In general, I&#x27;ve had good luck with USB-C. I can power my laptop and display to a 4K monitor with a single cable. It&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ve also had plenty of frustrating experiences and weird USB bugs with certain hardware combinations.<p>Despite some of the issues, I think it&#x27;s still a net positive.')
