Item(by='sneak', descendants=None, kids=[25925940, 25925549], score=None, time=1611724065, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25924436, text='&gt; <i>You can make the same argument in the opposite direction: for those who support unbridled electronic speech amplification, are you prepared for it to fall in the hands of people who are bent on changing minds en masse to fill society with falsehoods, uncertainty, and violence?</i><p>This seems to equate the ability to publish with a society that&#x27;s filled with falsehoods, uncertainty, and violence.  Is it possible that society won&#x27;t have any more or less falsehoods, more or less uncertainty, or more or less violence than a society in which you don&#x27;t appoint some &quot;knows better than the reader&quot; censor to decide what people are allowed to see and read?<p>It seems insanely presumptuous to me that some censor at Facebook or Google won&#x27;t turn into a violent maniac when they see the things you seem to propose that they censor, but the general, unwashed masses will.  Give adults some credit.<p>We&#x27;ve had the church around spreading falsehoods, uncertainty, and violence for centuries, and the world is still here (and still improving).  I don&#x27;t think letting people publish whatever legal content they like is going to suddenly send our world to hell in a handbasket.  The danger from uncensored publishing is overblown.')
