Looking around hoping to see some example appliances and integrations you are puzzled that most of the store is given over to themes. In the distance two people are cheering because the washing machine has dark mode. Presumably the lights in their house don&#x27;t work.<p>A customer wearing a V for Vendetta mask locks eyes with you, they start to say something about a YouTube video they&#x27;re following to upload a custom firmware to their cooker which lets the gas burners override the legal safety limits and double as a room warmer, but at the mention of YouTube a solid sheet slams down from the roof in between you blocking the conversation. &quot;Get the best YouTube experience&quot; it ... instructs? Demands? The place where it should take a response from you is missing. You turn away.<p>The shop assistant invites you over to the VR counter where you can tour the AndroidHouses on offer, several tens of thousands of makes and models all alike, and hands you a pair of carefully cleaned and sanitized VR goggles, which you put on. &quot;Please select all images of brutal murder scenes or books on leopards&quot; the familiar captcha test prompts. You go through the motions, accepting that it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable that you might be a spam customer. Nobody has been able to speak to a human about the captcha contents for at least a decade now.<p>The VR goggles go blank, then show you a scene from a Virtual Reality headset of the 1980s. &quot;I thought Android VR was quite good?&quot; you mutter. &quot;Mandatory Samsung overlay&quot; says the assistant, &quot;runs all the same apps&quot;. Data gathered by the headset arrives at the nearest orbiting FaceBook point of presence, sneaking past the privacy filters. Which privacy legislation applies to the satellites is still being fought. You tour some houses, you watch some ads. It&#x27;s terrible that Apple doesn&#x27;t let you block ads properly. You watch some more ads. Disgusting Apple blocking third-party plugins. You ask if AndroidHouse allows third-party plugins, but it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Leaving the shop, undecided, you glance in the door of the GNU&#x2F;OpenLibreHouse Organization. &quot;Our houses would have electricity now if it wasn&#x27;t for Microsoft!&quot; you overhear. A large and intimidating man walks up to you and grabs your arm. &quot;If you want to see your daughter again, come with me and move into your new OracleHouse&quot;. He moves and you go with him like his grip was iron. It might well be. Your wallet is missing. He nods at a crowd of people standing nearby and your heart sinks. Consultants. &quot;We can have your toothbrush setup within six months - a Gartner leading average time&quot; one of them says. You never asked for this.')
