With our proprietary tool that assesses mysterious investment fees, retail investors are provided with a deep, yet manageable, understanding of their investment fee structures.  After understanding how investment fees strip their life savings (typically to the tune of 33-50%), investors are motivated to leverage Compoundly&#x27;s expert negotiators to reduce their fees or switch brokerages altogether.<p>Why I&#x27;m reaching out: We&#x27;re validating our value prop, namely, negotiating fees down on behalf of retail investors. I need to speak with advisors to see if the average fee reduction is, indeed, .25%.<p>The ask: If you have an investment advisor&#x2F;broker, I would love to hop on the phone with them and lower your fees - for free.  I cannot make changes to your investments (I&#x27;m not an investment advisor).<p>What you get: Beyond lowering your fees for free, I&#x27;d be happy to help test your beta, or hop on a call where you could pick my brain regarding startup legal questions.<p>Why should you trust us? I&#x27;m a licensed attorney and would be happy to send references.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please email me at mario@compoundly.com.<p>Thank you!')
