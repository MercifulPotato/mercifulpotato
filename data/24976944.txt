To take one example, the government mandated that entire neighborhoods in Beijing be completely closed with movement outside only allowed during certain hours of the day. You can disagree with the policy on other grounds but there is no reason to think that extreme steps like that wouldn&#x27;t be effective.<p>As for &#x27;quarantine hotels&#x27; the point isn&#x27;t that they are entirely fullproof but they are significantly more effective than the alternative of asking positive cases to self-quarantine. The same point applies to temperature checks.<p>China&#x27;s record may be exaggerated for propoganda purposes but other nations with similar policies like South Korea and Japan have had simliar outcomes.')
