I do not outsource my thinking to a legislature.<p>&gt;&gt;I&#x27;m trying to assume good faith but replying to me while completely ignoring the content of my comment or twisting my words to imply the exact opposite<p>I was not &quot;completely ignoring&quot; your content,  it seemed to me then, and continues to be my belief now based on this further comment that you desire increased regulations on Uber to make them fall inline with existing regulations,  to &quot;close the loop hole&quot; as it were<p>This is in stark contrast to my belief that the regulations are the problem and adding regulations to uber is not the solution to the problem<p>Eliminating regulations on everyone is the solution.')
