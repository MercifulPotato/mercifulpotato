Item(by='tomduncalf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606384880, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25218050, text='&quot;Move the iPadâ€™s front-facing camera on the side beneath the Apple Pencil charger to better reflect how most people actually use their iPad Pros&quot; - this! Face ID on iPad is really convenient, except the way I usually hold my iPad (landscape, with the pencil at the top) means that the front camera is more-often-than-not blocked when I want to unlock it. I rarely use it portrait so it seems a strange decision.<p>Interesting post, I too have been wondering how the Macbook and iPad (Pro, especially) will co-exist in future. It seems inevitable that touch will come to the Macbook in some form in the next few years, and with the M1 it sounds like Apple are able to make thin, light laptops that don&#x27;t run hot or burn through battery, removing a few of the key differentiators between the iPad and laptops.<p>I do really like using the iPad for consumption and for some creation (music making, photo editing), but for any &quot;serious&quot; work I still find it frustrating at best (editing documents etc.), impossible at worst (development). The hardware is very capable, but the question is how they develop iPadOS to support these use cases without treading too much on the Macs toes - or will the two ultimately merge?')
