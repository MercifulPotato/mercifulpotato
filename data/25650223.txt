I just want to point out one under-appreciated side effect of hands-on altruisim: it does often change the person for the better.<p>It&#x27;s often better to give money, and there&#x27;s no better way to see how little you can do with your hands vs how much you can do with a dollar than to go and see it yourself. Even raising awareness about the problems with a visceral experience of being there can make a person more prone to donate money, advocate for causes, and be contemplative in their policy choices.<p>But, money is not a sure-fire solution. \nEven when donating money, this is a cognitive barrier that must be overcome.\nIn major philanthropic work, a huge problem is matching the donor&#x27;s expepectations of targetted &quot;This person saved 1000 people&quot; investments vs a &quot;general fund&quot; investment to, say, a global vaccine initiative. There&#x27;s no traceability when you dump your dollars into a pool to buy a billion vaccines, but there is enormous positive impact. Contrast that with, say, building a well in a village (something that is usually poorly done, poorly maintained, and not very helpful compared with a municipal water project or sanitation education program). But the well has immediate impact that can be photographed and they probably got their name etched into it.<p>These aren&#x27;t made up examples, I&#x27;ve heard these stories from policy &#x2F; fund raisers. They just shake their head and agree that the world is slightly better, even if it could have been even more slightly better.')
