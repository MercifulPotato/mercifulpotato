The vehicles will be operating in a smaller, roughly 50-square-mile service area.</i><p>Qualifications:<p>(1) existing Waymo One customers<p>(2) you can&#x27;t go anywhere in Phoenix.  Phoenix is a lot bigger than 50 square miles.  (Also, even if the area were bigger, 300 cars sounds like a small number to cover it)<p>(3) <i>Waymo plans to reintroduce safety drivers for some rides as it expands its Phoenix service area</i><p>Is it driverless or not?<p>I&#x27;m trying to read between all the doublespeak, and I don&#x27;t see much progress.  Again, I would love for someone who lives in Phoenix to sign up, try it, post here, and prove me wrong.  Tell me what it was like.')
