Think privacy, banking, relationships. Those can be harmed. It&#x27;s always felt to me like a historical accident that networked devices, really most software in general, slipped past this accountability requirement. Without a specific , named accountable person, security seems to fall into the not-my-problem phenomenon, and continues generates articles like from the OP.<p>In the imagined future where signoff from professional engineers was required, you&#x27;d see pushback against a vendor by the engineer until the implementation was secure, because the engineer&#x27;s licensure was on the line until it was secure. And the vendor couldn&#x27;t just &quot;shop&quot; for a favorable signoff, because every engineer would be held to the same ethical standard and penalty.')
