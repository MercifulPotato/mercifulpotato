Tens of thousands. To claim “there is nothing that links the computer to Biden” is disinformation.<p>DKIM validated by the way:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;robertdavidgraham&#x2F;hunter-dkim" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;robertdavidgraham&#x2F;hunter-dkim</a><p>In fact there is a massive amount of data which substantiates that it is Hunter Biden’s laptop, including extremely personal pictures and videos. We could say that it is either Hunter Biden’s actual laptop, or perhaps it is merely a clone of his laptop, down to the stickers on it (a “conspiracy theory”).<p>People on the email chain confirming that they did in fact receive those emails is <i>evidence</i> that the emails are genuine.<p>There is no evidence that I know of indicating any of the emails being doctored. If you want to make that claim, please cite a source.<p>John Paul Mac Isaac is a 44-year old Wilmington owner of “The Mac Shop”, located near a Biden family home. He was an Apple Genius from 2004-2010. There is no one disputing he works at the shop he owns, and while I have read some people claiming he is “legally blind” — what he actually said in the interview was that he has an eye condition, not that he was legally blind, and in any case that doesn’t mean he can’t see with corrective lenses. And he said he could <i>not</i> conclusively recognize Hunter Biden but that the sticker on the laptop and then ultimately it’s contents (e.g. thousands of sync’d iMessages)  \nidentified Biden as it’s owner.<p>As to the FBI investigation, for years the anonymous claims of Justice Department officials have graced the front pages of every national newspaper with stories damaging to Trump. So I agree it’s important to qualify the statement with “anonymous” and “allegedly” while also certainly being newsworthy, and would otherwise obviously make the front page if it concerned Trump or Trump’s family.<p>I think your last paragraph gives up your position. The bigger story even than all the alleged corruption in the Biden family is how the media has circled the wagons on this and lied about it being somehow linked to Russia, a claim made entirely without a shred of evidence. This latest attack against Greenwald is just more of the same. The story has nothing to do with alt-right anything, it is widely reported on Fox News, has a surprising large amount of documentary evidence for this type of exposé and now has <i>on the record</i> sources directly substantiating the key findings with their own testimony as well as their own emails, text messages, and even recordings.<p>It’s time to pack up the disinformation campaign <i>against</i> this story and go home.')
