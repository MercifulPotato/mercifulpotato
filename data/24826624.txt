Do consider for that outlay though, Mister supports a ton of other systems (pretty much any 16-bit or earlier console&#x2F;computer).<p>Mister doesn&#x27;t have any support for any type of cartridge readers for any of the systems supported and I don&#x27;t believe there is any plan to ever support this, it is all SD card based loading.<p>Mister works with pretty much any controller you can throw at it - original controllers through SNAC, bluetooth &amp; USB.<p>Also, something missing from the Analogue console is analog output - RGB scart, VGA, etc. You can fairly easily do this with Mister now without any of the analog video add on boards.')
