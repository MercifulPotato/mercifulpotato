There are a limited number of people living on campus and testing is required after arrival, and the USC hotel has been converted into a quarantine facility; where people in isolation would be delivered meals. Employees and students are told to take a covid test at least once a week, and since this test is processed by USC themselves turnaround is within 24hrs. USC has received doses of the vaccine already and is vaccinating groups in 1A within their medical community. 1B will include essential employees with on site business and those older than &gt;75 within the university community, and this will begin as soon as the county health authority authorizes it.')
