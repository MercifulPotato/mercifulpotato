It&#x27;s absurd that she keeps appearing on those lists of allegedly overlooked female scientists.<p>Sure, she may have had to fight for recognition, but that is not unique to female scientists. Einstein had to work in a patent office, for example.<p>Similar with the story of Bell - not sure what exactly happened, but in any case she is not the only scientists who didn&#x27;t get credit for her work. It happens to men on a regular basis, too. The assumption that it happened because of her gender may simply be wrong. (Edit: in the meantime she received 2.3M GBP via the &quot;Special Breakthrough Price in Physics&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cam.ac.uk&#x2F;stories&#x2F;journeysofdiscovery-pulsars" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cam.ac.uk&#x2F;stories&#x2F;journeysofdiscovery-pulsars</a> - as for the Nobel, they are a private organization, and it may be difficult to judge for outsiders what is the elementary work in a discovery. Maybe the people who designed the telescope are more deserving than the person who manned it, or whatever).<p>Sadly, there are few sources discussing why women were excluded from academia in former times. I suspect part of it was the church, another economic reasons as women had a high risk of dying from childbirth, making their education a risky investment. Even today, women work less on average over their lifetime compared to men, so investing in their education has lower returns.')
