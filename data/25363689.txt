Tried disputing it to get them to apply the coupon, they refused and demanded a screenshot of the order before I clicked checkout which I obviously didn&#x27;t have since I didn&#x27;t expect them to scam me. I pressed further and they basically responded saying they spent more time on this issue then allowed and just offered a $5 credit for a future order. After using that I&#x27;ll never order through doordash again. That $5 coupon just brought the price down to what it would be if I ordered directly from the restaurant.')
