It&#x27;s amazing to see how clever and powerful these machines and how they push the limits of what was possible in their era.<p>His explanations are very clear and he has mad troubleshooting skills. It&#x27;s always very thrilling to see these old machines get back on their feet and come alive again!<p>MrCarlson&#x27;s Lab[1] is another very enjoyable channel showing detailed restoration of antique -generally radio, mostly tube-based- equipment.<p>[1]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCU9SoQxJewrWb_3GxeteQPA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCU9SoQxJewrWb_3GxeteQPA</a>')
