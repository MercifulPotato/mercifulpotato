When dealing with a low performance h1b employee, they were treated exactly like a regular employee and were given a low performance review.  The company did stack ranked based year cuts so he knew he that he had a high change of getting cut with a below expectation performance review and a PIP and had 3 months to look for a job.  Firing h1bs out of blue would make it hard to hire other h1bs.   There maybe companies that abuse the situation, i have yet to see it.   Most people aren&#x27;t sociopaths and have empathy.
