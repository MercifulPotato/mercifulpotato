So it’s apparently irrational: being willing to incur effort (cost) to get something that is worth a smaller amount and being unwilling to do it when the same effort&#x2F;cost gets you more isn’t what one would expect.<p>But maybe it’s satisficing: maybe formerly the experience was endurable only when running at 110% of maximum, but now there’s no need to redline to get a decent experience?<p>Or maybe it’s the law of diminishing returns, utility approaching some kind of asymptote.')
