For example a db transaction wrapper might want to rollback instead of commit if we leave the block via an exception. You also want the &quot;destructor&quot; of that block to raise if the transaction can&#x27;t be committed.<p>The only thing that the c++ method does really well is memory management (e.g. unique_ptr), because free() can&#x27;t fail. But that use case is of course not a thing in gc languages.<p>Regarding the composition: Everything that&#x27;s not memory management usually has side-effects and often wants to do something with regards to exceptions. So it&#x27;s a good thing for the caller to know that the &quot;RAII&quot; is happening. Allowing you to complete hide that in your class is not a benefit.<p>C++ paints a distorted picture here, because its method is great for memory handling issues, but only OKish for everything else. But most of your RAII issues in C++ are memory related, so you don&#x27;t notice the problems that much.')
