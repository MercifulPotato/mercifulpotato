The numbers are bit scary - &quot;The employment-population ratio, at 56.6 percent, changed little over the month but is 4.5 percentage points lower than in February.&quot;<p>&quot;The number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job, at 7.2 million, changed little in September; this measure is 2.3 million higher than in February. These individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work during the last 4 weeks or were unavailable to take a job.&quot;<p>So that&#x27;s 12m officially unemployed, plus 7m &quot;not in the labor force&quot; but who want a job.<p>So yeah, the article is kinda on point; that the numbers don&#x27;t mean what they think we mean. But I have to agree: that&#x27;s not because the numbers aren&#x27;t available for anyone to look at and understand.')
