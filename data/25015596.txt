It takes ~25 times as many resources to make 1g of beef protein compared to 1g of soy protein.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of the specifics of this process, but it&#x27;s not unthinkable that it could be 100x as efficient as prevalent systems per 1g of protein produced (or that a future version of it, once perfected).<p>Also, in some places (e.g. in iceland, and in many places near dams) electricity is effectively use-it-or-lose-it free after sunk costs; Sounds like -- if electicity is the expensive factor in this -- another use for this essentially free energy; e.g. iceland exports this energy as aluminum, could also export it as protein.')
