So it&#x27;s not a binary thing, you can use ORMs to reduce the amount of boilerplate for simple queries and then where it makes sense you can drill down into native SQL.<p>(a lot of what ORMs give you is just a reduction in boilerplate code, manually populating 30 different fields on an object and so on.)')
