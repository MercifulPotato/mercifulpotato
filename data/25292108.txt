Git LFS? ...?<p>I use Git LFS. It&#x27;s a bit of a shit show though. Blueprints are a tricky thing to diff. I generally use the in editor tools to do commits.<p>&gt; Is networking support for multiple players something that works out of the box? Or do you have to hand roll this and the server code?<p>I think unreal&#x27;s multiplayer is quite good personally. All actor&#x27;s have a checkbox as to whether they should be replicated. Blueprint support for handling RPCs is pretty good too. You can simulate client&#x2F;server setups in the editor with multiple windows. To actually run online you&#x27;ll likely want to get either steam&#x27;s online subsystem working or epic&#x27;s.<p>&gt; How might I find people with experience to work with, review my code, or potentially hire?<p>I would try the unreal slacker&#x27;s discord featured on the epic launcher.<p>Edit: for good laughs, here&#x27;s Tim Sweeney himself tweeting a similar question in 2016 about whether git LFS is a good idea for game dev: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;timsweeneyepic&#x2F;status&#x2F;747888067248295937?lang=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;timsweeneyepic&#x2F;status&#x2F;747888067248295937...</a>')
