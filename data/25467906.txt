Item(by='stevehawk', descendants=None, kids=[25468868], score=None, time=1608304876, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25467809, text='DDG for life (honestly the first thing I do with all browsers, mobile or desktop, is swap out Google for DDG).. It&#x27;s good enough, and when it isn&#x27;t I can just throw a &#x27;!g&#x27; on it and hope Google will be better. Mileage varies on that, though. Some people think Google is still the best search engine, and some of us don&#x27;t (I mean that in regards to quality of search results, not &#x27;Google is evil&#x27; or some other emotional metric), if you&#x27;re still in the former group then switching to DDG may not be your best move.')
