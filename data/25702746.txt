These articles just get posted over and over, and then people hop straight into the comments to vent their feelings which aren&#x27;t really unique to the article in any way.<p>I&#x27;m not clear what the point is, the types of comments I see in these threads aren&#x27;t remotely persuasive, and I imagine the people who do have more nuanced takes have little interest in participating in these little melees.
