But we opened for business in November and we knew the deadline was coming, so the UK was out of the game for us from the get go. We&#x27;ll need to see how shipping to the UK will work after that, but for now we&#x27;ve got other things to worry about :)<p>Unfortunately, the product can&#x27;t be called &quot;cheese&quot; (or &quot;plant-based cheese&quot; for that matter). Currently, &quot;cheese alternative&quot; seems to be fine as there&#x27;s one precedent (in Germany at least) where a plant-based cheese company won the case. My understanding is that it&#x27;s ok to talk about &quot;cheese&quot; on your website, but when the customer makes the buying decision it needs to be made clear that this is a cheese alternative.<p>Honestly, there are no clear guidelines here and the law is very fuzzy. It&#x27;s a big pain in the ass, especially for a small company like ours with little resources to spend for unnecessary, zero value-adding legal actitivies like these.')
