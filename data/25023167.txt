The latency is an absolute killer.<p>On every app that I&#x27;ve optimised, I have to get people to stop going with their gut and look at the traces (both synthetic and real-user). People generally think they should be optimising their JS execution. But in fact the most important thing is usually sequencing loading correctly, followed by minimising JS bundle sizes.<p>Modern browsers are getting really good at parallelising loading and parsing JS and other resources. But if you&#x27;re whacking some fetch in there that happens as a result of JS execution then you&#x27;re generally looking at a wasted 300-500ms for most endpoints&#x2F;device combos.')
