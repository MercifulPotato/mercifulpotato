Tried to arrange to see the item working in person but my messages to the guy kept vanishing. Eventually I managed to send him a photo of my phone number and arrange to see it. Got a warning email containing specific quotes from my messages and telling me that my account would be banned if I ever tried exchanging contact details again.<p>Interestingly under UK law, business sellers must display contact details (address and phone) on listings. eBay seems to do its best to hide this info at the bottom of the page inside a js pop out.')
