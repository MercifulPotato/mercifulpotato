I can imagine that people who&#x27;ve done a lot of corporate&#x2F;enterprise development with large teams or straightforward requirements would see immense value in an ORM. I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe the breadth of projects where an ORM is a good idea. I&#x27;ve never built applications in this space so I can&#x27;t speak to it.<p>With most of the stuff I do, an ORM is a non-starter for my databases. The data would make no sense as objects and I tend to avoid using data objects in programming anyway. It&#x27;s probably impractical or impossible to build what I build using one and even if you could it would be more difficult to write and performance would certainly be atrocious.')
