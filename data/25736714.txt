I was most disappointed that crafting is useless because I wanted to roleplay that skill tree. The game is so boring I&#x27;ve been playing Far Cry instead and Far Cry is trash. Coming from a Deus Ex background there is nothing there to Cyberpunk. However most people liked the game so what&#x27;s the big deal, it works and the audience is mostly happy.')
