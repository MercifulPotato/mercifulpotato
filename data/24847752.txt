There is a reason we don&#x27;t translate programming languages and this is the same thing.<p>I used computers before localisation was a thing (we didn&#x27;t even have localised keyboards) so I always have everything set to US English (even though I endeavour to speak British English).<p>However I agree, if you localise it should all work properly.')
