It&#x27;s approx $800 per sq ft, which certainly wouldn&#x27;t be considered expensive in the art world.<p>Of course galleries usually take about a 40% cut, so the retail price would probably end up north of $5,000, probably more if the artist wants to make any money too. Which definitely moves the price per sq ft up.')
