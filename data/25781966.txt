You are hiding behind a slippery slope fallacy to avoid doing this. You can remove the image then immediately go back to your policy of not removing things. see how easy that was? And as for people complaining about archive.org, can&#x27;t you just ignore them like you are ignoring this? Your logic doesn&#x27;t hold up. You either don&#x27;t want to admit you were wrong or you just don&#x27;t want to remove the image period. That&#x27;s your decision but you should have the guts to stand behind it.')
