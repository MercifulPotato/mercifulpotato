I buy cheap food, I live in the US, I don&#x27;t eat &quot;healthy&quot; and never have -- and yet I&#x27;m thin. People like to hand-wave this away by telling me I must have a high metabolism, but I&#x27;ve never found that to be a convincing explanation.<p>I think a more probable reason for the obesity epidemic is the rise of food as a self-soothing device. To me, the best indicator of whether you&#x27;re likely to have a weight problem isn&#x27;t your activity level or the sugar content of your groceries, it&#x27;s whether you turn to food as a way to relax.')
