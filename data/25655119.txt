I exercise less and am a bit more restless when I sleep. I’m less energetic overall.<p>I have a very small cup of coffee, which is half milk. So never more than 4oz total, usually less than that, and not more than one a day. I try to only have it when I find I can’t get myself to focus. It’s such a small amount that I’m hoping the effect is more due to placebo than caffeine, but it does give me that bit of extra energy and helps me focus.<p>Ultimately, I see caffeine as a crutch, and that I really need to regroup and exercise a bit more, which should help me sleep soundly at night and help restore my focus and energy levels.')
