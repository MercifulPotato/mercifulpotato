While the inferred fatality rate in the US is as high as ~1.3% (Louisiana), in many other places like China outside Wuhan and in India, the inferred death rate is close to 0.0%. I highly doubt that&#x27;s actually the case. It seems much more likely that Covid-19 deaths have been under-reported in China and India.<p>Anecdotally, my Pakistani friend called Covid-19 a &quot;rich-person&quot; disease because only rich people in Pakistan can afford a Covid-19 test. That may account for the lower number of reported Covid-19 deaths in poorer places.')
