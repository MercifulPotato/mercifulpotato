That&#x27;s it.<p>React is actually fantastic, but I&#x27;m an old frontender and using React instead of Vue won&#x27;t really do much for me - I&#x27;d still face the same problems, which are related to business logic. Ultimately, we all end up writing JavaScript when all the nice boilerplate, buzzwordy paradigms and rendering issues are taken care of.<p>Therefore, the only comparisons I respect are subjective ones. I like Vue. I&#x27;m expressive with it and can take care of the goals I have to achieve. I&#x27;ve no reason to try something different, and that also makes me incompetent to judge React in detail as I haven&#x27;t used it to the same point I&#x27;ve done with Vue.<p>&gt; My HTML is at the bottom of my my JSX file, in the render() method I keep at the bottom. My CSS is in CSS files. In Vue, the correct way seems to be using the &lt;template&gt; and &lt;style&gt; sections of the .vue file. Is that more separate?<p>You can split your HTML &#x2F; CSS &#x2F; JS into separate files, or combine everything in one, or do a mix of whatever pleases you, or you can simply use JSX with Vue.<p>I prefer to split everything in its own file, it makes it easier to find.')
