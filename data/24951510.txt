In my view this technology shouldn&#x27;t be allowed on public roads at all. Not even a little bit. Either it&#x27;s 100% safe under all circumstances or it shouldn&#x27;t be allowed. And Tesla definitely shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to call it autopilot or &quot;full self driving&quot; when it very clearly isn&#x27;t.<p>And yes, human drivers might be statistically worse - but just because this might be statistically better(and I&#x27;m not even sure that&#x27;s actually the case here) it doesn&#x27;t mean it should be allowed.')
