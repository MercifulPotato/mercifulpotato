Mine goes up and down a pound or two. It has to do with the amount of water your body is retaining at any given time. Starting a new exercise routine will make your weight spike temporarily. Cutting your caloric consumption will sometimes dramatically decrease your weight, then you&#x27;ll gain a little bit back, then it&#x27;ll gradually go down again if you stick to a deficit.')
