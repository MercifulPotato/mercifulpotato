Instead of just telling you &quot;your battery needs to be replaced&quot;, they scale down your CPU&#x27;s frequency to the point where the phone becomes completely unusable. It&#x27;s not great. Most people don&#x27;t realize that they could get their battery replaced in a matter of minutes, at a cost of about $50. I&#x27;ve done it with an old iPhone, and it worked like-new again.')
