For years, there has been a huge argument about what they should teach as far as CS goes.  Logic is definitely important, but do you really fault a degree program and a kid&#x27;s (young adult) ability on something that is never stated that way in the real world?  Most people just want to graduate and get on with life.  They learn what they need to pass and then move on, and there is nothing wrong with that.  I put this in the same boat as all those logic puzzles they asked in the mid 90&#x27;s early 00&#x27;s.  Ok maybe someone given enough time should be able to figure it out, but there are a lot of people out there that will do just fine at a job without being able to answer it on the spot.<p>Bertrand is definitely in a league of his own as far as skill and intelligence, but he comes from a different era than today.  I&#x27;m not insulting his age, but I do think that we need to take into account what has changed over the last 35-40 years.  Things seem so much more complex than before.  Even source control is complex.  I feel for people just starting out these days.  It&#x27;s a give and take.  You have to gloss over some things to make time to teach about others.')
