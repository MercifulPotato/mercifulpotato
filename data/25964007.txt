At least that&#x27;s how I understand the argument.<p>Really, the biggest problem is that shorts have a vested interest in tearing a company down, be it through tricks like FUD, short ladders or just outright market manipulation. If they&#x27;re just trying to make sure a stock is not overvalued, fine. If they start trying to kneecap thriving businesses through shady tactics, who does that serve other than the short seller?')
