Item(by='mqrs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608010814, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25424398, text='&gt; Video games are more likely to give you real world skills. As more and more of the world moves online, skills that you pick up trying to get games to work or trying to make them run faster can be valuable. Online etiquette is another thing you tend to learn (hopefully, instead of just being toxic).<p>This is begging the question more than a statement of real fact. What about magical combat against imaginary enemies, opening treasure chests, and completing collectibles is valuable in the real world? At least learning to play a musical instrument is actually doable in the real world.<p>One might argue that video games can teach someone to solve puzzles or to strategize towards an end when given a set of strengths and weaknesses, but if you really wanted usable critical thinking out of puzzles, you&#x27;d be better off grinding away at LeetCode and HackerRank. Strategizing towards any end requires the <i>specificity</i> of the context, too, and the world in video games is often very far from real.<p>And besides, if you really believe in video games--are you willing to raise a child to spend his youth and energy on video games instead of learning new skills?')
