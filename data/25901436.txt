It only supports a single display “scan out” on thunderbolt. Plus a second that must be via HDMI.<p>The issue as I understand it is the lack of ability for 2 “scan out engines” to run and output at the same time.<p>Given the MacBook Air&#x2F;Pro support only 1 external display I imagine the HDMI port connects to the hardware that would otherwise connect to the internal LCD. Hence why the mini can do 2 but the MacBooks only 1.<p>I hope this limitation to be lifted in the next generation. It’s the only reason I haven’t purchased one. I want 3 external monitors on a MacBook Pro.')
