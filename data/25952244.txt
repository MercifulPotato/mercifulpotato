We provide a wide range of services around those data which include reviews and ratings historical analysis and so on.<p>I can confirm that the displayed rating on both stores is exactly the weighted average of <i>valid</i> reviews and ratings posted by users. No trickery there.<p>The only caveat here is that both platform regularly invalidate posted reviews and ratings for various reasons (the user asked for it to be removed, apple&#x2F;google has reasons to believe it was fraudulent&#x2F;automated, ...). If a review&#x2F;rating is removed, it won&#x27;t be shown and won&#x27;t be taken into account in the calculation.<p>So the calculation is really along the lines of :<p>&gt; SELECT app, AVG(stars) AS display_stars FROM customer_reviews WHERE deleted=false GROUP BY app;')
