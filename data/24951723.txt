Virtue signaling does not.  Assuming we&#x27;re monotonously moving towards tolerance and treating people better is also extremely arrogant.  The comments to this post demonstrates that with great clarity.  Sean Connery isn&#x27;t even cold and already people line up to piss on his grave.<p>Next time someone in your family dies, are you going to list their moral shortcomings?  The &quot;but&quot; right after listing their accomplishments and good sides?  &quot;BUT...he didn&#x27;t like Asian people, spoke ill of jews and objectified women and stared at Mrs Jenkins daughers tits whenever he could.  He ate red meat and belonged to a religion that terrorized much of the world for a thousand years&quot;.<p>Of course not.<p>But then again, Sean Connery isn&#x27;t a person to any of us.  He is just a symbol of something it is okay to hate.  So pissing on his grave is somehow permissible.<p>What annoys me isn&#x27;t that people get upset about his views.  What upsets me is that people have the absolutely disgusting idea that pissing on his grave makes them better.  It doesn&#x27;t.  It just means they are a different kind of asshole.')
