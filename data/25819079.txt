I used it briefly to communicate with a single friend and a lot of work was needed to ensure the integrity of the connection (side channel in-person initial communication). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a useful protocol for anyone other than crypto-anarchists or similiar types of people. Definitely not a protocol for wide use.')
