Item(by='timr', descendants=None, kids=[25920784], score=None, time=1611689916, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25919846, text='&gt; My understanding is the funding for the trials was partly from NIAID.<p>I have no particular insight into the pricing of this drug, but in general, NIAID funding doesn&#x27;t get anywhere close to the level of investment needed to bring a drug to market (NIAID&#x27;s total budget is something like $5Bn. A <i>single drug</i> can easily require that much money to go to market).<p>Moreover, it isn&#x27;t a bright-line distinction between public and private funding: if a novel drug is developed (entirely privately) against a target for which academic researchers once received public funds, does it count as public funding? There&#x27;s a huge gray area in between. Nearly <i>all</i> drugs can be characterized as &quot;publicly funded&quot;, if you look hard enough.<p>Rules like this sound great, but in practice, they&#x27;ll lead to perverse incentives (like drug companies completely avoiding targets from the academic world, in the previous example). Nobody rational wants to spend billions of dollars doing late-stage development and clinical trials to be torpedoed by a researcher who took a small amount public funding decades prior.')
