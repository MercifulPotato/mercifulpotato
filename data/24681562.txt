For Lafayette, the numbers read: the yearly cost of bad roads for the average motorist is $2.133. The pavement conditions of 53% of the roads are described as &#x27;poor&#x27; and an additional 19% as &#x27;mediocre&#x27;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tripnet.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;louisiana-baton-rouge-transportation-by-the-numbers-trip-news-release-10-08-2019&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tripnet.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;louisiana-baton-rouge-transporta...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tripnet.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;LA_Transportation_by_the_Numbers_TRIP_Report_October_2019.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tripnet.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;LA_Transporta...</a><p>&gt; The pavement data in this report, which is for all arterial and collector roads and highways, is provided by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), based on data submitted annually by the Louisiana Department of Transportation &amp; Development on the condition of major state and locally maintained roads and highways. Pavement data for Interstate highways and other principal arterials is collected for all system mileage, whereas pavement data for minor arterial and all collector roads and highways is based on sampling portions of roadways as prescribed by FHWA to insure the data collected is adequate to provide an accurate assessment of pavement conditions on these roads and highways.<p>So, yeah, potholes.<p>There&#x27;s also research for plenty of other areas. Which isn&#x27;t surprising since this organisation has been doing this for the past 50 years.<p>&gt; Founded in 1971, TRIP is a private nonprofit organization that researches, evaluates and distributes economic and technical data on surface transportation issues.  TRIP promotes transportation policies that help relieve traffic congestion and its impact on air quality, improve road and bridge conditions, make surface travel safer, and enhance economic productivity. TRIP is sponsored by insurance companies, equipment manufacturers, distributors, and suppliers, businesses involved in highway and transit engineering and construction, labor unions, and organizations concerned with an efficient and safe surface transportation network that promotes economic development and quality of life.<p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tripnet.org&#x2F;about-trip&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tripnet.org&#x2F;about-trip&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; Or all those people flooded out of their houses.<p>I&#x27;ll pick the 2016 Louisiana flooding as an example. 146.000 homes damaged, 11.000 people ended taking refuge in shelters.<p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2016_Louisiana_floods" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2016_Louisiana_floods</a><p>&gt; Pick one and let&#x27;s break it down.<p>Okay. The story surrounding the 2016 floods is more complex then simply &quot;needs more maintenance&quot;. You&#x27;re looking at a flooding prone area where housing development ballooned in a few short years. So, what happened? As always, a combination of factors and the dilution of responsibility across many actors. This ranges from the population not having flooding insurance, over private contractors cutting corners, to building permits being issued based on outdated information and so on and so on.<p>Even so, engineering infrastructure at scale requires a different approach which can&#x27;t be implemented on a municipal level. And even then, infrastructure isn&#x27;t a silver bullet. You need a layered approach across administrative levels which requires cooperation, continuity and forward thinking strategies. Which is a tall order when economic and political circumstances aren&#x27;t favourable.<p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eu.theadvertiser.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;23&#x2F;did-flood-reveal-drainage-problems-south-lafayette-parish&#x2F;90129456&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eu.theadvertiser.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;23&#x2F;did-flood...</a>')
