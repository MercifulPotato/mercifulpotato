A woman is under arrest for trying to grab what she thought was her phone back from a black kid. It&#x27;s a national story.<p>&gt; In 2020, getting into an argument with a Black person is &#x27;racist&#x27; and &#x27;criminal&#x27; if you happen to be wrong.<p>Assault isn&#x27;t a mere argument, and it&#x27;s a crime regardless of the race of the perpetrators or victim.<p>&gt; But because someone is a different colour, she&#x27;s being destroyed and doxxed on the MSM for the assumption of racism.<p>No, sheâ€™s being condemned for the objective fact of assaulting a child.')
