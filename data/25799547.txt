Your web application written in Rust isn’t going to be systematically more or less secure than an application in Python or Ruby.<p>Just want to call out that I&#x27;ve heard a horror story of a very bad security bug due to implicit shared mutability in Python.<p>(vague to protect the innocent)<p>&gt; Heck, if you ask some people, Rust is less secure than a GC’ed language for web apps if you use any crates that have unsafe code - which includes Actix, the most popular web framework, because unsafe code allows things like deferencing raw pointers.<p>You can write unsafe code in Python (and some of the web frameworks use this) and nothing helps you with auditing it, unlike unsafe blocks in Rust.')
