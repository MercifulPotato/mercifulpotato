I suspect most stories in the paper are bullshit. It isn&#x27;t even because the paper is agenda-driven, it&#x27;s because the journalist is either lazy or simply has no idea what he&#x27;s writing about and mangles what he was told about it, or he asked the wrong questions, etc.<p>Sort of like me being assigned to write an article about culinary arts :-)<p>P.S. For more decent articles about airplanes, Aviation Week is far better.')
