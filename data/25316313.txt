Of course, I did well academically in high school, which helped me do ok in the program. But my specific family circumstances during that period of my life didn’t determine whether I was financially able to even consider the prospect of going to university.<p>To put it another way, I didn’t work hard in high school so that I could put university within financial reach. I worked hard so I could focus on actually preparing for the program I was going into.<p>Perhaps there are issues with how higher education is run in the US that make heavily subsidized college education for everyone less of a bang for your taxpayer buck. But in Canada, practically every reputable university is public and heavily subsidized, and many of my brilliant peers simply wouldn’t have been there at all if they had to have a supportive family and an excellent high school education to be able to afford the scholarships to attend.')
