I’ve read that a blackberry android phone (Key One?) has similar on its hardware keyboard, but I’ve not seen one in real life or seen a video of that feature specifically (anyone know of one?).<p>I don’t see much about eyeball tracking these days; if I can look where I want the cursor to be, can’t I push a key to put it there?
