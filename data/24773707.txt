That&#x27;s not an arrest, it&#x27;s a civil commitment of a medical nature without any criminal implications.<p><i>Sure, they don&#x27;t want people harassed, but I see no evidence they&#x27;re actively trying to prevent people from getting treatment.</i><p>Homeless advocacy groups recently blocked the construction of a homeless shelter in Lancaster because they didn&#x27;t like the location. They&#x27;ve blocked multiple attempts by the city to force violently mentally ill homeless individuals from being treated, even though such individuals are a harm to themselves and to others...especially others. More than dozen homeless individuals have been murdered this year by other homeless persons who were prevented from receiving medical treatment by homeless advocacy groups.<p>The problem is that the idiot advocates base their views of &quot;harassment&quot; on academic ivory-tower views of personhood, and don&#x27;t understand what it means to be mentally ill and homeless. It means to be shitting yourself every day, to be eating food off the streets, to spend your days and nights fighting off rats and cockroaches, and to avoiding drug dealers and persons more ill than yourself, to be lost in haze or to be seeing people and creatures that don&#x27;t exist.<p>Nobody wants to be mentally ill, and once treated, the individual <i>always</i> prefers sanity. The problem with most mental illnesses that lead to homelessness, especially the schizophrenic family of disorders, is that the disorder itself makes the individual paranoid of treatment, and the homeless advocates focus all of their attention on that refusal instead of actually making the person better.<p>A homeless person that has their mental illness under control can transition to permanent housing  and become a functioning member of society again. But in order to do that, you need to let them be treated, even if they don&#x27;t want the treatment.')
