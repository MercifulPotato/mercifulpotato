So no &quot;arbitrary code&quot;.<p>Second thing, unless you can push a branch to the project main repository, no pipeline is ran. So for your own personal forks you&#x27;d either rely on gitlab.com-provided free minutes or you run your own runner (and tbh, it&#x27;s fairly easy).<p>Last thing: you should not think of regular end-users. Think of middle to advanced users, that have a home server or something like that (homelabbers?).')
