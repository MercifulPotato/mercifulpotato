There are only few folk who care about correctness and compile times.<p>LLVM, while its drawbacks are not highlighted, is a monolith and only slightly better than GCC in some areas. Compile times being one of them.<p>Not to forget &quot;fast&quot; compilers don&#x27;t apply many optimizations.<p>There are some rust specific reasons too, like lack of binary dependencies.')
