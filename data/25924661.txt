Adafruit has commercial interests - they&#x27;re building CircuitPython so that people buy their stuff. They&#x27;re a multi-million dollar corporation, not your mom and pop hobby shop.<p>Instead of doubling down on MicroPython, Adafruit decided to fork it so they can have the right HALs. They should have made a library, contributed to MicroPython and grown the ecosystem.<p>Unrelated, I absolutely despise Adafruit customer service - they&#x27;re demeaning and belittling. I wanted to return items because they were not as described in the pictures - their response was we don&#x27;t guarantee that. OK. So, you buy stuff off of AliExpress and put a 3x markup and you can&#x27;t guarantee your supply chain? I now buy all my electronics from DigiKey and Sparkfun.')
