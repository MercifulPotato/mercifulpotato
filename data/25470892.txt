Here&#x27;s a summary of the first: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pingcap.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;reasons-rust-compiles-slowly" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pingcap.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;reasons-rust-compiles-slowly</a>.<p>In theory, with enough time and resources, Rust could see an efficient compiler, but this is something that can&#x27;t be predicted, as it depends on its future success, or, to be clear, the backing it will have.<p>In practice, the Rust Cranelift backend could provide enough speed (for debug builds) that compilation times won&#x27;t be slow anymore.<p>Something to consider is also that compilation is a tradeoff between compiling speed and runtime speed (Golang&#x27;s favoring compiling speed), so one can&#x27;t have both ends of the the spectrum at the same time.')
