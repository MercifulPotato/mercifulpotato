To your knowledge are there any other software ecosystems that track stability in nearly as formalized a way? Has there been investigation into bringing these ideas into other modern languages? (I don&#x27;t believe Rust has a concept like this, for instance, though it would even further strengthen the language&#x27;s concept of correctness if it did!)')
