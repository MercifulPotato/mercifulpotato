Good luck with that if you have a hundred issues a day.<p>This honestly sounds like it could be a feature with the right automation.  Devs are often separated from customers by multiple layers of &quot;flappers&quot; who&#x27;s sole job is to triage, organize, and perform manual resolution of customer issues.<p>If your app is large enough to receive hundreds of issues a day, then it&#x27;s likely there are entire teams of &quot;flappers&quot;.
