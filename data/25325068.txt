There has been a voluntary reduction in rate. This is not in dispute.<p>The graph suggests a terminal decline in demand, for which you could say there is some form of an expectation (for the most optimistic? viewer), but the prefix condition was not met. Peak oil is not an statement about economics, but about practical conditions that have an economic effect. Re-interpretations withstanding, as mentioned, history has an inherent possibility of increased production in the future which also fails both conditions.<p>There is no coherent interpretation that fits, at this time.')
