Countries that don&#x27;t want foreign influence (of both good and bad varieties) injected directly through their citizens eyeballs will ban social media first. Then a &quot;nextdoor&quot; style social media company will appear and allow individual countries to control how their social media is used. That or a Docker image with a Generic Social Media App can be bought and loaded onto a regional datacenter controlled by said country, because &quot;cloud&quot; will get a well justified bad label  of being associated with foreign influence.<p>Does a multi-country-specific social media company already exist?
