It&#x27;s about forbidding DRM breaking [on a copyrighted work]. What if breaking DRM has no bearing on the copyright itself? I.e. it doesn&#x27;t affect it because nothing is infringed. DMCA 1201 still forbids it. So it&#x27;s clear that it&#x27;s wider than simply being about copyright and that&#x27;s exactly the problem with it - being overreaching and forbidding perfectly legal things that copyright should have no business touching.<p>DRM proponents realize it very well, and they abuse DMCA 1201 to extend copyright law into any area they want, as long as they can slap any kind of copyright + DRM on it. It basically gives them a rogue lawmaking tool that doesn&#x27;t need to involve actual legislators.<p>Like for example forbidding one to switch mobile carriers because it involves breaking DRM. Nothing really to do with copyright - it&#x27;s about controlling the market. But they use DCMA 1201 for it.<p>So DMCA 1201 is utter garbage and it&#x27;s not only corrupt, it&#x27;s clearly easily abused.<p><i>&gt; BTW, what you&#x27;re describing with treaties has a name: it&#x27;s called policy laundering.</i><p>Yep, that&#x27;s exactly the origins of DMCA 1201, so I&#x27;m always surprised when anyone tries to defend such clearly corrupt law. That&#x27;s basically being proponents of corruption.')
