But of course everyone thinks they deserve a place at the top of the totem pole and anything less prestigious is a catastrophe. It&#x27;s understandable. Many were always the top or one of the top kids in class or in school, won various local competitions but then it comes to competing against everyone across the globe and suddenly the story changes and it&#x27;s no longer automatic and a given that you are at the top.
