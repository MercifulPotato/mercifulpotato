Item(by='jessaustin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609546151, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25608562, text='I&#x27;ve been on a city bus several times when the driver just pulled over, turned off the engine, said &quot;I&#x27;m going to the bathroom&quot;, entered the business he&#x27;d parked in front of, and came back after a couple of minutes. It didn&#x27;t cause a problem, so municipalities who don&#x27;t allow that are abusive. I&#x27;m sure that in general drivers try to keep that to a minimum.')
