In return there is also a huge attack surface, with all the code running below, and corner cases in web standards. AFAIK any js click event can allow a website to read your clipboard. Websites can somehow prompt to add extensions to your browser etc.. I know there are legitimate reasons for this but it sandboxing is not exclusive virtue of web platform.')
