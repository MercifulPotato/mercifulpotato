I have no idea how these bots have found me or why they are allowed to message me, and so far any attempt to make Discord answer me about them has failed.<p>This earned yet another twitter DM to them telling them they fucked up. They benefit directly from the open source community so this is a huge &quot;fuck you&quot; to everyone involved.<p>Slimey, shitty tactics. I was previously going to run a company through them but now I&#x27;m going to evaluate other options.')
