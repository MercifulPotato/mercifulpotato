There are a few solutions that can manage org files outside emacs, but none of them goes beyond basic functionalities. I find logseq promising. I think there is already an effort to make it compatible with org-roam. It would be awesome if they support citation packages like org-roam-bibtex and org-ref as well, in future. I would like to hear the author&#x27;s opinion on this, if they are reading this comment.')
