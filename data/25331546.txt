Open source community has issues with complex software that needs substantial amount of R&amp;D, UI&#x2F;UX design, manual QA, hardware design, or pretty much everything else that&#x27;s not coding.<p>Multimedia codecs aren&#x27;t user facing, yet only PNG was invented as open source, the rest of the wide spread ones (gif, jpeg, MP3, MPEG2, h264, h265, AAC, etc) - were made by companies.
