Or they might fix in as they go.<p>One consistent tension is that the old-hand developers have a &quot;mental issue queue&quot; that is enormous, but without fail, every time, they just can&#x27;t be transferred.<p>These can&#x27;t be made into issues and farmed out to other people. Inconsistencies in the data model, for instance, might exist, but a better solution isn&#x27;t obvious. You can hand it to someone fresh, and after significant effort (on both of your parts) they agree with the inconsistency, but they won&#x27;t propose a solution that&#x27;s any better.<p>Once you&#x27;ve contributed enough of the main functions of a code base, you just never lack for something to do. All code is bad, because the business focus is on expansion of responsibilities over refinement of the existing ones.<p>Those ghost issues are best communicated with a code change, at which all observers say WOW WHY DID WE NOT SEE THIS?! But the issue without the code change gets gawking blank stares.<p>EDIT: but fixing unrelated issues as you go is bad, don&#x27;t do it!')
