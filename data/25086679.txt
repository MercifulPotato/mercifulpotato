But they don&#x27;t hold on to it. They create special-purpose entities (SPE) which then buy credit card debt, funded by bonds sold to investors. The banks do not hold on to much of the credit card debt.<p>The yield of these bonds issued by the SPE is commensurate with the risk of default of the credit cards. In this case, the bank issues billions and billions of credit without the reserves to handle high defaults. But it&#x27;s OK, because they sell off the debt, so it can no longer directly consume their reserves.<p>Any losses on that credit card debt affects the value of the collateral backing the bonds issued by the SPE, not the bank. So the investors of the SPE are on the hook, but not the bank.<p>These bonds backed by the SPE are not rated AAA. So the real question is regulating the leverage of the investors buying the SPE bonds. But that can be handled separately, and need not restrict Ant&#x27;s ability to issue microloans and then sell them off to securitized pool trusts.')
