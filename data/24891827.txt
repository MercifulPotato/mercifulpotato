Electricity is just too cheap and humans too weak.<p>“One kWh” sounds like a tiny amount, but it is 3,600,000 joules. If you want to store that as potential energy, you must (taking g=10m&#x2F;s²) lift a mass of 360,000 kilograms by a meter.<p>Another way to see how large a kWh is: a human body, ballpark, needs 3kWh per day (125W an hour)<p>⇒ If you want to produce 3kWh a day, you’d have to eat twice what you normally eat.<p>And that, even ignoring heating and airconditioning, doesn’t power an average household in the western world.')
