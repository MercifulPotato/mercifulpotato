Although 9 out of 25 is only a 36% accuracy rate, I still remember when reading The Singularity is Near for the first time that almost all of the predictions seemed wildly optimistic and sort of crazy. It seemed a bit unlikely that it would be possible to have a high speed internet connection from a touchscreen super-computer everyone has in their pocket that can also act as a personal assistant that you can speak to in natural language and it will usually understand and respond appropriately, albeit unable to have a full conversation at this point.<p>So his best record is in making predictions about the internet and ubiquity of portable computers (smartphones), but he&#x27;s been less successful in his optimistic predictions for full-immersion virtual reality, and the jury is still out on the singularity.')
