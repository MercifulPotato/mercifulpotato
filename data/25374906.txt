I&#x27;m glad the service fits for you, and it appears that they have setup reasonably-structured incentives.<p>But using that pricing, 24TB with Jottacloud would be 450 EUR&#x2F;year, which is still on the order of $1000. The larger point is that disk sizes are always growing, and while 24TB may seem unnecessary to you, it&#x27;s <i>very</i> easy to build an array that is cumbersome to backup. And IME this has remained true for the past two decades.<p>You&#x27;re right that the cost effective way of performing large backups seems to be just buying another array and hosting it somewhere offsite. But that still <i>doubles</i> your array cost, and so is not something to be done lightly.<p>FWIW personal users want availability too, unless rebuilding arrays from scratch is your hobby. A simple mirror is a form a raid, which you can only get away with if your storage requirements can be taken care of by a single spindle. If that&#x27;s where you are, fantastic. But that doesn&#x27;t describe most home ZFS users.')
