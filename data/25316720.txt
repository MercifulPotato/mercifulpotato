I think it’s one of those films where I’d say it’s the exact opposite to your description of Citizen Kane; the individual components aren’t necessarily all that great if you start to examine them closely, but when it all comes together I think it’s pure cinematic gold.<p>I must’ve seen Casablanca a hundred times at this point, and I still laugh at the snappy exchange at the bar between Rick, Sasha and Yvonne[1], gleefully grin when Rick rigs the roulette game in favor of the young Bulgarian couple[2], get goosebumps and damn near cry when the whole place erupts in an impromptu rendition of the Marseillaise to drown out the nazi’s singing[3] etc. etc.<p>I’ve never actually seen Citizen Kane, but I think I’ll do so tonight prompted by your comment. I’d love to see if I agree with your assessment. Thanks!<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=14ZnZ4-aGi0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=14ZnZ4-aGi0</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xD_bKVAZJBw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xD_bKVAZJBw</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZgXw58ZP4Ss" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZgXw58ZP4Ss</a>')
