But I&#x27;m wary of extensions that I need to load from other locations than the Google webstore - the webstore at least provides some guarantee against abusive extensions (or that become abusive after a while).<p>You say that the it &quot;infuriates you&quot; that Google demands payment for adding an extension to the Chrome web store -  but it&#x27;s only $5 FCOL [0]. Their motivation is purportedly to stave abusive extensions, and it might actually work like that to some degree (as well as contributing minimally to their cashflow).
