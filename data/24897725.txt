Better to just throw them out.  Also why waste time talking about anything not relevant to the job to judge communication skills when you could be having job related discussions.<p>&gt; If you get performance complaints about an otherwise-good employee who is fasting during Ramadan, what&#x27;s the right way to address that while respecting privacy and being fair to the complainant, complainee and the company?<p>Is the complaint this person isn&#x27;t doing their job?  Then it should be treated like every other complaint. Is the complaint is &quot;They aren&#x27;t eating lunch&quot; then it should be treated very differently.')
