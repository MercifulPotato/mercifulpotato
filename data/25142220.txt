The Ohio class subs are quite old and no one knows with any real certainty that they remain untrackable. It&#x27;s entirely possible they are being tracked through some unknown mechanism like new classes of drones, sensors, info leaks, spies, etc.<p>And your response proves my point: everyone is banking on the Ohio class subs as the trump card. But if they&#x27;re wrong, we&#x27;re in a very precarious situation. Hence the need to revamp and expand the other legs of the triad.<p>2. SpaceX had &quot;no competency&quot; in creating rockets and spaceships until they did. And now they&#x27;re objectively better than most governments at it. Creating a reentry vehicle that launches on one of their existing platforms doesn&#x27;t seem implausible, at all. This is probably easier than most of their previous work.<p>Unlike the legacy U.S. defense companies, SpaceX delivers on a budget and time scale that makes choosing them the obvious option. But it probably makes sense to have another company also work on improving the nuclear response.')
