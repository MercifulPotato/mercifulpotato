This is a serious problem because without treatment, 70% of prediabetics develop type 2 diabetes. Prediabetics are also at an increased risk from strokes, heart attacks, dementia, heart disease, and COVID-19.<p>We built Sapien to give people everything they need to track and manage their blood sugar before they develop diabetes. With our $25 at-home test, customers can get lab-certified results back in one week, tailored and actionable insights from our team, and access to the Sapien community.<p>While you may not be personally at risk for prediabetes, chances are you have a family member or friend who&#x27;s one of the 88M Americans who are at risk.
