However I still maintain that correctness implies memory safety, at least as a characteristic of the program if not of the language. If your language doesn&#x27;t help there you should expend more time and effort to achieve that result, and accept higher risk of screwing it up.\nBut I see why you argue that readability correlates with correctness. It&#x27;s also true that most memory safety issue are really hard to spot, and that may be even more true for 80%-safe language. I really like when the computer does work for me, since as a human I&#x27;m way more sloppy.')
