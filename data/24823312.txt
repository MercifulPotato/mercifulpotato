If they are designed for musicians, they may attenuate all frequencies equally.<p>I often sleep with Ohropax foam earplugs.  They eliminate the high frequencies like sirens.  They reduce the mid-range and low frequencies, too.  Conversation becomes muffled quiet mumbling.  Noises can transmit through the frame of the frame of the building, my bed frame, my mattress, my pillow, and my head.  Luckily, such noises are rare in my building.  I&#x27;m not distracted by my body&#x27;s internal sounds.<p>I tried many many kinds of earplugs.  The Ohropax ones work the best for me.  I can wear them for 2-3 sleep cycles (3-4.5 hours) before my ears hurt, but only if I insert them far enough into my ears.  For smaller ears, Mack&#x27;s Dreamgirl earplugs are good.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Ohropax-Soft-Foam-Ear-Plugs&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B000V3PZB0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Ohropax-Soft-Foam-Ear-Plugs&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B000V3...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Macks-Dreamgirl-Soft-Foam-Earplugs&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B0051U7R0A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Macks-Dreamgirl-Soft-Foam-Earplugs&#x2F;dp...</a>')
