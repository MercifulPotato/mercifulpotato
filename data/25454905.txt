Item(by='xmodem', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608207486, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25448700, text='&gt; You posted several times about how macOS isn&#x27;t compatible with your production environments scripts and what-not. The solution is to either not use macOS, or use a standardized VM every developer on the team uses to develop inside of, so that your scripts work &quot;out of the box&quot;.<p>Another solution would be to write those scripts against a language and standard library that doesn&#x27;t have wildly varying behaviour between its underlying platforms. One of my side projects has a bunch of supporting scripts in Python doing similar things and they run exactly the same on Linux and macOS. They even run fine on Windows with only minimal modifications.<p>&gt; Your posts seem to contradict this. Perhaps you were exaggerating the pain it causes the team when production scripts don&#x27;t work on developer systems. Either way - it seems the writing is already on the wall. Apple isn&#x27;t going to make it easier any time soon - so ditch the mac&#x27;s.<p>With this statement I was referencing specifically the complaints that have surfaced in the past few years about new OS changes and security features breaking tooling. I don&#x27;t count our infra team using new bash features in this because the issue with outdated bash&#x2F;unix tooling is a long-standing one.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for others, but for me personally, the usability of macOS for almost all of the things I do on a day-to-day basis is just day-and-night better than anything else, even if I have to hack up a bash script to work correctly from time to time. I will say the difference is less than it used to be - I use it occasionally and Linux has come a long way in the past 10 years.')
