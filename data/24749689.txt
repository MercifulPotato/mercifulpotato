There are already a bunch of other browsers piggybacking on Chromium.<p>The article is a little vague on the antitrust reasoning behind splitting off Chrome. It bases the argument on how getting rid of third-party cookies could be bad for publishers, but at the same time mentions that Chrome&#x27;s competitors have <i>already done away with them</i>. From an antitrust perspective I think it makes sense to go after the ad tech stack, but this article feels like it is trying to throw everything against the wall and see what sticks.')
