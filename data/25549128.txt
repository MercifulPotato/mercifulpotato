Item(by='cnst', descendants=None, kids=[25549501], score=None, time=1609047454, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25548419, text='&gt; Even if all you want is plain HTTP, when HTTPS breaks it&#x27;s mostly the fault of the device, and the product is still experiencing planned obsolescence caused by the manufacturer.<p>&quot;Mostly&quot;?!  That&#x27;s quite a stretch!  You&#x27;re attributing direct and explicit actions taken by a specific subset of site operators as caused by the device manufacturer, which it is clearly not!<p>&gt; And it would be stupid of a site to allow old versions of TLS, since that compromises the people depending on HTTPS; if there&#x27;s going to be an insecure access method it should be HTTP.<p>This argument doesn&#x27;t stand -- if you&#x27;re running the latest User-Agent software in December 2020, access to pre-TLSv1.2 sites is likely already disabled (or at least it was supposed to have been disabled earlier in 2020 -- did they back out of their own plan all over again?), so, how would the site allowing older versions of TLS at all allow the compromise that you describe to take place?  It&#x27;s simply not possible, because the User-Agent won&#x27;t allow it!<p>To the contrary, if thousands of sites that don&#x27;t actually need crypto wouldn&#x27;t have been mistakenly made to use crypto since a few years ago, then we could have disabled pre-TLSv1.2 in newer browsers at a much faster rate; whilst still leaving TLSv1.0 support at the server level for the older clients that don&#x27;t have the newer crypto.<p>So, ironically, the HTTPS lobby actually shot themselves in the foot by making everyone adopt TLS without any actual need.<p>&gt; Crypto isn&#x27;t just for banking.<p>Yes, sadly, crypto works great for planned device obsolescence, too!<p>&gt; Also it&#x27;s not really a capitalism thing, capitalism is too busy trying to sell you an update every 2 years to care about the difference between 8 years and forever.<p>The evidence appears to show otherwise.  Capitalism -- Google, Bing, Amazon -- doesn&#x27;t care if anyone still uses TLSv1.0; they&#x27;ll still serve everyone to make a sale.  Ironically, it&#x27;s the non-profits &quot;socialists&quot; -- Wikipedia, Mozilla, EFF -- who (inadvertently?) promote planned device obsolescence by intentionally deprecating all backwards compatibility on the internet.')
