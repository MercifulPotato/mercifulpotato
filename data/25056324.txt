Apple has made a strategic decision to pretend RAM doesn&#x27;t exist, ship underpowered hardware, then brag about the battery life.<p>This is also the reason RAM is not listed on iPhone specs.<p>If I remember correctly the iPhone Pro 12 Max has twice as much RAM as the other 12 models and it&#x27;s nowhere in the marketing materials.  This is not accidental, it&#x27;s a fundamental part of Apple&#x27;s strategy.<p>EDIT: <i>The max has 6GB and the rest of the line has 4GB. That is not twice as much. I did not remember correctly.</i>')
