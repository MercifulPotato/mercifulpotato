In 1989 the future first president of post-Soviet Russia visited Houston, and what most impressed him wasn’t NASA.<p>— It was a Randall’s grocery store, where the Houston Chronicle saw him “nodding his head in amazement” at the fish, produce and frozen pudding pops:<p>— “He commented that if the Soviet people, who often must wait in line for goods, saw U.S. supermarkets, ‘there would be a revolution.’ ”</i><p>The Internet lets people experience pretty much the same, except do so while being on the other side of the public&#x2F;government divide, and in fact, there are revolutions happening.<p>What I myself believe that a lot of people in the West kind of realise how this work in basics, but only the people who grew in the unfree world will continue further to note that what matters even more is what he said later:<p><i>— “Even the Politburo doesn’t have this choice. Not even Mr. Gorbachev,” he said.</i><p>Elzin was said to be almost crying from this realisation. He saw it&#x27;s impossible to recover the control of the party when, in a few years, it will be not only him, but tens of thousands of other USSR&#x27;s officials visiting USA.<p>The later made themselves to feel that they look like clowns in eyes of people who been there, and saw this. These officials will forever stop believing in the power of CPSU, because they saw who really have all the wealth, power, and political potency in this world.<p>Those officials will stop wanting to be high ranking functionaries, and will want to do business themselves in hopes of achieving even a tiny fraction of wealth they saw in the USA, or even drop everything, and move to the West themselves (A huge portion of Russian immigration to the Brighton Beach in early nineties <i>were, in fact, families of Soviet officials, and other elites</i>.)<p>Above, was what the third man in the power vertical, in the second most powerful world country at the time said. <i>Now, imagine how much will this crash the worldview of some &quot;big guy&quot; official in a small town, or a village in the third world, and how they will feel. They too will stop caring for their duties, cash out the treasury, and run.</i><p>The Internet is equally potent in erasing the faith in the government of both the governed, and the ones doing governing.')
