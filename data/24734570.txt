You just picked on a random small company, and then said generic stuff about &quot;economies of scale&quot;.<p>I love hearing about failures (and am happy to talk about my own!), but there&#x27;s a difference between exploring what went wrong, and &quot;punching down&quot;. Now when you Google their names, &quot;Biggest Y Combinator Failed Startups&quot; will be the result. Unfair.')
