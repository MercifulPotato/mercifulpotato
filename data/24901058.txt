Some companies, particularly larger ones, will fire people for any lies on their job application or background check, as a matter of HR policy.<p>So, don&#x27;t lie. Just refuse to tell them your salary history and talk about your expectations instead. If that negotiating approach causes you to lose that job opportunity then you were probably asking for more than they were willing to pay, and you probably weren&#x27;t going to get it anyway.')
