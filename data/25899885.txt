The model of their licensing business is to do years of R&amp;D, then spend years selling rights to the work product to pay for the next cycle of R&amp;D. Cost of revenues for the licensing business (R&amp;D) are out of sync with the sales that they later generate. Licensing revenue was 40% of QCOM&#x27;s total revenue last quarter. How exactly do you suggest they make money by selling IP without a legal environment that protects their contracts and patents?<p>Same goes for ARM. Their entire business is making and licensing designs internationally. That&#x27;s what they do. That&#x27;s how they make money.<p>&gt; The thing is, just macros, or verilog code alone is near useless without tons of documentation, spoonfeeding by ARM FAEs, and tooling support.<p>Looking at past cases, I think this is an extremely poor characterization of how infringement actually happens. More likely,<p>(A) customers (or former customers) use licensed technology for which they underpay (or refuse to pay); or<p>(B) competitors hiring engineers from customers or former customers to compete with the company.')
