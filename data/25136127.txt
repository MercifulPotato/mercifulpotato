I was <i>not</i> ready to become a father early in life; I can&#x27;t tell you if it would have taught me patience earlier, or would have made me resent the responsibility and poisoned my relationship with my kid.<p>And overall, I think that prescribing having a child to mature people faster fits into the same bucket as having a child to save a failing relationship.<p>&gt; <i>it would be nice if people had to think about the care and feeding of others more often</i><p>Perhaps we can get young people more dogs. Or a fish.')
