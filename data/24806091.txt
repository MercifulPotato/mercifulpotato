I am without MIDI keyboard at present as I play an acoustic upright, but I will look out for an opportunity to give it a proper go.<p>And I might as well put in a feature idea (which I suspect would be rather tricky to implement but here goes anyway!): it would be awesome if it could take input from a mic and figure out the notes from that, so it could work with acoustic instruments too :)')
