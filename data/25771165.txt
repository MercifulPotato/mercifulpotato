Item(by='giantg2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610592081, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25769762, text='True, the better jobs tend to have better benefits to go along with the better pay. I&#x27;m non-FAANG, making less than a third of you and my max out of pocket is $7k with a $3500 deductible and something like $7k in premiums. My kid has a condition now and so I will be hitting the max out of pocket every year or close to it.<p>So my comment was intended to apply generally. I can certainly see that there could be some outliers that this wouldn&#x27;t apply to. I feel like SV and FAANG sort of fall into that category. I think many of us never make close to that money (or maybe I&#x27;m just a loser). I think I&#x27;ll top out at $120k (today&#x27;s value) if I have some career advancement, which seems unlikely. The US average (median?) for a developer is about $95k.')
