And rightly so. Allowing everything isn’t a shield from that accusation, nor should it be. Good faith moderation is.<p>Since there are platforms without that content, the effect of starting a new platform allowing it is that you get a disproportionate amount of the most extreme content. You become the gab or parler or t_d.win.<p>Next, if your content has an extremely high ratio of content that must be moderated to be allowed in a “parent service” (App Store, cloud provider, credit card company) then your moderation burden is higher than your competition. Your ad revenue is also likely smaller. So basically, it’s simply very difficult economically to create such a platform.')
