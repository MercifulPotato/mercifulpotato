He is presenting his opponent&#x27;s viewpoint, with humorous exaggeration.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s just not the case that students can absorb new material five times faster<p>That isn&#x27;t his claim here. It&#x27;s hard not to agree that books can be more polished. But his viewpoint is that &quot;50 minutes of mathematics occupying 50 minutes of exposition&quot; is actually a blessing, both because it limits the author&#x27;s temptation to squeeze in one more thing, one more generalization. And because it puts the experienced speaker&#x27;s thought process on show, not only the final tidied-up result. He does go into these points later but I&#x27;m lazy to find quotes.')
