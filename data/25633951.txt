Note that anyone who does so is bad at their job; and won&#x27;t last long unless if anyone else wants it.<p>-Workers commonly take multi-month parental leave breaks; block off afternoons for a kid&#x27;s event, etc.<p>-I don&#x27;t know anyone who works 100 hours a week; and if I did I would think them a fool. And also help them; as this is unsafe and they need some more sleep!<p>I understand that other gigs, especially perhaps in Gaming, are different! And workers of course have the right to freely associate, and so collectively bargain, if they choose to.')
