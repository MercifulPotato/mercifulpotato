If your item&#x27;s status says &quot;pending review&quot; for more than three weeks, you should contact support.&quot;<p>Reviews are meant to take longer if you ask for e.g. permission to all URLs  (which a large number of popular extensions need to because of lack of permission granularity). Maybe your extension isn&#x27;t impacted here? There&#x27;s no guarantee the next update won&#x27;t get trapped in the review queue either, which is not going to be fun when a critical fix is pending.')
