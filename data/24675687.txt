So you have a flux of heat. But if the other object is hotter, you have a lux of heat from in the wrong direction, that is impossible according to the Second Law<p>I don&#x27;t think your hypothesis would necessarily break the Second Law. Wouldn&#x27;t the hotter distant object result in making Brownian motion around it?  The same Brownian motion which would <i>eventually</i> end up as energy input at the graphene membrane - provided a thermodynamically closed system?<p>As so I&#x27;m not convinced this study breaks the Second Law, nor do I see how it produces useful work. To me it only seems so, because the system isn&#x27;t being modeled as a closed system...<p>EDIT: Actually, I&#x27;m pretty sure the following statement is completely false:<p>&gt;the graphene and circuit are at the same temperature and heat does not flow between the two.<p>I&#x27;d suspect heat does flow between the two, it&#x27;s just outside their modeling of the system.')
