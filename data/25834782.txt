I don&#x27;t agree that a primary residence qualifies as secure under that definition. Fire, flood, earthquake, etc all put you at risk of losing both keys, as does a search by law enforcement.<p>I _really_ don&#x27;t agree that if one of those things happen I will no longer care about accessing my digital possessions&#x2F;accounts. If anything I need that access more than I did before it happened.<p>And home isn&#x27;t really convenient enough for many people: I, for one, frequently create accounts at work and when traveling. This subset of people are going to be doing either #2 or #3.<p>For the folks that are still using the same password everywhere I think a password manager is a better recommendation than a security key. For one it helps them everywhere, not just the small number of sites that currently support U2F&#x2F;Webauthn. For another, such a person is probably at high risk of making mistake #2.')
