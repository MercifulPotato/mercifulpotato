It simply signifies that our model is flawed or incomplete.<p>The grandfather problem is a paradox <i>if our model of time travel is one which is impossible</i>. That is the point. It is <i>simply a way of demonstrating why there needs to be constraints that makes our more naive notions of time travel impossible</i>. As such it constrains the set of possible valid models to those in which the grandfather paradox can&#x27;t be expressed within the constraints of the model.<p>&gt;  I wasnâ€™t merely making up impossible scenarios; I was demonstrating how their theory gives rise to paradoxical scenarios.<p>You&#x27;ve done no such thing. The paradoxical scenario you imagine <i>can&#x27;t be expressed</i> in the model I proposed, and so it solves the paradox.')
