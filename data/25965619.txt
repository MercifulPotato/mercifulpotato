And before this incident, the philosophy of Ethereum was that &quot;the code is the contract&quot;. The hacker did not breach the contract. They noticed a bug, or as one could say, a loophole, and used it to their benefit.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the mechanism of enforcement was. Whether it was a fork or something else, the net effect was that a) the history was rewritten, the contract terms changed retroactively, and the monies were returned to their source; and b) the concept of code is contract was effectively showed to be an empty gesture and the philosophy was effectively abandoned.')
