(I was never dismissive publicly, but probably didn&#x27;t pay as much attention as I could have).  I would have to say that the buzzword turned out to be pretty accurate: those 3 things largely defined the last decade in terms of software technology, as I see it.<p>Especially for young people -- there is no world where they don&#x27;t use some form of social media on their phones (including ones that didn&#x27;t exist in 2012).<p>They use cloud applications rather than desktop ones -- that&#x27;s the &quot;default&quot;.  Businesses also use cloud infrastructure -- that&#x27;s the &quot;default&quot;.<p>Lots of money was made in these 3 areas.')
