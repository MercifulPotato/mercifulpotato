Many I’ve known are making even more money AND working from home, which has been a huge win, win for them. Any extension of this situation is a huge boost for them economically and lifestyle wise.<p>Most of my personal circle though is small business owners, and starting with the laughable PPP mess and joke loan offerings, and just screwed up situation economically and shifted consumer habits, many are looking for the exits and running for the hills.<p>Only a couple in my group are doing really well in all of this, but they cater to the luxury end of the scale and the rich have gotten significantly richer in all of this. One of them does very high end custom pools and he is booked into 2022 with jobs because of all the California money flowing into Arizona.<p>My main concern is we have green lit tyranny to the governments around the world. For a virus that is arguably no worse than anything else we’ve experienced in the last 60-80 years we have flipped human rights and liberties on it’s head and completely perverted it. We are now in the process of normalizing this situation and behavior long term. The consequences of this are going to be felt for years after this, if not decades. We likely won’t even remember the virus in 5-7 years, but we’ll still be living under the system it ushered in.')
