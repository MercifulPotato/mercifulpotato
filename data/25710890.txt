The question of how to use a tool arises from the existence of the tool.<p>&gt; otherwise you could hold me responsible for looking at a driver the wrong way, which annoyed him past a threshold<p>You&#x27;re still just responsible for your own acts, and they for theirs. If you were being a dick to them needlessly, that&#x27;s your fault, and if it tipped them over the edge, it&#x27;s natural to feel bad. Not fully responsible, but also not as if you had zero to do with it.<p>Just like when someone gets bullied and commits suicide, you don&#x27;t just look at that act of suicide and talk about who had the most agency and what one should focus on.<p>&gt; You definitely want to focus your attention on people with most agency over the problem, and those people usually aren&#x27;t scientists or engineers.<p>There is no need to &quot;focus attention&quot;, and holding one party responsible for their actions is orthogonal to holding other parties responsible for theirs. This is a tech forum, Weizenbaum was one of <i>the</i> greats when it comes to writing about technology and morality, and I dare say it is the responsibility of technologists to be familiar with his body of work.<p>&gt; And you can&#x27;t simultaneously praise decision makers for their wisdom and leadership, and absolve them from responsibility because they&#x27;ve only used an &quot;evil&quot; piece of tech they found laying somewhere.<p>That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t, and never hinted at doing so, and even clearly stated the opposite when I said &quot;All links in the chain are responsible for what they do&quot;.')
