Item(by='rglullis', descendants=None, kids=[25670182], score=None, time=1610010621, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25664520, text='Though not direct, there should be alignment between what a business creates and offers and consumers&#x27; (society&#x27;s) satisfaction.<p>&quot;Users seem happy&quot;, the same can be said about smokers and tobacco. The issue is not even with the smoking per se. If tobacco companies were simply processing the plant and giving users what people have done for hundreds (thousands?) of years, it would be fine by me. The problem of Big Tobacco is in developing the mechanisms where they stopped satisfying consumer demand and artificially creating it.<p>Facebook (not just them, you can include actually all of Big Media) is doing the same thing to people. I&#x27;d be ashamed to work on FB, or Fox or CNN just the same way I would if I were working on Philip &amp; Morris')
