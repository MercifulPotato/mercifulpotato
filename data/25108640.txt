Are you really telling me NO ONE shorter than 5&#x27;3 ever decided the trade offs were worth it?<p>No, at some point, it doesn&#x27;t matter how hard you work or whether or not you have any outside issues; some people simply don&#x27;t have the genetic attributes needed to be great.<p>Now, everyone can get better, but we all have some limit to our abilities that we approach but don&#x27;t cross as we work harder and practice. Not everyone who isn&#x27;t great should feel like it is because they didn&#x27;t choose to be great, some people (most of us, probably) just aren&#x27;t capable of being that great.<p>Of course, most of us aren&#x27;t that close to our limits, and it is impossible to know what those limits are.... but they are there nonetheless.')
