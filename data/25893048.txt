Yes the language was out then, but it took a while for even for basic practices like 2 and 3 compatible code bases to emerge, and for any of the most popular libraries to support 3. Even 5 years ago, maybe even 3 years ago the “is it compatible with py3 yet” page still had some non-trivial gaps.<p>So it’s not like it has been feasible for most projects to migrate for a full decade, it’s only been a few years.')
