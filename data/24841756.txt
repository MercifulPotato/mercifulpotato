I would have to get in touch with the advertisers to see if that data is still in their account (which may be possible, I&#x27;ll see what I can do).<p>It&#x27;s also not sufficient even if they do that. Many advertisers will run a time-sensitive campaign -- free traffic 3 weeks later in those scenarios is worthless. I actually doubt google does this because if they did it would be most easily implemented as an account credit.<p>They just keep the money and hope no one ever holds them accountable for anything.')
