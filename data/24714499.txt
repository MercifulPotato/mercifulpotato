They are saying that the situation in which Monty opens a door and it reveals the grand prize, are the set of cases that we do not care about because we have already lost, and can thus discard them.<p>This is basically just a different way of saying that Monty looks behind the door to be sure to only reveal goats.<p>Yes, the probability of wins will be different in these two scenarios, but it doesn’t affect the conclusion: when Monty reveals a goat, you should always switch.<p>Edit: if you believe I am the confused one after this comment, I will go make the simulation as you suggest.')
