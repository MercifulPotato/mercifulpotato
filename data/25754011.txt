So its a bit more personal than anonymous internet ninja philosophers so popular not only here these days.<p>What you write doesn&#x27;t make much sense. The world isn&#x27;t black and white, and left and right have whole spectrum. The ultra (left or right) never overthink their decision, always feel righteous even if heading straight to hell. If you think moderate left (ie EU from US perspective), it might be a correct assessment from certain point of view (not a big fan of EU here, I like the theory but not many things in practice).<p>Moderate right&#x2F;centrists could be described exactly same things as you say about left.<p>Why right might beat left, at least in theory, is because it gives people more money directly. People like that. tey like to have some control over such an important thing. Instead of massive taxation, that in ideal world isn&#x27;t stolen in some way (in reality much&#x2F;most of it is, or at least very badly mismanaged) and spent in social, health, education, infrastructure etc.<p>Once folks see real money, they have at least some control&#x2F;choice over it. Even if kindergardens cost a fortune (there are other options in some cases), and paid maternity leave is shorter (you can stay longer but unpaid). And health care might cost something (but apart from US its not a bad idea generally, works great in Switzerland for example).<p>Oh and don&#x27;t forget the lean state aparate, very attractive unless you are actually some semi-useless otherwise unemployable state bureaucrat. And so on.')
