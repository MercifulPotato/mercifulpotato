Just 10 years ago, you probably still needed to play with OpAmps and Inductors to effectively read a hundreds-of-MHz signal in any real capacity (at the hobbyist scale at least: $1000 or less projects). A PC probably had the compute girth back then to interpret the data, but you still needed a high-speed, and high-quality, ADC to even read the data that quickly.')
