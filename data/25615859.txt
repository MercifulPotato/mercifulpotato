Nearly every car on the road has a GPS, either organic to the vehicle or inside the driver&#x27;s phone.  If we wanted to actually enforce speed limits it would be a trivial matter to have google forward the relevant information.<p>This was done by a few rental car companies many moons ago (circa 2001).  Speeding laws don&#x27;t know how to account for such data.  Should someone speeding continuously over many miles be fined more or less than someone who speeds twice, each time only for a short distance?  Traffic laws are premised on the systems by which people are caught (cops, traffic cameras etc).  They are not adapted to the perfect knowledge that modern tech can provide.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drivers.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;428&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drivers.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;428&#x2F;</a><p>Of course, if we really care, it would be trivial to limit all cars to a particular speed while on public roads.  Japanese motorcycles are already limited by industry agreement, iirc 300kph (see the Hyabusa fiasco).  Merc&#x2F;BMW cars are limited to 250kph.  Those limit could be lowered via a simple software patch.')
