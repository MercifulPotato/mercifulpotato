Of course the one on sale previously had a bunch of bad reviews, but merged with the reliable SKUs it appeared to have a good average and had a nice star rating. The comments showed an inconsistent story all about that one SKU.<p>What Amazon is doing is just outright dishonest and ought to be against the law. They are certainly intentionally utilising this to sell products with dishonest reviews and star ratings.')
