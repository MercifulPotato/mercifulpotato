In that case, the user will likely need to be using a popular browser loaded with graphical features, with images, CSS, Javascript and cookies enabled.  In practice, it would be impossible to make a purchase via web with only Host: and Connection: headers.  (How many websites engaging in online commerce require neither images, Javascript nor cookies.)  That said, there may be instances where web users are not engaging in commerce or other uses that require graphics, cookies and interactivity (submitting forms, etc.).  It would seem futile to show ads to users who may not see them due to their client potentially not showing images or running Javascript.')
