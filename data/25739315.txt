Those who don&#x27;t acknowledge&#x2F;comprehend this issue yet are claiming to defend a &quot;free market&quot; are called &quot;vulgar libertarians&quot;:<p>&quot;Vulgar libertarian apologists for capitalism use the term &quot;free market&quot; in an equivocal sense: they seem to have trouble remembering, from one moment to the next, whether they’re defending actually existing capitalism or free market principles. So we get the standard boilerplate article arguing that the rich can’t get rich at the expense of the poor, because &quot;that’s not how the free market works&quot; — implicitly assuming that this is a free market. When prodded, they’ll grudgingly admit that the present system is not a free market, and that it includes a lot of state intervention on behalf of the rich. But as soon as they think they can get away with it, they go right back to defending the wealth of existing corporations on the basis of &quot;free market principles.&quot;&quot; -- Kevin Carson')
