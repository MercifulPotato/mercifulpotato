What are you encompassing with &quot;the left&quot; here?<p>Social democracies here in Europe are nowhere close to opposing market freedom and property rights. The opposition is mostly to complete unregulated markets, nothing much further than this at the moment. Even here in Sweden, which the media and people in the US like to paint as &quot;socialist&quot;, is very far from being socialist... To the point where it&#x27;s more a market economy with socialist ideas tackled on (welfare, comprehensive healthcare, free education, etc.) to disrupt markets that are inefficient or monopolistic in nature.<p>The left don&#x27;t even exist in the US, whenever I hear an American repeat what I quoted I laugh a little bit inside, it&#x27;s a strawman based on thin air and fears for the most part.')
