Skyrim does dynamic leveling and this has the advantage you are not stuck in the beginners zone where you have to do most of the quests so you can get enough levels and money to be able to exit this zone.<p>I also like Gothic series did the static enemy levels and enemy would respawn only on Chapter changes, this gave you a god feeling when you could finally access a hard area and defeat the guys that were impossible to scratch at start.<p>So IMO both Skyrim and gothic work because they feet the game and the player base that is targeting and give a different feel of the world, there is no better system IMO. Also in Skyrim the stronger enemies differ visually too, is not just a hidden number that is increased, stronger enemy types with stronger gear is spawn.')
