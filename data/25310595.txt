They&#x27;re technically shopping areas, but they&#x27;re very car-centric, with 5- or 7-lane 45mph roads with tons of curb cuts and huge parking lots all around. You&#x27;ll have the dealerships grouped by big franchises, each building doing it&#x27;s best at giving the impression of separate businesses for imports, one for each of the big 3, a used lot, and a carwash and probably a gas station. The other side of the pedestrian-impassable road may have a mall, a big box store, fast food, or small retailers, and there&#x27;s probably more a half mile down the road, but there&#x27;s no sidewalk or safe way to walk there from the dealership.<p>Some malls making an effort to be more relevant than they were in the 80s have charging spots in their parking lots, that would be a lot more attractive.')
