Many of the bugs, especially on PC, are not game-breaking bugs. Things like getting into a car and having it launch you 100 feet into the air before returning you to the ground is pretty amusing, sure. Being able to drive straight through other cars with no collision is actually convenient at times. Having your dong flop around while T-posing on top of a motorcycle is pretty hilarious. I think a lot of people are giving these bugs a pass because they&#x27;re mildly entertaining... but they&#x27;re definitely still issues that should be addressed, IMO.<p>I am having plenty of fun playing the game despite the &quot;jank&quot;, but the bugs are undeniably there and completely immersion breaking. The game very quickly goes from being a serious game about sex trafficking, drugs, and evil corporations into a meme game about flying cars and funny looking character models... if you don&#x27;t care much about immersion and just want to shoot things and look at pretty neon graphics, I can see why you would still love this game, but I can&#x27;t imagine that was what CDPR intended.')
