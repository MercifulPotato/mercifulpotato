Blockchain is littered with startups making that bet, but now quite serious players are making that bet too.<p>Regardless how far up the hype curve you think blockchain is, it&#x27;s interesting that AP is leveraging its reputation to commit to a project in this emerging tech.<p>Idea is that oracles are that bridge between the physical and the blockchain worlds, and it&#x27;s these interfaces that are always the problem for the blockchain idealists. Playing that bridge role relies on being a trusted source so people believe you won&#x27;t just run away with their funds... a startup doesn&#x27;t start with the reputation needed to pull that off, but someone like AP does. So it&#x27;s an interesting competitive advantage for someone like AP to do this.')
