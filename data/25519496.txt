The VRM or Voltage Regulator Module is responsible for converting the 12V input down to 1.3V or so for the CPU. Under that heatsink there are 2 of the 8 phases for CPU Vcore and 2 phases for Vsoc. It would be pretty safe to remove that heatsink, even in a passive case because:<p>- Vsoc draws very little power, especially with no iGPU.<p>- The VRM is designed to survive providing 200A to a 16 core 3950X, 50A to a 2600 is very easy by comparison. Maybe 6W of heat split among the 8 phases so &lt;2W of heat on these 2 phases.<p>- The MOSFETs will happily run all day at up to 125C.<p>- The MOSFETs are smart power stages which communicate their temperature to the controller, and have many built-in protections, so there&#x27;s extremely little risk of damage. The controller probably shares load amongst the phases based on temperature but I can&#x27;t find a datasheet to confirm.<p>Ref: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yXwjwxb39EA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yXwjwxb39EA</a>')
