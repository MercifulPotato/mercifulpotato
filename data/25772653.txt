So pkm should support backlink. And notes should not live in seperate folders. Relation of note should be provided by links. Notes or parts of notes can be embedded to others. These are basics. And rest is plugins, ux. But these are basics. Of course this philospy also regrets vendorlock. Thats why they mostly use markdwon. These are the requirement. Backlink, embedding, markdown, graph view of notes relation. Who achieve that on multi-platform will win the game. Obsidian is on the way. But their users are generally developers. So they want always new features. So the markdwon format started to lose the feature of interoperatibilty. Needs are that simple. And all solutions on some point will need an mobile app. Because in use case you will need your pkm with you allways.')
