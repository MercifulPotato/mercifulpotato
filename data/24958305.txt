Even if, in terms of knowledge skills, SR only helps directly with the memorization component, there&#x27;s considerable empirical evidence that it does make that more time efficient. Using it to structure that part of learning allows you, all other things being equal, to <i>reduce</i> the proportion of learning time devoted to memorization.<p>&gt; SR takes the worst 8th grade history class you ever had and doubles down on it.<p>Well, SRS maybe. Having first learned about SR in ballroom dance teacher training as a tool for structuring both curriculum for in-person instruction and personal practice, I disagree.<p>The common usage pattern for spaced repetition software may do that, but spaced repetition is more than just that.')
