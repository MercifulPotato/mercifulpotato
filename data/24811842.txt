The primary monitor uses the HDMI port, and it works fine. The secondary monitor runs off Thunderbolt and a couple of weeks ago it started going black, randomly. This isn&#x27;t a hardware issue, because I have used multiple cables and monitors, and I have used both Thunderbolt-to-HDMI and Thunderbolt-to-VGA adapters and I get the same issue. Oddly, the black screen still shows the mouse pointer, and if I take a screen shot it shows what the monitor should be displaying.<p>The fact that it just started happening leads me to believe that it came with an operating system update, and it&#x27;s probably a driver issue.<p>Apple really needs to get its act together on USB.')
