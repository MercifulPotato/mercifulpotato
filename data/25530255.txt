It seems incredibly insensitive given the minute amount of difference it is likely to make - the way to tell a phishing email from a non-phishing email depends much more on the metadata than the actual contents, so there&#x27;s no reason to play with people&#x27;s emotions like this. Even the employees who immediately recognized it as phishing will have felt the disappointment.')
