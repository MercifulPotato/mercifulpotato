If we could quantitatively characterize every little effect, we might be able to model complex systems accurately, but it isn&#x27;t always possible (exceptions exist, like meteorological modeling). For the longest time in biology, the modeling approach has tended to be more qualitative than quantitative, though this is changing.<p>Yes, identifying root-causes from the outcomes is a model inversion problem (here&#x27;s the data, find the generating model), and model inversion problems tend to be ill-conditioned. In complex systems, there&#x27;s so many possible combinations of causes that could have led to a single outcome that characterizing the entire set is difficult.')
