It is almost always the perspective character that is the defending party, so perhaps it doesn&#x27;t have the same influence.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting difference. I find that in U.S.A. romance fiction, more often than not, the protagonist is the party who falls in love, and the story is about the protagonist courting and succeeding in winning the love interest, whereas in Japanese romance fiction, the protagonist usually starts out strongly disliking the love interest, who is the offensive party, but eventually is won over.<p>I find that say, <i>Boston Legal</i> is essentially a <i>clicheÃÅ</i>d Japanese teenage girl&#x27;s romance fiction from the other perspective. If one think of Alan Shore&#x27;s many love interests as the protagonists of such stories, who are initially quite disgusted and annoyed by his antics and sexual harassment, but more and more find themselves falling for him, it&#x27;s actually quite similar but reversed.')
