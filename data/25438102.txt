Item(by='rappatic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608083858, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25435652, text='I play PC with a pretty good rig (RTX 2080S and i7-9700) and performance has been fine. I do struggle to hit 1440p60 at high settings in certain scenes (driving in populated areas etc.) but the game has been pretty bug-free for me at least. I had some bad crashes on D1 but after the 1.04 patch I had no problems at all besides a single isolated animation bug where a single character&#x27;s glass would hover six inches to the side of her hand. Maybe this is just me?<p>I&#x27;ve been loving the game. I completed it and am starting my second playthrough. Honestly, my only complaint is that it&#x27;s too _short_, and I think CDPR took comments about the Witcher 3&#x27;s long length a little too much to heart. I would not have complained for a second if it was double the length or more.')
