If you mean that you can&#x27;t have a houswife as a character on your show that very obviously isn&#x27;t true. If you mean you can&#x27;t make a show where a character aspires to be a housewife, I&#x27;m not sure I understand what the narrative purpose of such a story would be. Becoming a housewife isn&#x27;t really an aspirational achievement in the way having a prestigious career is, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a story many are really interested in, nor one that would be easy to tell in a manner that doesn&#x27;t seem forced. There is certainly a lot of media (both in the past and today) where a woman aspires to romance or marry someone, and domestic fantasy is a common element in those, but that isn&#x27;t really specific to becoming a housewife, and the romance is the key aspiration in those.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t help that maintaining a family on a single income is not economically viable for most people anymore. People want stories that relate to their own fantasies.')
