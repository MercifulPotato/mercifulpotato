For instance he claims Bitcoin to be anonymous and a criminals&#x27; haven when all BTC transactions are publicly and permanently recorded on the blockchain. While also criticising it&#x27;s inefficiencies he offers no other alternatives nor any solutions for them.<p>Unrelated though; There is no fighting against Bitcoin as the future of digital currency. The fast dinosaurs like PayPal have already started seeing the mass extinction ahead.')
