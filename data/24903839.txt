I bet one could go through the privacy statement of a large co like youtube &#x2F; facebook and nitpick similar issues. Of course it should be aligned, although i think it never is, a privacy statement is definitely not a reflection of how good a productâ€™s security is.<p>Best of luck to you and your team!')
