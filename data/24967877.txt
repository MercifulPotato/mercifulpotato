The purpose of this DMCA claim wasn&#x27;t just to prevent people from downloading videos, it was to set a legal precedent for the RIAA and similar organizations to troll Github and anyone hosting public repositories with it, by linking them to &quot;illegal downloads&quot;.<p>By agreeing to this without any public opposition, Github has become similar to Youtube itself, in that it will be expected to immediately comply with Ã  la carte takedown requests by RIAA and other copyright trolls from now on. It doesn&#x27;t matter that the actual reason to take down your large repository is political or it simply bothers certain company for miscellaneous reasons, since all it takes is some &quot;illegal content&quot;.')
