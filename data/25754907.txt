At some point  the scale of reach and influence come into conflict with public policy and governance.<p>Newspapers are horribly regulated and most TV stations can say what they like within reason - especially in the US where being fair and balanced is no longer a requirement to run a news service.<p>This jurisdictional problem affects all media and isn&#x27;t just limited to social platforms.<p>The difference with TV and Newspapers is that they can have their licenses revoked. So there is a degree of power wielded by the government over what is acceptable locally.<p>In contrast, social media infringes on sovereign power by existing and influencing on a global scale without being regulated on a local one. A great example is name suppression during trials, it might be illegal for a newspaper in France to publish a name, but that doesn&#x27;t stop one in the UK from doing it, and because the paper has a website, that foreign paper inadvertently breaks local law in France because anyone can look it up, but it can&#x27;t be held accountable.<p>Sovereignty and global digital media do not intersect well without an interface - and that just doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Expect more balkanisation of the Internet in the future as govts take back some control over media within their borders.<p>And no, I&#x27;m not advocating for  dictator-like suppression of free-speech, but a mechanism of accountability for foreign firms breaking local laws.<p>It&#x27;s a shame that the real-world example has to be Trump,  if this had happened to Malala, or Thunberg, or the Pope, the advocacy for oversight and accountability would be a lot easier to digest.')
