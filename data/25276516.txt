One version is &quot;Vitalik&#x27;s fork&quot; and another one is &quot;non-Vitalik&#x27;s fork&quot;. Which one of them is a valid chain? Any idea?<p>Assume the attacker is Vitalik and there an &quot;evidence&quot; of his attack. Who will dare to slash him? Vitalik won&#x27;t include this evidence into &quot;Vitalik&#x27;s fork&quot;. If Vitalik wants to have his own blockchain, nobody cares, isn&#x27;t it?')
