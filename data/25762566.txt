Many apps are free.<p>Then again I&#x27;ve never really understood the point of free (as in beer) software that&#x27;s not also open source (or at least source available), so personally I think dropping platform support for a [free, cross-platform] application rather than simply distributing a tarball for users to do as they wish with is a bit dramatic.<p>Personally though I think it&#x27;s weird that so many people are okay with distributing on platforms they don&#x27;t even own. It&#x27;s particularly rampant in cross-platform dev - I don&#x27;t understand how anyone can feel comfortable just publishing an app on Android and&#x2F;or iOS when they&#x27;ve never tested it on a real device, to talk of actually collecting money for it.')
