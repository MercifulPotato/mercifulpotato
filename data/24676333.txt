Since becoming a father I realised how annoying our analogue microwave knob is when you just need to blast something for 20 second while dealing with a screaming child. Either it&#x27;s too short and you get 2 second, or it&#x27;s too long and you get 60, now you need to do your best to cool the thing down quickly<p>Not sure about your microwave, but mine (ca. 1996 Panasonic) has an analog knob (actually, that&#x27;s the <i>only</i> control) for time.<p>If I need less than a minute, I turn the knob <i>past</i> 1 minute, then turn it back where I want it.  That pretty much always works for me.<p>Perhaps it might for you too.')
