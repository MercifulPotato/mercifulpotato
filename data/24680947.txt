To get users you need apps, to get app developers you need users.<p>I didn&#x27;t say it would be easy. :-)   It is a huge can of worms to declare the current smartphone + app store design as a public utility to be preserved for 50 years, when this industry is barely 12 years old at this point.<p>&gt; To overcome that you don&#x27;t just need something which is as good as the status quo, you need something so much better that people will switch to it despite the apps conundrum.<p>Yes.   I don&#x27;t think it will come from &quot;the smartphone&quot; market which has already been won.  It will come by some disruptor that eats into adjacencies:  AR, VR, wearables, etc.  Apple actually has a good chance to retain their position because everyone has underestimated how important Apple Watch could become, plus their investments in AR.<p>&gt; Who do you propose has the resources to unseat the incumbents at this point?<p>Alibaba group, Facebook, Valve, Tencent, Huawei, Amazon,  and Microsoft.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s a big part of the problem -- the users lack visibility into the inner workings. How many iPhone customers even realize that competing stores are prohibited, or that Apple bans things they may want?<p>I think most users are broadly aware that Apple control things and take a cut.   Most people have to deal with Kindle or Audible and having to buy that content via a different app or the browser.   IMO the current legal argument is broadly not about banned apps, it&#x27;s about profit margins.<p>&gt; The developers can&#x27;t even show the users how much they&#x27;re paying, or offer discounts for purchases made through other channels, because Apple prohibits it.<p>So does every other platform provider though.  Publishers and retailers can&#x27;t discount Nintendo switch games unless Nintendo approves it.  This goes back 40 years to Atari.<p>&gt; And the lack of user awareness is another impediment to establishing a new competing platform.<p>I think the bigger issue is if users actually <i>prefer</i> the current curated arrangement.')
