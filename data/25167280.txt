RISC tends to allow addresses in the load&#x2F;store to be exactly as complex as allowed by how many bits they’ve got available if you account for size of the architectural register file being the priority. So, it could probably go either way generally, but since 32 bits is about the right size for instructions, there’s no way in practice to fit the whole address. But RISC load&#x2F;store instructions end up having some pretty sophisticated addressing forms. ARM’s are crazy powerful.<p>But if you go variable length then why not.<p>In CISC, generally, yes, absolute addresses are allowed. But x86-64 only allows absolute 64-bit addresses and immediates  in a handful of instructions.')
