Which sort of makes sense in that we only _can_ address the physical evidence that is in front of us as members of the public, but shouldn&#x27;t we at least acknowledge it seems somewhat unlikely that several members of the Navy with thousands of hours of training onboard both fighter jets and also in the radar rooms of Destroyers all collectively believed they were seeing physically impossible maneuvers by multiple targets, or that these tracking systems are that unreliable, or that they all collectively decided to lie about these videos and make up a story? Dismissing a video as showing a bird or balloon subject to parallax is great, but those explanations fall down if we choose to believe the report that they had radar tracking these objects at impossible velocities.<p>Perhaps the lying is the most logical possibility if this is a planned piece of government disinformation &#x2F; muddying of the waters around technology or UFO&#x2F;UAPs for some strategic reason, but let&#x27;s at least discuss the topic before saying &#x27;it was a bird or balloon, slam dunk, case-closed&#x27;.')
