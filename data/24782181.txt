So unless we checked the linkedin link (almost never provided) and clicked through to projects (or followed links in docs, neither of which I or any I&#x27;ve talked to have ever done AFAIR), we&#x27;d never see it.<p>It might be workable for last-round or very small + &quot;high contact&quot; interview pipelines, but it&#x27;s probably useless earlier or at larger companies.')
