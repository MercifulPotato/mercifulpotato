Now you seem to be arguing the opposite. Everything you wrote above correlates with the opinions I&#x27;ve expressed so far.<p>You also wrote:<p>&gt; If you live in a [country where homosexuality is illegal] and secretly a homosexual, do not send emails indicating that you&#x27;re a homosexual.<p>As if that&#x27;s an acceptable state of affairs and a reasonable compromise for the purpose of catching the occasional bad actor. It isn&#x27;t.')
