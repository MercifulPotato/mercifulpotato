We can only guess why users flag things. It was flagkilled for a while and then we unkilled it but left [flagged] on. It also got a lot of upvotes, so the signals were actually mixed.<p>I don&#x27;t have any special insight, but FWIW: situations like this are inevitably messy. People want different things (e.g. the social standard about not speaking ill of the dead vs. curiosity to know the truth or share inside information) and they do different things (e.g. use of throwaway accounts to share sensitive true information vs. to post rumors or lies). How all that adds up is impossible to be certain about, and people will strongly disagree. It&#x27;s intrinsically conflictual and I don&#x27;t think we can impose simple rules on it. For example: HN is a watercooler site and it&#x27;s natural for people to wonder what really happened and want to talk about it; and at the same time, that sort of internet thread can run amok and do harm surprisingly quickly.<p>In my experience, that sort of throwaway account (but there are many sorts—let&#x27;s not overgeneralize) is usually reporting something true, though perhaps biased. But &quot;usually&quot; is still far from certain. If we&#x27;d known that it was likely false we&#x27;d have left the comment flagkilled, but in this case it felt likely true, so I unkilled it, but left [flagged] on as a marker of community discontent. To anyone who objects &quot;who the hell are you to make calls about &#x27;feels&#x27;, &#x27;likely&#x27;, &#x27;true&#x27; or &#x27;false&#x27;&quot;, I can only completely agree.<p>p.s. Here&#x27;s what I replied to a user who emailed about it a few days ago:<p><i>&quot;I&#x27;ve unkilled the comment but left it [flagged]. I think that&#x27;s the right balance.</i><p><i>Posts like that are usually authentic, in my experience. Not to say that people don&#x27;t make shit up on the internet—they certainly do—but one can usually &#x27;smell&#x27; the difference somehow.</i><p><i>Of course the fact that it&#x27;s true doesn&#x27;t make it an appropriate comment, but I think [flagged] is enough of a marker to indicate that, and to let people decide for themselves.</i><p><i>It&#x27;s a tragic story in any case.&quot;</i>')
