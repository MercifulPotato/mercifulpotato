Even more, I&#x27;m not so sure that it is in accordance with Github&#x27;s rules, and might (sometimes) even be in in direct violation of the license with which it is got published. Either way, it certainly feels abusive.<p>While I did read a lot of positive things about this particular project in several of the comments, one thing just rubs me the wrong way (and I can&#x27;t shake it) .. it is the short time frame (left) until the kickstarter will run out, with the clearly stated intent to not open source if it doesn&#x27;t make enough money in time. That just feels wrong on too many levels. I&#x27;m quite surprised actually, that I didn&#x27;t  see this pointing out by more people.')
