I’m an artist who specializes in Illustrator, and I have some simple rules for its pen tool:<p>1. Drag curve handles out to 1&#x2F;3 of the length of the curve segment they control.<p>2. Eschew s-curves between two control points.<p>3. Don’t turn more than about 90º between two control points.<p>There are people out there who have a similar set of rules but prefer to always put their control points at 12&#x2F;3&#x2F;6&#x2F;9 o’clock; for more circular shapes this works, but it falls apart on anything interesting - try drawing an oval with its long axis at about 45° with my method and with this method, and observe how much more uneven the curve handles have to be for the 12&#x2F;3&#x2F;6&#x2F;9 method.')
