I think when it comes to compile size zig does it a bit better due to it&#x27;s smaller std although, when compiling rust with just a link to libc and a printf call I believe you get an exe ~2048b when optimizing for size so I&#x27;m not certain how well that scales.<p>The 100 line hack I used was to noop out the `.idata` section which link.exe refused to merge&#x2F;shrink, that only saved me 1Kb in the end.<p>Looking at the section info of the zig exe it looks like there is some black magic going on with it&#x27;s alignment so I may have to dig deeper to see what zig is doing here.  Also thank you both for pointing zig out, I haven&#x27;t heard of it until now and it may come in handy for something else I&#x27;m planning on making :)')
