In the US that may be 30-40% and in France and Venezuela 60 and 80%, respectively.<p>In the US the government redistributes 20% and borrows another 5%. Add to that verticals overregulated by the Feds (energy, telco, healthcare) and you&#x27;ll quickly hit 40%. If you are allowed to run a business but have to buy overpriced services (healthcare) you don&#x27;t want, that greatly diminishes your supposed economic freedom.<p>Rule of Law doesn&#x27;t help you because laws suck (and they suck because of Democracy, so no, Democracy combined with Rule of Law is why life now sucks in the West).<p>The article is completely misguided, of course. It doesn&#x27;t matter if socialism retards innovation or improves &quot;public&quot; health. If an individual does not want to participate in it, then it&#x27;s wrong and does not work for that person and they should be free to choose. It&#x27;s as simple as that.<p>You can run a socialist community in the US (assuming you own land in a state where there&#x27;s no land tax). You can&#x27;t run a capitalist community in China or the EU.')
