Item(by='fastball', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607150487, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311760, text='Not GC, but I&#x27;ll try to answer constructively. I don&#x27;t know Doreen personally, but the thing that always strikes me about her writing is how much of it is spent calling other people names (exactly as the GC did to her) or talking about how other people mistreat her.<p>In this article: &quot;classist&quot;, &quot;toxic&quot;, &quot;asshole&quot;, &quot;mommy issues&quot;, &quot;bullying me&quot;, &quot;warped&quot;, &quot;unhealthy&quot;, &quot;harassing me&quot;, &quot;insulting me&quot; are all used.<p>And yet not once did Doreen apparently do anything wrong. She comes across as entirely blameless, which to me is a sign of a suspect narrative. It&#x27;s like my friend that hasn&#x27;t had much luck romantically who always blames such issues on the women he dates â€“ failing to realize that the common denominator is not them, it&#x27;s him.')
