Namecoin is dead but there are a few projects pushing forward, including ENS and Unstoppable Domains.<p>There&#x27;s opportunity for a significant privacy and authentication improvement over DNS. Two key advantages:<p>1. One can run one&#x27;s own node, reducing or eliminating DNS privacy leakage. Today your ISP can&#x27;t read your traffic with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;secret-newsletter.example.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;secret-newsletter.example.com&#x2F;</a> but they do know that you looked up the IP address of secret-newsletter.example.com. which is about as bad. DoH is somewhat better because you can choose your DoH provider, but in practice people will probably use one of a few major offerings, which they&#x27;ll have to trust.<p>2. Info about a name can be authenticated, so in response to query you could receive both the ip address corresponding to a name, and a hash of the TLS certificate that ip address should use, removing the ugly hack of certificate authorities. There&#x27;s lots of details to get right here, but the potential advantages are enormous.<p>IMO those are the key advantages of DNS on the blockchain. But there&#x27;s a big gap between having an idea and executing on it. There&#x27;s tons of existing DNS infrastructure, and it&#x27;s not going away overnight, so work is needed for interop, and there are complex questions to resolve around regulation and trademarks etc.<p>As the saying goes, it takes years to be an overnight success.')
