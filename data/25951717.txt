I&#x27;m serious here.<p>Sure, there&#x27;s threads on WSB about this, but there&#x27;s no real way to tie that to actual transactions, and not everyone who has bought stock even contributes to that subreddit, let alone the specific threads about this.<p>Furthermore, all it really takes is someone saying &quot;I bought stock because I believe in the company&quot;. We don&#x27;t have thought police; unless someone explicitly posts &quot;I, RH account XXX, bought the stock in a concerted effort to short it&quot; there&#x27;s no real way to prove intent.')
