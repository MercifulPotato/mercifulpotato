Given that the US is both the largest economy and military power this feels like a moot point.<p>&gt; Europe has failed to protect itself against US power<p>Yes, just like Chinese citizens failed to protect themselves against their leadership. They aren&#x27;t just a tiny South American nation, they are 1.3bn people who want freedom. That they failed to successfully do this is the fault of the people and no one else.<p>But really, the fact the EU stood quietly next to the US while the US tightened its grip on the world is indeed a failure of the EU (Europe, given that this started happening long before the EU). They took the easy road of growing in someone else&#x27;s shade, even if post WW2 it may have been the best or only thing Europe could have done. This doesn&#x27;t change anything about my characterization of the US, it&#x27;s just a tangent.<p>I&#x27;m not saying what China is doing is ok because the US does it too. But just like OP, I pointed out the double standards obvious even here on HN. Whether it&#x27;s mis- or dis-information, ignorance, hypocrisy, cognitive dissonance, or whatever else you may call it, the fact that people hold 2 completely different and opposing opinions on the same kind of action differentiated only by &quot;us vs. them&quot; is a massive failure of those people.')
