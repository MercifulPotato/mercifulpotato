Item(by='apetrovic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607445127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345134, text='I don&#x27;t plan to buy it (I have Air Pods Pro and Bose QC35 II and they works well), but if I&#x27;m on the market for NC headphones, I would probably pay premium for Apple&#x27;s, if reviews doesn&#x27;t find any glaring shortcomings. Why? Because of the small things - switching between active devices on AirPods works very well for me (today I received a phone call by telling my iphone to switch to AirPods even if they&#x27;re attached to my laptop), automatic detection of the right ear, head tracking (these spatial sound demos sounds amazing and I hope more applications will support it).<p>These things means more to my average and aging ears than some flashy audiophile names.')
