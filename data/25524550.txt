While this can speed up incubation quite a bit, you can also run into problems at low concentrations of where (1) you can start depleting the sample, and (2) mass action kinetics no longer apply.<p>Also figuring out how to reliably manufacture these to within a certain tolerance is a very difficult feat of engineering.<p>I havenâ€™t been active in this field for a while though, so these may no longer be issues.')
