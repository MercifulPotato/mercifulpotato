We all already own things under higher or lower pressure than normal and they can be kept that way essentially indefinitely. Light bulbs, hard drives, thermoses, etc. On the other hand keeping something below room temperature - especially really far below room temperature - takes constant work.<p>In theory you could make a cable that keeps the conductive material under high pressure, but you&#x27;re probably not going to have any luck attaching an air-conditioning unit to your cables.')
