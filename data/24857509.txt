Item(by='yorwba', descendants=None, kids=[24857978, 24857962, 24858434], score=None, time=1603371661, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24857164, text='5% WER or less isn&#x27;t that unrealistic. It&#x27;s just not very good. It means that there&#x27;s an error every 20 words on average, which with a slow rate of speech of 2 words per second amounts to an error every ten seconds.<p>That humans can still communicate effectively with each other despite a higher transcription error rate is just due to the the way humans do transcriptions: listen to a section of audio, then write down what they heard. If they understood the meaning, they&#x27;ll likely write down a transcription that retains this meaning, but they might drop an article or duplicate it or switch the order of two words. It&#x27;s easier for an algorithm to avoid those mistakes of inattention, but harder to prevent errors that change the meaning.<p>So WER isn&#x27;t a perfect indicator of transcription quality. It also matters which words are affected. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if people preferred a human-written transcription that reads well despite a high WER over a machine-generated one with fewer errors, but more obvious ones.<p>Bonus: find the word duplication in this comment.')
