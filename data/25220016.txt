Not once did it tell me that I&#x27;m a robot so seems your alternative fails the most basic of captcha functionality, limiting people&#x2F;machines to spam functionality that the website owner wants to be limited.<p>Maybe not everyone but a lot of people use captcha services to prevent automation from being used to extract&#x2F;insert data. I know as a developer that there is always a chance of bypassing this, even with Google&#x27;s reCaptcha, but your service seems to make this trivial, so many won&#x27;t even go beyond your demo.')
