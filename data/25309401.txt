Added with the previous two trials, you&#x27;d expect even the rarest reactions to start showing up already.<p>You can expect that if there are indeed super-rare novel responses, they&#x27;ll come to light over the approximately year-long roll out.<p>Additionally, even though vaccines will be rolling out, Moderna is holding 88 trials over the next 2 years. So they&#x27;re not just ending the trials and injecting everyone they can.<p>That&#x27;s just the one company. Pfizer and the others should be similar.')
