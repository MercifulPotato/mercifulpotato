As an example, he said when in stressful situations they are taught to recite: &quot;go slow, slow is smooth, smooth is fast&quot; over and over (like a mantra). He had last used it the previous day when jumping out of a helicopter into the ocean to then secure a boat - which didn&#x27;t include any scuba diving, and for which they could have used box breathing as well.')
