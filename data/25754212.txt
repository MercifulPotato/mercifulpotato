I used to work in Foster City.<p>The joke on the campus was that VISA stood for &quot;Very Inconspicuous Spy Agency&quot;.<p>You&#x27;d think that there wouldn&#x27;t be this kind of miscommunication in the chain of command.<p>All jokes aside, I&#x27;m very curious to check out Plaid now because I didn&#x27;t pay attention when it was independent and Visa is a *very* smart organization, so Plaid must be something special.')
