The touchpad is pure wizardry. I never accidentally touch the corner of it while typing and send my cursor flying across the screen. The hardware is solid, and can be repeatedly woken&#x2F;suspended all day long simply by closing the lid, without a driver lockup. The OS never crashes. It overheats and still works fine.<p>Truly the next best thing to a MBP for development work is a Windows desktop with WSL.')
