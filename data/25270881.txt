A fairly trivial buffer overflow programming error in C++ code in the kernel parsing untrusted data, exposed to remote attackers. In fact, this entire exploit uses just a single memory corruption vulnerability to compromise the flagship iPhone 11 Pro device. With just this one issue I was able to defeat all the mitigations in order to remotely gain native code execution and kernel memory read and write.</i><p>Yes, same old buffer C&#x2F;C++ overflow problem.
