I stood in line for a food truck a couple years ago that offered a promotion &quot;$2 off your order if you show us your 5-star review of our truck on [site].&quot;  Obviously, you have to do this before you even order your food so I was intensely put-off by this.  I gave them a 5-star review with no comment, received my discount, then after I tried the food I edited the review to 1-star with an explanation that it probably would&#x27;ve been a 4-star review had they legitimately just prepared good food but gaming the reviews was a sleazeball move.  The review was removed.<p>Every single game on the Google Play store does this now, too.  Instead of just letting people review honestly, they show a pop-up saying &quot;Are you enjoying this game?&quot;  if so, they ask you to review it on the store.  If not, they ask you to review it via their own private feedback system.  Not quite as bad as requiring a 5-star review, but obviously this alters the score the app would otherwise receive.')
