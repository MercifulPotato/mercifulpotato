Item(by='steveklabnik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606244325, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25201541, text='In very broad strokes, changes to the language work like this:<p>* Anyone may write a proposal<p>* Anyone may comment an open proposals<p>* The people on the Rust team decide to accept, reject, or postpone a proposal.<p>Those people on the team have the power to gate any major decision about the language itself. Some big company could hire 500 Rust developers (let&#x27;s make it ridiculous on purpose), have them write 1000 proposals for new features, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that those changes will happen: it requires that team of people to sign off on the decision. That group of people is added to only with the consent of all of the existing members. Additionally, making decisions is a consensus based process, so a single &quot;no&quot; vote will mean the proposal is not accepted.<p>Now, that doesn&#x27;t mean the process is <i>immune</i> to companies suggesting things. For example, a company could try and hire literally every member of the team. That would be... aggressive. They can use their resources to give more people more time to do the work of making a great proposal, building consensus, and making changes they want to see happen. That is actually an ideal situation, and has been working pretty well historically. (Google employees were key in getting async&#x2F;await to work out, for example. This is also basically what Mozilla&#x27;s influence on Rust was for its entire history of working on things.) This is the way I&#x27;d personally love to see Amazon (and others) contribute.')
