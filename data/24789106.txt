I would have been lost - but loved for somebody to explain it in a way I was able to grasp with my level of technically understanding.<p>Thanks to the author - I would love for this data to be in an open format, as I would love to do some kind of personal analytics on that (same with Audible data actually).<p>On a different tangent, I really love the ease in the Kindle&#x2F;Audible ecosystem to switch between the same content in different media. Reading on the kindle app, switching to Audible in the car and back to kindle in the evening in bed. That really makes reading&#x2F;book consumption great.')
