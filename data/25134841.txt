It would cover most of the use-cases that are commonly used as &quot;what if&quot; counter-arguments, and it doesn&#x27;t stop the urban populace from using electric&#x2F;public transport.<p>Besides, it&#x27;s not like the entire farming industry is going to switch to electric just like that; where I live, it&#x27;s not uncommon to see 40+ year-old farming machinery in active use. In other words, it&#x27;s going to take a long time before we get rid of diesel engines.<p>The major challenge, as far as I see it, will be to implement different rules for different people, and getting the populace to go along with it. People generally  dislike being told what to do, and any exceptions that can be considered unfair for anyone will be used as an argument against new legislation.')
