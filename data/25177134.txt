Ownership implies private property, with property being defined as something that is scarce, is delimitable, modifiable and which its owner can protect and defend.<p>Societies don&#x27;t &quot;exist&quot; (within the self-ownership context) exactly because they can&#x27;t perform arguments on their own, as they are just an idea, or abstraction, being composed of individuals that perform arguments and can never fully agree on all possible arguments collectively.
