I was responding to the claim that “there was no evidence of Russian influence in the election and collaboration by the Trump campaign”. That claim is demonstrably false. Muller did find evidence, and people went to jail for lying to hide the evidence. The president could not be convicted because the DoJ internal policy prohibits filing charges against a sitting president.<p>I am not ignoring or shouting about any red herring diversion. Read the report. Read the court proceedings that sent Flynn or Stone to prison.')
