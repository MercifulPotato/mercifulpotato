I&#x27;m afraid I might have just word-vomited instead of being helpful.<p>I&#x27;m enjoying all your comments in this thread. You&#x27;re knowledgeable and you&#x27;re doing a good job of translating it into lay terms. I&#x27;ve had cancer and I&#x27;m a nerd, so I&#x27;ve read a fair bit about it.
