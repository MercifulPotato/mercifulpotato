You have hired them in their sole proprietorship capacity.<p>&gt; Of course they can have opinions or refuse to do things in certain ways. But they can&#x27;t force you to have a pink wall color, or other things. At most, perhaps if the see something dangerous or illegal in your kitchen, they may have a duty to do something about it.<p>You&#x27;re not their employer, you&#x27;re contracting their employer.<p>&gt; Harassment: again, quit your job, apart from that, general laws about harassment should apply, independent from you being an employee or not.<p>No thanks, that&#x27;s an objectively worse world.<p>&gt; Why do you get people to have the duty to take care of you, but I don&#x27;t? Who should have the duty to take care of me?<p>Because that&#x27;s what running a business is. Since you&#x27;re self employed you have that responsibility to look after yourself.<p>&gt; Now what is your duty towards me? Is it now your duty to see that I earn a living wage and have job security forever? All just because you simply wanted a new wall color in your kitchen?<p>Nope, that&#x27;s their employers duty.')
