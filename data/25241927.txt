The developers at Apple (or any developer in general) cannot possibly think of every little thing that user might want to do with their device. That&#x27;s why nothing stays at v1.0 for very long. Users report bugs, and even make requests (however that might look). Any developer not looking to incorporate these requests will see their product wither and die.<p>Sure, sometimes a 3rd party comes along and makes a great product that once it is used, it feels like it is just something that should have always been there. Apple being Apple, they are going to want full control, so if they can&#x27;t acquire the tool to do what they want, you know they will develop it internally. Every tech company does this. FB&#x2F;Snap&#x2F;Insta&#x2F;etc have all borrowed&#x2F;stolen&#x2F;re-implemented.')
