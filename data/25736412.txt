At the recommendation of basically every networking forum and subreddit, I bought some Ubiquiti stuff to power networking and wifi for a new place I recently moved into. It cost 3x what a mid to high-end Linksys would have cost, and as far as I can tell provides literally negative benefit for my purpose:<p>Specifically, rather than a single box and an easy interface, I now have 3 devices that all require their own power bricks, connected via Ethernet cables, and a UI that required reading all sorts of documents and tutorials just to mimic the functionality of my last consumer-grade router. Not to mention the wifi coverage isn&#x27;t even as good as my old router, even when adjusting a bunch of settings from default based on said tutorials.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that this hardware isn&#x27;t worth it for some people, but for anyone who uses it for regular streaming and remote working, it&#x27;s completely not worth the expense, hassle, and inconvenient form factor.')
