And in fairness, this is just one more marketing langauge abuse on top of a giant heap of marketing language abuses -- OAuth is standing on the shoulders of giants here. How should a non-native speaker pronounce &quot;Flickr&quot; or &quot;iOS&quot; without any guidance?<p>(And we geeks have our own sins to atone for -- how to pronounce &quot;&#x2F;etc&#x2F;&quot;, &quot;&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&quot;, or &quot;TTY&quot; for that matter?)<p>On that last one, I&#x27;ll share a quick story.  I once worked with a genuine Unix greybeard on a remote project. He was tasked with debugging my terrible phone-home code, which was stored on a computer that I had couriered to him.  The first time we ever spoke on the phone, he kept talking about &quot;titties&quot;... &quot;this titty&quot; and &quot;the other titty&quot;. I&#x27;m sure that it was natural to him, but it took me a long moment before I realized he was talking about TTYs!')
