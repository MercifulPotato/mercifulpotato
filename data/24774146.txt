Not even God can compute the number because it is not &#x27;representable&#x27; even with infinite memory.<p>And every calculation involving particle trajectory involves PI. So what &quot;nature&quot; does instead of computing it is to create a function that represents it, and then solves the function later on &#x27;on demand&#x27; with whatever accuracy there is, which is definitely finite.')
