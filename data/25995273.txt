How do you deal with endpoints that are down or 500&#x27;ing? I saw &quot;Smart Retry&quot;, but it doesn&#x27;t say what kind of retry policy or backoff occurs.  Related, how do you notify clients when their endpoints are having trouble? (I ask because that&#x27;s PII that I then have to share with you).<p>2. Is there support for message signing (e.g., HMAC) to let clients verify that the webhook really came from us? How does it work?<p>3. Any kind of deduplication support? One use case we had was that certain webhooks only required the latest delivery.  e.g., product inventory.  If we previously failed to deliver a webhook, but have a newer version pending, our next attempt should try to send the newest version.<p>4. Is it possible to delay hydrating data in the payload? It seems the expected usage is that I send a blob of data and you take care of the last mile and send it.  Is it possible to send you an id and then you call back to my service and fetch the latest version of that object just before delivery?<p>5. How are webhook subscriptions actually managed? e.g., my app lets users register webhook URLs? How do I get those URLs to your service?<p>6. The big question: What do I do if your service is down?<p>Congrats on the launch.  100% agree there are a lot of requirements in building a decent webhook delivery system.  HootSuite covered a lot of them in their blog post from a few years back:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;hootsuite-engineering&#x2F;a-scalable-reliable-webhook-dispatcher-powered-by-kafka-2dc3d677f16b" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;hootsuite-engineering&#x2F;a-scalable-reliable...</a>')
