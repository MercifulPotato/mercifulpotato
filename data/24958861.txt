I&#x27;m labouring the point because a lot of comments here are waving this away as a one-line stateless change (&quot;just check the fragmentation offset is zero&quot;), when in fact it might mean switching from a completely stateless ALG to a stateful ALG. That is a bigger deal from the code complexity point of view, because it means the ALG has to start tracking TCP connections.')
