Transistors don&#x27;t have enough time to switch, but it matters where it happens.<p>If there&#x27;s an error in e.g. floating-point unit, it would just cause random errors in the output, but the game would probably keep running. That might be completely fine, if it&#x27;s rare and you could undervolt just that unit a lot. Especially in somewhere in the graphics pipeline, where it would just generate visual noise. Also, I think energy consumed &#x2F; heat is proportional to voltage squared, so it has a big effect.')
