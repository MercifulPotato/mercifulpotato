They want to keep you and your valuable data all to themselves.<p>I assume they still track your web history when you use firefox on android. But if you enjoy firefox on mobile, you might switch to firefox on desktop. Then they would lose out of your history there. (Assuming some sites you visit don&#x27;t use google analytics or adsense, and your isp and your browser extensions aren&#x27;t selling your history)')
