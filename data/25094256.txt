I suppose it helps that I went to smaller Jesuit school rather than some big top-tier Ivy or similar.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve kind of gone the opposite direction. I&#x27;ve always worked in tech companies, in production environments, for companies you may-or-may-not have heard of. I never understood why engineers from Big Name companies were considered so much &#x27;better&#x27;.<p>Now I work at a big tech company you&#x27;ve heard of (but definitely not a FAANG), and I understand now. The professionalism, the thoughtfulness, ownership, and output they expect.. it really is another level from just showing up at work every day. I&#x27;m not saying 60 hour weeks, I&#x27;m just saying the caliber of work and collaboration. The job titles really are &quot;worth&quot; more than at the average company.')
