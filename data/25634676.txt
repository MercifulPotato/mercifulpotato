They hate Bitcoin because (1) they missed the boat (2) they don&#x27;t understand it.<p>As the years go on the HN hatred of Bitcoin went from funny to sad as they try harder and harder to justify their ignorance and this article getting to the front page is a perfect example.<p>The article (for example) says that Bitcoin is not a good medium of exchange because, why, <i>it is hard to use</i>. When I pay in Bitcoin (Bitcoin Cash) I open my wallet (enter password), copy paste and address and send. Compared to typing out a CC number, exp. date, secret code AND my home address and real name. Bitcoin is FAR easier to use in comparison.<p>Starting from zero it is STILL way better. These insincere people will usually already have a bank and credit card, then try to compare using that card to starting from scratch with Bitcoin. OF COURSE that is harder, but starting from scratch with both OR starting with an account, Bitcoin is better every time.<p>It is bizarre to see the same non-sense narratives pushed in this forum over and over. Volatility is another one. Yes, for a few days every couple years Bitcoin seems to spike upward then come down to half its high value. Until literally this morning EVERYONE that had EVER bought Bitcoin was better off then when they bought it. Hows that for stability! What other asset can say anything close to that. But they will STILL scream about price swings.<p>When I do talk to otherwise sensible people in day-to-day life about Bitcoin it comes down to people not understanding it. That&#x27;s harder to judge on-line when people make short comments that superficially seem like legitimate concerns. I bet if you could talk to most of these guys it would come out they really don&#x27;t understand what Bitcoin is or how it works, so they get scared and angry when they see it doing well.')
