Settlement is handling payment. Clearing is re-assigning the securities. This isn&#x27;t perfect, but it will do.<p>Exchanges deal with execution. (About a third of trading occurs away from exchanges [1].) The rule in America is you can&#x27;t execute, on or off exchange, worse than the national best bid and offer [2]. That number aims to catalog all on-exchange quotes.<p>Once a trade is matched the exchange is done. Settlement is its own can of worms. This story is about clearing. The shares you bought need to get from their seller&#x27;s account to yours. Then the shares you sold need to get from your account to their buyer&#x27;s.<p>When you bought and sold the shares, the cash and shares &quot;appeared&quot; in your account. That&#x27;s a convenient fiction. Cash doesn&#x27;t move instantly. And securities settle over days. While all of that is happening, a complex web of credit arrangements keeps everything stitched together. Those arrangements have costs and risks. One of them is the requirement to post collateral as a safeguard against a broker breaking its word [3]. When those collateral costs get high, for example, because your customers are all trading risky things with high collateral requirements, it can create a cash crunch.<p>What&#x27;s happening here has, to my knowledge, nothing to do with exchanges or execution.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasdaq.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;slicing-the-liquidity-pie-2019-02-11" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasdaq.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;slicing-the-liquidity-pie-20...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_best_bid_and_offer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_best_bid_and_offer</a><p>[3] &quot;But I don&#x27;t trade on margin!&quot; No, you don&#x27;t. But you&#x27;re still a borrower of sorts from your broker. When you buy a share at 11AM and then sell it at Noon, you&#x27;ve sold a share your broker may not yet own. That&#x27;s the credit risk between you and your broker. If your broker bought that share at 11AM and sold it at Noon, <i>it</i> sold a share it did not yet own. That&#x27;s the credit risk between the broker and the clearinghouse. Clearinghouses are nice. They usually say &quot;give us 2% of yesterday&#x27;s closing price in Treasuries. If you fail to deliver on a trade, we&#x27;ll sell your Treasuries--maybe all of them, across all of your collateral with us--and make your counterparty whole.&quot; But when assets get volatile, the clearinghouse may want more than 2%. So it asks for that. Per its contract. But you don&#x27;t have that money. And shit, Suzie just bought and sold the same shares thirty-six times in the last minute.')
