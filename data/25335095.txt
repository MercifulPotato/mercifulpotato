Americans need to buy and hold equities. Period. When Google cuts costs or makes more money, I benefit as a shareholder (or you can hold total market indexes and the like).<p>2. Maybe the money will go to new hires, capabilities, expenditures, etc. ?<p>3. Sure, but this is certainly a good arguing point against immigration, population growth and H1-B visa programs and the like.<p>4. Increase taxes on the wealthy, etc.<p>One arguing point I&#x27;d like to make though is that if this doesn&#x27;t result in wealth redistribution (companies will pay less and this is fine) should we all begin moving to a few cities?')
