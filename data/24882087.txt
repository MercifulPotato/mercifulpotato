Item(by='yebyen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603574943, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24881721, text='&gt; &quot;Fair use&quot; is entirely a legislative creation of Congress, and theoretically Congress could take it away.<p>If you have a court decision that shows a court interpreted Congress&#x27; actions as revoking fair use by the enactment of DMCA, then I&#x27;ll concede the point, (but you won&#x27;t have one as the DMCA does not explicitly revoke fair use.) DMCA laid out protections for copyright owners who sought to protect their copyright with eg. DRM schemes.<p>That doesn&#x27;t revoke fair use. It just makes it practically difficult to utilize, since you might have to (illegally) circumvent a copyright protection device in order to access those fair use rights. They are still there, copyright owners just have a few more tools in their toolbox to prevent you from accessing them lawfully.<p>Is Youtube&#x27;s &quot;rolling cipher&quot; such a mechanism? Debatable. Is the proper remedy a DMCA takedown of the entire youtube-dl source, or something else? That&#x27;s all something for a court to decide. Only certain uses of youtube-dl are potentially foiling anti-circumvention devices like &quot;rolling cipher&quot;, it&#x27;s a utility that works on many video streaming sites, (and substantially many of the works on those sites are not protected by &quot;rolling cipher&quot; or similar, possibly any, DRM.)<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re hung up on Betamax.<p>Has there been a landmark ruling since, that reversed Betamax? It was decided by the Supreme Court, so unless you have one, I don&#x27;t think I can agree that it is no longer relevant.')
