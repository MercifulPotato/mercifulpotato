Can you tell me which one is BTC (hint: the green one is TSLA)?<p>BTC has higher volatility than other assets on short timescales (e.g. &lt; monthly and particularly, daily). But once you calculate over &gt;3 months you get volatility comparable to stocks. And an investment in the size of $400M doesn&#x27;t feel like they are worrying about daily volatility a lot.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;mE7bSI4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;mE7bSI4</a>')
