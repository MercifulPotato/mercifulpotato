While it&#x27;s true that most of them don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll also find that a surprising number do.<p>For example, the entire MS Office Suite is programmable - you can write VB Script (or lately, JS?) and achieve most if not all of the functionality supported in the GUI.<p>Rather more well known on this front, Emacs and many other Lisp systems have always supported the same kind of programmability as a shell from within the GUI environment - both in the form of a simple REPL and more advanced GUI-command interaction (e.g. executing the current selection as elisp code, executing a command with the current selection as input etc).')
