The languages also aren’t as nice as R for statistics and machine learning. And nowadays they don’t have much performance benefit either. In most cases I think Octave&#x2F;MATLAB provide too little benefit and too many drawbacks.<p>Octave is a great option as a personal calculator, and be the best option for small mechanical&#x2F;electrical engineering firms. MATLAB code is unusually clear and expressive for numerical calculus and linear algebra, so are a good choice for problem domains where the math is very complicated but the dataset isn’t terribly large (e.g., models of crack formation in ceramics). I worked at a place that used Octave to run a free MATLAB script that did some very complicated microeconomics: a lot of very smart professors have written many useful algorithms in MATLAB, so being able to run them without porting is nice.<p>But I think Python and R have, sadly, made MATLAB as a language mostly obsolete for future development. The real relevance is MATLAB as an analysis tool with lots of MathWorks goodies.')
