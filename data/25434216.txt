(The latter is certainly better for avoiding death or serious complications.)<p>Even if that immunity fades somewhat with time, as seems to be the case with other &#x27;common cold&#x27; cornoaviruses, it&#x27;ll typically be re-boosted by either a mild survivable case (from circulating virus), or explicit re-vaccination. So at some point – probably no later than 2022 – people will be behaving mostly as before, because the ongoing impact of COVID will have shrunk to be similar to traditional colds&#x2F;flus.')
