After two years founder decided he needs to hire a project manager. The person he hired had very bad habit of badmouthing people behind their back and collecting everyone&#x27;s failures so he could use that later as ammo. After another two years founder was kicked off by that manager. I was loyal to the founder so I was next on the list of people to go. This startup still operates on simple premise of finding yet another investment wave to slide on, almost if finding next investor was sole purpose of this startup.<p>But outside of this drama story that startup was a failure from day one simply because we was following the founder dream, not the market (I learned this over years, I was way too inexperienced when I was joining). Founder was deciding what features we need based on his &quot;expert&quot; knowledge. The problem was that at first glance all potential customers was saying how good the product was, but when it came to actually make use of it they could not really see the benefit.')
