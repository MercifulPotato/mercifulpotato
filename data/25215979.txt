Never fully got back to my ritual and then I gained 40lbs. A few years have passed and my attempts to restart my running all end with me taking a break nursing weird muscle and tendon pains that last for weeks.<p>So I guess my point is: yes, it actually is possible to out-train your diet, but that&#x27;s only a good plan as long as you never hurt yourself.')
