I&#x27;ve seen a lot of over-the-top benchmarks lately from low-power devices, but if you tell them to run the task in a loop for half an hour, they saturate their heatsinks, and drop the clock to the sustained &quot;non-turbo&quot; clock or even throttle below it, so the score on the 10th run is a fraction of what it was on the 1st.<p>On the one hand, this is obviously gaming the knowledge that many benchmarks are short and bursty, but it makes me wonder if there&#x27;s merit in trying to design a thermal solution that would allow permanent boost clock for thin-and-light-is-irrelevant tasks.  If you had a iOS based kiosk or whatever, I could imagine installing a &quot;shucked&quot; iPad that was mounted to a much bigger cooler.')
