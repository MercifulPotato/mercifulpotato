Maybe, but that&#x27;s not what Hawley&#x27;s bill does.<p>2. Leaving inherently political questions up to the courts invites politicizing the courts -- something that&#x27;s already happened and that, if it continues apace, threatens to delegitimize and gridlock the entire federal legal system.<p>3. Given that you&#x27;re not a Trump supporter or Republican, perhaps you should review the last 20 years of federal judicial appointments before placing so much faith in the courts...<p><i>&gt; We can&#x27;t be terrified of regulating platforms that have massive amounts of control over what most people see or hear about.</i><p>Agreed. I think there are lots of reasonable approaches toward regulation and&#x2F;or self-regulation. The ability of customers to choose from a marketplace of recommendation algos (or implement their own) is the obvious market-based solution.<p>However, I do not think a politically appointed committee whose job is to define political neutrality is a reasonable approach. And I think that leaving inherently political moderation choices up to the courts would be even worse -- at least FTC chairs aren&#x27;t lifetime appointments, and at least politicizing the FTC won&#x27;t deteriorate public trust in the one portion of the federal government that is not yet perceived as nakedly partisan.')
