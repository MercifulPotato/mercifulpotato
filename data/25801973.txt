What percentage does 24 patients represent? Are there other vaccines in circulation? Do they have similar adverse-effect rates? Were there similar deaths in unvaccinated people of that age group? How does this compare to deaths from people who contracted coronavirus in the same group?<p>This is important context. &quot;A person died from the vaccine&quot; vs &quot;0.0000001% death rate from vaccine compared to 0.001% from the disease&quot; may be factually the same information, but sounds like very different news to most people.')
