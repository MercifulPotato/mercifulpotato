They only replaced their lowest spec MacBook Pro with the new M1 machine. And the lower model always had 2 thunderbolt ports and 16 gigs of lpddr4 ram maximum. The “higher end” models still have Intel chips, and when they get replaced with Apple silicon we’ll see higher specs and by that point better compatibility from compilers and whatnot.<p>This is the first, and worst &#x2F; “least pro” Apple silicon machine Apple will ever make.
