It is just a victim of its popularity.<p>The authors clearly say that is designed for writing scalable networked services. And they definitely don&#x27;t care about GUIs, Windows, embedded, etc.<p>Overzealous programmers are constantly taking Go where it is not meant to be and complain about its shortcomings. Go&#x27;s simplicity means that it makes a lot of assumptions about the system. I think authors should have been more upfront and explicit about this.')
