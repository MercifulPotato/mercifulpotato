Long buyers are taking the other side of that bet.<p>Neither side is deserving of compassion or concern as long as they are fully informed on the underlying nature of the share of the business they are buying.<p>Selling a house that you have a mortgage on is selling something that you only partially own.<p>Short sellers are selling something they borrowed because what they borrowed is fungible (ie one share in GME is equivalent to any other share in GME).<p>The real question is whether what they borrowed exists and whether the owner of that is doing the right thing by lending it. If owners of shares won&#x27;t lend, then short sellers can&#x27;t borrow.<p>Should a pension fund that owns shares that are expected to increase in value (otherwise why do they own it), lend that share to someone who is actively trying to reduce its value?')
