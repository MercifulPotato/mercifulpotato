The Department of Homeland Security confronted him about a video about police brutality:<p><i>&gt; A few months ago I uploaded a video about police brutality. It showed explicit acts of violence by the police, and it was understandably age-gated. The video was appropriate only for older audiences, but did not break any of YouTube&#x27;s terms and conditions.</i><p><i>&gt; That video earned me a visit from the DHS, who asked me about &quot;Anti-American sentiment&quot; in my videos. That was the first time I realized, wow, I guess people really are monitoring what we say and are willing to try to intimidate us, even if what we say is objectively true.</i><p>It’s “anti-American” to say that the people ostensibly enforcing our laws should not commit violence against us.')
