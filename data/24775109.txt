You&#x27;re optimizing for safety of the passengers of <i>both</i> cars simultaneously.<p>Satellites don&#x27;t have this constraint. Of course you&#x27;d generally prefer smaller sats to collide (smaller = less fragments), but assuming fixed size, denser (= heavier) pieces will have more inertia, and so deviate less from their original flight path. This keeps the debris trail more concentrated. If only one of the two is heavy, the pieces of the heavier one should end up more concentrated. I&#x27;m not sure whether the wreckage of the lighter one gets spread more widely, or - with these velocities - just flash-fuses itself with the heavier one.')
