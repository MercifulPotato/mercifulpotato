It did all that very well in the year 2000 when I started in Lisp.<p>A parenhesis matching command (the % key) has been in Vi since the 1970&#x27;s, and the same is true of the Lisp mode (:set lisp) that handles the bulk of the indentation semantics. When you load a .lisp file, Vim turns on Lisp mode. That ancient invention is what does the indentation.<p>Nobody spends &quot;considerable effort&quot; formatting Lisp. Not even buffoons like me who use a Vi derivative, and who are ridiculed by Emacs users.')
