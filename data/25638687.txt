I needed some help getting beta users to try out the application and was wondering if you could help me out. I was a little nervous since people are obviously from different places and unless you have many people posting in the same region you can&#x27;t do much, so if anyone has any other tips for getting it started that would be great!<p>Public link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;testflight.apple.com&#x2F;join&#x2F;NPwgYK3H')
