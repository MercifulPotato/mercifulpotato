The cost&#x2F;benefit of making a metaprogramming library just to write a lexer is fairly bad, however.<p>wrt to the SMT integration, it&#x27;s something that I would very much like to try in D, but it&#x27;s quite difficult to work out exactly where to start (and means bolting a fairly big dependency on the compiler). There also seems to be a big gap in the literature between &quot;practical&quot; verification done &quot;in&quot; the widget being verified (e.g. SystemVerilog code) and more academic work where, effectively, a parallel structure is built which represents the semantics of the widget.')
