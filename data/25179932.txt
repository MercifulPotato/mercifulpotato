While it is possible in some cases to negotiate with a store, most of the time they ask you to get a price in writing that is lower so that they can match it. A few problems with that- 1) MAP is the minimum Advertise-able price so you wont find that anywhere online searching, and stores aren&#x27;t exactly excited to quote you lower just so that you can take it down the road to get a discount...<p>Edit: Also Ive tried getting a lower price on gear in the US by showing the all in Thomann price, and the response I get:We do not honor non US pricing.')
