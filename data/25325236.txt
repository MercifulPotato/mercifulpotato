I do not think that I will try to pay for coffee with some of my antique gold coins any time soon, but that does not render them any less valuable. bitcoin plays a similar role in the context of digital assets for the moment. It frustrates me when I read other comments here dismissing cryptocurrency out of hand without taking the time to understand it. As you rightly point out, some tokens are better at certain tasks depending on the situation In the same way that some fiat currencies are circumstantially better than others... I think a number of people in Lebanon would prefer BTC to LBP right now regardless of the fees. For my part, I am more concerned with micro transaction fees for running applications, and I will leave the speculation to someone else.')
