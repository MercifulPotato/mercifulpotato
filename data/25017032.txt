If Trump had put the best minds in the CDC and the NIAID in charge of the Covid response and just allowed them to do their thing (instead of undermining them at every turn), that would be one thing.<p>Instead he puts his son in law in charge of the Coronavirus response, so we are all left to wonder how it could have been if the experts were in charge. Maybe it would be different, maybe it&#x27;s a no win situation like you said. But at least then we would know there was nothing more to do. No one would be wondering &quot;Maybe things would have been different if Jared Kushner were put in charge of this...&quot;<p>We all see the pandemic and how it affects our lives. When Trump tells us that it&#x27;s no big deal, that it&#x27;s a media hoax that will go away with the election, that doesn&#x27;t make him look good. That&#x27;s a choice he&#x27;s making to do that. It didn&#x27;t have to be this way.')
