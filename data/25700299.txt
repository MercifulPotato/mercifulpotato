At work, when I and others write an article&#x2F;blog post&#x2F;etc. with technical content we&#x27;ll often send it to one or two other people to get some more eyes on it, especially if it&#x27;s a topic at the edge of my experience.<p>I&#x27;m also sometimes asked to review book proposals by publishers. And I know a publisher will enlist a technical editor to check out that code in a book works and to give a sanity check to the technical content overall.<p>But these are all enlisting something between a few minutes and a few days work from someone familiar with a topic. And they&#x27;re either just part of the job internally or they&#x27;re some very modest payment from a publisher. Any given person is probably also only qualified to do technical editing on a limited number of topics, especially if the technical info is relatively deep.')
