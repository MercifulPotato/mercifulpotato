It&#x27;s a fantastic product -- excellent modeling tool that performs very well, but the kicker is the language that makes up the underlying 3D &quot;document&quot;[0] into a set of instructions program, the &quot;API&quot; of which can be queried&#x2F;manipulated&#x2F;rendered&#x2F;tesselated and fully edited using their REST API.  The language, itself, is designed to be serialized to JSON and you can basically create very interactive program-3D-document-like-things.  Or you can just mouse around and build objects in a similar manner to Fusion360 (I find Fusion easier to use, though).<p>We were an early customer of the API and were using it in ways it wasn&#x27;t designed for so we encountered some problems early on ... the team over there consistently under-promised[1] and way-over-delivered.  They were purchased by a competitor, recently (not Autodesk).  The company that approached us to build a 3D customization tool on the web <i>specifically required we use Onshape</i> because they were a Solidworks shop and they were loving the web app&#x27;s compatibility and features.<p>[0] It&#x27;s hard to find a good name for what, exactly, it is.  Storage-wise, a document in Onshape closely resembles a git repository.  Under the hood, much&#x2F;most&#x2F;all? appears to be made up of FeatureScript, which is a language expressing transforms&#x2F;operations on components within one or many documents (I&#x27;m not a cad guy&#x2F;was concerned mostly with the back-end API, not the make-up of the docs, so this is probably partly wrong -- google FeatureScript for more info).<p>[1] That&#x27;s not a back-handed compliment -- they were careful to manage expecatations about a major performance issue being resolved in code by a specific date.  They often &quot;hinted&quot; at dates, and the dates they hinted at were hit, usually in advance.  For the worst of the performance issues, they spent <i>hours</i> with us working out a suitable workaround that eliminated the latency.')
