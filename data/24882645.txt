The word is thrown around in this thread in a trivial way as if you can accuse anyone of advocating it. Let me spell it out for you: Pretty much no one advocates this. You&#x27;re coming at him saying &quot;I never said it was at holocaust levels&quot; as if that makes a huge difference. This is mass human slaughter we&#x27;re talking about.<p>He described it with the word &quot;Holocaust&quot; for two reasons. To detrivialize the usage of the word and because I&#x27;ve seen numbers being thrown around as if millions of people were exterminated.<p>&gt;&quot;concentration camps are bad but..&quot; No but. There&#x27;s no but there.<p>There is indeed a but. The US put the japanese in concentration camps in the past. This does not raise them to the same position as Hitler gassing the jews.<p>&gt;I am going off first hand accounts and confirmed facts. What are you doing?<p>Confirmed facts of genocide? Show me some pictures. Show some proof. The seriousness of the accusation demands serious evidence.<p>&gt;Reducing this to a &quot;two sides&quot; issue is shameless deflection. What part of the dozens of reporting done on Xinjiang do you think is false, and what facts are you basing that on?<p>He&#x27;s reducing the issue to an &quot;all sides&quot; issue. Insulting an alternative view point is reducing it to a &quot;one side&quot; issue.<p>Let&#x27;s keep things utterly clear here. It is completely wrong to build internment camps. Completely. But it is also completely and utterly wrong to silence another view point and accuse someone of genocide.<p>You don&#x27;t solve an issue by attacking the people who created the internment camps without understanding the situation which caused them deploy such drastic procedures in the first place.')
