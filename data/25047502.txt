Nobody is buying bacon just for flavoring. People use Zoom because it&#x27;s a free digital telephone with screen sharing. Not because it&#x27;s super duper secure.<p>Telephones (VoIP, PSTN, SMS, etc) do not have end-to-end encryption - or <i>any</i> encryption - and we&#x27;ve been using them for conferences since <i>always</i>. Hell, <i>we use them for Zoom calls!</i><p>This is some kind of government vendetta, probably pushed by Zoom&#x27;s competitors who make a bundle in government contracts. Because they&#x27;re currently the biggest provider, they&#x27;re the biggest target. But this standard has not been (and will not be) held up to any of its competitors who make similar claims. The political party that is sabre-rattling in this article is just making themselves look good to their constituents.')
