I would pick ... a BBC Micro:bit.<p>Why? Three reasons:<p>* Ecosystem<p>* Ecosystem<p>* Standardization<p>Having the same microcontroller (or small set of microcontrollers) in my house makes maintenance a lot easier and cheaper. Have an ecosystem around me means there&#x27;s a ton of code to reuse.<p>I went from:<p>* Non-standard junk; to<p>* PIC, briefly; to<p>* Atmel (switching to standardized Arduino boards when those came out); now to<p>* Micro:bit<p>I&#x27;d recommend the same to others. Standardize. The past two decades were Atmel, and I recently switched to Micro:bit. More isn&#x27;t merrier.<p>Even within a series, standardize. Pin compatibility, plug compatibility, etc. is all a big deal. The most painful projects are ones where I have a one-off oddball part where I can&#x27;t find an IDE two decades later. The most pleasant ones are where I have a half-dozen standard Micro:bits at home, and if I fry something, or need a second of something, I can just make it.')
