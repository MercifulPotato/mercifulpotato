Item(by='samizdis', descendants=None, kids=[25952063], score=None, time=1611879811, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25951390, text='Final edit to add: IGNORE THIS COMMENT!<p>Nothing to see here, but I can&#x27;t delete this post. tl;dr I got excited because I couldn&#x27;t see the RH app returned in a play store search, even though I could see the app via a direct link. A commenter has pointed out that this is because the app isn&#x27;t available where I am, in the UK. Sorry for the fuss.<p>----------------------------------------<p>I&#x27;ve just posted the comment below in a dupe of this post [0], but am keen to see whether anyone else can reproduce my result:<p><i>I just searched for the app so that I could see what reviews remained, using my desktop browser pointed at:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;search?q=robinhood%20trading&amp;c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;search?q=robinhood%20trading&amp;c</a>...<p>Top results include Trading 212, Webull, eToro and others - and the page goes on for quite a while (Coinbase, Bamboo, etc) before eventually ending up with kids&#x27; cartoon Robin Hood games.<p>The Robinhood app itself hasn&#x27;t been displayed. Can anyone else confirm this?<p>Edit to add: Just tried searching using the suggestion [1] that came up after I typed the word &quot;robinhood&quot; into the query box - which was &quot;robinhood trading app uk&quot; - and chose that. I thought that perhaps there was some georestricted stuff going on. But no: I scrolled to the end and the Robinhood app was not listed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;search?q=robinhood%20trading%2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;search?q=robinhood%20trading%2</a>...<p>---</i><p>Further edit to add that I followed the link given in this post, which took me to the RH app page with its (remaining) reviews, and then copied the title of the app as given &quot;Robinhood - Investment &amp; Trading, Commission-free&quot;, and pasted it into the search box.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;search?q=Robinhood%20-%20Investment%20%26%20Trading%2C%20Commission-free&amp;c=apps" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;search?q=Robinhood%20-%20Inves...</a><p>Again, that search returned lots of other apps, but not the Robinhood one. Any ideas why?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25951215" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25951215</a>')
