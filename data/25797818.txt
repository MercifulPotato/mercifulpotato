With a iOS&#x2F;Android&#x2F;Desktop app, you can verify the checksum of the binary against what signal provides.<p>But with a web app you redownload the application everytime which means you&#x27;d have to recheck that checksum every time you use the app. I guess that WhatsApp, Discord, et al have decided that this is a reasonable risk. But the privacy oriented Signal team disagrees.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a prioritization issue, the desktop app is currently running via electron which means it&#x27;s effectively a web app already.')
