An old lady who lives in a cabin in the woods is being interviewed. The interviewer asks: &quot;isn&#x27;t it incredibly inconvenient that you need to gather firewood and light a fire every time you want to drink some tea?&quot;<p>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it inconvenient that you have to work for someone else for 8 hours every day, only so you don&#x27;t need to start a fire?&quot;<p>I&#x27;m positive you can do all of those things with an average salary, at least in northern europe. There is little to worry about once you have a roof over your head. You may not have that Tesla though.')
