You fail a &lt;race&gt; person, person claims you are racist against &lt;race&gt;. How do you make sure no one has examples like that? Just always pass literally everyone no matter how bad a driver they are in case they&#x27;re going to later claim discrimination?<p>You can avoid explicit examples with evidence attached (&quot;he called me a n-word and fired me, see &lt;youtube link&gt;&quot;) but I don&#x27;t see how you can reliably avoid claims of bias. And while the nyt article isn&#x27;t out yet, I&#x27;m willing to bet that these (like most) claims is one of bias. Moreoever most actual legitimate instances of racism are also going to be of that form, because most people aren&#x27;t stupid enough to make illegal things they are doing obvious.')
