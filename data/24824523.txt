He still gets interesting people to talk about interesting things.<p>Yes, amazing guest list, I do wonder how it took off like that.<p>Edit: in contrast, Rob Reid&#x27;s After On podcast has somewhat similar guests (not an all-stars list, no AI folks except Stuart Russell &amp; Rodney Brooks), but he&#x27;s my favourite interviewer. The amount of research he does before each interview is insane, to the point he already knows what the guest will say and what are the most interesting items to talk about. But he still lets the guest tell the story themselves.')
