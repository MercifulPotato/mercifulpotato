Yet bagel shops aren&#x27;t calling themselves &quot;bagel as a service&quot; because... well... it&#x27;s insane.)<p>But it probably will get people&#x27;s attention in a hyperlocal social media ad, so it has utility to us as a business strategy.<p>I know it probably sucks a little bit, but our goal is to accrue many small advantages to drive a higher total probability of success.<p>:sob:')
