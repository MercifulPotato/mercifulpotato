As open&#x2F;concealed carry is a privilege granted by legislative law, not a right granted by constitutional charter.<p>Furthermore, most states only permit open&#x2F;concealed carry if no laws are being broken. So if you&#x27;re breaking curfew, entering a restricted area, unlawfully assembling, etc, you lose the privilege of carrying.<p>Real question is whether the governments in those states have the political will to act against carry laws.')
