The policy goals of people in the streets were absolutely thwarted and the police continue to do whatever they want.<p>&gt; The lack of access to medical care just spent $6 billion buy vaccines for everyone in the country.<p>Congrats, you get one (1) vaccine so they can keep making money off your labor. If you have a stroke or an accident, that&#x27;s on you.<p>&gt; The unchecked imperialism just drew down all their troops and is achieving real progress towards normalized peaceful relations.<p>The US military has &quot;lily pads&quot; in over a hundred (and maybe over two hundred) places in the world and patrols the high seas.
