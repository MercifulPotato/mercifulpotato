I&#x27;m not going to pontificate about it here, but I would love to be able to filter these comments based on the length and depth of experience of the commenter, both in Haskell and other language of choice.<p>There&#x27;s a lot being said here that&#x27;s true, and a lot that&#x27;s personal opinion.
