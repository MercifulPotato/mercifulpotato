The art of thinking and reasoning in strict accordance with the limitations and incapacities of the human misunderstanding. The basic of logic is the syllogism, consisting of a major and a minor premise and a conclusion - thus:<p>Major Premise: Sixty men can do a piece of work sixty times as quickly as one man.\nMinor Premise: One man can dig a post-hole in sixty seconds; Therefore-\nConclusion: Sixty men can dig a post-hole in one second.<p>This may be called syllogism arithmetical, in which, by combining logic and mathematics, we obtain a double certainty and are twice blessed.” --Ambrose Bierce, <i>The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary</i>')
