I&#x27;m not worried per se, there are just too many interesting things to think about.  Sometimes in response I&#x27;ll do prime factorization of numbers in my head.  It requires focused attention, and is interesting enough that I can actually focus on it, excluding all the other things I was thinking about, but not so interesting that I&#x27;ll fight sleep to do it.  Sometimes listening to Chinese does the same thing: it&#x27;s interesting enough to focus on (and exclude whatever else was keeping the &quot;engine&quot; going), but not so interesting that I&#x27;ll fight sleep to pay attention.')
