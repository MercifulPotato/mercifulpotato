Not Bay Area expensive, but expensive.<p>That said, a lot of tech and related industries aren&#x27;t in the city proper. Indeed, it&#x27;s relatively recent that tech companies started moving back into the city proper after almost completely vacating it. And suburbs range from fairly expensive to, if not cheap, moderate. (I live about an hour west and my house on multiple acres is probably worth in the $400-500K range.<p>On the topic of cars, I would say that much of Boston and Cambridge is fairly navigable without a car. But it&#x27;s not a car-free culture like NY largely is. People I know who live in the city but wither commute to jobs outside, visit friends in the suburbs, do outdoor activities in NH and elsewhere all own cars. You can manage without one. I did as a student. But it&#x27;s pretty limiting, even with Uber, ZipCar, and so forth, if you want to leave the city on a regular basis.')
