Item(by='dwheeler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611468278, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25888619, text='&gt; If you started only making new stuff in python 3 in 2010 2 years after python 3 came out how much python 2 would you have to convert?<p>In many organizations there was never a time where they could start writing new code in Python 3. They needed to write code that was compatible with their existing python 2 code, and the only way to do that is to continue to write new code in python 2. Rinse, lather, repeat.<p>This is why the failure to provide a gradual transition was so bad. When I write new code in Python I use python3, but that assumes that there are python3 modules available that I need.<p>If you have infinite money this is not a problem. But I think we should be sympathetic to the people who do not have infinite money and have never been given a realistic upgrade path from 2 to 3. The 2to3 program is not a workable solution for many.')
