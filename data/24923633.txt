I can highly recommend this one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discordnetwork.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discordnetwork.com&#x2F;</a>, I have no idea how many people are in the server but I&#x27;m guessing at least more than 10k (about 9k online as I&#x27;m writing this, and more offline I have to presume). The advantage with such servers is fluid communication, but the downside is because of this in combination with the fact that there might be alot of people, you sometimes have to wait as to not disturb ongoing discussions.<p>This discord server in particular is good if you want help, although you might not recieve instant help, you will eventually get help if you are patient. There are also other channels in the server just for the purpose of discussion, i.e discussing general topics in math.<p>This might not give you what you are looking for, but it&#x27;s a possible alternative I guess.')
