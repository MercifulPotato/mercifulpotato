Not having to worry so much about how you organize your files and where to put stuff is such a relief.<p>But I think it&#x27;s too early to call roam, the startup, a success. It has some mindshare, but the product has no defensibility. It&#x27;s not that complex. A competent developer can probably build a clone of Roam in 1-2 months of full-time work. A lot of copycats have started already and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if in a few years it&#x27;s not Roam that has won but just another copycat that had a better UI. Kind of reminds of how Slack killed that other app before it... was it... hipchat?')
