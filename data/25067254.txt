In any public space, I can give a very accurate ratio of the number of men and women, and it&#x27;s remarkable how as soon as there are sufficient women, all these dudes just appear and all the women leave, like gazelles in the presence of hungry lions. In any bar (when they open again), sit down with your double scotch and count that ratio every few minutes. It&#x27;s like a law of nature.')
