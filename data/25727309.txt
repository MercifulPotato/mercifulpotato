There is a good reason there&#x27;s a whole separate international connection oriented network for making phone calls (it&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s no good for video - unsurprisingly the internet wins on open platforms and innovation).<p>There are two important differences with VC compared to that ping:\nYou&#x27;re not trying to exchange data with a CDN built for exactly that purpose, you&#x27;re trying to exchange it with someone else&#x27;s (probably crappy) internet connection. The analogy I used the other day is &quot;your supermarket has better roads to it than your friend&#x27;s house&quot;.<p>You&#x27;re probably pinging 32 or 64 bytes. Now try that again at a more realistic video data rate (not that the CDN endpoint will allow that). Keeping latency down is a lot easier on small packets than on full pipes.')
