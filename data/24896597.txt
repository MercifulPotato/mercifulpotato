Even when solutions were provided (which was rare!), the path connecting the dots could be foggy. &quot;What made them think to introduce this lemma?&quot; kind of questions.<p>I often needed discussion with others to help figure out my misconceptions and correct them -- so... big ask, but do you have any further suggestions on how to replace talking with a TA, or with a smart group of upper-year friends?')
