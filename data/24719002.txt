The board is nowadays predominantly populated by emotional outbursts from people who have next to no idea what they are talking about regarding the subject matter.<p>The threads on COVID where everyone is a statistics trained doctor is a good showcase of what the board has turned into.<p>I don&#x27;t even want to bother discussing tech stuff here anymore. People can make fun of Reddit all they want, but while they have a larger population of people who are there to shitpost, they also have a larger population of people who know what they are talking about.<p>As one person said, HN is &quot;no longer really populated by hackers&quot;. It&#x27;s an embarrassment.<p>Others have mentioned that the downvoting brigade is in full swing, and that there seems to be a lot of shitflinging in general.<p>As for moderation, DanG does a great job of staying out of it but I do wish he would toss his weight around a bit more.')
