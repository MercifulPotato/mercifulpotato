I&#x27;ll get to a bit where there&#x27;s something complicated needed, like a loop with a lot of conditional logic.  So I&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s going to be complex, decide how that piece of code could be turned into a function by deciding what to send in, and what to send out, and then put that call in and finish writing the original function.  Then I&#x27;ll write the (so far) imaginary function which contains the complex bit.<p>So recursion is just realizing that I can do the complex bit by calling the current function!<p>Of course, this sometimes means that the function signature needs to change, to (say) include a collecting list or something.  But that&#x27;s the general idea.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this has ever helped anyone :-)')
