How do you even know of the software if you had not already found a place which could contain the starting point for your process?</i><p>Why is this question so strange to you?  The <i>end user usage</i> of a tool can be much more widely known than the workflow development of it.<p>Let&#x27;s take a look at Youtube-dl specifically:<p>Go to &quot;<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube-dl.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube-dl.org&#x2F;</a>&quot; ...<p>There are only 3 obvious web pages: (1) Home (2) Download (3) About<p>From there, you <i>can</i> download some binaries to <i>use</i> the software but there is no mention of any source host to enter a &quot;git clone&quot; to then later do a &quot;git shortlog --summary --numbered --email&quot;.<p>It is way easier to get the end user software to <i>run</i> than clone the git tree.  For some reason, your reasoning assumes they are always tied together but youtube-dl is an example where they are not. (It sorta used to be tied together when the youtube-dl webpage&#x27;s &quot;dev repository&quot; link to Github actually worked.  It doesn&#x27;t work now.  See the &quot;ex nihilo&quot; problem?)<p>And btw, a git clone doesn&#x27;t help for sensitive (aka legally uncertain) projects where contributors don&#x27;t enter real valid email addresses and&#x2F;or the use fake email to avoid spam.  (This is a general statement and not a email address validity test of youtube-dl maintainers specifically.)<p>Also, a &quot;git clone&quot; is a barrier for <i>non-programmer end users</i> who just want to report a bug.  The Github repo (or mailing list) was a logical place (Schelling Point) for that type of activity rather than cloning a repo that the end user doesn&#x27;t need.<p><i>&gt;The starting point, however, is nothing more than that. </i><p>But some starting points matter more than others.<p><i>&gt;If you think that there are no adversaries out to kill Linux, you&#x27;d be sorely mistaken,</i><p>This is not engaging with the <i>spirit</i> of what I wrote.  Surely, you realize we were talking about adversaries such as RIAA&#x2F;MPAA&#x2F;DMCA using legal threats for takedowns and not <i>business competitors</i> such as  Microsoft that tried to squash Linux.<p><i>&gt;, but it&#x27;s moot as it has no single points of failure. Everyone works on their own trees, </i><p>This is a 100% true statement about no SPOF that is not relevant for this youtube-dl discussion.  We already know hundreds (thousands) of people have already git cloned youtube-dl and some have even re-uploaded copies back to Github.  But all that copying misses the point of all the various threads in the last week where people wonder where the &quot;blessed repo&quot; with PRs&#x2F;issues&#x2F;etc will live that&#x27;s resistant to censoring.  Repeating the &quot;no SPOF nature of distributed git&quot; is not making progress in that discussion.')
