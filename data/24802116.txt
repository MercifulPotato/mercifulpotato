The whole thing hinged on &quot;Microsoft installed its browser by default which gave it an unfair advantage.&quot; To allow the DOJ to save face, Microsoft agreed to make it easier to install other browsers.<p>Nothing was &#x27;thrown out&#x27;, rather the penalty was changed after the higher court issued a ruling that actually changed the liability implications for MS, which allowed MS to negotiate a lesser judgement. Findings of fact and the ruling were not overthrown, despite questions about judge Jackson&#x27;s impartiality.<p>Beyond that, the US was not the only jurisdiction in which Microsoft was taken to court and found guilty of monopolistic practices.  &quot;DOJ&quot; is meaningless in courts outside the US, so your statement doesn&#x27;t even make logical sense as a component of your argument.<p>Second - you seem to be standing behind a single dictionary definition for what constitutes a monopoly.  That&#x27;s fine when discussing certain technicalities in abstraction, but completely ignores the fact that the dictionary definition is meaningless in terms of law. A monopoly can absolutely exist even in the presence of competitive options, and that is very clearly laid out in many ways in various laws and legal precedents.  The Sherman Act* alone has very clear statements about this, and absolutely contradicts what you are saying.  Monopolistic behavior is about controlling the market and&#x2F;or using market&#x2F;industry dominance to prevent or stifle competition. It is not about the sheer absence of competition.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;atr&#x2F;competition-and-monopoly-single-firm-conduct-under-section-2-sherman-act-chapter-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;atr&#x2F;competition-and-monopoly-single-...</a>')
