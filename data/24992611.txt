Just because you purchase the final thing doesn&#x27;t entitle you to have control over product decisions. I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to entangle ownership and programmability as a product feature.<p>Your reference to &quot;general computing device&quot; here is a concept that a particular market identifies with (you being in that market). Attached to it is some kind of concept of free&#x2F;open. Apple will tell you their devices are general computing devices. I am currently playing around with lidar sensors in an iPhone 12 pro by writing code and pushing it onto my device. The functionality I can build is pretty arbitrary and I would call it general computing. I would agree with Apple.')
