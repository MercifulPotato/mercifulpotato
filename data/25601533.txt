It&#x27;s become a part of the standard lexicon of hip-hop, R&amp;B and electronic music. I imagine a fair amount of casual pop music fans know that when someone says an 808 beat is about to drop, they&#x27;re gonna get that booming bass drum and typewriter snare, maybe a cowbell.<p>I&#x27;m not sure the DX7 ever had the same widespread name recognition, even back in its heyday. And outside of synths, I don&#x27;t think the average person connects specific guitar models to distinct sounds either, even if they know the names in the abstract. The 808 might be unique in this. Then again, rock music fans might never even have heard of it?')
