Item(by='SmellTheGlove', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604535420, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24993922, text='&gt;Zoning is inherently authoritarian and an affront to individual liberty.<p>&gt; Parking tickets depends on whether they write citations for things that aren&#x27;t harming anyone, like people parking unregistered stuff on the street where there&#x27;s ample parking available. If you&#x27;re enforcing minor laws just because they&#x27;re there and forcing people to step in line when them doing whatever doesn&#x27;t appear to be bothering anyone then that passes my duck test for authoritarianism.<p>You&#x27;ve effectively painted all cities as authoritarian. If that&#x27;s your position, fine, feel free to include Portland. But I still don&#x27;t see any specific examples beyond has zoning, has police who might enforce its laws, etc. I think that becomes a very broad brush with which to paint anywhere that isn&#x27;t rural as authoritarian, and I don&#x27;t agree with you.<p>&gt; Frankly from the rest of your comments in here you&#x27;re coming across like a masshole who thinks Portland is perfect<p>Wrong on both counts. Portland has its issues, but I don&#x27;t think heavy-handed enforcement of its many laws is one of them. Diversifying its economy away from tourism, and expanding its base away from 3-4 large, very legacy employers, would be two big ones in my mind.<p>&gt; They&#x27;re from elsewhere and are of a different culture. Sounds like a reasonable definition of &quot;outsider&quot; to me.<p>Authoritarians love in-groups and out-groups. Just a hop, skip, and jump to nationalism and fascism. Not everyone that moves into a place is going to want to change it to their ideal, but they&#x27;re going to have their own perspectives, and I see no reason not to respect them.')
