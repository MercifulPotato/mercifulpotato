I&#x27;ve stayed away from RH as I always suspected they are shady. However, blocking people also from selling is even worse imho. If the exchange does it then that&#x27;s OK because trading halts for everyone. But if RH does it, people can still sell on other platforms. I would be very upset if my trader is blocking me from selling. I do understand that disabling buying caused the stock to tank, but I think it would&#x27;ve happened even if they disabled both. Was that their way to manipulate the stock price? idk but it makes sense.')
