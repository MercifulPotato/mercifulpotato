To me, that is the baseline, and anything beyond that is a privileged blessing, NOT a necessity.</i><p>I&#x27;m sorry what? This isn&#x27;t the 1800&#x27;s anymore, this way of thinking just astounds me. How can you anyone look at our modern times and say as long as your a half days horse ride away from a government office you got everything you need. You&#x27;re ignoring that fact most people don&#x27;t even have horses. Cars have existed for over 100 years now. You could at-least factor that into your baseline.<p>If we never move the baseline up then we lose the will to advance. We strip the upward mobility of our poorer citizens.<p><i>ease of access is something that I think is over-valued when it comes to government</i><p>The harder it is for your average citizen to due something the less likely they are to do it. It discriminates against the people who need help the most and concentrates power into fewer and fewer hands.<p>Take starting a Business for example, the harder it is the less people will do it. This is bad for our economy and society as a whole. Less small businesses means less jobs, less ways for people to lift themselves out of poverty. The more difficult Government is to interface with the more time someone has to devote to dealing with it. It means less time to focus on education or a small business, or their family, or health. It means they are more likely to be stuck where they are.<p>Ease of Access to Government resources can be directly correlated to some peoples quality of life. Think of Food stamps or welfare to the people who need it.<p><i>I think it&#x27;s hard to make the case that someone may be excluded just because they don&#x27;t have internet</i><p>No, its pretty easy, most libraries have been closed due to Covid. Many people might not have reliable access to the internet atm. Which in the supposed best country on Earth is scary.')
