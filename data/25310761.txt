The proper metric would be Joules in per gram of chicken out.<p>Since the lab grown chicken doesn&#x27;t need bones or organs, there is already an efficiency gain there. You also don&#x27;t don&#x27;t need to maintain a chicken for months since this burger only takes a few days to grow.<p>Real chickens are currently more efficient, but that won&#x27;t last forever as lab technology improves. Ideally, you just need a vertical farm that takes in electricity, organic feedstock, and some minerals and you should be able to get a better energy to meat conversion than an inefficient chicken that was cobbled together by blind luck.')
