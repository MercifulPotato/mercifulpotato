Sure, it loses to Python, but that&#x27;s some tough competition.<p>Personally, I find that smile[1] covers most use cases.\nBreeze[2] also has a lot of love, but I&#x27;m not much of a fan of the `UFunc` abstraction.<p>I&#x27;m also really excited about polynote[3]. It&#x27;s still a bit green and only supports Scala 2.11&#x2F;2.12, but it&#x27;s such a joy to be able to use Scala in notebooks :). You also get Python interop, in case you need to use some specific python library.<p>P.S.: I hope that Scala&#x27;s ML&#x2F;AI libraries other than Spark keep growing, because &quot;embarassing&quot; is a nice way to describe it&#x27;s performance on everything that&#x27;s not a &quot;really-huge dataset&quot;.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;haifengl&#x2F;smile" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;haifengl&#x2F;smile</a>\n2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scalanlp&#x2F;breeze" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scalanlp&#x2F;breeze</a>\n3: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;polynote&#x2F;polynote" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;polynote&#x2F;polynote</a>')
