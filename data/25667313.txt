My reaction to hearing Rush Limbaugh is the desire to shut it off ASAP. Don&#x27;t you have to willingly invite him into your life? To listen <i>and</i> enjoy and want to listen more, to even &quot;experiment&quot; with the drug of anger with an object of blame, is not very indicative of kind and optimistic IMO.<p>The thing is, people are complex. They can be very kind... to their own kind, if you know what I mean. Alternatively, some parents can be kind to everyone else&#x27;s kids and be abusive toward their own. It&#x27;s almost always nuanced. You may only see side one side of a person, even if you think you know them better than anyone else.')
