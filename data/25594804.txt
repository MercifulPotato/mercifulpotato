So if your requirements change later, it&#x27;s just a change to the function generating your UIDs.<p>Also I don&#x27;t use monotonic generators, because in pratice, in my applications, it never make business sense to sort entities with a greater granularity than a millisecond, so even if I generate 10 entities&#x27; IDs in a millisecond, I will let the random part randomly sort the entities generated during this millisecond.<p>Monotonic generators, are in my opinion only useful when you require absolute ordering, like with events, and thus rarely are a concern.')
