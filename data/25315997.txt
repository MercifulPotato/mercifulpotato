His detailed description of Iran and Iranians was published as a book with the original title “Persien, das land und seine bewohner.” In this book he wrote: “hashish-cannabis is used by some ethnic groups but opium use is a very popular habit and unlike cannabis it has no negative social stigma or shame for users. It is not forbidden and every Iranian who can afford its cost uses it daily.”» - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4479403&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4479403&#x2F;</a><p>So it was social stigma, not availability that made the difference.')
