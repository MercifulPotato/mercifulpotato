I have never to my recollection purchased anything because of an ad. If I have clicked through an ad, it was simply because it was the quickest way to get to the website&#x2F;product.<p>There is a role for advertising because Google polluted their organic search results with Ads making it harder for you to find what you want and forcing you to compete for the top Ad spot.
