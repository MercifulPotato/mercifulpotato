About a month ago I took a break from my usual environment (Linux Mint Cinnamon) and gave Icewm a try.  I decided after a week of usage that it did everything I need in a window manager: fully configurable with hotkeys, multiple virtual desktops, a taskbar, a decent &quot;start&quot; button with a menu system you can edit to your heart&#x27;s content.<p>I usually like transparent terminals with a slight shading to them and icewm uses older technology so the newer terminals don&#x27;t provide transparency. I fixed that by moving to aterm which in turn gave me trouble by not handling unicode.<p>So icewm is perhaps dated. But it&#x27;s very lightweight, a bit more mainstream-feeling than openbox etc., and I thought it&#x27;s a good compromise between a KDE&#x2F;Mate&#x2F;Gnome3 and openbox&#x2F;fluxbox&#x2F;i3 etc.  It&#x27;s nice for remote machines you remote into where you want some basic GUI functionality but not a full-blown desktop environment.')
