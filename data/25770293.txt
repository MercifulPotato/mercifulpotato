I would regularly go to McDonalds for lunch around 11:30 in order to watch an amazing crowd behavior.  Above the McDonalds was a large elementary school.  At noon sharp they would break for lunch and huge numbers of little kids would come down and crowd into the restaurant to order lunch.  Almost 100% of these kids ordered exactly the same thing: a Filet &#x27;o Fish.<p>I remember this McDonalds having a very long row of those diagonal slots where hamburgers were slid down and stacked up: except for one slot, they were all pre-filled with Filet &#x27;o Fish sandwiches in preparation for the onslaught.')
