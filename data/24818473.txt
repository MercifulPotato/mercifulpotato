I tend to use the web UI on my desktop which, IIRC, has always made links bounce through a Google. I use an app on my mobile device so I can&#x27;t confirm whether links bounce through Google.<p>Is Google rewriting the links in the message such that if I forward to someone&#x27;s non-Gmail address, they still bounce through Google?<p>Or is the client &#x27;rewriting&#x27; links dynamically? This same thing happens all over the web. Drop a link in your Medium-hosted blog, and they&#x27;ll front the link with their own and then redirect.<p>What&#x27;s the new, surprising bit here?')
