I have a &quot;confirmation-thank-you&quot; page, but it&#x27;s behind a one time token that is only in the email and only valid for 48 hours. And once it&#x27;s validated the token is no longer valid, so there is no way to get further information.<p>Once confirmed there is no other public page or anything to get a hint if the email got validated or not.')
