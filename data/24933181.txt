There&#x27;s a nasty issue with companies trying to emulate Google on &quot;all the things&quot; and it usually doesn&#x27;t work, since often times these organizational structures are a natural evolution of where a company came from, but you aren&#x27;t that company...<p>Best SRE&#x2F;QE model I&#x27;ve experienced was with a couple of these guys being embedded into a dev team (reporting structure didn&#x27;t really matter), such that they participated in the team  meetings and rituals, becoming domain experts. One fellow eventually learned the SAML2.0 spec inside out and was invaluable for catching bugs.<p>I suppose being embedded but reporting up through a different org did have it&#x27;s benefit: namely, the consistent dissemination of best practices across the company, but with a judicious eye to applicable context that the current do-it-all-swe cannot with the current SRE ivory tower model.<p>The do-it-all-swe model has yielded trash QE&#x2F;observability in my experience.')
