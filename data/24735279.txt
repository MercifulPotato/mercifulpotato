You&#x27;d like to believe that people believe everything they read on Facebook, while the truth is people don&#x27;t care. People don&#x27;t care about a lot of things and will repeat memes and jokes. We all &quot;believe&quot; things that are more or less false just because we don&#x27;t care about them. Your relatives believe in things you may think are false but to them is just rubbish tidbits of information that do not affect them. Obama being Muslim or not has no effect on her life, why must we enforce that people now must be informed of the &quot;right beliefs to have&quot;? Who picks what things are important as well?<p>Just stop. The sad thing is you as a human will not recognize in yourself how much your &quot;knowledge&quot; is faulty as well.')
