Item(by='darawk', descendants=None, kids=[24877824], score=None, time=1603528466, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24877641, text='&gt; People say this, but I&#x27;ll note that humans have lived through &quot;crippling poverty&quot; for most of our 2 million year existence. It is only crippling poverty by today&#x27;s distortion lens (also a shifting baseline).<p>That&#x27;s very easy to say. But it&#x27;s hard for me not to notice that you&#x27;re commenting on web forums, which means you probably haven&#x27;t given up on the creature comforts of modernity. If you&#x27;re not willing to do it, what gives you the right to tell half of India to?<p>&gt; We should focus on what people really need to live quality lives, which is: good health (read: access to modern healthcare, freedom from pollution, disease), good food (read: freedom first from starvation, from malnutrition, poor diet), shelter from the elements, and then the rest of Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy. Cars, TV, home appliances, and the whole lot of today&#x27;s energy-hungry living isn&#x27;t sustainable, and I&#x27;d argue isn&#x27;t even the thing we should be shooting for. People of the past lived very different and satisfying lives that we simply can&#x27;t imagine because, frankly, we are spoiled. People lived in tribes and hunted with spears for 100,000 years at least. And you know what, they beat those drums, painted their faces, tracked the stars, and contrary to whatever we might believe from our high place of &quot;development&quot; they actually enjoyed their lives.<p>I see a whole lot of people saying things like this, and literally no one actually living it. The contradiction is hard to ignore. Maybe the old way of living wasn&#x27;t really that nice.')
