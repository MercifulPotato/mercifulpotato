For example Apple developed Pages, Numbers and Keynote because nobody else was able to compete against Microsoft. It&#x27;s hard to see the computing environment would be better off without those products.<p>You can argue that someone else would fill that gap but they didn&#x27;t really seem to be doing that before Apple stepped in. In fact I would guess that Apple would have preferred not to have developed them, it&#x27;s not as if they generate any direct revenue.')
