The same article could be written for any age range. And commenting about how &quot;scary&quot; it is that there are influential teens or 40somethings would be equally strange.<p>And perhaps there&#x27;s value in generational diversity?<p>The first half of the comment seems to just serve as a conclusion drawn from the premise in the last line, which doesn&#x27;t have a ton to do with the article, other than the fact that 3 of the listed people are politicians. But then, there are thousands of politicians across the country, and it stands to reason that longer tenure tends to be paired with a sense of influence.<p>Of course, the article also has activists and donors media types, and so on.  But, again, these kinds of people tend to have influence, and are found at many ages.')
