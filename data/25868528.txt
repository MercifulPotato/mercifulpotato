AWS has instead chosen the path to maintain their own fork to avoid sharing any profits with Elastic as they&#x27;re obviously currently making so much from hosting Elastic&#x27;s products that it&#x27;s in their financial best interest to start hiring dev resources to maintain their own fork then sharing profits with Elastic to fund its continued development.<p>Will be interesting to see how this strategy turns out, AWS may have already become to big to compete against who will be able to out resource, out fund &amp; take over any ISV&#x27;s OSS product, but it&#x27;s clear the longer Elastic waits, the harder it would be to protect their own investments being used against them.')
