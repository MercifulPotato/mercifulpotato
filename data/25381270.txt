Anyone who looks at the numbers can see that AirBnb is not affecting housing availability in any meaningful way.<p>There are about 6 times more permanently vacant units in SF than the peak number of AirBnb, and the amount of construction that has been blocked during discretionary review (met the zoning requirements, people complained about parking) since AirBnb&#x27;s existence far exceeds the AirBnb units too.<p>(I am in favor of vacancy taxes, a house being used, even by a short-term renter, is better than the blight caused by properties sitting empty)')
