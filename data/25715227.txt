Who would adopt it?<p>Maybe in the context of a company this could reap benefits and become a case study. Or in a partnership between many companies there could arise such applications. But they would still be locked to a niche. That is why I think even with financial support, the problem is maturity, or lack thereof.<p>You could argue that once a large enough group adopted practices that proved to be effective in reducing maintenance time and complexity, that others would follow, but that stops being a matter of pure financial support and starts being a matter of adoption and convergence, pointing once again to maturity of the ecosystem.<p>And another aspect of maturity, standardization and sanitization is that it comes at a cost to diversity, which in turn has benefits of its own, like new ideas and technology. This is kind of the balance between exploration and exploitation we see in training neural networks. I think software is in the transitioning phase from exploration to exploitation and we are living it.')
