They&#x27;re just making incremental improvements on something that&#x27;s been done many times, and 99% of the work is grunt work. The kind of research-driven code crafting us developers wish for simply doesn&#x27;t exist in the programming world. Maybe someone out there is working on self-driving flying cars, but I willing to bet even that isn&#x27;t as glamorous as it sounds. It&#x27;s probably mostly turning academic algorithm code into something usable, a.k.a. rote transformation of math into code.')
