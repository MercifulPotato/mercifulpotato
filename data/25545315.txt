I&#x27;ll never invent my own because whatever I come up with will be half baked anyway.<p>In these cases you recognized you needed to use a specific algorithm or data structure and was aware of it&#x27;s existence, name and properties. That&#x27;s most of the work.<p>Contrast this with code where common data structures are re-implemented (I need a dictionary and all I know is an array, better iterate and compare the keys until I find the right thing). And that&#x27;s only scratching the surface of bad code, believe me.')
