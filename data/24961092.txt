Rather, various youtube partners like VEVO have special encoding schemes and the youtube-dl test suite includes tests for handling these schemes.  Because the different styles are only used on partner content it isn&#x27;t possible for those specific test case to use a CC-BY(-SA) work.  Moreover, the test cases only download under 1 second of video and don&#x27;t even store it.<p>AFAICT all the documentation examples are test videos uploaded by the youtube-dl authors themselves and ones by the Linux Foundation.<p>The complaint submitted to github was not a DMCA takedown (17 U.S. Code ยง 512), though it was superficially formatted like one.  It was a complaint regarding 17 U.S. Code ยง 1201 anti-circumvention.  There is no counter-claim (or takedown, for that matter) provision in that law because there is no safe harbor.<p>Moreover, your description of a ยง512 takedown is simply incorrect.  Github is not obligated to take down a work when they receive a well formed DMCA notice: rather, they obtain an immunity from lawsuit for that particular infringement if they follow the procedure.  In cases where there is transparently no infringement that immunity isn&#x27;t worth much.  In all cases it&#x27;s simply a business decision to accept the liability or not vs the interruption in customer relationships, distrust, and loss of goodwill that can result from cutting off a user... no different than the decision to take on liability in any other business activity.<p>Maybe try avoiding such strong language when you haven&#x27;t personally researched the subject in great detail?')
