Think about it, if the cabin decelerated at the same rate as the front bumper the occupant would be half way to the steering wheel by the time the bag finished exploding and they&#x27;d get hit in the face with an exploding airbag.   Crumple zones #2 is deceleration and is tuned for a specific speed of impact.  They can be thought of as a single use coil spring without a damper.  Too slow of an impact and they do little to nothing (no big deal because it&#x27;s a slow impact).  Too fast and you will blow right through your available travel and bottom out hard.  Because the car manufacturers are not staffed by idiots they respond to incentives and tune their crumple zones to be most effective at crash absorption at the high end of the speeds they are tested at.<p>Most of the increase in &quot;wall thickness&quot; so to speak, of vehicles is from pillars and body structure that increases in width (to get more strength without adding too much material and weight).  Then the trim is layered over that and that means you not only lose the space where the reinforcements are but over the whole vehicle.')
