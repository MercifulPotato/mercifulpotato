I&#x27;m not good at it. I struggle to understand basic SQL joins, intermediate R, and intermediate statistics.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re just overwhelmed and don&#x27;t allocate enough time to learn each of those concepted? Joins in particular are a very simple concept that could be understood in a weekend of reading tutorials and playing with them. Honestly, the worst thing about them is probably the naming&#x2F;syntax confusion across database engines.<p>BTW regarding studying medicine: here in Poland, in every city with a medical school, I see US students who are getting their M.D. here (they&#x27;re easy to notice as they congregate in Starbuckses and study there). Many look like they&#x27;re in their late twenties or in their thirties. Maybe it&#x27;s a route for you as well?')
