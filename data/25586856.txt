You probably look at cues like whether it occupies an expensive skyscraper in the center of town? Do you see its ads around town? Does it sponsor the local soccer team? All credible signals that are hard to fake for a fly-by-night scammer.<p>All Bitcoin did was formalize this process. At any given time there are many chains that all purport to be the canonical history. How do you decide which one is authentic? By looking at hard-to-fake signals. In this case the accumulated hashing power behind the chain. Looking for whoever spent the most hash work is fundamentally no different than checking to see which bankers are wearing the most expensive suits.<p>Any system with trusted intermediaries will waste resources on costly signaling. The only question is whether crypto mining is more of a fundamental waste than traditional signals, like high-paid bankers and prestige real estate.')
