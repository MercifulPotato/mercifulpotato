But so what? That only matters if you&#x27;re using presence on the site as your mechanism of quality filtering. If the site has mixed quality posts, read the ones from high quality authors.<p>There could be a market for a service that just does quality filtering as a news aggregation service. So basically the opposite of what YouTube is doing -- don&#x27;t show anything from OAN or CNN or similar partisan outlets, don&#x27;t show garbage blogs, show the good ones. Maybe easier said than done, but I bet there&#x27;s a market there.')
