Push doesn&#x27;t have to be to Github, it can also mean sending an email. Obviously you can&#x27;t undo that.<p>The Github-first problem is viewing git merely as an interface to Github, where the home of the work is and where all things are collected and operated on. From this it follows that git push is a fundamental operation like add or commit. And from this follow complaints that git commit isn&#x27;t something that sends your changes to the One True Repo.<p>If you push then you should give up any expectation of control or ownership over the code that&#x27;s sent over the communications protocol of choice. Purging a file is nice for you but in action would be a force-pushed rebase that you have to ask people very nicely to use instead of the initial branch. Controlling what branch other people use is completely out of scope for a local VCS.<p>The blog continues on to say that the distributed nature gets in the way of the mental model.:<p>&gt;they have never even considered that thereâ€™s such a thing, because why would they? A branch is just a single concept in our head that is made complicated by the inherent distributed nature of Git.<p>And that&#x27;s just the wrong model to have, inspired by understanding git through the lens of Github. If you&#x27;re using git and you&#x27;re unaware that you&#x27;re operating on your local copy, not a shared workspace, then you can&#x27;t place much stock in whatever mental model you come up with.')
