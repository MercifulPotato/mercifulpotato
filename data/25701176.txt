We’re just upset we’re not the ones breaking treaties anymore. Ironically, the treaty was signed because the British pretended they were in a Position to unilaterally re-negotiate a previous treaty obligating them to return HL.<p>The Chinese had no obligation to sign the 1980s treaty to get HK back, and were  hardly intimidated by the UK’s 1980s military might to do so (I mean an British admiral said about the Falkland war: “if not for a few defective fuses we would have lost”. Against <i>Argentina</i>. Pretty pathetic)<p>The UK was delusionaly saying it might not give HK back to commies (understandable sentiment, surely) and the commies signed something to let the Brits save face.<p>About HK:<p>There’s nothing we can do.<p>Deluding ourselves that there is weakens us<p>We must contain the CCP, but HK is not it.')
