I don&#x27;t know anything about her, but her debate with Lecun on Twitter was enough for me to know she is toxic. I don&#x27;t care how good of a researcher she is. The fact they fired her given the current climate shows they actually have balls. I had no idea...<p>I read her email. You know what&#x27;s crazy about it? she is talking about Google silencing marginalized voices. She keeps referring to herself as a marginalized voice in the research community! She has a PhD from Stanford, working at one the best places in the world for AI researchers, and she gets more attention than almost any other researcher I know of (she earned it of course). Wake up woman. You&#x27;re a privileged researcher! If I were making the comments she made to Lecun, no one would even bother to listen, yet alone Lecun actually respond and eventually leave twitter because of that. Give me a break. There&#x27;s not even one sentence in her email about what is actually the content of her paper that is so controversial. It&#x27;s just a rant about nothing. Welcome to the real world, companies have policies and once you join them you lose your freedom to do whatever the heck you want. You can go back to academia but no one would pay you what you&#x27;ve been making at Google Research.')
