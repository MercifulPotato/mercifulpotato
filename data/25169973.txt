I think there&#x27;s been some times (like maybe pre-Devonian), where the Earth was pretty much Waterworld.<p>There was a series of books that Terry Pratchett co-authored, called <i>The Science of Discworld</i>, where a bunch of wizards were creating a planet, and it went through a bunch of phases, punctuated by E.L.E. asteriod impacts. I think it was a fanciful chronicle of early Earth.<p>Interesting books.')
