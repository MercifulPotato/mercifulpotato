At least in my experience, Bootcamp seemed almost designed to cripple Windows by contrast to OS X<p>The last time I used it (the last MBP with Ethernet built in. I want to say 2012 or 2013?) some of the features &quot;missing&quot; in Bootcamp<p>- No EFI booting. Instead we emulate a (very buggy!) BIOS<p>- No GPU switching. Only the hot and power hungry AMD GPU is exposed and enabled<p>- Minimal power and cooling management. Building Gentoo in a VM got the system up to a recorded 117 degrees Celsius in Speccy!<p>- Hard disk in IDE mode only, not SATA! Unless you booted up OS X and ran some dd commands on the partition table to &quot;trick&quot; it into running as a SATA mode disk<p>The absolute, crushing cynic in me has always felt that this was a series of intentional steps. Both a &quot;minimum viable engineering effort&quot; and a subtle way to simply make Windows seem &quot;worse&quot; by showing it performing worse on a (forgive the pun) &quot;Apples to Apples&quot; configuration. After all, Macs are &quot;just Intel PC&#x27;s inside!&quot; so if Windows runs worse, clearly that&#x27;s a fault of bad software rather than subtly crippled hardware')
