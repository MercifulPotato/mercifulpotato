The situation seems made for mockery.<p>To be fair a lot of startup origin stories are so ridiculously fake that they seem like they could have only been created as a mockery of earnestness. Like the founders know they&#x27;re lying, they know everyone else knows they&#x27;re lying, and they&#x27;re just doing it anyway as a weird flex or whatever.<p>Say what you will about Bezos, but at least he was honest that he just put every CPG product into a spreadsheet and discovered that books had by far the best unit economics and flywheel potential, rather than making up some bullshit backstory story about childhood literacy or whatever.')
