Think about what it realistically costs to move to NYC right now, first months rent, last months rent, deposit, and even then most rentals aren&#x27;t even on the market unless you pay a broker several thousand. The majority of people in rural america surveys can&#x27;t handle a 400 dollar emergency let alone the cost to move to a large metro.<p>And before you say &quot;well they can get the money to attempt a move by selling their family property&quot;, realise what you are saying. Sell dilapidated rural property to whom exactly? How does that happen?<p>Unless you have grants of approx 15-30k to bring people to cities I don&#x27;t think it is even possible. And what cities would even want this to happen enough to participate? Probably places like Cleveland? Detroit? Out of the frying pan into the fire I suppose.')
