I&#x27;m super thrilled to share with you the investing app Denys and I were building for past couple years.<p>Just like many folks in US and around the world, we are on our path to achieve financial freedom, by constantly saving and investing what we can.\nWe read a number of books on investing including a famous &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; and also doing research how value investing gurus, like Warren Buffett do the companies valuation and picking.<p>What we found, to be a passive investor is a pretty easy task. Invest in stock index fund or ETF like SPY or VOO and you should be good :).\nBut if you like to get a bit better resultsâ€¦ this is where it does take a lot of your time and knowledge.\nDoing analysis just for couple companies takes significant amount of time and involves looking at financial reports and making the calculations just to understand whether the company has healthy business numbers, not to mentioned if its stock is overvalued compared to the market price.\nAnd we are talking hundreds if not thousands of potentially good companies out there that are traded publicly.<p>Being software engineers, we knew we could scratch that itch and build software that will be doing all the calculations for us daily and present results in an easy to follow recommendation list of what to buy, what to sell and what to hold.\nThat&#x27;s how wealthX.ai was born.<p>Join us on our path of achieving financial freedom faster!\n Check out wealthx.ai and let us know if you have any questions!')
