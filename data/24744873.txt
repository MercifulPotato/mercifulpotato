I personally would rather have a boring colored car in most cases. The main reason I&#x27;m not currently choosy about color is because I buy used cars. The current car is a 20-year-old Toyota, purchased earlier in the summer. (The car gets used 2-4 times a month, and I don&#x27;t drive due to oversight after moving overseas).<p>And it isn&#x27;t like companies don&#x27;t offer choices.
