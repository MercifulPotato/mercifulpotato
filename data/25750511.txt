Item(by='Svettie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610473864, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25748700, text='No one is defending calls for violent overthrow, but typically we hold the people that have actually committed the acts responsible. Here, we&#x27;re shifting the responsibility a level above with the sentiment that &quot;this happened on your platform, so you have a duty to moderate&quot;. The kicker is that these tech giants employed the polar opposite of this philosophy for the majority of their existence to eschew as much responsibility as possible for their users&#x27; content.<p>Let&#x27;s see. If I go and organize a violent insurrection using GMail, what does Google need to do to comply with it&#x27;s own philosophy here? It seems that it needs to start scanning all emails for inciting violence and send them to a moderation queue. Of course, it&#x27;s never going to do any of that, because unlike Parler it doesn&#x27;t have any overlords holding it by the neck.<p>Google, Apple, and Amazon like to do whatever they can get away with when it comes to anti-competitive practices, and enjoy the protections granted to them as private entities. On the other hand, this shows that they&#x27;re willing to also take unilateral action to silence millions of people, based on nothing more than a whim and a holier-than-thou attitude. There&#x27;s a messy contradiction here. They&#x27;re not subject to having to abide by the 1st amendment because they&#x27;re private companies, but in practice they&#x27;re in control of the majority of public discourse. This is a big problem.<p>And this returns me to what I think was a big point in the article. The response to any free-speech concerns has been: &quot;if you don&#x27;t like Facebook or Google&#x27;s policies, you&#x27;re free to create your own.&quot; But the sway of FB&#x2F;Google&#x27;s policies is no longer just over their own content, but also the platforms they manage. Which as it turns out, form the majority of the infrastructure of the internet.')
