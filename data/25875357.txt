There&#x27;s a valid accessibility reason as being able to see the other person helps people with hearing challenges and also, it&#x27;s pretty rude to refuse to let yourself be seen.<p>I never understood people who &quot;didn&#x27;t want to be seen&quot; on camera during meetings (especially meetings with hearing accessibility issues) because those same people were willing to work in the physical workplace. The way I see it, if you refuse to be seen in a virtual meeting, you should _also_ refuse to be seen in person as well.')
