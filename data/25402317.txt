First, Druid well predated Runebender, though Runebender is now the &quot;hero app&quot; (before, it was xi-editor, now on the back burner).<p>Second, I have a <i>lot</i> of experience doing high performance 2D and font rendering, from libart to working on the PDF 1.4 blend modes in Ghostscript to font-rs. I&#x27;ve also been curious about GPU for a while, not least because that was what was actually painting the text on Android, and I worked on the Android UI team for almost 5 years. So now that GPU compute is becoming mainstream, I see an almost unique opportunity to apply my skills there.<p>Third, I&#x27;m not doing all this by myself. I&#x27;m deliberately trying to cultivate open source community involvement and, really, building a team, though it has diffuse borders. Now is also a good time to acknowledge my long-time collaboration with Colin Rofls, who does a huge amount of the day to day work on both Runebender and Druid.<p>Lastly, I published this in advance of a career move, which is becoming a research software engineer on the Google Fonts team. I believe this is a perfect position for me to continue pushing this research agenda forward, and I&#x27;m hoping will bring more resources and focus.<p>There is no chance of me getting bored doing this. Burnout is something I&#x27;m watching carefully, as I have experienced it (it was the end of my time on Android), but one thing I discovered in my 2.5 years away from being a full-timer at Google is that graphics research is what I love the most, and would probably be doing even if it wasn&#x27;t also a good career move.')
