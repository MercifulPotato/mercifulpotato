Can you build software?<p>After 20 years doing this job I can confirm that building software is really hard. I’m not sure how you really give people experience with that. My courses at uni did little to prepare me for building software.<p>Once you have a codebase in place, things are a whole lot easier. There are far fewer decisions to be made. Really you have little choice in how to do things as the current structure dictates your options. Discussions with customers are easier too, as you’re no longer talking in the abstract.<p>But it’s really challenging reaching that point.<p>Edit: having said all that, this does look like an interesting course')
