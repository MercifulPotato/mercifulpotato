For example, skyportal.xyz is another public portal. Same goes for hosts.<p>The Skynet (Sia) model aims for thousands and thousands of hosts spread geographically. It becomes extremely difficult to delete any piece of data from the network entirely as long as someone wants to make sure it stays up.<p>Erasure coding redundancy ensures very high resilience from any single host going offline.')
