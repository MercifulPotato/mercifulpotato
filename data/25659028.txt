You might as well ask Facebook to give you a dunce cap on your first day, or a t-shirt that says, “My lack of self-respect is so severe that I agreed to do Facebook’s interview process.”<p>The mere fact that I’d actually be valued at the $350k place and wouldn’t be rectally probed to ensure I am fungible with every other assembly line programmer is a big indicator that my total earnings over a long time are likely to be much higher away from a place like Facebook. Generous scheduled equity refreshers are no match for actually rising in responsibility and skill growth to critical new positions in a firm.')
