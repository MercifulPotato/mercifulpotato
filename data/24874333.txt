The site just worked, and everything was fine.<p>At the beginning of September, I bought a new domain name, and two days later got an email saying because of suspicious activity my account had been locked. After attempting to login on namecheap.com, I got the same message, with text saying I should submit a ticket.<p>I responded to the email, letting them know I hadn’t logged in since I bought the domain, and asked them to do a password reset. I got swamped with other things, and forgot about it until two weeks later, when they finally responded with another email.<p>They said sorry for the delay, and basically asked the same things. Had I logged into the account, did I share the account, etc.<p>I repeated what information I had given them before, asked what else they might need to resolve the issue ASAP, and waited. 10 days after that I still hadn’t received a response, so I emailed them again. I also chatted with support on their website, but they said I have to wait for them to reply to the email since it was a “security matter”.<p>I sent another email 20 days after that, making it almost 2 months in total that I haven’t been able to access my domains, and use the new domain I bought. Has anyone else had this much trouble with namecheap? I don’t even think I can transfer my domains if I can’t get into my account can I?<p>Any suggestions on what I can do? I haven’t had any problems up until now, but this is ridiculous. I’d love to be able to use what I paid for… Let me know if you’ve had similar issues with them and how you got it resolved, thanks!')
