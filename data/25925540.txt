That&#x27;s market manipulation. Why allow wallstreet to make money off of price movements they caused themselves? Why short sell only to short sell even more and never actually close your shorts? It&#x27;s like a bubble where everything is going down and once the bubble bursts it shoots back up. The reason they do it is that it is easier to drive the price of something down than up.')
