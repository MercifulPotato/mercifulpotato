Not quite as easy as &quot;it just works&quot; in popular messengers, but still good given the nature of email.<p>The most difficult part was getting a signed certificate. There&#x27;s only 1 free provider left (apparently) and the payed one I&#x27;ve tried was a worse experience. This is a hindrance, but something that could be solved if usage was more wide spread in the first place. But how come it (seemingly) never got off the ground in the first place?')
