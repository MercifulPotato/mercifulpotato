A couple of months back their support stopped responding even though we were paying TravisCI significant sums of money. Their service had all sorts of glitches and wasn’t very reliable.<p>If they were walking away from people who wanted to give them money, I can imagine they don’t give a shit about OSS projects where they lose money.<p>TravisCI taught me a hard lesson. Relying on 3rd party for CI is a losing bet if you care about reliability and guaranteed capacity.')
