It&#x27;s such a mind trick that it gets nearly universal support regardless of if the policymakers is on the left or the right, and everyone who is opposed to it is labeled a kook.  If it&#x27;s gradual enough the increasing divide between the rich and poor will be pointed at other causes like &#x27;capitalism&#x27;.  Naturally, governments would like to continue such a universally beloved source of revenue, so the state of affairs of bitcoin vs fiat is unlikely to change, and of course bitcoin and similar forms are like to suffer restrictions and limitations imposed on it by governments.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that the meteoric rises of bitcoin since its inception has very little to do with this fundamental form of cryptocurrency relative appreciation, outside of attracting the kooks who want to believe in alternatives.')
