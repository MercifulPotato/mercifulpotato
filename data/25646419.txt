The benefits were immediate, greater awareness, energy, and quality of sleep.<p>What I also found is that I had been using coffee&#x2F;caffeine to control certain aspects of my daily life, such as when to have focus and when to get tired&#x2F;sleep. Without caffeine I was felt distracted by little things I was noticing or thinking of, made worse by the WFH situation.<p>I&#x27;ve gone back to consuming a limited amount (~1.5 cups) only between 10am and 6pm. I used to have none on weekends feeling a bit off to reset but eventually even this seemed pointless, so 10am-6pm every day has been working well.<p>If I didn&#x27;t have a job where I had to hold a house of cards in my head daily for hours at a time, or have a distraction-free work area, I could probably give it up entirely. But then I don&#x27;t think I would, I enjoy the flavour and ritual of coffee and frequently drink decaf espresso or americano even when out, which is actually pretty good if you find a good local bean roaster.')
