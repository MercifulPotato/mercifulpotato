It took a team of 10 people and some extra consultants to come up with a half backed version of the latest database based on elastic cache instances, redis caches and other &quot;not meant to be a backup&quot; services.\nIt was insane walking in an office that had hundreds of employees and see they all gone while we rebuild this cobbled together db.<p>At one point someone called it &quot;good enough&quot; and they basically had to honor the customer word if they had purchased something and it wasn&#x27;t there.<p>It was a mess.<p>It was on all major news, and it was really bad press. In the end, they actually had a massive bump in their sales afterwards.\nEveryone went to checkout their own purchases and ended up buying something else, and the news was like free ads.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;capitalbusiness&#x2F;the-download-livingsocial-goes-down-for-nearly-48-hours-after-critical-database-error&#x2F;2013&#x2F;11&#x2F;15&#x2F;2012bc4e-4c9b-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;capitalbusiness&#x2F;the-...</a>')
