The idea of Small Claims Court is to have a cheap way to resolve monetary disputes, without having to rely on complex procedures and expensive lawyers.  So, since you as an individual wouldn&#x27;t have a lawyer when you sue someone for $300, it wouldn&#x27;t quite be fair if the company was afforded one.<p>Keep in mind that anything you take to a Small Claims Court you can also take to to a Superior Court, where only lawyers are allowed, unless you&#x27;re an individual, and are representing yourself.<p>Not every state bans lawyers from SCC.  But in California, you&#x27;d only face a lawyer in SCC if you sue them for not returning your money, or they sue you for not paying them their fees.')
