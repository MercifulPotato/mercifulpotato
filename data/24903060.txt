But I didn&#x27;t mean to extend the doctor analogy to individual people. Personally, I&#x27;m very slightly aspy. I didn&#x27;t get into computers to help people, I got into it because I loved programming, science, and tech. Unlike doctors, I don&#x27;t need to see my work save people&#x27;s lives. I&#x27;m in it for a totally different reason.')
