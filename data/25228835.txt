Understanding efficient sorting and how quicksort works is fundamental CS knowledge. I would say the idea is if you know how quicksort works, you should be able to write the code, no? If one is okay with writing a basic sort function but not quicksort - it could mean (1) that person does not know quicksort, (2) knows quicksort but not a good enough engineer to write code for it or (3) idealistic.<p>Companies are hiring software engineer not computer scientists. If someone wrote a sort algorithm in a normal job I would expect that not to be used and a library to be used. This is also knowledge that people who studied and aced their tests in Uni forget, because no one in their right mind writes a quicksort.<p>&gt; Not practical enough. Do you expect, in the current scenario where there is a demand surplus, for candidates to happily sign up for a trial stint - that is for the &quot;interview&quot; to last one or three months? I personally won&#x27;t be okay with it because it messes up with a persons stability, their ability to interview at multiple places.<p>People actually sign contracts like that on a daily basis. That is literally what you sign up for. Here is the actual process: CV screening -&gt; Tech Test -&gt; Phone Screening -&gt; Interview -&gt; Trial or &quot;probation&quot;.<p>And the rest of it about people looking for jobs, well that&#x27;s why companies should be selling&#x2F;recruiting. The whole &quot;but people won&#x27;t do that&quot; is clearly wrong since they already do and often jump at their first offer.')
