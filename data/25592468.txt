I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually <i>faster</i> but given that SDL2 focuses on accelerated rendering I&#x27;d imagine so. Worth checking out in any case.<p>Just in case it&#x27;s still as slow as ever: there&#x27;s perfectly fine SDL2 bindings for python, so if you use those at least the slowness will be your own fault.')
