Failure to understand that motives are necessarily private causes otherwise well-laid plans to fail. Imperfectly, we can examine the behavior of the person to determine whether their behavior is consistent with one motive or another. This is not guaranteed to be correct but if done sincerely and charitably can help to catch the more egregious cases.')
