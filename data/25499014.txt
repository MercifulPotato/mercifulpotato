These were only available due to a law allowing police to have access to private data, and apparently pretty commonly used by jealous spouses to spy on their SO.<p>&gt; A glimpse of the future for those supporting these kinds of laws because they have nothing to hide.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily true, because pervasive and tolerated corruption is required to get an end state like that.  If a country has &quot;[those] kinds of laws,&quot; but unlawful access is investigated and prosecuted, then the data will remain (more or less) restricted to police and government investigators.<p>So, even though you still have to worry about the police and government abusing the data, as well as certain powerful or connected people, you won&#x27;t have to worry so much about stuff like your SO buying your phone records for $10.')
