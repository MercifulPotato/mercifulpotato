The most I&#x27;ve heard from pilots is that they didn&#x27;t use an airborne radar and didn&#x27;t use the VHF radio on the plane under any circumstance. Even on the runway, it was forbidden. Those things have nothing to do with stealth and everything to do with basic signals intelligence stuff.')
