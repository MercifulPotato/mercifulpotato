Yes it doesn&#x27;t last a lifetime.<p>Honestly, I haven&#x27;t found IKEA to be all that cheap? When I was looking for a bed frame they seemed comparable to other midrange furniture places. I could definitely have found a similar thing cheaper online or maybe even at Walmart.<p>I guess I&#x27;m used to buying furniture used, where the floor&#x27;s the limit for how cheap it can be, but my impression of IKEA was that people go there for the showroom experience and the meatballs more than the price.')
