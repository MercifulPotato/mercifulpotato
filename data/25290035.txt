Apple is doing some crazy stuff with the M1, but I personally would chock (most of it) it up more to being clever than true innovation. I think only Intel needs to be concerned right now because they&#x27;re being outpaced by both AMD and Apple. Additionally if the acquisition of Arm by Nvidia results in what people expect, Intel will basically be losing out in every market.<p>Going back to versatility, there&#x27;s no way that AWS or Azure is going to move to Apple silicon for their infrastructure, so there&#x27;s still a massive market for AMD or other Arm manufacturers to target. For the consumer side unless Apple releases a chip that results in them making a sub-$800 laptop, they&#x27;re just simply not going to capture a large market. With the rise of devices like Chromebooks in education and home there&#x27;s still something to be said for Apple devices just being too expensive.<p>In general, Apple devices also leave a LOT to be desired for any sort of large scale enterprise organization. Unless they go back to their 90&#x27;s and early 00&#x27;s mindset, I just can&#x27;t see this changing.<p>It&#x27;s certainly exciting to see the CPU market being upended by Apple and AMD, as well as the potential future for a large architecture shift, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any real threat to market shares as a whole.')
