In the wealthier country, managers make lots of money by outsourcing labor, causing the cost of labor in the wealthier country to plummet.<p>In the poorer country, it creates a class of ultra-rich businessmen who rule over the ultra-poor laborers (and those laborers must remain ultra-poor otherwise the jobs would flow back to the laborers in the wealthier country).<p>Not only that, but the poorer country isn&#x27;t going to adhere to environmental standards of the wealthier country (absent coercion a la border adjustments), and so it basically becomes a way for businesses in the wealthier country to continue to enrich themselves by way of pollution (and otherwise mismanagement of environment).')
