I&#x27;m suggesting that when you put all your empathy into caring for one thing at the cost of another, typically yourself, it&#x27;s a hard path to walk. Empathy as a fix all, isn&#x27;t. There needs to be balance between what&#x27;s reasonable, feasible and practical, for our environment, for the eco-system and for us as humans. Empathy for sure is necessary, but it&#x27;s only part of the solution, not the whole solution.')
