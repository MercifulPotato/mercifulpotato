It’s rather infantilizing and I wonder about the politics of it. I could see a party using it to buy votes - “elect us and you’ll get more money each month.”.<p>It wound do wonders for the drug and alcohol industries, casinos, and state lotteries though. How many boys would never leave their moms basement?<p>If anything it’s a huge risk to the USD remaining a global reserve currency.
