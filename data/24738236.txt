I can&#x27;t believe that this passes muster with you as a scientist.<p>I can&#x27;t help but notice the gas he creates at first is white in colour.  In the second the gas is clear in colour.  Both white and colourless gas are the same apparently.  The difference in colour is not explained.<p>In the second experiment, Brian Cox says he is using hydrogen + AIR (not oxygen).  Air is apparently 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and argon + trace gases are the rest.  This is to say, this is not mixing oxygen + hydrogen.  So this experiment is NOT what I was asking evidence of.<p>Finally, he creates an explosive pop and some condensation appears on the glass jar.  Let&#x27;s accept that this liquid is water.  What&#x27;s to say that the water isn&#x27;t simply water that was already in vapour form in the air that condensed against the glass?<p>And why do we need flame to ignite the gases?  Is it really true that fire creates water?  Is that a joke?<p>And do we really think that the ratio of 2 particle of hydrogen to 1 of oxygen was met?  It was hardly a rigorous measurement, was it?<p>Overall, no, I did not see and experiment where pure hydrogen and pure oxygen where combined to make water.  Do you think you did?  To me, its all inference, hearsay and claim.<p>If this is all the evidence you need, yes, I think your threshold is too low.')
