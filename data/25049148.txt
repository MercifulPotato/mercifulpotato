It definitely adds value, as I know what I should be working on in order. Doing it on a digital calendar also means that I can move stuff around or add tasks quickly as plans (invariably) change.<p>When trying it as my only method of planning, I found that I was losing the bigger picture and losing track of key tasks. For instance, if I put some task to do for Friday but don&#x27;t do it and forget to reschedule, it&#x27;s just lost in my calendar. However, it works quite well with an external todo list, as a way to make it more concrete.<p>It can add or remove stress depending on how you use it. At first I blocked out too many things per day and would get stressed from not finishing them. Now, I block out maybe 2-3 main tasks which I can usually finish and feel good about spending time for myself in the evening.')
