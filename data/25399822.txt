I <i>think</i> based on the essay, they mean seriousness + sincerity. But there is also a sense that the author considers “correct” as part of the definition:<p>&gt;“when you call someone earnest, you’re making a statement about their motives. It means both that they’re doing something <i>for the right reasons</i> [my emphasis] and they’re trying as hard as I can”<p>So why assume that “interest in the problem” is intrinsically good? Do we really believe it’s not possible for a politician to be addressing the problem of “improving people’s lives” via the intermediate aim of “gaining political power”? So why wouldn’t that also be classified as “earnest”? If a gang leader is addressing the problem of “keeping our guys safe”, and therefore murders members of a rival gang who pose a threat to them, wouldn’t that also be “earnest”? Is it just because the author holds people working individually on a certain class of problems to be admirable, while having a much more negative view or politicians and criminals?<p>[Edit: I forgot to mention that I think there are some good points in this essay, and I agree with many of them, but I think it leaves some important areas unexplored]')
