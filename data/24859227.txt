Item(by='HelloNurse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603381339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24858456, text='Documentation is terribly lacking, but in addition examples are perplexing.<p>Where is the &quot;Url&quot; type, which should be a union of a constrained subset of &quot;Str&quot; (as built by mylib.makeURL) and a three component record (as used in the example)?<p>Where can I specify that the &quot;urls&quot; list in the configuration must be present and nonempty, and that &quot;host&quot; and &quot;port&quot; are mandatory (or not)? And that the type of &quot;urls&quot; is a list of &quot;Url&quot;, the type of &quot;port&quot; is &quot;port&quot;, etc.?<p>How can a general purpose port <i>type</i> have a meaningful default value, given that duplicates are generally fatal and a configuration can contain multiple ports? Only individual port usages (e.g. ftpPort and telnetPort in a commonNetworkServices record) should have defaults.<p>Where is the body of numToStr? Maybe in some unmentioned standard library?<p>Is there some kind of enforceable separation between the configuration file (untrusted and supplied by the user) and a schema it must satisfy (trusted and supplied by the application)? What forbids the configuration file to, say, redefine makeURL as Str -&gt; Str -&gt; Num -&gt; Str -&gt; Str -&gt; Str (to add a HTTP path and query string) and make the application&#x27;s URL parsing fail?')
