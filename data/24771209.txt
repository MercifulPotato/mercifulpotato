But for a purely remote firm, why would a cost-of-living adjustment exist at all?<p>In a pre-COVID job market with physical offices, obviously you need to pay higher rates for the same quality of employee in a major city. Someone must be hired, and the only available applicants are paying high rents, so the firm is forced to pay more if they want their offers accepted. Supply and demand.<p>But if the firm is purely remote, why tolerate this? Ignoring the issue of pay cuts for moves, why pay $200K for someone in SF instead of $100K for someone just as good in Pittsburgh?<p>If there were no friction to hiring&#x2F;firing, and no difference in employee quality by location, the rational strategy would not to set wages based on the local cost-of-living. The wages should be set at the replacement cost of the labor. The firm receives no benefit from the employee choosing to live somewhere expensive. They should simply pay the same rate everywhere, and each employee can choose their city based on their own values and ability to pay rent.<p>My personal theory is that this <i>is</i> the scenario that many newly-remote-only firms are now in. They don’t want to pay employees different rates based on location, but their workforce is nonetheless mostly in an expensive city and expects to be paid accordingly, as per pre-COVID norms. What the firm would <i>like</i> to do is reduce wages across the board, but doing so would spark a backlash from workers who suddenly can no longer make rent. Thus they create the fiction of downward CoL adjustments, which only made sense pre-COVID, to concentrate the negative effects on the workers most willing to endure them — the workers suddenly paying less in rent. If remote-only remains permanent, firms will eventually fire or decline to replace staff in expensive cities, as the same work can be done cheaper elsewhere, until reaching an equilibrium where all workers are paid less and the firm no longer cares where they live.')
