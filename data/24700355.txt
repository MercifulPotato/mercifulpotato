The same types of etching and doping processes can be used to create many integrated  circuits.<p>DRAM chips are integrated circuts that consist of individual transistors and capacitors for each bit, plus the wiring and logic to read, refresh, and write to those bits. They&#x27;re substantially transistors.<p>It&#x27;s true that logic, power, analog, flash, DRAM, SRAM, and mixed signal ICs do have some significant differences, and some manufacturers optimize for a subset of those capabilities, but they&#x27;re similar enough that if one industry advances leaps and bounds (like Flash storage and low-power processing have).<p>So why does DRAM lag behind the others?')
