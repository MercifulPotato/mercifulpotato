Most times it was entirely mediocre. As a kid, that was a big investment, so I got stuck listening narrowly, and buying things that were very likely to be hits (the same bands; the same labels; etc)<p>Now my friends send me Spotify and YouTube links every day.  I’ve found new genres and artists.  It’s been wonderful.<p>I know that your ignorant, judgmental, and elitist opinion doesn’t matter; streaming is here to stay.  But it’s absurd that your whining that kids today don’t enjoy music the right way is near the top of the page.<p>Your arrogance should be dead, like my comment surely will be.')
