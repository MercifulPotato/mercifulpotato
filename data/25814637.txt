Two comments though: trying to handle corporate actions, instruments, pricing, risk as well as settlement in one library might be a bit too ambitious. Maybe it would be better to focus on just the pricing, or the risk part of things?\nThe other comment, is that I would probably split products from the pricing. I looked at one of the product definitions and it seemed to be intertwined with pricing. Products and pricing can both be complex in an of themselves, and they are not necessarily conceptually coupled. Just my two cents.')
