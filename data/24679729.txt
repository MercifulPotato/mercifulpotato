Every single flavour of English has its own distinction and incompatibility with the others, that&#x27;s what defines it as its own thing.<p>A US or UK English speaker will face issues when talking with a Indian English speaker, or an Australian English speaker.<p>In practice we already use EU English, both in official documents and communications, and in casual exchanges. We just don&#x27;t recognize it officially.<p>The document you share is using UK English as the standard to follow, which explain why there are some differences.<p>&gt; This leads to less understanding, rather than more.<p>That leads to a common language WITHIN the EU, which is what we don&#x27;t have currently. I mean, again, we do have European English, we just don&#x27;t recognize it, and it isn&#x27;t as spread as it could be. The differences with other forms of English are small enough to increase the general communication between EU citizens and other English speakers in the world, but as you said also comes with a few differences that can cause misunderstanding. I work in international environments with people from all over the world, we already face those issues and they aren&#x27;t a big deal.')
