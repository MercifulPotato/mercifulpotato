Calling someone a fascist in\npublic(meaning 10+ witnesses I think) is considered defamation\nand, yes, if you cannot prove such claims it can have\nconsequences.<p>Note that this does not apply to just any kind of insult as you\nsay. It&#x27;s for cases when it&#x27;s considered harmful for one&#x27;s\npublic image, as usual with defamation. I&#x27;ve never heard of a\nsimple &quot;Idiot!&quot; leading to any consequences. I don&#x27;t know\nwhy it&#x27;s &quot;incredibly fascist&quot; to win a defamation case when\nsomeone called you a fascist in the open. Though I do admit that\nit&#x27;s hard to draw a clear line with these things, and there are\narguments for both sides as long as it doesn&#x27;t steer towards\ncensorship.')
