It would probably be straightforward to just make every blog post create a corresponding Cerulean&#x2F;Matrix post and then have a link to it automatically inserted into the bottom of the post.<p>One question I have, though, is how performant it is to have thousands and thousands of these small Matrix rooms around. Are rooms that lightweight? One for each post seems like it could be a lot, but I&#x27;m not familiar with the intended internals for servers to use in how they represent rooms.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25336352" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25336352</a>')
