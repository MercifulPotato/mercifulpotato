Item(by='xnyan', descendants=None, kids=[24666020], score=None, time=1601643386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24657822, text='I don&#x27;t know if this applies to you, but I&#x27;ve purchased multiple pairs of airpods and airpods pro (only ever lost one bud) and I&#x27;ve gotten 1 very professional counterfeit (sold at a major US retailer, looked perfect) and one bad set from the factory. Both had the problems you are mentioning - terrible battery life, terrible pairing and connection.<p>I was able to return both of them (convincing the retailer that I had not swapped out a counterfeit set of airpods and was trying to return them was tricky), no problems anymore.')
