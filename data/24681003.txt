He agrees with me it’s a possibility but it stops there. He was even given stimulants by someone but he hasn’t tried them. He’s not opposed to it, but he’s so bad he never gets around to popping that pill. Actually setting up a doctor appointment is never going to happen.<p>He’s 33 and has been in college since graduating high school and still doesn’t have a degree, and he’s actually quite intelligent.')
