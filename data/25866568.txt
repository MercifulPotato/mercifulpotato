I&#x27;m sure Russia and China have a hand in all of this, but that is to be expected after how the US intelligence agencies have weaponized every technology for  nearly the entire last century around the World.<p>But in the end, people have agency and the choice to not use your algo optimized survielence based apps&#x2F;platforms and fall trap to these abysmal outcomes. And the truth is so many of you people default to the &#x27;If I didn&#x27;t do it, someone else would&#x27; rationalization.<p>And as I&#x27;ve come to learn in my time in tech, especially in my (limited) time in Silicon Valley, many of you are  immigrants on employer sponsored Visas or 1st generation migrants with family back home who need the money to survive, so I can&#x27;t hate you as a person if that&#x27;s your situation. I just want to clarify that I hate the system you operate with a passion because it lures you in with the delusion of <i>prestige</i> tied with bloated salaries for focusing your attention on the most pointless, and in modern times clearly dangerous, use of your collective talents and skills at these places when we have so many more real problems to solve.<p>What I can say is I just sincerely wish you do something worth redeeming you as a Human being as a side project.')
