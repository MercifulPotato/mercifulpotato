Any company that relies heavily on A&#x2F;B testing suffers this problem.  I know Netflix had&#x2F;has this problem.<p>You try out a bunch of changes, and one of them makes a slight uptick in the metric you&#x27;re tracking.  So you implement that change and kill all the other experiments, instead of iterating on the other ideas to see if you can get them to do <i>even better</i> than the current winner.<p>Apple didn&#x27;t used to suffer from this problem, because Steve Jobs didn&#x27;t care about data if something bothered him.  He&#x27;d just have it changed, and he happened to have good taste.  Johnny Ive tried to do the same, but his taste was hit or miss, so now they have a conglomeration of taste and data made interfaces.<p>Google is 100% data made interfaces.  From what I understand, their PMs have <i>no</i> leeway to go against the data.  At least at most companies the PM can still make a decision against the data, and as long as they can justify it with user studies or something else they can move ahead.<p>Data can tell us a lot of things, but it can&#x27;t tell us everything.')
