Most states weren&#x27;t particularly clear about exactly which ballots were being counted when, and didn&#x27;t report distinct ballot cohorts.  The GA data (where they were really good about it after Tuesday) doesn&#x27;t show the effect you&#x27;re talking about.<p>[edit: OK, you&#x27;re just repeating this point without evidence again and again in this topic, despite being repeatedly asked for a citation.  That doesn&#x27;t seem like rational discussion, and I suspect you&#x27;re just being a troll.]')
