See this recent tweet from AOC (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AOC&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334184644707758080" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AOC&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334184644707758080</a>), where she excuses activists acting illegally because the &quot;polite language policy game&quot; (her words) didn&#x27;t work for them. This is no less an act of incitement than Trump, since Trump never called for violence or encouraged acts of violence.<p>I also think there is a great deal of hypocrisy from the left on this point given the events of this last year. There have been numerous riots, arrests, deaths, and illegal occupation of public places recorded. All the politicians, activists, organizations involved in those criminal acts have been given a pass and have faced very little accountability and virtually no censorship from big tech.<p>Even before George Floyd, we have incidents from left-leaning activists where they literally invade federal buildings. Here&#x27;s an example documented by the Associated Press (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;B_kxyacaAF4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;B_kxyacaAF4</a>). What was the response from the far left elements? Rashida Tlaib and AOC actually joined some of their events and encouraged them (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;alexandria-ocasio-cortez-sunrise-activists-nancy-pelosi&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;alexandria-ocasio-cortez...</a>). And yet, these two continue to be allowed their platforms.<p>Let&#x27;s be honest, the tech platforms are using this ridiculously inept protest at the Capitol as an enabling excuse to further censorship and erode free speech, aligning with the interests of their left-biased employee bases. The precedent it sets is dark, as it will be employed to discriminate against viewpoints that disagree with the progressive agenda.')
