But personally what I was attracted to in Soylent, I found in better in Huel. Real nutritionists, who share great content about their choices, etc. Very interesting to follow, and I&#x27;m a big fan of their powder for breakfast and their &quot;Hot &amp; Savory&quot; for lunches.<p>My diet is now almost entirely plant-based, there are noticeable health improvements, and it&#x27;s as cheap and efficient as Soylent.')
