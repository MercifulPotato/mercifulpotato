They make money by selling phones, computers, and related bits like watches. They have traditionally provided a great user experience partly because they control the software AND the hardware on their devices.<p>So sure, deciding to release an Android app for iMessage <i>might</i> be profitable, but it doesn&#x27;t serve their overall goals (selling more hardware), and time &amp; treasure spent on the initiative are resources NOT available to work on the next Mac, the next phone, the next iPad, etc.<p>Ergo, it seems super easy to me to understand why there is no Android iMessage, and why there likely won&#x27;t ever be one.')
