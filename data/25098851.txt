It just happens to have chili peppers. When Koreans talk about spicy food, it’s the spiciness level of something like bulldak (spicy chicken) that has a lot more spicy ingredients. In relation to effects on health from eating a lot of spicy food, I don’t think you will find much in studying Koreans. Korean food is notoriously famous for being salty (especially soups that most Koreans eat daily) and a lot of Koreans suffer cardiovascular diseases from high blood pressure because of their diet.<p>On a side note, it’s really kimchi’s acidity that helps with cleaning palate much like Germans’ sauerkraut or Japanese’ pickled ginger (called “gari”) that you eat with sushi.')
