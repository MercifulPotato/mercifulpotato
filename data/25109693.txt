Antiviruses had a much better solution to this ~20 years ago: download malware signatures, store them locally, and check every program run against the signature DB. Works while offline and completely respects user privacy.<p>Also, doesn&#x27;t really work that great for security, as there are always relatively easy ways to fool the signature detection. That&#x27;s why AVs usually moved to include much more complex behavioral checking.<p>Note: not claiming that AVs usually respected user privacy - a lot of them could be conisdered malware in and of themselves. But the malware protection scheme was simple and it did guarantee privacy - it&#x27;s other parts of the AV that then went behind your back and sold your data more directly.')
