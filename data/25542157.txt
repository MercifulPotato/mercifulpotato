I take a sleeping pill every once in a while. I was at the store once comparing two boxes of pills. One was marked &quot;Sleep Aid&quot;, and was $8 or so. The allergy medication nearby was the same count, same dosage, and only $5.<p>They were both diphenhydramine HCL, 25mg. Both tablets. The only differences were the labels, the pill colors (blue for ZZZZ, pink for allergy), and the price.<p>And the other benefit to stocking single-drug medications is more flexibility. I imagine some hapless guy whose has pain in the morning, but sees only &quot;Advil PM&quot; in the medicine cabinet.<p>If I need Advil PM, I&#x27;ll take a regular ibuprofen and a regular diphenhydramine.')
