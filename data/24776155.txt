A therapist can help you discover the aspects of your office life that are in conflict with your core values, and the aspects that are mere annoyances. This isn’t a suggestion that you are depressed. It’s a suggestion that what you’re experiencing isn’t normal or healthy, it’s not something the rest of us endure. Counseling might help you develop a plan for fixing it.')
