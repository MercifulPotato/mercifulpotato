Parents seem to forget that they aren&#x27;t a surrogate for the teachers, friends, and boy&#x2F;girl-friends their children would otherwise be interacting with at school.  It&#x27;s hugely valuable, nearly as much as the education itself.  I&#x27;m saying this as someone who is a kind of recluse; it would have been bad for me to never be challenged socially while growing up.<p>My conclusion is that things like Khan Academy are already good enough, and the real question should be how such a system could be adapted to a standardized testing structure(or perhaps the other way around).  What would be ideal is if schools can use something like Khan Academy so that there can be seamless transitions between home schooling and physical schooling, as well as making the concept of forgetting one&#x27;s homework obsolete.<p>The reason that we as a society are struggling with remote learning right now is because the people in control have no idea what they&#x27;re doing.  They&#x27;re having to play catch up to the rest of the world, at least in a digital sense.  It&#x27;s not that we don&#x27;t already have tools ready to go.  It&#x27;s a failure to adapt.  We had well over a decade to evolve education to the digital frontier and we were slow to the draw.')
