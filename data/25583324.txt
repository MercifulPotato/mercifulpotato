The easiest way to ensure that you don&#x27;t kill anybody is to limit your speed to 20mph.   At and below that speed a car-pedestrian collision is highly unlikely to result in a dead pedestrian.   Also, at 20mph you can stop on a dime.   So I imagined a large fleet of robot cars traveling at 20mph and normalizing that speed, forcing human drivers to slow down too.<p>But it turns out that self-driving vendors spend a lot of effort on &quot;driving like a human&quot;, which includes driving faster than the speed limit and faster than vision zero would allow on shared streets &amp; roads.')
