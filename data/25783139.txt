We worked with a plant to curate a 30000+ multi-class defect dataset, many with varying lighting and environment conditions. As you said, modifying and parameter tuning NN is not always a hopeful endeavor.<p>However, you can make significant gains to your models by going back to traditional image filtering&#x2F;augmentation. Sticking with well researched object detectors&#x2F;segmentation algorithms and putting our effort on improving the algorithms that cleans up the data takes you far. It&#x27;s impossible to avoid because images will always be full of reflections, artifacts, strange coloration unless you have the perfect lighting tunnel setup; doable nonetheless.')
