ARMv8 has conditional select, which is quite a bit richer than conditional move.  POWER has &quot;isel&quot;.  Seeing an ISA evolve a conditional move later in life is pretty strong evidence that it was useful enough to include.  So would modify your list to be:<p>ISAs that evolved conditional move:<p><pre><code>  - MIPS\n  - SPARC\n  - x86\n  - POWER (isel)\n</code></pre>\nISAs that started life with it:<p><pre><code>  - ARM (via general predication)\n  - Alpha\n  - IA64 (via general predication)</code></pre>')
