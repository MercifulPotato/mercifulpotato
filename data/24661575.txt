And also human capacity for accepting compromises.<p>When Malthus lived, there were about 1 billion people. It&#x27;s hard to estimate, but I&#x27;d guess at most 10% of those were living non-miserable lives, so about 100 million people at most.<p>Now the world middle class is 4 billion (40x) and the world upper class is probably around half a billion people (5x). I&#x27;m willing to bet that each and every one of those middle class individuals live better lives than the upper class of his time. We&#x27;ve been able to scale that 40x in 200 years. Despite wars, natural disasters, social strife, etc.<p>We&#x27;re pretty resilient.')
