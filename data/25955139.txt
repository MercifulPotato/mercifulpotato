Breathing has more momentum to the particles but talking produces smaller particles that break up further.<p>I don&#x27;t like that they suggest fit standards rated masks (ie, brand name N95) should be reserved exclusively for medical and related persons. That was okay a year ago but it&#x27;s really time to increase production of tightly fit low pressure drop N95 masks for everyone.')
