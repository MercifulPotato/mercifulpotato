Hammering is more straightforward for smaller-scale productions. Furthermore, China frequently forbids civilians to have weapons, while in Europe there are many weaponsmiths, and people are more familiar with this craftmanship.<p>And is there is usually no face on coins in China. It&#x27;s really nothing for some corner of the word to disappear after ages compared to making &quot;kings&quot; losing their nose and ears.<p>The square-shaped hole in the center - people usually use a thread to string together the coins and use them as belts. It&#x27;s much easier to have holes in the center if it is molded, though I&#x27;m not sure if the hole is the motivation of molding or the consequence of it.')
