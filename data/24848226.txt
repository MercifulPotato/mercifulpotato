Yesterday we had 241 Covid-19 fatalities, a number not seen since the start of June.<p>Additionally, the way the UK is counting deaths changed a few months ago. Originally we were counting everyone that had been diagnosed with Covid, now if the death doesn&#x27;t occur within 28 days of infection the death isn&#x27;t counted as a Covid-19 death.<p>And finally, we&#x27;re testing a hell of a lot more now so the alleged case numbers back in April (~5000 a day) don&#x27;t marry up at all with case numbers now  (~20,000 a day).  I&#x27;m guessing back in April it was closer to 80,000 cases a day in reality, which would make the disease just as deadly now as it was back then.')
