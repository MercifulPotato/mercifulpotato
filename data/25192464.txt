If anything, Baumol’s effect clearly demonstrates that price (wages) is set by supply and demand just like goods, and it’s entirely unsurprising.<p>As you reduce the supply of laborers for labor type A because those laborers have better options, then the price for labor type A rises.  That’s what Baumol says.  That’s what supply and demand says.  I fail to see the significance.')
