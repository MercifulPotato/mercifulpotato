But the latter is in fact illegal. CEOs can&#x27;t talk to each other and agree to pay $10&#x2F;hour for warehouse workers. Coordinating with others to set prices for labor or goods isn&#x27;t viewed as within the scope of freedom of association. Union activities are in fact specifically exempted from anti-trust laws because otherwise they would fall within the scope of them. Workers can agree with each other not to accept less than $15&#x2F;hour for warehouse workers.<p>You need something more than freedom of association to justify unions, rooted in the recognition of bargaining disparities between employers and employees.')
