Spacetime expanding sorta helps keep things from blowing apart.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting factoid that blackhole mass isn&#x27;t related to their volume but their surface area, so by adding mass they grow a lot faster than you&#x27;d expect and density goes down fast. Larger black holes are barely denser than water.')
