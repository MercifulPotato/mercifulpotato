Not necessarily, though it may hinder their ability to make informed choices when, e.g. dealing with a pandemic whose causal agent is evolving.<p>(Does a leader need to accept a heliocentric model? Again, probably not, very little in the way of political life depends on the leader&#x27;s cosmology at that scale, but for some reason it would make me deeply uncomfortable if we ended up with a president some day who insisted the sun revolved around the earth.)')
