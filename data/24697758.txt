In Kakoune Normal mode you can select multiple selections, and your normal mode commands operate on all those selections at once, and if you switch to insert mode you can insert text at all of those multiple cursors.<p>This is why I switched to vis (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;martanne&#x2F;vis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;martanne&#x2F;vis</a>) after trying kak for a couple days (and previously being an nvim user). ^k and ^j add cursors directly above and below the current one, :x&#x2F;foo&#x2F; selects all occurrences of ‘foo’ in the current selection or (if there’s no current selection) file (this is based on the command language of Rob Pike’s `sam` editor, and foo can be a structural regex), and then you can manipulate them using standard vi bindings.')
