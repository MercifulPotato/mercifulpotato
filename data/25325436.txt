I began the deprecation process of SMS around 1999 with the first Blackberry which supported this awesome new thing called <i>e-mail</i>. E-mail is this FANTASTIC new thing that offers more than 140 characters, allows larger attachments. It works just like SMS, except you can receive them even if you change your SIM card while travelling! Your inbox moves with you from provider to provider! How COOL is that!<p>Seriously, nobody should ever require SMS in 2020. Kill that nonsense.')
