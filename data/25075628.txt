In a super quick search: &quot;From Feb. 2 through July 25, Illinois had officially recorded 10,252 more deaths than typically would be expected&quot; [1] =&gt; 59 per day. If 300 people died per day (your stat) and 5% of those were misattributed to COVID-19 because they were tested and happened to have a harmless COVID-19 infection (this is a silly upper bound), that&#x27;s only 15 misattributed out of the 59, so at least 75% are correct. That&#x27;s already good enough to use for setting policy IMHO. In reality, I doubt everyone who died was even tested, so I think more error lies in the other direction.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chicagotribune.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;ct-dataviz-coronavirus-covid-excess-deaths-illinois-20200828-llxjzyrnxnc5hjptuudce2t7ty-story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chicagotribune.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;ct-dataviz-corona...</a>')
