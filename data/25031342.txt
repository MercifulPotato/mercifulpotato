I max out at 40 WPM<p>I&#x27;m not running a production server (or anything else compute-intensive). I agree that Windows does the &quot;toy&quot; things better than Linux, such as web browsing, sleep handling, sound management, etc. These are &quot;appliance&quot; level tasks where Windows is definitely better.<p>That said, I wouldn&#x27;t even consider doing a full system build (takes about 3 hours on my fastest machine) on WSL. All I&#x27;m trying to do is enter 2800 numbered lines of text. The Windows machine was more portable so I chose to move it to the problem rather than move the problem to my office.<p>Now I&#x27;m continuing on WSL and trying to understand the faulting behavior.')
