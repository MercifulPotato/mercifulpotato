Either way there’s a reset.<p>But I don’t think either is inevitable, in all domains.  What we’ve actually observed with the banking system is that:<p>1) powerful monopolies&#x2F;oligopolies use their resources to capture the actual government and regulators, and use those entities to shape favorable laws, and to bail out the monopolies when they collapse, preventing the reset, and<p>2) even if the collapse and reset occurs, it causes far more damage and misery to the rest of the economy and society than to the people responsible for causing it.<p>All else equal I’d rather live in a society that simply prevents those extreme cycles by making natural monopolies into well-regulated public utilities.  Public utilities in the US have worked very well for a century, they’re a far more desirable economic arrangement for 99% of society.')
