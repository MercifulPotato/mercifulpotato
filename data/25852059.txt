This would be akin to reading Animal Farm and ignoring its allegory about Communism and judging it purely on its merit as a story about some animals staging a revolution. This is also like reading Shakespeare in high school without one of those copies that explain a lot of the jokes and references that aren&#x27;t obvious to the reading 500 years later.<p>Context is what gives art a lot of its power, the downside is that you need this context to understand it. I&#x27;m not a huge art person so I view most art superficially, but always enjoy when I get an opportunity to learn more.')
