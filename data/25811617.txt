Item(by='freedomben', descendants=None, kids=[25813021], score=None, time=1610898446, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25811215, text='Parler&#x27;s CEO was interviewed by Megyn Kelly on her podcast a couple days ago, and if what he said is true, AWS is not being truthful.  Of course we don&#x27;t know who is telling the truth, but Parler is asking to release all the correspondence between the two companies, and AWS will not consent.  It could very well just be standard legal best practice (since there is a lawsuit in progress), but it does give Parler some credibility.  As soon as there is evidence I will re-evaluate where I can stand (not that it matters of course, but to me personally it does :-)<p>Among the big mistruths from AWS alleged by Parler, Parler <i>does</i> do moderation.  They have a company principle of not surveilling every single thing their users do and vacuuming up data on them (which I would think most on HN would praise).<p>They have a group of about 600 moderators that review and take down reported posts.  Over the last couple months given the in flux of new users and violent content, they did develop some machine learning tools that would identify potential violent posts and send them to a moderator for pre-approval.  AWS told them <i>that wasn&#x27;t good enough</i>.  So Parler said, &quot;how about we just use AWS Rekognition, your own product?&quot;  To which AWS said, &quot;no, not good enough.&quot;  I wonder, what is &quot;good enough&quot; to AWS?  They clearly don&#x27;t apply the same standard to Twitter.<p>He also talked about how just a week prior the AWS rep was doing the standard AWS rep thing of, &quot;we love you, what can we do to get you deeper into AWS ecosystem?&quot;  Per Parler&#x27;s CEO, Amazon had previously been satisfied but suddenly after the capitol riot, nothing would satisfy them.<p>It&#x27;s remarkable to me how much disinformation there is out there over this.  Although after the CentOS disinformation fiasco, I shouldn&#x27;t be all that surprised.<p>I hope they release <i>all</i> of the correspondence soon so we can know who is telling the truth.  It is a matter of great consequence in my opinion.')
