I agree that this is less dramatic to report on than full-blown lockdowns enforced with police action. What picture do you put on the front page? A dad calming staying home and enjoying time with his kids? :) However, calling these measures &quot;herd immunity&quot; is misleading.<p>Also, even after eliminating the &quot;karensdag&quot; Sweden was in a way better welfare position than e.g. US, where worker were going unprotected and sick to work, for fear of losing their job.')
