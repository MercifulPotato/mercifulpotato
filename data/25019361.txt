In his first statements[1] in an interview on August 12th, 2017, he famously didn&#x27;t condemn white supremacists who murdered someone, saying instead that he condemns &quot;egregious displays of hatred, bigotry and violence <i>on many sides, on many sides</i>&quot;.<p>Then, several days later in the second interview[2] on August 15th that you linked to, he equates the violent white nationalists that murdered someone with what he calls the &quot;alt-left&quot;, the purported group that the murder victim belonged to, saying that he thinks there is blame on both sides. After asking for further clarification, he says that there were fine people on both sides. Only after further questioning, and in a separate statement, does he condemn white supremacists.<p>People were criticizing him for his initial equivocation on August 12th, comparing the white supremacists who murdered a person to the victims of their violence, and the fact that he didn&#x27;t name or condemn white supremacists. In fact, when journalists asked him to condemn them, he walked away from the interview. He refused to differentiate between the two.<p>Then, on August 15th, he defends his initial comments through his continued equivocations in the second interview.<p>It isn&#x27;t a hoax to criticize inappropriate equivocations, especially when it took him 4 days to muster out a condemnation, but still only after doubling down on the equivocations.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;the-fix&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;12&#x2F;trump-responds-to-charlottesville-protests&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;the-fix&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;12&#x2F;tr...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;15&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-alt-left-fact-check.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;15&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-alt-lef...</a>')
