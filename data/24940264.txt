It&#x27;s no different from a convention saying that IDs  1000XXX are for project A and IDs for 2000XXX are for project B, it&#x27;s just easier to read and distinguish like PROJA-0001 and PROJB-0001.<p>Obviously, you wouldn&#x27;t want to have things migrating between projects - but if that is even concievable for an issue to do, then the division in 2 projects was probably not correct and it should perhaps have been a single project. That is: the PROJA-0001 is as immutable and unchanging as 1000001 is.<p>A thing changing &quot;kind&quot; (e.g. a bug to a feature) doesn&#x27;t seem far fetched, and I&#x27;d be reluctant (Meaning I think it would be a flawed design) to use that as the public identifier prefix for a feature.')
