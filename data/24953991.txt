If they just do it, it will antagonize consumers. ATM, I doubt it&#x27;s worth it for Tesla.<p>Meanwhile, they <i>are</i> already selling software, and it seems pretty lucrative. Whether it&#x27;s taxing used car sales or voluntary upgrades, it&#x27;s all just software revenue. Unrepentant antifeatures are more of a &quot;late stage&quot; game.

Everything is becoming a hunk of metal running never software we don&#x27;t own.<p>IMO, the really unpopular moves are likely to come from traditional OEMs. They&#x27;re playing the game of tight margins and high volume.
