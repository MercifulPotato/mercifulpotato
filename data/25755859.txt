(And by extension, their &#x2F; our common processes.) Sure - the bridge metaphor doesn&#x27;t fully land because a collapsed bridge is visible immediately. But the security failure is <i>worse</i> because of how long it took to become visible.<p>I think the people defending the engineers involved have a mistaken idea of what the responsibility of the security team is. Their job description is not &quot;follow industry best practices&quot; or &quot;look for signs of a break in using their tools&quot;. Their job is to keep their company and customer&#x27;s data secure. At this job they failed.<p>I probably would have failed too, so I have some sympathy for everyone involved. There&#x27;s an open question of how we engineer our systems to make sure this never happens again. But none of that changes the fact on the ground that the security teams involved failed their responsibility to their businesses.')
