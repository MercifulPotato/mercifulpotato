Partly because of technical issues of getting the signal out of the layers of photosites, but also, I think, because of good ol’ Moore’s Law. (Or Dennard scaling, whatever.) Back in the days of 3-megapixel cameras, it would have mattered a lot to have every photosite be a full RGB capture, but now that we’re at such high resolutions, you’re pretty much always downscaling to display the image, so you don’t need that per-pixel perfection.<p>And, you can do tricks like sensor shift, where you pop a camera on a tripod and use the image stabilization mechanism to shift the sensor subtly to create a very high resolution sample.')
