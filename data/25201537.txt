The original term &quot;non-game game&quot; was coined by late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, who describes it as &quot;a form of entertainment that really doesn&#x27;t have a winner, or even a real conclusion&quot;.[1] Will Wright had previously used the term &quot;software toy&quot; for the same purpose.[2] The main difference between non-games and traditional video games is the lack of structured goals, objectives, and challenges.[3] This allows the player a greater degree of self-expression through freeform play, since they can set up their own goals to achieve.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Non-game" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Non-game</a><p>Will Wright is the designer of Sim City, and he deliberately called his creation this way. I think the above wikipedia distinction is spot on. I don&#x27;t think the term &quot;non-game&quot; is ideal, but I can&#x27;t think of any better one that&#x27;s short. Sandbox, entertainment software, etc. &quot;Sandbox&quot; doesn&#x27;t capture graphic novels. I think Will Wright also compared Sim City to a ball. You can play a game with a ball, you can invent some rules, but it&#x27;s not a game by itself.<p>Speaking of Minecraft, you can make a game within it, or out of it. But it&#x27;s not a fully fledged, &quot;batteries included&quot; game. Minecraft is very similar to Lego, and if you remove one dimension - even a painting set.<p>The term &quot;non-game&quot; is somewhat useful for me because I specifically look for games for my active entertainment. I&#x27;m annoyed when I have to wade through several quasi-games on a review site to find one proper game. I don&#x27;t necessarily think games in classical sense are inherently better or more challenging. But if the word &quot;game&quot; ceases to have any meaning on computers, someone will have to come up with a game2 term, which would be silly.')
