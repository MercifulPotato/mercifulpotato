It&#x27;s come a long way in FreeBSD, and I think is now quite clearly the best filesystem choice for nearly every workload.  ZFS on Root is super usable and easy to install now, and is great with an SSD mirror.<p>Highly recommended as something to learn and use, it&#x27;s obviously the best choice for a home built filer, but is also an excellent choice even for general purpose server use.  My colo setup is running FreeBSD w&#x2F; ZFS which is very stable for backending VPN servers, web servers and app servers of all stripes, etc.')
