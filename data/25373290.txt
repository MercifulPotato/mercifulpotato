I used PiMusicBox a few years ago and found it to be a very usable. If I remember correctly, the only reason I switched to volumio was because of the snapcast plugin, but I could have easily just not understood a similar option in PiMusicBox.<p>&gt;  I also like that they&#x27;ve refrained from using the word &quot;audiophile&quot;.<p>YES! That word seems to be thrown around a lot as a justification for upcharge and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re right about the support issues.')
