I am of course biased in talking mostly to people on the Julia Slack etc. who enjoy the language a lot and do interesting things with it.<p>That&#x27;s one of the reasons, though, why I never find the &quot;how many people are using it&quot; argument the most convincing when talking about the merits of a language. Because most people I&#x27;ve seen using R, Matlab and Python, at university or work for example, used it really superficially, and therefore wouldn&#x27;t have any interesting things to say about it. Neither do they add anything interesting to the respective ecosystems. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the first interest of a new language to get this type of user, although of course in the long term you want to build tools that are easy to be picked up and used by a wide audience, and number of users is some indicator of that.')
