Let me cite what I wrote 5 months ago in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23290800" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23290800</a> about Taiwan:<p><pre><code>   ----------- \n</code></pre>\nThe country has 23M inhabitants, most of them are clustered in a few densely populated metro areas (Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung–Changhua, Taoyuan–Zhongli, Tainan and Hsinchu). Taiwan had many daily flights to&#x2F;from China, including daily directs from Wuhan (stopped 31 December 2019). Taiwan is one of the world&#x27;s older countries (median age ~43). Taiwan permitted the docking of the Diamond Princess [2] and allowed passengers to disembark in Keelung (near Taipei), on 31 January, before the ship left for Japan. The ship was subsequently found to have numerous confirmed infections onboard. In reaction, Taiwan&#x27;s government published the 50 locations where the cruise ship travelers may have visited and asked around 600k citizens who may have been in contact with the tour group to conduct symptom monitoring and self-quarantine if necessary. None were confirmed to have COVID-19 after 14 days had passed. (The only advantage Taiwan had was that facemasks were widely used and even expected on public transport for years.) For all those reasons, Taiwan was at unusually high risk from Covid.<p>Yet, no lockdown.<p>No country managed the disease better than Taiwan. We should learn from Taiwan. See [1] for an analysis of Taiwan&#x27;s response from early March 2020.<p>It is interesting to reflect upon why most countries ignored Taiwan. The World Health Organization&#x27;s locking out Taiwan on China&#x27;s request is probably one reason. Is it the only one?<p>[1] C. Y. Wang, C. Y. Ng, R. H.
