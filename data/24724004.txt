Even on an older CPU with mediocre single-threaded perf (i7-5820K), I can run the game <i>fine</i> on high settings, 1080p (100-250fps), but it occasionally dips down below my 144hz refresh rate, which can be annoying.<p>And yeah, the GPU is never begged while playing, but multiple CPU cores definitely are.<p>Also, emulation is another big place where CPU bottlenecking is a thing. Look at Dolphin (Gamecube&#x2F;Wii), Citra (Wii U), and yuzu (Switch), they&#x27;re all CPU bound. Folks in the various subreddits will ask why their new GPU isn&#x27;t netting them a higher framerate, and it&#x27;s because the GPU is almost not even used (though in some cases with better graphical effects, shaders, etc. they can be beneficial)')
