Libc is a portability concern not because of linking but because it is a <i>worse-is-better</i>  compatibility layer. There isn&#x27;t just one example of it, and it straddles the boundaries of the language ecosystem and the operating environment. If I write C targeting WASM and try to call fopen(), the build system either has to say &quot;no&quot; somewhere along the way, or bamboozle me with a very specific interpretation of what I mean by that, effectively turning it into an unspecified interface. When a language builds on that foundation it gains temporary convenience but misses out on being more encompassing in its approach to compatibility.<p>Your statement only makes sense within a &quot;libc is just the standard&quot; worldview, which I believe contributes to the fragility problem by offloading compatibility into a series of &quot;good-enough&quot; measures instead of documentable specifications.')
