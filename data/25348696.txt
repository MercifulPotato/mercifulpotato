Item(by='Supermancho', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607449466, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25347545, text='&gt; But should the US government, given the current developments, ban Twitter and&#x2F;or Facebook?<p>Twitter and Facebook are blocked in China. Going from a philosophical question to a current policy question, the existing context has to be taken into account. There is no equivalent reason for banning the apps.<p>&gt; Because they are quite literally doing the same as TikTok.<p>I think they (Facebook&#x2F;Twitter) are doing very different things from Tik Tok right now. They are certainly a vector for the US states&#x2F;feds to mine and use data (as has been admitted and demonstrated). In the way the data is available to a government, there is an equivalence with Tik Tok.<p>&gt; Now, is TikTok spying for China?<p>I define spying narrowly. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s &quot;spying&quot; but the infrastructure of Tik Tok presents an information vulnerability to the USA, which represents a harm. This is the basis of my justification as I am making the distinction.<p>&gt; Either way, forcing TikTok hand is not a move made to protect US citizens.<p>I think it is a move that protects US citizens. The official justification is paper thin Trump revenge tactics (not racism, imo). Given, I give no credence to most of what Trump says, I don&#x27;t care about the justification anyway.')
