Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=[25870834], score=None, time=1611315606, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25870459, text='I like Telegram, but it would be much nicer if secret chats could be synchronised between devices.<p>The distinction isn&#x27;t just &quot;mobile&quot;.  Each mobile device a person uses has a separate secret chat, not synchronised with their other devices.<p>There&#x27;s someone I talk with on Telegram where we have <i>two</i> secret chats open all the time, one for their iPhone and one for their iPad.  Both channels are connected to my phone.<p>I have to guess which chat to write in for the other person to notice that I&#x27;m writing to them...<p>That&#x27;s because when using their iPad they often don&#x27;t have the iPhone nearby (no need for most purposes).  It&#x27;s lucky I don&#x27;t have two mobile devices too, as then we would have <i>four</i> secret chats.<p>When I&#x27;m at my computer, we can only use the non-secret Telegram chat, which has a nice GUI but unlike my phone cannot connect to either of the secret chats.  This isn&#x27;t really a problem because we use the non-secret chat for most topics anyway, because of the search and synchronisation.<p>(Aside, the ability for the other party to delete old messages in Telegram is not very cool imho.  I know someone who fell out with a friend and their friend deleted their entire multi-year conversation history, which was heartbreaking.  Once you have a long history of messages with someone I think it should be part of your personal archive to look back on.  It feels permanent until that point, so it&#x27;s a surprise to find it can all disappear.)')
