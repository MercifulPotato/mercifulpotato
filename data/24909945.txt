But, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed the &quot;next&quot; version is more about Vercel&#x27;s own internal business agenda. Promoted as amazing &quot;DX&quot; is not really true. It had a better DX compared to the other tools, that&#x27;s why it grew so popular, but not seeing anything real DX related in version &quot;10&quot;. Other tools are starting to do things a bit better.<p>Analytics, great idea, is a huge disappointment. It&#x27;s just a Vercel thing and not NextJS, not to mention a &quot;pro&#x2F;enterprise&quot; paid feature, not cheap either.<p>A few days ago I saw the YT videos of &quot;future of Svelte&quot; and that video was really about &quot;DX&quot; with no non-sense no BS that just focused on the real next evolution on web&#x2F;app dev. That DX really resonated with me.<p>My opinion, I&#x27;m not sold on NextJS 10, the &quot;commercial&quot; move kind of turned me off and scares me of platform lock-in, but I&#x27;m getting more and more interested into Svelte (v4?) and I&#x27;m seriously looking to switch to it from NextJS.<p>Note: &quot;DX&quot; stands for &quot;Developer eXperience&quot;, meaning how joyful, easy it is to get started with the tool and feeling productive.')
