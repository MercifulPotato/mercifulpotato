He likes things that benefits him, and condemns all things that don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s amazing that people can still with a straight face make these kinds of excuses for him.<p>&quot;I know your pain, I know your hurt&quot;<p>&quot;great patriots who have been badly &amp; unfairly treated for so long.&quot;<p>&quot;These Anarchists, not protesters&quot;<p>&quot;Disgraceful. Never seen anything like it. Thugs.&quot;<p>&quot;when the looting starts, the shooting starts&quot;<p>&quot;domestic acts of terror.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll leave it up to you to guess whom he&#x27;s addressing in each quote.')
