We prohibit child abuse precisely because it is a physical act. If I said &quot;I will whip my child 50 times&quot;, and didn&#x27;t do it, that would not be child abuse. It becomes child abuse once it is a physical act.<p>You make the faulty presumption that speech itself can be a form of abuse. This is where free speech absolutists such as myself would disagree. Speech is a protected class of expression precisely for this reason: it cannot be abusive.<p>To argue that child pornography is a form of speech is rather ridiculous, if we define speech as &quot;the communication or expression of thoughts in spoken words&quot;. A form of expression, sure, but there are limits on forms of expression. I cannot choose to stab people as a form of free expression, nor torch a building.')
