Critical hardware should not be user-configurable, especially not from remote. You would not leave the &quot;root console&quot; open to untrained personal, neither should it be opened to an untrusted network.<p>My feeling in this context is that security should not be a compromise of cost-efficiency and usability but a strict requirement. In days before the internet, somebody had to get on their truck and take a ride to the power plant station. That&#x27;s a whole different level of intention compared to &quot;just&quot; sending some mallisicous packets over the internet.')
