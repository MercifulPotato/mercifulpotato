I used to be at the same point, in my case logistics. I always came back to it, because quite frankly it is the only thing I am good at I can earn a living with. What helped for me, was two things:<p>1) See the logistics tasks I have as not &quot;my&quot; logistics, in other words getting some professional distance back I didn&#x27;t realize I lost<p>2) Do it really for someone else, in my case, I turned consultant of sorts. That supports point 1), it also means I have a client now who hired for a clearly defined, concret task. So in a way, I am not simply doing it for myself<p>Especially the &quot;not doing it for myself&quot; part helped a lot. It prevented me from burning because I am less personally invested. And it also means, by doing for someone else, that I have an outside goal I can &quot;serve&quot;.<p>Put in other words, not doing things because I want and I considered them cool solved my prioritiation issues. And doing for really someone else, solved my personal investment problem. For now at least.<p>EDIT: A hobby, how could I forget that. In my case, a 1982 Range Rover. Besides the engine and gearbox, I tore everything appart in the last 2.5 years. Never touched a car before that, so. Yeah, doing something completely different, completely new without the oal being money helped.')
