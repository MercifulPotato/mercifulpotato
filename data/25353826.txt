I think the only limitation with the Buds is the ability to stream to 2 sets of Buds at once, but that&#x27;s such a rare use-case and doesn&#x27;t really affect the experience in the same way as the quick switching between Apple device that comes with AirPods.<p>I wish I could have the Apple experience, but my hate for iOS is too strong. Otherwise, I love a lot of what they develop.')
