To my dismay, at my workplace I have to use MacOS because everyone uses iMacs which belong to the company and have no choice in that regard. This means MacOs is tied directly and non-trivially to my livelihood. My complaint of apple and what I percieve as shenanigans by Apple are due to that very fact that it is tied to my livelihood. Ofcourse you can say <i>switch jobs because you dont like the brand the company uses</i> and I will concede that as a somewhat valid point- but a reasonable person may look askance at the suggestion. We can agree it&#x27;s a stupid reason to plunge myself into financial uncertainty. There is a non-zero chance that there are others in my position and who must exercise the right if not courtesy to complain.<p>&gt; But for a certain segment of the non-Apple crowd, yelling consistently about their opinions is an odd recurrence.<p>There is a certain group which self identifies as <i>fanboys</i> which is their right and that group is not comprised of Windows or * nix users. This segment of <i>fanboys</i> I can assure is equally if not more vocal. Amusing if nothing else.')
