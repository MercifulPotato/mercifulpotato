It’s a change in dev methodology&#x2F;mentally and usually goes hand-in-hand with “trunk-based development” (trunk&#x2F;master is always stable and you should avoid long lived branches).<p>a good feature flag service should also allow you to do % rollout to try to de-risk the release of a new feature, some times even auto-closing the feature if some specific metric passes a certain threshold (e.g. dau dropped 10%, number of errors increased x%, etc)')
