Cryptocurrencies, Tesla, and penny stocks are the assets I absolutely won&#x27;t short, no matter how much I think they&#x27;re overvalued, because the low liquidity in them means that they can easily shoot up 10x and wreck your margin position even if you&#x27;re right.<p>(Disclaimer: Long Bitcoin, got in at prices between $6.5-8K in 2018.  Previously sold @$11K in Dec 2017, after having bought in 2014 at $800.  It tends to rise 10-40x from peak to trough each time, which means we could see $100-150K Bitcoin this cycle.  There&#x27;s also the chance that this is &quot;the big one&quot; - the cycle where the dollar collapses entirely and cryptocurrency becomes the new global unit of account and medium of exchange.  IMHO the tail risks facing the dollar and the U.S&#x27;s hegemonic position have never been higher.)')
