I&#x27;m London based and signed up for the waitlist in maybe September last year and then forgot about it - someone I know bumped me up at the weekend (which doesn&#x27;t cost an invitation). Within 2 days of my joining I&#x27;d say about 10 other people in my contacts have joined too. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s less big names and more FOMO.<p>Interestingly the person who bumped me up appears to have had an outsized effect on which rooms I see.')
