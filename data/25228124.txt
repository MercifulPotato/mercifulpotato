I never had visual impairment on that level from weed or alcohol.<p>Or when you see moving patterns on a wall, it does break one sence you as a human have a lot of trust for.<p>Our neighbor is an old lady who had cancer and apparently smells sometimes things which are not here. She doesn&#x27;t want to be crazy and doesn&#x27;t even accept that it can easily be nerve damage or whatever which makes her sometimes smell things which are not here.<p>Instead she thinks we and neighbors above her are trying to get her out of her flat. We are living in a very stable modern building, there is no realistic benefit of anyone to boot her out and walls are so thick, there is no noise issue at all. She still called the policies at least twice, had an expert here and was standing in our door twice angry and pissed of because we are creating that smell.
