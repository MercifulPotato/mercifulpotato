Multiple priority queues are nice in computer science, but managing them with time-sensitive vaccine doses is hard. Simple, imperfect and fast is better than perfect, complicated, and slow.<p>Getting a large swath of people vaccinated is more valuable than perfectly getting prioritization right. Prior to this change, NY was attempting to perfect prioritization, and was discarding many doses as they expired.')
