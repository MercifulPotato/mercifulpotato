It&#x27;s applied unequally, there is no recourse, and it merely serves to enforce the orthodoxy and drive dissent underground. Honestly it&#x27;s like the church in the middle ages. What a dystopian moment we&#x27;re living through when monopoly corporations wield that power in society.<p>Facebook specifically can go to hell. They&#x27;re making money by selling people&#x27;s precious time to advertisers at pennies on the dollar. Jewel thieves pawning stolen goods at 10% of their value is less wasteful to society as a whole. I know they don&#x27;t force anyone to use their services, but neither do the tobacco companies. They just get people addicted to their product. Just because it&#x27;s legal doesn&#x27;t make it ethical.')
