That would cost the state some attention for the benefit of a better chance in close elections at the top.<p>Twice in the past two decades, the Electoral College has gone red when the popular vote would have gone blue, by a nontrivial margin. That leaves an avenue open whereby some state&#x27;s legislators fall on their swords to fix that problem.<p>Whether it would stick is an open question -- they&#x27;d almost certainly face an angry campaign against them, and the swing back could undo it. So it&#x27;s unlikely. But there is a route by which it could happen, since the state&#x27;s benefit from the EC is mitigated by the distortion it causes.')
