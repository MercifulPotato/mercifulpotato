It&#x27;s an alternative to having a switch&#x2F;machine sit on the floor, not &quot;nobody needs to buy racks anymore&quot;. (And at least around here, &quot;racks for scrap value&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly common, or if it is it&#x27;s full-height ones with pickup only (or understandably expensive shipping))')
