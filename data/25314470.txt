Item(by='forest_dweller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607175584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311397, text='Scott Adams when talking to Sam Harris said there is &quot;two movies on one screen&quot;.<p>I consider myself a &quot;center-right liberatarian&quot;, however when doing political compass tests I come out right in the middle of the quad. I frequently try to _steelman_ the opposition.<p>So lets go through your examples:<p>&gt; * A stonetoss comic about the relationship between race and IQ. This was the top post on the page. It was posted by a user with the username &quot;NationalSocialism&quot;.<p>The Stonetoss comics I&#x27;ve seen pretty racist and usually contain anti-semetic tropes. So I will give you that one. No argument from me there.<p>&gt; * A comic caricaturing an asexual person who decries Christmas but celbrates a silly celebration of their own, supposed to show hypocrisy<p>There is a lot of people even on the left that believe a lot of people have replaced traditional religion with some other form of spirituality. Usually this person proclaims themselves to be an athiest and laments about traditional religion while claiming to be. It is a trope, but there I&#x27;ve certainly seen it and it is somewhat of a hypocrital position.<p>So I don&#x27;t see anything particularly wrong with this based on <i>your</i> description.<p>&gt; * A comic showing a caricature of a fat black woman shouting in a white woman&#x27;s face, and the white woman pushing her away. The title is &quot;At this point if a White woman looks at a Black wrong she is a &quot;karen&quot;&quot;<p>The person that posted it <i>could</i> be racist. However to give someone the benefit of the doubt from <i>your</i> description this is commenting on the <i>perceived</i> hypocrisy. Karen means &quot;entitled white woman&quot; and I&#x27;ve seen it used as an insult (to deflect from the actual issue) to a white women making a valid complaint about someone behaviour (and that person happened to be black woman).<p>&gt; * A post from the &quot;Controlavirus&quot; sub-forum, arguing that lockdowns mean life has lost its color. (One of the only non-caricature comic and reasonable posts I could see on the front page)<p>A lot of people are suffering due to the corona virus lockdown. My grandmother&#x27;s dementia has gotten worse because visits to her are very restricted due to the lockdown and it been very upsetting to my mother.<p>So out of the four examples you have given. Only one I would find objectionable based on <i>your</i> description. Whereas you have found 3 that are objectionable.<p>&gt; Even on a bad day, load up the Reddit front page and it&#x27;s nothing like this, even if you were to browse for hours, you wouldn&#x27;t see an endless stream of reductionist memes a 14 year old might find funny.<p>I find most of the content of the front page on reddit trite. It is full on worn out pop culture references, consumer culture nonsense, cute animals, strawmanning <i>right wing</i> politics and ideas and other crap that I am not interested in.<p>As for &quot;reductionist memes a 14 year old might find funny&quot;, most of the people that spend a lot of time online on these sites are younger. I&#x27;ve noticed as someone that is almost forty is that a lot of this is younger guys blowing off steam online because they are frustrated by their circumstances.')
