Looking at the settings now, I see in &quot;Home Networks-&gt;Subnets &amp; DHCP&quot; the [public subnet mode] is on. I haven&#x27;t had to deal with any EAP authentication (but again I may be forgetting!).<p>And IP Passthrough is off. Basically the modem is routing between the public and private subnets.<p>BTW, I do have a static IP block from AT&amp;T.')
