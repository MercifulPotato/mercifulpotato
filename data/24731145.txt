As IC declines, this will be freed. road-dust in places might be worth gathering??\nIn addition, the membranes will be in large facilities and are not consumed, although they need to be melted and made anew as sites get poisoned.\nI see batteries as the winners, with hydrogen as a niche - that said, even a niche is large on the global scale and once optimised, will be part of the overall process whereby we get rid of all IC engines')
