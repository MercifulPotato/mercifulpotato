My opinion is not currently, but opinions vary on this point. That said, if you&#x27;re a heavy Linux user with an interest in mobile you might want to pick one up... it really is a fantastic little portable Linux device.<p>Thanks!  That&#x27;s really helpful.  I&#x27;m really optimistic about the device since Pine64 does other (hopefully brisk) business, too.  I&#x27;m not necessarily opposed to modifying scripts and working through issues (Sailfish wasn&#x27;t really working all that well on my Moto G Falcon, to be honest), but my family will get annoyed if I can&#x27;t participate in group messaging.')
