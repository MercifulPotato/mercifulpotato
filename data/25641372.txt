Then steps at the end of the catwalk to get off it.\nThen have the steps and catwalk flip up during the day to give good access under the bed.  On the underside would be a divider running the length of the bed in the middle, separating the two halves.  Connected to that divider would be a good office desk on either side (so two people could work from home yet have their personal space).<p>I&#x27;m surprised that there hasn&#x27;t been a real advertising push for solutions such as this during the last year.
