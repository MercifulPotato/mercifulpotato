If ever I&#x27;m in doubt of someone&#x27;s design and I have an inkling of respect for them, I&#x27;ll try to design the code from scratch in my head, or sometimes even redesign a toy version myself. This usually surfaces some weird property of the problem that explains their code. You can also go through their thought processes and see exactly how they made decisions along the way. I&#x27;d argue you can even infer philosophical viewpoints in some cases, too - all without actually communicating with the author.<p>I love that about humans. One of the things I really admire about us.')
