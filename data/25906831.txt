They also offer some versions of competitive workouts. Where Aviron differs is our machines are built with dual magnetic and air resistance, this allows our machines to go to much higher resistance levels. For example, our strength programs will guide you through bicep curls and back rows where you are “lifting” 50+ Lbs. with each pull. A water rower on the other hand does not have variable resistance settings. \nAviron also incorporates fully animated video games that include being chased by zombies and throw backs to old school favorites like pong and brick breaker. If you&#x27;re interested we have a long-ish content video that goes into depth: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VN2PVuK73Xg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VN2PVuK73Xg</a>')
