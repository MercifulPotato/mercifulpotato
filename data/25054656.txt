The first bottle of multivitamin I found, &quot;Sundown Multivitamin Gummies&quot; has 800IU, which is additive with your diet. 4000IU is the upper limit (and 60,000IU per day has been shown to cause toxicity) I&#x27;ve seen people chow down on those gummies because they&#x27;re tasty. Not likely to hit, though.<p>The first Vitamin D supplement (Forest Leaf D3) I found is a once-weekly 50,000IU hum-dinger that provides on average double the safe upper limit.<p>Lastly, if folks at the poverty line are taking these sometimes expensive, often unnecessary supplements, could that money be better spent on other things?')
