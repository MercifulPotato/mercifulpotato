I think if you take the tiniest living organism and look at it under a microscope you won&#x27;t see it breaking down over time you&#x27;ll see it reproducing or eating or moving around. I think it does those things with greater frequency and on shorter time scales then it breaks down. And I&#x27;m pretty sure there are some tiny organisms that you know don&#x27;t break down at all.<p>But I&#x27;m not denying that breaking down and entropy is an almost universal fact of life for most of life.<p>and I agree that from an evolutionary perspective there&#x27;s no point repairing the body after the sort of population average procreation age. and in fact I think someone else mentioned in this thread that you know there&#x27;s some organisms that die immediately after procreating. And I&#x27;m also not disputing that repair mechanisms and things like telomeres have a genetic origin... that seems obvious.<p>However this sort of decay behavior and repair behavior is not universal there are some things that are a lot more durable but even if we assume that it&#x27;s universal,  i don&#x27;t think you can tell or I can tell whether, nor the extent to which, decay is a disease or genetically evolved solution to some problem that we don&#x27;t understand yet, or some complex interaction of the two.<p>The possibilities of some of the potential consequences of immortality have been discussed in this thread and people have proposed aging as a genetic solution to that, and an explanation for why agelessness which, on the face of it seems like it would be adaptive, has not evolved. So I honestly don&#x27;t think we know the degree to which aging or agelessness is genetic or is diseased, or a complex of both. And I don&#x27;t think your relatively simple, but still on some level convincing, example establishes that either way.')
