Item(by='ryukafalz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605299654, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25079246, text='P1 Gen 3 is 0.72&quot; x 14.24&quot; x 9.67&quot;, compared to the 2019 15&quot; MBP which is 0.61&quot; x 13.75&quot; x 9.48&quot;. Slightly larger? Sure, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it &quot;huge&quot; if the 15&quot; MBP is what you&#x27;re used to. It&#x27;s only 0.11&quot; thicker than the MBP and half an inch longer. (And it weighs less.)')
