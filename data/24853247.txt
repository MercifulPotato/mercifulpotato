If the rev share is too high so using the spectrum isn&#x27;t economical, the telco could simply not build out (and probably lose their license, which is OK for them, it wasn&#x27;t economical). If the prepaid price was too high, they still have to pay it from spectrum activities and other activities; but they probably can&#x27;t sell the spectrum to retire the debt, because the price was too high.')
