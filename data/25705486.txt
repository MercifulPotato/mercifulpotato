They may be able to calculate that including cameras and a computer on a car that will ship in high volumes would increase sales of their self driving option across all Tesla vehicles (including that low cost model) enough to justify the inclusion of those parts.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hx7BXih7zx8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hx7BXih7zx8</a>')
