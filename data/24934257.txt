Item(by='hinkley', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603998274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24912162, text='First, because TSMC was aiming for 1.8x and Apple only saw 1.49, and I expect that not to improve going forward.<p>Second, one of us is reading that number wrong. They said 1.49x, not 49%.<p>In any other conversation, 2x is reducing feature size by 50%. 3x is 1&#x2F;3 of the original, or reduced by 2&#x2F;3. That means 1.8 is 45% smaller, and 1.49 is 32.9%.<p>Similarly, if you cut the pitch of a circuit in half you should see 4x as many transistors. If you could keep shrinking the space between transistors while shrinking the transistor, then going from &quot;7&quot; to &quot;5&quot; node should have been a 1.96x factor for areal density, not the 1.8x they claim, or the 1.49x Apple achieved.<p>I&#x27;m not saying they screwed up. As soon as nodes stopped measuring literal transistor size, it wouldn&#x27;t take long for the names to be aspirational instead of descriptive. It&#x27;s something they can name the project early on when the set of potential tech has been selected and some estimates have been made. For building a team it&#x27;s fine. But I&#x27;m not on that team, I&#x27;m a customer (and current or former shareholder).<p>I think the consumer cares about the transistors per mm^2 (after the voltage and the instructions per second), not the node number. Especially when each foundry uses the same number to describe different densities.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to keep remembering that TSMC-7 = INTC-10. Numbers that are actual numbers, please.')
