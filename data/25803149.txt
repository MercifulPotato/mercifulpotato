That&#x27;s what it means when a handful of companies dominate most of the web and the web playing a dominant role in global economy.<p>We have very little real choice.<p>Occasionally people will pretend this is not so.  In particular those who can&#x27;t escape the iron grasp these companies have on the industry.  Whose success depends on being in good standing with these companies.  Or those whose financial interests strongly align with the fortunes of these dominant players.<p>I own stock in several of these companies.  You could call it hypocrisy, or you could even view it as cynicism.  I choose to see it as realism.  I have zero influence over what the giants do, and I do have to manage my modest investments in the way that makes the most financial sense.  These companies have happened to be very good investments over the last decade.<p>And I guess I am not alone in this.<p>I guess what most of us are waiting for is the regulatory bodies to take action.  So we don&#x27;t have to make hard choices. Governments can make a real difference. That they so far haven&#x27;t made any material difference with their insubstantial mosquito bites doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t hold out some hope they might.  One day.  Even though the chances are indeed very nearly zero.<p>What&#x27;s the worst that can happen to these companies?  Losing an antitrust lawsuit?  Oh please.  There are a million ways to circumvent this even if the law were to come down hard on them. \nThey can appeal, delay, confuse and wear down entire governments. If they are patient enough they can even wait until the next election - either hoping, or greasing the skids, for a more &quot;friendly&quot; government.<p>They do have the power to curate the reality perceived by the masses.  Let&#x27;s not forget that.<p>Eventually, like any powerful industry they will have lobbyists write the laws they want, and their bought and paid for politicians drip them into legislation as innocent little riders.<p>We can&#x27;t vote with our clicks.  We really can&#x27;t in any way that matters.<p>That being said, I also would like regulatory bodies to step in and do something about it.  To level the playing field.  If nothing else, to create more investment opportunities.')
