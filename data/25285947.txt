Chrome up until recently would honour revocations via Group Policy, but Firefox would not.<p>Google uses CRLSets in Chrome for CA revocation, but <i>good luck</i> getting them to accept your Intermediate CA key that was compromised!<p>Now Google is going down the same selfish path: Because Google doesn&#x27;t need Enteprise PKI -- because none of their products are used extensively for private networking -- they&#x27;re more than happy to break hundreds of millions of deployed Windows private networks. Who cares, right? That&#x27;s the <i>competition!</i><p>&quot;Do not be evil&quot; was removed, remember?')
