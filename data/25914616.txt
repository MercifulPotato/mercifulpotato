I was living in Paris and taken there by friends - who didn&#x27;t explain the concept to me in advance.  So I found myself in someone&#x27;s house, with a massive buffet table and was expected to help myself - there was then a long conversation with my friends about what was going on.  Much incredulity on my part :-)<p>I met Jim very briefly - I guess I was one of hundreds of new people he meets every month.  Mostly I hung out with other guests - who were mostly expats (I didn&#x27;t hear much French) - and who also didn&#x27;t know Jim very well.<p>He definitely stepped outside the box with this idea.  This is something almost anyone with a big house could do in any place, but which only he actually did.')
