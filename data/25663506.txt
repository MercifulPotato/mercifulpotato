Now, tell me what&#x27;s the difference between the claims that have signed affidavits and accusations of someone committing a rape that make the former not meeting the basic criteria of viability, whereas the latter does meet them?<p>&gt; The mere signing of an affidavit doesnâ€™t create a perjury dispute that a court needs to resolve if there are no perjury charges offered.<p>Sure, but if actions of one of the two parties lead to the constitutional crisis, the court had better investigate which side is the lying one, don&#x27;t you think so?<p>&gt; It would only be required for that if a prosecutor was charging them for perjury.<p>And to establish whether there was a perjury, you need to investigate it through a formal process of hearings and other elements of the due process.<p>&gt; There were plenty of hearings<p>Dismissing the case is not hearing of the case, there were other hearings related to the matter, but not the legal hearing of the case with witnesses attending and being interrogated.')
