Every one of us who&#x27;s jumped into a question about something they&#x27;re working on and had the other person say &quot;I don&#x27;t understand the context&quot; has done this.<p>The opposite is what makes great teachers, authors, and other communicators great: they recognize what the other person doesn&#x27;t understand.')
