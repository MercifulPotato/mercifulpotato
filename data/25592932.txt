We had a &quot;card&quot; where librarian would stamp the date. Books had a paper on the back where they would stamp the issue date and return date.<p>It was trivial to know when you had to return a book. Is this done differently in Germany?<p>I like the app but I believe people won&#x27;t buy&#x2F;subscribe to an app that helps you only if you forget to return a book in time. Most people will believe they will return it in time and won&#x27;t invest in this type of &quot;insurance&quot;.<p>Libraries might be more interesting customers but they have little reason to reduce late fee bills as it is extra income to them. You could&#x2F;should look whether university&#x2F;free libraries are interested.<p>Hope you enjoy working on it.')
