Horribly pissed at Google to this day. I thought I knew what I was getting except they literally turned features off after I got it (e.g. video hangouts). Their rational was dumbass that it drained too much battery .. the fix .. turn off the feature. Seriously?? They did not open up the SDK fully after they stopped dev&#x2F;pivoted to enterprise .. maybe if some form of this tech takes off one day, I can sell it as a collector&#x27;s item.')
