A different example might help us communicate:<p>&gt; &quot;Hey guys, that relatively new way of dealing drugs is no longer a misdemeanor, now it&#x27;s a felony.&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;But isn&#x27;t using drugs already a felony?&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;... yes, they already have a law to go after users; this new law just reclassifies the type of crime it is for cartels offering drugs.&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;m not talking about the new bill. If it&#x27;s already illegal they don&#x27;t need another law to go after the users.&quot;<p>No laws have changed for consumers. I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re trying to say, please clarify.')
