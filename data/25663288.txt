The original poster uses gift cards going for higher than face value on eBay as evidence of money laundering. I am pointing out that on eBay there is a demand for gift cards from buyers whose payment method is accepted by eBay but not accepted by gift card vendor. Those buyers may be located elsewhere in the world but want to use that vendor’s content or services, so they buy gift cards and use them as primary way of payment. eBay sellers respond to that demand by setting higher prices for gift cards.')
