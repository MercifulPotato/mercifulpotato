Red Bull have built a car they believe is the fastest they can build. Verstappen is able to extract the most from that. If Albon doesn&#x27;t &quot;prefer it&quot;, then that&#x27;s his failing, a failing that Verstappen demonstrably does not have.<p>&gt; On top of that Verstappen being the lead driver means that alot of engineering effort is geared towards giving him specifically the car he needs, with his teammate having to adapt within that framework.<p>Why is he the lead driver? Because he&#x27;s a generational talent.')
