Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610501762, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25755876, text='&gt; If a single worker is 10 times more productive he can ask for 10 times the salary.<p>This is only true if very few workers are 10 times more productive.  If many workers are 10 times more productive, then the supply of labor has increased 10x and unless there is a corresponding increase in the buyers of labor, the price of the labor will go down.  Which is what has happened in real life.<p>Low income jobs pay low income because the buyers of that labor are not willing to pay much and the supply of labor is high for that type of work.<p>I believe the rest of your comment does not apply to state and city governments in the US, since only the federal government can print money.  For state and city governments, their tax base and therefore potential economic growth&#x2F;future tax income can move away.')
