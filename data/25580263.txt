They had a titanium powerbook g4 close by. It was an order of magnitude more expensive. (I think about 8500 DM &#x2F; 4300 Eur vs 1100 DM &#x2F; 600 Eur). My laptop was garbage, of course, but the other one was a few months of my salary at that time.\nI bought a Powermac 12&quot; a few years later, but the price was much more reasonable then. Loved that machine.')
