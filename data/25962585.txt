Also, you don&#x27;t want to be the only remote person. When you interview for a position, interview _them_ as to how remote work actually works there. Entrenched remote companies with a culture that&#x27;s battle hardened for that kind of work environment is a way better opportunity than a place that &quot;does remote now post covid&quot;.<p>Pro: Your money goes farther than your peers in an awfully expensive place.<p>Con: Cost of living tiers are more of a thing so the gap isn&#x27;t as big as you might think. What states the company already &quot;does business in&quot; limit their ability to pay you &#x2F; onboard you easily.<p>Interview enough to know what you are worth, loyalty has it&#x27;s benefits but don&#x27;t get abused, once you have a solid work history of being effective remote engineer &#x2F; leader -- you&#x27;re golden.<p>Never quit learning and make sure you know what keeps you valuable as the years add up. :)')
