You can do whatever the hell you want.<p>On the other hand result of this is the code represents basically how you think about the problem. Which would be very different for every person.<p>Languages with frameworks like Java+Spring, Ruby+Rails etc. are less &quot;fun&quot; to work with because you are not given so much freedom and likely have to fill in a lot of stupid, mundane boilerplate, but are easier to maintain in team setting because developers know more or less what to expect from the code. Very likely developers come with that knowledge and if you know one Spring application you know how to move around almost any Spring application.')
