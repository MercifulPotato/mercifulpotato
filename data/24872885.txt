General relativity, the initial quantum mechanical theories, Dirac’s equation and anti-particles, neutrinos were all the product of this process of adding mathematical conveniences and extrapolating to things that turned out to be real. You can argue that more recent efforts in this direction have been much less successful than those were, but I think you have to turn a completely blind eye to the history of modern physics to claim that method “has not really worked too often”.')
