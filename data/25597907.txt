I always thought controversial &quot;+&quot; badge is an alternative validation system outside of points. Not validation in terms of karma&#x2F;points but contribution. I guess HN equivalent would be highlighting dead comments brought back via vouch. Should even be default sort option for topics that gets suppressed due to inflammatory subject matter, or maybe have comment threads with most controversial index be pinned at top.')
