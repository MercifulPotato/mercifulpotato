For instance, dendrite.matrix.org is currently sitting at 480MB of RAM, despite being in ~5000 rooms spanning ~150K users.<p>* Matrix is coherent no matter what clients you use, given there is only one version of the spec (and as it happens, we haven&#x27;t broken backwards compatibility yet).  Sure, some implementations might not have implemented all the features, but the features they <i>do</i> implement (assuming they&#x27;re not buggy) will work reliably with any other client or server out there.<p>It&#x27;s fine to dislike Matrix and pine for XMPP, but please don&#x27;t spread FUD.')
