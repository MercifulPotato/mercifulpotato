Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.<p>I mean wearing my programmer goggles it doesn&#x27;t state privacy AND correspondence but OR, but still. Not having your personal conversations get intercepted is not too much to ask for, is it?<p>I mean I get it, if they have a reasonable suspicion they CAN intercept your communications (listening devices, intercepting the phone conversations), but this is not a right they can claim on anyone, and they shouldn&#x27;t be able to force companies to allow them to listen in. Not arbitrarily anyway (see: Snowden revelations, where it was proven that the NSA just hoovers up anything and retroactively checks if there&#x27;s anything wrong in there)')
