For various reasons [1] I feel that inappropriate humor shouldnâ€™t be used in public workplace channels. Because of that it feels a bit weird for me to send or receive a link to a product that includes a sexual innuendo on its landing page.<p>[1] At the risk of stating the obvious: If the majority of the team or if a person in a position of power starts making inappropriate jokes (here: sexual innuendos), then people in the minority or people with less power may feel uncomfortable and it may be difficult for them to stop this kind of thing.')
