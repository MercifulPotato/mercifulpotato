Item(by='seanwilson', descendants=None, kids=[25719819], score=None, time=1610302311, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25717345, text='&gt; When I asked stripe how we can handle taxes they just told me to use another Saas to do the tax calculating for me.<p>Do you know if most people actually do this? I feel like they don&#x27;t because I hear about Stripe a lot but never how people handle tax.<p>&gt; Sure paddle takes away like %10-20 from each payment for their service but it really saves stressing over taxes and other things.<p>Just to clarify for others, but it used to be 5% + $0.50 for Paddle fees and Paddle take out the country specific tax (which they don&#x27;t have a choice in) before sending anything to you, leaving you the rest.<p>So payments from e.g. the US to the UK you won&#x27;t lose anything extra to tax but from EU countries to the UK the VAT ranges from about 15% to 25% depending on the country (and these tax rules are always changing, but Paddle deal with this for you).')
