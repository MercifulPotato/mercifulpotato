Imagine these giants coming down if it turns out that online ads aren&#x27;t effective?<p>Just because Google and Facebook are able to make a profit off their ads doesn&#x27;t mean that their ads are actually good value and not overpriced, nor that the people in charge of assessing the ROI of these ads are incentivized to look into it (which is the point I&#x27;m arguing in the thread you linked). You can very well agree that online ads <i>are</i> effective but still aren&#x27;t worth what they are currently priced at.')
