If you used a term like &quot;ancestral region(s)&quot; or something, it might&#x27;ve been less triggering.<p>Firstly, the word &quot;homeland&quot; is not one <i>typically</i> associated with one&#x27;s country of ancestry. I&#x27;ve rarely ever heard someone use that term. On the contrary, I have heard people say &quot;my ancestors came from X country&quot;, or like &quot;my great-grandparents came from Italy&quot;. The term &quot;homeland&quot; is usually used for the region where a person&#x27;s current home is. And this not to mention that even a first-generation immigrant who has lived in X country for a long time, could consider X country to be his true homeland.<p>Secondly, there&#x27;s an implicit assumption here that &quot;Africa&quot; is the &quot;homeland&quot; of African Americans. I don&#x27;t need to explain why that&#x27;s troubling.<p>Thirdly, many of my &quot;African American&quot; friends are of thoroughly mixed ancestry. One such friend did a 23andMe test, and it turned out he had 54% European ancestry (even though physically &quot;he looks black&quot;), 30-something% African ancestry, and a smattering of other ancestry groups (including Native American) for the rest. It would be inaccurate and inappropriate to consider him as someone &quot;of African ancestry&quot; (even though he looks somewhat so). The phenotypes a person&#x27;s genome expressed do not necessarily correspond to a person&#x27;s actual genetic ancestry.<p>I could go into more reasons as to why it&#x27;s not a great term to use, but I think these three reasons make a good case.<p>----<p>&gt; get a lump sum, if they start a business or invest in land<p>While the underlying motivation behind your idea is pretty decent (and a fairly lofty goal I might add); I, for one, would rather prefer direct foreign aid (not loans, but literal foreign aid grants with no expectation of return). There&#x27;s too much of a risk of corruption with your idea, and bad incentives are baked right into it. Just increase the current foreign aid to developing countries across the board. Do something like the Marshall Plan, where in exchange for free-market economic policies, we directly invest in education, infrastructure, and other things in developing countries.<p>On a secondary note, <i>domestically</i>, I would rather focus on just getting some kind of actual, concrete, meaningful (<i>maybe financial</i>) reparations bill passed through Congress. That alone seems like a huge and almost insurmountable political challenge, and I want to see that tackled somehow. We want to improve the quality of life and <i>access to opportunity</i> for the poorest economic classes in the US, so they can pursue their ambitions and dreams from a similar starting point as more well-off Americans. Achieving this alone would be a <i>huuuge deal in and of itself</i>.')
