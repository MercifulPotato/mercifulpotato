At multiple points Keller straight up roasted him for the kind of questions he asked. One of them is one of my favourite roasts to date, where Fridman asks him what achievement he is most proud of (is this a phone interview for a junior position??) and Keller pretty much laughs at the question and tells him he has kids.')
