Item(by='tikej', descendants=None, kids=[24955433], score=None, time=1604172007, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24953145, text='Wow, thanks a lot, those are very valuable tips!<p>Regarding part about contracts. I live in Europe, so I&#x27;ll look into local code about agreement between architect, owner and contractor. I suppose they are quite a lot differences between USA and Europe (not to mention European countries themselves).<p>Generative design is very interested for me as I am generally into optimisation problems. Ability to interact with design programatically is also first priority. I&#x27;ll look into Rhino + Grasshopper. It looks nice, but as I mentioned in other comment I&#x27;d prefer my tools to be free if I&#x27;m going to learn them (I generally think that 3D&#x2F;parametric drawing is becoming important skill nowadays, even outside architecture&#x2F;engineering). I also have an engineering physics degree, so writing a solver for some building physics is not out of the scope, therefore my bias towards FreeCAD.<p>I surely understand that cost of switching would make it a loss if standard fee is applied. Billing hour is absolutely fine by me. Thanks for the tip about getting contractor and architect on board early and together.<p>To add some details I have the site and I&#x27;m not in a hurry at all, since there is already one house on that property, already built. I also have rough idea how it should be placed, look and function. At the moment it&#x27;s more of a hobby project than true need to build a house.')
