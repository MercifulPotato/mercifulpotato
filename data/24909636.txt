He&#x27;s more controversial when he&#x27;s speaking well outside of his domain which he does all the time.<p>He got into politics because U of T was ready to fire professors for not engaging in compelled speech (E.G. Not using somebodies preferred pronoun &quot;Xir&quot; or &quot;Ze&quot; even if you use their preferred&#x2F;legal name &quot;Betty&quot; and avoid misgendering) based on a misinterpretation of Canadian law supplied by the Ontario Human Rights Commission (later quietly corrected).  The initial dispute quickly spiralled into self-parody in one debate where fellow professor A.W. Peet admitted to forgetting WHICH gender-neutral pronoun their friends use and suggested programming peoples pronouns into your contacts <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;SiijS_9hPkM?t=356" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;SiijS_9hPkM?t=356</a>.  The Canadian government later introduced a 3 gender system for IDs and the American Psychological Association recommended the usage of singular &quot;They&quot;.<p>Yet Petersons amateur input only added to public confusion over the law, the controversy prompted him to only say more controversial things about gender, and he became this alt-right symbol whose fanbase holds far more extreme anti-trans views than he ever did.  If he just stuck to psychology and ripping off Joseph Campbell he would be a lot less controversial and a lot less famous.')
