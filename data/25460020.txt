From that perspective it doesn&#x27;t really matter which seller is the one at fault. Buying from that shady seller won&#x27;t get you a worse product, or even necessarily worse service. It&#x27;s just that the product overall is likely of worse quality than what the other reviews might indicate, regardless of which seller you buy it from.')
