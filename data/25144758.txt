We literally chirp louder than any bird ever could. Lots of diseases simply wouldn&#x27;t exist today if we didn&#x27;t learn how to medicate and operate, because those diseases would have killed off those humans prone to them, and only &quot;immune&quot; humans would survive. Etc.<p>So in the early days when Homo Sapiens were not the only beings headed towards our modern (evolved) form, there probably were vastly different mortality rates depending almost solely on that scaling equation. There probably still is today, but more or less nature forcibly trying to maintain that 3&#x2F;4 ratio.<p>I&#x27;m only speaking in re evolution since you mentioned that, because otherwise you&#x27;re spot on.')
