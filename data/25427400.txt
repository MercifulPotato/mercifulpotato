And they left behind people that didn&#x27;t.<p>No, they didn&#x27;t. Some moved here by choice, others had no choice but to move where opportunities are, and many were born here as a consequence of their parents being here.<p>The latter point is of particular note. It is not at all uncommon for first-generation Americans to be torn between their parent&#x27;s ideologies, values, and culture, and those of the rest of the population. The result is a unique perspective, or put another way, &quot;diversity of thought&quot; regarding many issues.<p>Anyway, I appreciate the conversation.')
