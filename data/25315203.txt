Item(by='hyperpallium2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607182028, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25315018, text='I know &quot;staying away from people over 55&quot; seems logical, but it hasn&#x27;t been possible in practice to segregate by age. The problem is transistive closure.<p>For example, in aged-care homes, the workers live in the general community, and if the virus is in the community, they get it and pass it on. Could the workers be segregated, in a bubble with the aged-care home? Their outside life would be cut off: the above social&#x2F;services&#x2F;supplies. Should their own families be with them in the bubble - or cut off from them? Where do you draw the line? Can it be drawn?<p>This same issue of transistive closure occurs for all over 55. Everyone is connected, and an epidemic follows those connections. This has been better put:<p><pre><code>  No man is an island entire of itself; every man \n  is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; \n  if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe \n  is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as \n  well as any manner of thy friends or of thine \n  own were; any man&#x27;s death diminishes me, \n  because I am involved in mankind. \n  And therefore never send to know for whom \n  the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.</code></pre>')
