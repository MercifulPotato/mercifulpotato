I doubt the solar business or grid batteries are particularly profitable, but it’s the same Apple vs Samsung song and dance.  Outsourcing everything means you’re sharing profits with your suppliers and have little leverage over your competitors.<p>That’s not to say they can or will do all of that profitability.  Tesla’s self driving tech could fall behind rendering a massive investment worthless.  But, the numbers aren’t so high it’s impossible for them to be a great investment just IMO unlikely.')
