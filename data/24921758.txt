At Wikimedia we want to be welcoming to new contributors. We also have to consider the on-boarding  experience of new staff members, as well as the productivity of staff and long-time contributors. Gerrit satisfies some people who have used it for a long time but it is almost universally disliked by newcomers. When your users are volunteers, you can&#x27;t force them to use Gerrit until they get used it it. If the experience is bad enough then they will choose to spend their time on something else instead.')
