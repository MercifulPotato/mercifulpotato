It&#x27;s not as strict or drastic here in Berlin. For a 9-6 office job, I&#x27;d say people leave for lunch between 12-13.<p>What I&#x27;m thinking of in the Nordics, or Finland especially since I haven&#x27;t worked in the other ones, are the two coffee breaks that are part of the work day. I&#x27;ve worked in construction and the aforementioned tech internship, and this is roughly how the day looks (offices tend to start one hour later):<p>- 06:50: arrive early, banter, coffee\n- 07:00: day beings\n- 09:15: first 15min coffee break\n- 11:30: lunch break\n- 14:15: second 15min coffee break\n- 15:30: day is over<p>I may be off by 15 minutes for the coffee breaks, it&#x27;s been over a decade since I worked outside of the tech startup bubble.<p>Not sure how things are in Finnish startups, probably slightly different? I miss these &quot;natural&quot; breaks though. On the other hand, I do enjoy having my coffee while working as well. :&#x27;)')
