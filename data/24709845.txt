Item(by='quietbritishjim', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602088141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24708162, text='There are really two &quot;flips&quot; that are often talked about with a mirror:<p>1. It flips things in the direction perpendicular to the mirror. If you&#x27;re facing a normal wall-mounted mirror then that means it flips your &quot;forward&quot; into your &quot;backwards&quot;. This is a real physical effect that no one would normally dispute.<p>2. It appears to flip things left to right, and most people (before mirror-flipping enlightment) would reasonably believe this. But it&#x27;s a human psychological effect, not a real physical one.<p>This article is about the second point. You&#x27;re talking about the first point. The placement of the mirror is a red herring: even with a ceiling mounted mirror, if you show a piece of paper to it by putting it above your head in the natural unenlightened way and look up, you&#x27;ll find the text is still flipped left to right. In fact it maybe even emphasises the illusion because you can turn to face any direction (and without thinking you&#x27;ll turn the piece of paper too of course) and still see the same effect!<p>(BTW I upvoted your comment because it&#x27;s not the only comment to post this mix up - but it seems to be the first - so I think it deserves a bit of visibility for others thinking the same thing.)')
