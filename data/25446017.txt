Above all, your money likely goes to salaries and pension plans for CEOs and upper management.</i><p>This is simply incorrect. The Mozilla Foundation is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization, which have strict laws delineating how they are allowed to spend money. &quot;Education&quot; is one endeavor where charities can spend money, which IIRC is where most of the foundation money goes: to educating people about the web and web development. Notably, &quot;software development&quot; is <i>not</i> an endeavor for which such a charity can spend its funds. Donations don&#x27;t go to Rust, or even Firefox, because they legally can&#x27;t.<p><i>&gt; As to TFA&#x27;s point about &quot;sitting on the table to decide about web standards&quot;, that also hasn&#x27;t worked out. It hasn&#x27;t helped to keep &quot;web standards&quot; in check, nor did Mozilla&#x27;s own contributions become part of them.</i><p>This is also simply incorrect. Enormous swaths of the web spec have been authored by Mozilla representatives, and we can point to plenty of instances where Mozilla has torpedoed proposals from other organizations (e.g. WebSQL, PNaCL).')
