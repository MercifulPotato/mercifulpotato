Item(by='KozmoNau7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612093205, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25977831, text='I try to follow a similar path of buying local or at least from EU-based companies, organic where possible, and generally keep that in mind when buying something, plus try to look for second-hand whenever possible. Why would I buy a brand new amplifier and speakers or a brand-new bicycle, when the second-hand market is <i>brimming</i> with quality gear?<p>I also vote for the parties with the strongest climate and environmental policies, which is generally the most left-wing parties, so that also fits with my own views on most other things.<p>But like you, my consumption in general is very low, so even if &quot;vote with your wallet&quot; did work as advertised, it wouldn&#x27;t be doing much at all, an absent vote is a much less powerful signal than an actively cast vote.<p>So I donate to worthy causes and try to argue my views online and encourage people to reduce the consumption, for what good that does.<p>We <i>must</i> turn this consumerism ship around, somehow.')
