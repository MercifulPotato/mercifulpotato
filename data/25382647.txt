You go from &quot;humongously phat cable&quot; to &quot;really phat cable&quot;.  The problem remains.<p>Also remember that the cost of the petroleum distribution infrastructure is shared between in-town drivers and road-trip drivers.  If these &quot;fast chargers&quot; are only supposed to be used by people who need more than one batteryful of driving in a given day (i.e. people on a road trip), the budget available to pay for the refueling infrastructure is going to be tiny compared to the petroleum infrastructure.  EVs will simply never &quot;catch on&quot; for non-commuter use if we go down that road.')
