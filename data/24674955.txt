As you say, it&#x27;s dominant for data science... but recently it and R were the <i>only</i> practical choices... now other languages (Julia, for example) are valid options. The development of alternative Jupyter (formerly IPython) kernels has accelerated adoption of other languages. Similarly, a few years back it seemed like Flask and Django were vastly dominant frameworks for building APIs, now similar frameworks exist in tons of languages. None of this is to imply that Python is anywhere close to dead, but my personal opinion is that &quot;peak Python&quot; is behind us.')
