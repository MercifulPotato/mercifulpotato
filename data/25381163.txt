I&#x27;ve used AirBnB 3 times and have a really good positive experience. But I&#x27;ve read stories about AirBnB hosts (players) that are really horrible. I feel sorry for the guests (probably a small percent) but now AirBnB can and should spend more resource to really fix it as much as possible.')
