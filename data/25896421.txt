It is not specifically about embedded, just more systems and low level than working with (as opposed to implementing from scratch) APIs, workers, queues, DBs.<p>To rephrase the original question: it is not easy to imagine an &quot;Agile&quot; approach to a kernel&#x2F;network or other kind of systems programming. I would be glad to know there is a chance for a more natural, R&amp;D driven development and bit less fuss about corporate &quot;values&quot;.<p>Thanks guys.
