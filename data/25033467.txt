Though it had to start somewhere and I am glad Purism started that. There are many many smaller and bigger things which went into Android or iOS which will need to be re-done from scratch and things like Google Pay probably won&#x27;t ever be on such a device. Camera will probably be quite bad, etc. On the other hand, there is Andbox which should partly fill in the app gabs in the meantime.')
