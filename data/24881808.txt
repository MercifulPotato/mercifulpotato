Item(by='ayewo', descendants=None, kids=[24882579, 24882209], score=None, time=1603572147, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24881140, text='In the long-term, I think blockchains will make a major showing in the design of self-driving vehicles (SDVs).<p>For SDVs to really take off, it needs to surpass the safety of a human driver but the only way to do this reliably in a way that avoids the high costs and ugly protrusion of roof-mounted LIDARs is for SDVs to use low-cost internal sensor inputs and fallback on low-cost external sensor outputs from nearby vehicles[§] and road infrastructure.<p>Essentially, what I think is missing from all SDVs currently in development today is an important ingredient behind why Internet-use is so widespread today: a common communication protocol between SDVs from different manufacturers.<p>Once a common protocol is adopted&#x2F;legislated, all SDVs will be expected to record any accidents encountered during any trips in a partial copy of the “road blockchain”. Stated differently, details of accidents and near misses will be recorded with timestamps on the partial blockchain maintained by each SDV in a way that the exact position of all SDVs within the vicinity of a car crash can easily be reconstructed. Of course this will mean SDVs will use clocks that are network synced.<p>If 6 cars are in the vicinity of a crash between 2 cars, the trajectory of all cars before and after the crash could be reconstructed using the blockchain data from those 2 cars. If the 2 cars’ “black box” are lost due to them exploding on impact, the data could still be reconstructed using the partial blockchain data from the 6 SDVs proximate to the crash.<p>The “road blockchain” would be especially useful in accident investigations but its privacy implications would need to be properly thought out.<p>§: If a SDV has front sensors that start to return conflicting inputs while in operation due to inclement weather for instance, rather than the onboard computer aborting the ride in the middle of nowhere, it could switch to operating at partial instead of full situational awareness. In this state it could routinely query any three nearby vehicles for help: the vehicle in front, behind it &amp; to its left to regain some level of situational awareness.<p>Another use case would be falling back on wireless beacons when Internet access over cellular is lost. The SDV could start an adhoc network over wireless where it can broadcast a request for help from nearby SDVs. Something like: “I’m traveling from LA-SF. I need a recent copy of the point cloud from anyone traveling in the opposite direction (SF-LA)”.<p>For this to work at scale, a common protocol that allows a SDV to start a wireless conversation with any nearby SDVs would be required.')
