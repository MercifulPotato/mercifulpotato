I have switched to Mac Mini M1 and bought Logitech StreamCam for ~Â£150. It sucks in every possible way: focus does not work properly in any conditions except natural daylight, CPU expensive, additional meaningless software for basic features, etc.\nNow, I miss the MacBook camera. Yes, it is 720p, but do I need more for my meetings? Nope. It just works. The quality is acceptable, no problems with any applications&#x2F;web-tools, plays well with system resources, etc. If we are talking about &quot;Zoom me&quot; cameras, I would prefer the MacBook&#x27;s one. If we are talking about YouTube streamers, etc., then it is a bit different area, and yes, MacBook&#x27;s camera will not help with this.')
