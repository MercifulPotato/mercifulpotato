I chose to become a manager because I enjoy the people aspect of it. I see my primary responsibility to help my teammates be successful and deliver high quality products.<p>I considered taking a path through architecture but chose management because I felt like I could have a larger positive influence. As an architect I could design a few good software solutions but as a manager I can help coach a group of people who each go on to make great designs.<p>I do miss coding but I try and make up for it by setting aside time to pair program with teammates and perform “shadow PRs” (PRs that I review but don’t approve that I follow up with to see if there are things I missed that the team picked up on or vice-versa. I also set aside 2-4 hour per week of personal time to keep my skills sharp. I’m a firm believer that a software development manager should retain some technical chops.<p>Here are the values I try and live by as a manager:<p>1. Take less than your fair share of the credit and more than your fair share of the blame.\n2. Commit yourself to the success of your team and your own success will follow.\n3. Be transparent and honest.\n4. Don’t be afraid to admit when you’re wrong.\n5. Be decisive.')
