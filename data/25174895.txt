You hit the nail on the head. I&#x27;ve seen this dogmatic attitude as well, as if following how Anki does it is the One True Way and if you stray from it, you may as well quit.<p>It&#x27;s just a tool, and if you miss some lessons, it&#x27;s not like those cards immediately vanish from your head. If you fall behind because you weren&#x27;t disciplined, no big deal, just pick it up again and carry on. Learning is a marathon, not a sprint.<p>For me, SRS algorithms try to model how memory works, it&#x27;s not an exact match to it, so even missing a card deadline by a day or two or even a week isn&#x27;t the end of the world.')
