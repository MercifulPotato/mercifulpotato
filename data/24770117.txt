Learning real history helps.</i><p>I don&#x27;t have a real problem distinguishing real from fake news, research and verification come naturally to me. But although I hear this recommendation frequently, it offers nothing to help with the tidal wave of gullible&#x2F;dishonest people who spread false information. I would like to ignore them, but a) that requires additional effort, much like filtering spam and b) ignoring them is unwise to some degree, as such people can have a significant impact in the real world by spreading misinformation.<p>When I first expressed worries about the &#x27;qanon&#x27; thing several years ago, friends and family asked me why I wasted time studying such nonsense. Now it&#x27;s an international phenomenon with electoral leverage; and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> hard to get people to give their time to study and understand it as a strategic problem rather than simply mocking or belittling the adherents. It&#x27;s a bit like trying to explain to a clever developer that a brilliant architectural design can be compromised by idiots and that the user interface requires artificial friction or safety rails.<p>It&#x27;s not that your preference for an educated polity full of critical thinkers is wrong, it would be delightful. The problem is that stupid and mean people are indifferent or outright hostile to such a long-term goal and are perfectly willing and capable of wrecking things in the short term for their own selfish ends.')
