All econometrics comparisons are in real (i.e., inflation adjusted) dollars.<p>Here&#x27;s [1] one example: median inflation adjusted household income from 1985 ($52K) to today ($68K) has grown a lot. Dig up the same info per quintile, and you see the same trends.<p>This also ignores that households have <i>fewer</i> not more dual income over this time (check Census data to confirm if you don&#x27;t belive), and that the average worker has gotten younger (thus are earlier in a career, thus lower income on the career ladder - this can be checked with BLS and Census data), and the actual person in the precise same set of circumstances now as then has shown even more growth than this simple median metric shows.<p>&gt;workers increasingly can’t afford housing<p>Also false. Here [1] presents inflation adjusted price per square foot of new housing - remarkably consistent over the period listed 1978-2020. What has changed over this time is the median house has increased in size tremendously.<p>I&#x27;ve ran these numbers back as far as I can find data, and the trend is the same - flat per square foot price when inflation adjusted.<p>So I agree some places are expensive, but the vast majority of the US is not, and overall workers are not facing increased housing costs for the same housing. What they do now is want more than their predecessors want, and complain the prices are more.<p>&gt;Also, as someone that refinanced a house this year, I can assure you the wealthy are receiving much larger payments than the working class got from their stimulus checks.<p>I also refinanced, and I don&#x27;t how you conclude this from doing one refi, or even how you can conclude such a claim from a single anecdote. Care to explain?<p>If you;re going to claim some statement testable with real values, please provide a citation to your data. I don&#x27;t find any of the stuff you&#x27;re claiming to match these sources (Fed, Census, BLS, CBO) which are pretty well regarded sources of economic data.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;MEHOINUSA672N" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;MEHOINUSA672N</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermoney.com&#x2F;inflation-adjusted-home-prices&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermoney.com&#x2F;inflation-adjusted-home-prices&#x2F;</a>')
