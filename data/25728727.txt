They will have specialized products for special areas, but those will be small series, where running production is expensive and a high margin isn&#x27;t possible. (If a human is cheaper than the machine there is little reason to buy the machine)<p>Value for WhatsApp comes from the fact that it threatened Facebook&#x27;s business model.
