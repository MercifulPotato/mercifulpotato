There is also an option for file sharing where 2 or more devices connect with each other by emitting sounds and transmitting files peer-to-peer without any global server.<p>Here is a quick video demonstrating it&#x27;s functionality: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Zcgf77T71QM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Zcgf77T71QM</a><p>Would love to hear what you think about this project and more importantly - what could be some interesting applications for this type of communication.')
