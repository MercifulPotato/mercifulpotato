For example in 2019 every officer in Seattle made six figures, and about a quarter of the department made over $200k. This is part of why there are so many calls to defund the police.<p>It&#x27;s kind of amazing what unions can achieve when they&#x27;re allowed to exist. I think cops are the only folks who get to unionize without the cops beating them up.<p>Yeah, nurses and EMTs should be paid more. All the EMTs that serve Seattle get &quot;based&quot; out of city limits and don&#x27;t even make the Seattle minimum wage. You can make more as a dishwasher, and dishwashers don&#x27;t have 24-hour shifts.')
