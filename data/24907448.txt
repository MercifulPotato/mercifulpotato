There&#x27;s so much potential in this market. Congratulations on the launch! I remember another YC-backed Indian startup <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;authlayer.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;authlayer.com</a> which started out doing what Decentro is doing, but it seems like they&#x27;ve morphed into a DeFi startup.

Can you please share some examples of things they&#x27;ve built or link to their apps, if possible?<p>2. Btw, unless I missed something, the website is pretty sparse on any details whatsoever.

A bit about your technical stack, please? Back-end, front-end, authentication &#x2F; security etc;<p>7.
