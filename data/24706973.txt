Devs started dropping FF support just like they did with IE, not entirely realising, that the situation was much different: whereas the first time, we were going from a worse closed browser to a better open one, we were now abandoning a worse open one for a better closed one.<p>I&#x27;m of course not blaming this on the web community. The open-source license of Chromium made the switch feel safer, but despite the code license, the decision-making process behind the browser is far from open. Now that I think about it, this is starting to sound familiar... Something about Embracing..and Extending, with a third E-word rising up at the horizon, but I can&#x27;t make it out quite yet.....')
