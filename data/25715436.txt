To that end, their CEO has outright stated they will not moderate their site in any way, and as a result there&#x27;s some truly scary content on that site from individuals who are literally advocating for the murder of those they view as political enemies.<p>And if not calling for murder and violence is &quot;cultural orthodoxy&quot;, well, I guess I&#x27;m pretty orthodox and I&#x27;d hope you are, too.<p>As for Parler, their position on moderation always put them in direct violation of the Amazon&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Apple ToS for their various services.<p>The real mystery is why nothing was done to this point.')
