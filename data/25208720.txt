If you&#x27;ve gone from 400 lbs to 300 lbs in 6 months and suddenly you have knee pain you never had before, I think most GPs would take an acute interest in that and not just chalk it up to being 300 lbs. But if you&#x27;ve gone from 250 lbs to 300 lbs and suddenly develop knee pain, you&#x27;re going to have a hard time convincing anyone that it&#x27;s not the obvious problem.')
