Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605599145, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25114915, text='&gt; By 2030, a motivated nation state will probably have the ability to crack the 2048-bit RSA keys that Google is currently using for DKIM. Do you really want someone in 2031 to be able to contrive fake signatures for the emails of politicians in 2021?<p>By this logic, what the article is arguing for is to bring that same truth today: if DKIM no longer offers the same guarantees, but people think that it does, than it can trivially be used to forge emails that people will then wrongly trust, which is obviously worse than the status quo.<p>Of course, the more likely result is what the article suggests - if the scheme can be defeated, people will stop trusting it, and there will be no chance of forgery (at least not for very much longer).')
