Few media, few intellectuals, and few politicians initially condemned the rioting or looting or violence.<p>I appreciate your point of view and anyone who didn&#x27;t condemn violence should be roundly criticized.<p>However, my experience here in NYC was <i>much</i> different.<p>Not only did pretty much <i>everyone</i> decry the violence (a significant portion of which -- and there&#x27;s plenty of video evidence too -- was instigated by police), but time and again over the two or three days that there was looting, the protestors took it upon themselves to stop the looters, because no one wanted that -- except the looters.<p>What&#x27;s more, much (not all) of the violent actions against police property were perpetrated by folks from out of town.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to Portland or Seattle or Kenosha, but here in NYC, even some of the police[0][1] stood (and knelt) with the protestors to condemn police violence and urged the protestors (to cheers, I might add) to kick the looters and other violent folks out.<p>There&#x27;s nuance there and it&#x27;s sad (especially in the context of discussing social media) that those nuances are lost in social media bubbles where the loudest and most extreme are given undue exposure, if not primacy in the discussion.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsday.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;new-york&#x2F;nypd-chief-of-department-terrence-monahan-1.45201889" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsday.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;new-york&#x2F;nypd-chief-of-departme...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UWnzUTjGCoQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UWnzUTjGCoQ</a>')
