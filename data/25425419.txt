Some portion of people got shifted to working from home, but just about nothing else changed. And 2) there isn’t all that much about moving away from fossil fuels that’s going to look revolutionary. It will look pretty boring to most people. The idea that it’ll take a revolution is IMO a bit of fear mongering by vested interests.<p>Things like decarbonizing an electricity grid have been done before, France did it in the 80s. It wasn’t revolutionary. You wouldn’t have noticed except the air was cleaner.<p>Things like converting transport to non fossil fuels are already in progress and there’s nothing revolutionary looking about it. An electric car isn’t revolutionary it looks and (mostly) drives like a regular car. An electric train isn’t revolutionary, it’s already the norm for decades in most places.<p>Planting trees or restoring wetlands isn’t revolutionary. It’s just trees and wetlands.<p>Even carbon extraction is going to look pretty uninteresting to most people if it happens.<p>The only thing that will be revolutionary is what will happen if we don’t do these things soon enough.')
