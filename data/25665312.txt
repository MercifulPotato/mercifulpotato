Which is to say, there&#x27;s nothing particularly wrong with complicated rules and scoring systems making recommendations, but things like black box neural networks should not be able to be used for this stuff.<p>Let me give you an example of a good system: Spam filters not operated by Google. Algorithms decide whether or not mail gets through my corporate mail filter. It determines it based on a score, which is tallied from a set of rules. And you can drill down and see the score a spam email received, and then you can see the rules and factors that created that score. As a user, you can even generally see this, because the results are included in the message&#x27;s headers in your inbox. And if you&#x27;re the admin, you can then adjust those rules to fix errant behavior.<p>That&#x27;s how a recommendation system should work. A system which can&#x27;t be analyzed in that matter should not exist, and the rules and scoring applied to such systems should be disclosed in some sort of header.')
