Seems hard to have evidence for anything billions of years ago given we don&#x27;t have historical records past a few millenia.  It is all guesswork past that point, and the patterns of organisms and their complexity makes an earth origin of DNA extremely improbable if not impossible.  Try reading through a graduate level book on bioinformatics to marvel at the sheer ingenuity, for lack of a better word, of what our dna is capable of far exceeding anything our best engineers can do.  I find it impossible to believe mutation and natural selection can do better, even given billion year timescale and all of history&#x27;s biomass.  Just look at how ineffective genetic algorithms are in computer science.')
