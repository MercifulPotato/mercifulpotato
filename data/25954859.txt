Few if any of the people commenting on this know who got rich out of this yet or what was driving it. Theories - not evidence - are in evidence.<p>Finance is a slow game. Mistakes are built into over month, years or even decades. The only thing that happens quickly is crossing the point of no return. Pretending that a point of no return is when the mistake happened and requires an immediate view or response is bad framing.')
