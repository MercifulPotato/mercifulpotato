I was introduced to Jabber by a friend. I was complaining that I really wanted to talk to him about a certain topic, but that the topic was sensitive enough that I was paranoid about it being logged forever on some server somewhere.<p>He pointed out the OTR plugin, and it blew my mind that it was guaranteed that no one could possibly snoop our conversation.<p>I knew that it was <i>theoretically</i> possible, but I can&#x27;t overstate how important it is to package the crypto in a user-friendly way. Being able to get the session going in about 30 seconds was a killer feature.<p>But, more than that, it seemed to have an advantage over present-day Signal: I use Signal now, but I always feel a bit queasy about trusting it implicitly. I do trust it, but it&#x27;s such a massive ecosystem now that it doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as &quot;transparent&quot; as the OTR plugin did. The OTR plugin was like, if this is broken, there are many eyeballs that will know pretty quickly. Whereas Signal doesn&#x27;t quite feel the same way.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure why, or if that feeling is just me. There&#x27;s no reason to feel like an OTR plugin is inherently more secure. And yet, as evidenced by the article, it was rock solid for 18 years.')
