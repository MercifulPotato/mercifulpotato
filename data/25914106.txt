I use one account in the electron app, one in the Brave. So Brave is just a Teams client... (if somebody knows a better solution to handle multiple Teams accounts on desktop, I would be grateful for any tips)\n- I have so many privacy&#x2F;security enhancing extensions in Firefox, that some pages render&#x2F;work incorrectly. I&#x27;m too lazy to disable the extensions, so in case I really need such a page, I switch to Brave.<p>Otherwise Firefox is more than enough, I would say more - it&#x27;s better IMHO than currently available chromium clones.')
