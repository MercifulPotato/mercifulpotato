I don&#x27;t know what conditions you&#x27;re driving in, but I think it&#x27;s fucking scary to drive with it on unless there&#x27;s a completely open highway in front of me. Not controlling my own following distance feels like I&#x27;m about to hit the car in front of me at any given moment, especially on a road where the speed limit is 75mph and you have people going anything from 60-90mph.<p>Never heard of a speed limiter. As you can probably tell from the &quot;freedom units,&quot; I&#x27;m from the US if that matters.')
