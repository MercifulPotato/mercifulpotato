You buy it and quickly realise that you need to spend a lot more money.<p>Internal storage is limited, so you need an SD card at least.<p>Then if you plan on carrying it around, a screen protector is pretty much a requirement. And if you are planning on carrying it around, you&#x27;ll also want a case for it.<p>And if you don&#x27;t plan on carrying it around and are only docking it, you probably want a Pro Controller since the included ones are not really that good for couch play.<p>And after you&#x27;ve accessorised yourself, you&#x27;re now stuck with the most expensive game library, with first-party titles pretty much never dropping in price. Want to buy a first-party launch title for the Nintendo Switch? That&#x27;ll be $50-60 for Breath of the Wild. Meanwhile Horizon Zero Dawn, which is an acclaimed first-party title pretty much the same age as BotW, is available for $20 or less. Even cross-platform games might be more expensive on the Switch due to the cartridge costs.')
