Mostly the same codebase, some things ripped out, some things simplified, others just rearranged. One of the most notable changes is the API server being made backend-agnostic, so you can run it against anything from a SPOFy sqlite to a normal etcd.<p>And to me, even if it was a full rewrite: if it quacks like a K8s, walks like a K8s, and passes K8s conformance tests, it&#x27;s a K8s :). I don&#x27;t require a distribution to take upstream k8s binaries as is and just orchestrate them with a configuration management system, I think a lot of value comes from slightly moving things around and changing them to fit your vision. Better that than a murder of shell scripts.')
