Where we are in the conversation, your problem has already been addressed, and part of the solution has been to overprovision renewable generation such that we have excess electricity at many times, amounting to 50% to 200% of current electricity usage.<p>The problem you discuss has been addressed with tons of predictions and models. It&#x27;s solvable with excess generation capacity, storage, and transmission capacity. Which path we choose will depend on the relative dollar costs and political costs of each. (For example HVDC transmission would likely save us lots of money, but is so difficult politically that it is unlikely to happen.)<p>But in any case, nearly all models show that under nearly all cost scenarios, we end up with lots of excess generation capacity, with curtailed renewables generation for a large chunk of time.<p>This is the future we are talking about, a future where we are meeting our energy demands with all renewables, and we have lots of excess generation capacity with zero marginal cost.')
