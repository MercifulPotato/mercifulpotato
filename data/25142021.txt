Do kids pick up on parents&#x27; habits and mimic them? If a family had strict rules that even parents followed, would kids be more likely to feel that the rules are fair and&#x2F;or appropriate.<p>Even if this doesn&#x27;t work in the short run, it&#x27;s possible that after kids grow up, they would adopt healthier habits based on what they saw their parents doing when they were kids. I have seen similar things happen with eating habits, where kids initially rejected parental rules but as adults they adopted healthy habits that their parents modeled for them when they were growing up.')
