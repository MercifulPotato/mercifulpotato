Everything in the Bay Area is more expensive.  A quick Numbeo search, I found that housing in SF is a little more than 2x as expensive as in Austin, so somewhere around the same ratio.  Consumer prices, excluding rent, are 43% higher in SF than Austin.<p>Even your chain restaurants are more pricey.  Everyone has to pay rent, ya know?')
