People cannot invest <i>more</i> money than they put into their Robinhood account. In order to do that, they need to switch to RH Gold.<p>RH Basic: I put $100 into the account, I can buy $100 worth of stock before my funds clear. (Robinhood Instant)<p>RH Gold: I put $100 into the account, I can buy $200 worth of stock. (Actual effective margin)<p>While both of these are technically margin accounts, most people associate the term &quot;margin investing&quot; with the latter model which requires $2000 in the account and a deliberate choice to upgrade.')
