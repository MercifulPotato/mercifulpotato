They buy something that does everything they normally expect a car to do, which includes a long road trip every year or so. Maybe driving to a favorite campground 200 miles away, etc.<p>The reason people keep bringing these scenarios up is due to the fact that electric cars are terrible for these cases. Nobody is suggesting they can&#x27;t be used for daily commutes.<p>Right now electric cars are for people who can afford to also own an ICE or rent an ICE for road trips (or who don&#x27;t like road trips at all).')
