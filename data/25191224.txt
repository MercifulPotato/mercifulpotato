Instead, it creates a &quot;parallel system&quot; where everything is installed from MacPorts (and hence you all dependencies are continuously updated) for the &quot;latest stuff&quot; you install through MacPorts, while not touching the system stuff at all.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macports.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macports.org&#x2F;</a>')
