Capital Police leadership planned poorly and their leadership is at fault. They had to fall back to more secure chokepoints because they were outnumbered and overwhelmed. The cops didn&#x27;t let anyone in. They killed someone and one of them was killed in the fighting. Please don&#x27;t stir up trouble with fake conjecture over a 30 second clip that doesn&#x27;t show what really happened. It is what caused a lot of these problems. You are making it worse.')
