They give you masks. They follow up. The Koreans do mass contact tracing, they search your Facebook + Social Media. Those are things that Americans in particular would balk at.<p>Paradoxically - Korea and Japan have particularily high suicide rates and my &#x27;unscientific hunch&#x27; is that the high degree of social structure and expectations are the driving cause.
