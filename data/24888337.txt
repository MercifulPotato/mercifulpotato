It is also highly subjective, in a sense that every country &#x2F; group of allied countries have their own view of the historical events and try to disseminate those views as wide as possible.<p>As a result, I&#x27;ve decided to judge countries by the authoritarianism of their regimes and cruelty of their laws. If country&#x27;s government is treating their own citizens like shit without rights, I do not expect them to treat people on the outside any better, regardless of how they present themselves. Thus, I do not, as an individual human being, want to see these countries &#x2F; regimes to gain any more power externally.<p>So far, this approach for me had made most sense.<p>As a side note, look at the current list of best friends of a corrupt regime in Russia: Iran, North Korea, China, Philippines, Venezuela, up until recently - Turkey. Every dictatorship in the world is on their list of friends. Same with Iran. &quot;When the character of a man is not clear, look at their friends.&quot;<p>Regarding whataboutism and Russia, I want to remind you that my reply to the OP was not about Iranian sanctions, but was about sanctions as a political instrument overall. For me the most prominent case lately were sanctions against Russia, so that&#x27;s what I used as an example. I&#x27;m very familiar with the situation in Russia and even though sanctions indeed antagonized the regime there, it did make them stop and think whether they want to keep escalating. It&#x27;s hard to imagine what over appropriate response should&#x27;ve been to annexation of the Crimea, downing of the Malaysian Boeing and sending troops and equipment to create essential a civil war in a big region of Ukraine.')
