They&#x27;re not good for <i>future</i> datetimes, e.g. for recording appointments.<p>Because in case of local timezone policy changes, in the vast majority of cases the intention is for the future event to stay <i>constant</i> in the local timezone, and be <i>changed</i> in UTC &#x2F; epoch. If for example you made the mistake of storing store opening hours in UTC and translate it to local time in the UI, you will be showing the wrong time.<p>For appointments, you need both the datetime and the location&#x2F;timezone. In case of cross-timezone appointments, e.g. virtual meetings, if there are timezone policy changes the issue cannot be resolved without rescheduling the event for some participants.')
