Possibly because it gets mixed up with a related, more convincing one.<p>It can never be right to assign the majority of power to a minority of voters. If giving that power to the majority means they can only govern for the majority, then the opposite also holds true: governments elected by a minority can govern for only that minority. And that would seem to be even worse.<p>There is an argument for the minority to have some powers. First among them is a sort of veto power: requiring (some) support from the minority for enacting laws, or the most significant laws (and constitutional changes) is very effective at protecting them.<p>The US implements as much by requiring supermajorities for constitutional amendments, and by the non-linear apportionment of power in both houses of congress, and by the Senat&#x27;s filibuster.<p>But all that&#x27;s completely different from awarding the presidency to the minority! And your arguments about the the higher value of rural populations is equally ridiculous. &quot;One person one vote&quot; is a fundamental principle, and for every oh-so-important-farmer in Montana, I can find 10 scientist in a city that are each more important for the supply of food. Plus an additional 10 poets and musicians, because that&#x27;s also something people need.<p>Tying political power to land isn&#x27;t democracy, it&#x27;s feudalism.')
