I know it&#x27;s a bit unrelated.. but it seems like the right people are here. Is there any kind of open source database that is close to Amazon&#x27;s QLDB? ideally as a postgresql plugin.<p>Also: is there any &quot;distributed database system&quot; that allows to synchronize for example some tables (or even specific fields) of a server-side database with a third-party client (which might be sqlite vs postgresql in the server side), so that only part of the database is synchronized, in a secure way? this &quot;slave&quot; should not be trusted, think about it as a web user.')
