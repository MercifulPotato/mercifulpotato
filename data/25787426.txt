It&#x27;s quite early on and doesn&#x27;t even work yet, but I plug away at it in my spare time. I could use some help doing the Vue portion, if anyone is interested: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kodah&#x2F;girc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kodah&#x2F;girc</a><p>The idea is to have a chat client that can have panes that more resemble Discord with rich media utilizing IRCv3 tags as well as a configurable pane for more traditional terminal style views.<p>The motivation is that I&#x27;m not really a Matrix user. I like Freenode and that&#x27;s really the only place I want to hang out. I do want a modern IRC client though, one that can grow as IRCv3 is growing. One that could potentially rival Slack, Mattermost, and Gitter while staying open source.')
