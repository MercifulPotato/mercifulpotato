Item(by='kashyapc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607940546, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25411202, text='Yes! <i>On the Tranquility of Mind</i> is a marvellous essay.  Also it is the only essay of Seneca&#x27;s that has an interlocutor, a certain Serenus, who begins the essay with an excellent description of conflicting mental states he&#x27;s experiencing.  As a teaser for those lurking, here&#x27;s a fragment of what he writes to Seneca:<p><i>&quot;[...] I am aware that these mental disturbances I suffer from are not dangerous and bring no threat of a storm; to express to you in a true analogy the source of my complaint, it is not a storm I labour under but seasickness: relieve me, then, of this malady, whatever it be, and hurry to aid one who struggles with land in his sight. [...]&quot;</i><p>---<p>Seneca&#x27;s response to it is equally astounding.  (The above quote is from &quot;Dialogues and Essays&quot;, Oxford World&#x27;s Classics; translation by John Davie.)<p>One of my personal highlights this year: I&#x27;ve spent six contiguous months reading all of 124 letters of Seneca (the <i>University of Chicago Press</i> edition is the way to go) and several of his dialogues and essays. It&#x27;s amazing how many of his letters try to shape our reading habits.')
