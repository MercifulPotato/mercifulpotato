Some societies have no such humanity based floor.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s the intention, but what a minimum wage actually <i>does</i> is remove the possibility for anyone to work below an arbitrary number of dollars.<p>If that value is lower than the going market rate for low-skilled labor, minimum wage makes no difference.<p>Above that, it removes more and more people from the &quot;eligible to work&quot; pool. There&#x27;s nothing humane about preventing people from being able to work, especially when you don&#x27;t have a welfare system to pick up those who are now doomed to unemployment.')
