This has increased a lot.<p>As a former Amsterdam resident, another thing that has increased a lot is drugs-tourism. It&#x27;s a class of tourism no Amsterdammer is happy about (except the coffeeshopowners). The Amsterdam center is basically a no-go zone for many residents, it suffers from the usual European inner-city-tourism-blight, with a significant share of drunk and high tourists sprinkled on top. The city of Amsterdam already stopped their advertising campaign last year and wanted to improve the &#x27;quality&#x27; of the tourists it is attracting: less poor backpacking weed-seekers, and more middle-class and rich-class art-seekers.')
