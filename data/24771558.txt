For example, I only carry my medical insurance card if I’m going to the doctor. It’s not an every day carry. Likewise, I only carry my HSA card when I am going to buy something that can be covered by the HSA (not that often). I have a work-issued credit card but I only carry it when I’m on a work trip (and even then I generally leave it in my wallet inside my luggage unless I know I will need it that day).<p>On 99% of days over the past two years, I’ve left my wallet at home and only carried my phone with only with two cards: my personal credit card and my drivers license.')
