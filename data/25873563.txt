Nice that they&#x27;ve filtered AVCC pretty heavily-- 360Hz corner frequency-- lots of microcontroller boards don&#x27;t.<p>Less nice that the ADC scale will be affected by power supply offset, though that all depends upon how &quot;good&quot; the board 3V3 is.  The bandgap and error amplifier on the DC-DC converter IC is good at least-- max +&#x2F;- 1%.')
