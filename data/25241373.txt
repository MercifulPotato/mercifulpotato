Imagine that it’s the nonlocality side of things that ends up being correct. In that case, a full foundation of QM could be a nightmare.<p>Regardless, we don’t have a full unified theory of everything, so it seems premature to say we know how complex it’ll end up needing to be.<p>Also, the universe isn’t just an time evolution differential equation. It’s that, plus all the initial&#x2F;boundary conditions. Saying the Kolmogorov complexity of the universe is small while only looking at the side that’s simplifiable seems circular.')
