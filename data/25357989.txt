I wonder if Cocoa and the like are really so important to devs that they opt in to program for Mac only. It would be amazing to have this desktop application also available on Mac and Linux and I acknowledge that it&#x27;s a lot of fine tuning extra work, letting alone the neccessary choice for a cross-plattform toolkit such as Qt. I don&#x27;t have a Mac but would use this prodct if it was available. The same is with many other beautiful Mac apps.')
