Thank you.<p>Here&#x27;s how I read the poll: If I were a datacenter owner, and I leased out a serious portion of my datacenter as a public cloud, would I have terms of service? Yes; I don&#x27;t want to attract trouble or criminality. Would those terms of service ban abuse, like cryptocurrency miners on free trial accounts? Yes; I can&#x27;t afford to run a datacenter at a loss for long periods of time. Would those terms of service ban planning or executing crimes? Yes; I can&#x27;t afford to give service to criminals, as they drive off customers who are less likely to violate other terms of service.<p>It&#x27;s that simple. There&#x27;s no additional caveats. If I saw the sort of evidence that AWS, Apple, and Google have been shown, then I would have cut off Parler as well.<p>While it&#x27;s not a caveat, I would certainly enjoy a regulatory approach to moderating the immense power that comes with owning many datacenters. However, given the &quot;free speech&quot; angle, I think that Parler users and owners should suck it up and save up their pennies and dimes for on-premise deployments. If you want to host fascists, then you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised when the rest of society has an allergic reaction and forces you to go fund yourself.')
