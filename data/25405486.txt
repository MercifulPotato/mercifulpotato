Item(by='jsinai', descendants=None, kids=[25406515, 25405526], score=None, time=1607853864, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25404028, text='&gt; I once saw speed cameras as “un-sporting”.<p>With no attack on the parent, this reminds me of the general driving attitude of South Africa where I am from. A combination of lack of road enforcement and public mistrust in the police have created an environment where the rule of law on the road, designed to protect lives, is treated merely as suggestions or guidelines, often ignored.<p>It’s extremely common to see drivers speeding from 10 to even 30 km&#x2F;h above the speed limit, even on urban roads. Sometimes these drivers are so confident in their right (freedom?) that they’ll flash their lights at you from behind if you’re going too slow, even if you are a good citizen driving at the speed limit. And speeding is only one half of it...<p>When I came to Europe for the first time it was amazing to see how almost everyone respects the road rules (I know this isn’t the case everywhere) and it generally makes me feel much safer on the roads. Although it’s still scary as hell cycling in some cities without protected cycle lanes.')
