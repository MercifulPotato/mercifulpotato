But if Apple really wanted to show a fair comparison, they&#x27;d have just specified screen brightness in nits directly, instead of using this roundabout comparison.<p>Laptop screens can easily consume 3-7 Watts of power, which dwarfs the SOC power, and makes up for ~70-90% of the total system power draw for watching videos. So if the brightness settings were really different (in nits terms), this comparison is quite disingenuous on Apple&#x27;s part.')
