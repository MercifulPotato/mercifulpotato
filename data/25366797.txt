Why does it have to be a permissive license?<p>&gt;A restaurant chain starts selling your dishes, using your name, but, because of their scale, cheaper than you can afford to.<p>Why is it okay for them to use your name? You can release free software but not let just anyone use your trademark. (See: Firefox, Red Hat, etc.)<p>&gt;I donâ€™t see that smaller restaurant staying in business, unless it starts making new recipes it keeps for itself.<p>Well in the case of actual small restaurants, clearly publishing a recipe book isn&#x27;t necessarily catastrophic; after all, many do. Stretching the analogy this far doesn&#x27;t make the point very well.')
