Even with newer languages that are gaining popularity and are likely to be used in the future, I struggle to justify the time investment. I could be wrong but some of my concerns are:<p>- my time is better spent getting deeper into some more popular language that I already know to some extent<p>- unused skills deteriorate with time so by adding a new language that you don&#x27;t need professionally right now, you also need to add the future time and effort of practicing and maintaining that skill<p>- I could be wrong but I feel that it&#x27;s a red flag to have too many of the more esoteric languages on your resume.<p>I do enjoy tinkering with a new language but very often it just feels like a distraction.<p>Thoughts?')
