That reasoning sounds a bit like saying you don&#x27;t need software engineers anymore because your application runs on a microcomputer, not a mainframe.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more to a lighting technician&#x27;s role than &quot;hold lights because they&#x27;re hot.&quot;<p>&gt; Last year corridor crew did a video where niko broke down how much money he could save by moving to LED lights and cutting the mandatory crew requirement and run small films at affordable prices.<p>Bosses don&#x27;t like unions, and if you take the perspective of a boss, you probably won&#x27;t like them either.  What else is new?<p>&gt; Everybody thinks they&#x27;re the actor in the hollywood comparison, and they&#x27;re not. They&#x27;re more likely the tech guy holding an outdated lamp under union rules.<p>It beats getting dumped onto the street and pivoting suddenly into burger flipping.  The point of unions is to protect its workers, not minimize employer costs.  If a job is becoming truly obsolete, then the union could force the employer to retrain their workers (like what happened in this video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;127605643" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;127605643</a>) or buy time for a more gradual transition.<p>Heck, if workers trusted they weren&#x27;t going to get screwed by labor saving technology, they might not resist it as much.')
