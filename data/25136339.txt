It&#x27;s important that the concept of phase is not something absolute, it only makes sense in relation to something. Absolute phase could be defined from the beginning of the universe which is nonsensical .<p>You are right nobody can hear phase, but nobody can see phase either again because you need to relate (interfere) to something. \nHowever it does make a difference if we think about the superposition (interference) of different audio frequency components. We would definitely here some of those phase differences.<p>That said iq does not make sense in audio processing because it&#x27;s baseband. There is no carrier wave.')
