You wish to raise money.<p>You can sell 50% of each persons stake, or all of one person&#x27;s stake, or something else. Without dilution, it would be a founders job to convince the other employees that giving up some of their shares was necessary (assuming the employee equity pool was the only source, but s&#x2F;employees&#x2F;other investors for the same result in general), and individual investors or employees could make that choice. Dilution allows certain investors to make that decision on behalf of other investors.<p>If I wanted to invest in 1% of a company, I want to be in control of that choice, not have someone else modify my investment to be smaller (even if the $-value stays the same, that defeats the point of my investment!)')
