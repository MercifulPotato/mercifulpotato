But maybe it just suits me well.<p>I usually create a pdf or free summary and host on GitHub if my blog post is good enough to add long term value to the community. Eg: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ashok-khanna&#x2F;common-lisp-by-example" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ashok-khanna&#x2F;common-lisp-by-example</a><p>There doesnâ€™t seem to be a Medium equivalent for programming blogs? I would drool over having the style of raywenderlich.com for non iOS &#x2F; Swift blogs')
