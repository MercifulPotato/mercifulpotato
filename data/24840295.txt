You can represent anything non-relatavistic on top of the Unix epoch, and it could be handled as simply as using alternate time zones.<p>The big problems come from huge Earth assumptions about interval duration and interval sequencing being violated. A lunar day is 29.5 Earth days. Does the lunar calendar use solar days, and just have absurdly long weeks and years? Maybe the years are standard Earth length, they just don&#x27;t use weeks or months. Does a lunar society have a shorter &quot;not-day&quot; that replaces the way Earth uses days, and now everything needs to handle this new unit of time? Do days still get measured as solar intervals, and we just decide it&#x27;s okay for days to be longer than weeks on the moon, so it stays Tuesday for a month at a time?')
