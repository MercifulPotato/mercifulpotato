It took them 8 years to allow asking to play a particular song on Spotify.<p>Usually the first thing I say to Siri is &#x27;Hey Google&#x27; so it goes to Google Assistant.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure what &quot;seamless integration&quot; is left.  I (and my friends that have similar devices) use smart speakers for power control, getting the weather, playing music, and setting timers&#x2F;alarms.  It doesn&#x27;t take an sole-source ecosystem to make that work well.')
