Write it a wiki and send them the link.<p>- Have a great idea that needs brainstorming? Document it as a proposal and open a pullrequest to discus and have it merged into architecture documentation.<p>- People asking questions about your code in a pullrequest? Don&#x27;t explain in the PR why you did it, make your code and comments speak for itself so questions are not raised in the first place.')
