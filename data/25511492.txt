The difference is a fiasco on this level doesn&#x27;t usually happen to big titles (being unplayable on current-gen consoles, their biggest market, is inexcusable).<p>The other big difference is the amplification by social media that&#x27;s present for every pop-culture phenomenon makes the kerfuffle seem larger than it is.
