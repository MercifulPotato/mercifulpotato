And those claims also come up short...most of them can&#x27;t say where or how it is being used because they don&#x27;t know...just that at some point in the past, someone emails were exchanged between someone@bignamecompany.com and someone@haskell.org, and now there is a piece of copy on the Haskell website that disingenuously claims <i>BigNameCompany is powered by Haskell!</i>. Who cares how pervasivly it is used...if someone writes a config parser with Haskell, all of a sudden we can claim that BigNameCompany would fall over on its face if Haskell wasn&#x27;t there protecting it.<p>Come on. Nobody cares that Haskell is your secret weapon if you&#x27;ve never overcome an opponent with it. Or built an entire profitable company on its back. All these types of posts do is fake an authority so you can jump straight to your fallacious argument by authority.<p>If you want to argue the merits of your favorite language, <i>then do it</i>. Don&#x27;t make us sit through an argument about how your language makes you special when you aren&#x27;t even noteworthy enough for a 10 sentence Wikipedia blurb. There are a lot of valid and powerful technical arguments in this article, but they&#x27;re ruined by framing them all around the premise that we care about how it makes you and your startup special.')
