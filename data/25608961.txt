It&#x27;s not a deep look, but a fun one all the same (it is Tom Wolfe after all).<p>He traces the design we all see in the downtowns to the works of early german communists and their desire for good looking spaces and architecture that could cheaply be made for the masses in the coming revolution of the working classes. When capitalists heard about it they stopped listening after &#x27;cheap&#x27; was uttered. &quot;Oh, this is the &#x27;modern&#x27; look and it&#x27;s the new thing <i>and</i> it&#x27;s cheap? Do &#x27;em all like that then.&quot;<p>My recollection of Wolfe&#x27;s short piece is a bit dated, but that&#x27;s the theme as I remember. It&#x27;s a short and fun little satirical look at how the 80&#x27;s downtowns got to be looking as such.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;From_Bauhaus_to_Our_House" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;From_Bauhaus_to_Our_House</a><p>As an aside, I wonder how <i>Minecraft</i> is going to change the look of architects and cities in the future. I&#x27;m dead certain that the architects of the 2070s will have gotten their love of design in <i>Minecraft</i>.')
