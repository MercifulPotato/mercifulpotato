I had to help admin an office full of System 7.5 &amp; 7.6 PowerMacs in 1996&#x2F;1997, all constantly crashing because FileMaker could not run in a stable way at the same time as Netscape, or some extension in the System folder would freeze up the system randomly.<p>Classic MacOS had no memory protection, memory management itself was terrible and not particularly dynamic (reserve N bytes for this app etc.), and the multitasking in System 7 was bolted on in an awkward way, and the migration from 68k to PowerPC introduced a boatload of bugs.<p>The screenshots on the article&#x27;s page shows System 7.5. Those were the dark ages for the Macintosh frankly. The _concept_ was &quot;it just works&quot; and &quot;computer for the rest of us&quot; but that was the reality only if you stayed on a fairly narrow path, frankly.<p>System 8 was a major improvement.')
