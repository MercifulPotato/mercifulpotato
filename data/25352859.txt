I&#x27;m not sure I understand why any other artist should receive that subscription money if I paid for a service abd only listened to a single artist.  The service got their cut.  Shouldn&#x27;t the artist make their money for my listening preference?  I clearly would not have paid for that service if that band wasn&#x27;t there to listen to.  Beyond fair, it seems well deserved.<p>The opposite of that is strange to me.  Seems akin to buying a record at a record store and having my money go to other artists because people usually buy their records.')
