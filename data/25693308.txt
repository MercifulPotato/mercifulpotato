I used to help moderate a forum, and never had any issue at all banning people for posting racist stuff up until 2016. Then people started calling that &quot;political&quot; and insisted I was biased against conservatives after I banned someone (who happened to be of a certain political affiliation) for making a thread full of just &quot;fuck muslims&quot;. It caused drama and I left. People are overly primed for the narrative that conservatives are irrationally oppressed online and they ignore details to make it fit.')
