This is a cost of US citizenship and you are not forced to acquire citizenship. You could get permanent residency. I had to make this choice and chose citizenship 15 years ago. It’s a hell of a thing swearing that you’ll bear arms to defend a country you weren’t born in.<p>I have had many occasions to feel glad that I did. From military base tours to easier to entry&#x2F;exit to Canada to buying a house or getting a loan. It generally makes paperwork much easier in this country and opens up a few doors.<p>If you think the tax filing requirement is a big deal, consider the restrictions and obligations that other countries have. Compulsory military service, restrictions on moving money, etc.')
