They just want a quick linux install to run their shit on, or it was handed that way by the Uni department &#x2F; company &#x2F; whatever. Or just because it&#x27;s the biggest name and you&#x27;re sure to find help online. And then a lot of people don&#x27;t upgrade - I work with my fair share of people running win 7 (even still have an XP person around), OS X &lt; 10.10 and Ubuntu 14.04, just because they can&#x27;t afford newer hardware required to make the experience of newer OSes not a laggy shitfest.<p>&gt; And knowing that, your idea is to bolt on custom tooling that&#x27;s not installed anywhere or by no one by default and make it your own infrastructure?<p>gcc is not part of infrastructure, just like Xcode.app or Visual Studio aren&#x27;t part of Windows or macOS infrastructure.')
