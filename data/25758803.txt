Was the move from Digg to Reddit this drastic? I don&#x27;t remember Myspace going out of style this fast once FB opened up.<p>Seeing my boomer relatives flock to these obscure platforms has been really interesting. I&#x27;m also curious if there will be any sort of post mortem from any of these companies once the traffic stabilizes. My guess is probably not since from what I&#x27;ve been able to gather, all of these fringe sites tend to be run by a handful of people and not full teams of developers. Writing a post mortem may give their online opposition hints into whatever new infrastructure they cobble together and contribute to further shenanigans. It&#x27;s the same reason we didn&#x27;t seem a post mortem after Iowa 2020 or the DNC hacks in 2016 I would guess.<p>Does anyone expect a real drop in market share for the iPhone over the next 12-18 months if Parlor can&#x27;t get back on the App store?<p>Again, just fascinating stuff to watch from an outside perspective.')
