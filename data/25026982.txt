This looks pretty attractive when your death toll is looking to rise to over 500k people. Eg if nothing changes until after January, 70 days , infection rate doubling every ~3 weeks, by then 300-400knew infections per day, lagging death rate of 5-6k per day, ~100k will die just in the 14 days of hard lock down assuming that happens day 1 of new president. Really hoping none of this happens and is just bad extrapolation but vaccine likely to save a lot of lives even with a 0.01% death rate.')
