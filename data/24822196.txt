It&#x27;s just planned obsolescence. Nobody on goddamn Hacker News is a Luddite. The Luddites weren&#x27;t even Luddites the way you&#x27;re using it, which is just a slur for an imagined cranky old man as afraid of technology as Phil Hartman&#x27;s Frankenstein&#x27;s monster is afraid of fire.<p>The economics are that you want products that you sell to be rendered useless as soon as possible, barring the possibility that the customer becomes so resentful that they switch products. So you claim that features that will eventually destroy a product are necessary to make it appealing, you hide the costs of replacing the product through purchase schemes and equivocations about the environmental impact, and you denigrate older models as horrifically, irresponsibly dangerous.<p>&gt; Of course, there&#x27;s always going to be the complainers bemoaning the changing times.<p>This is a vapid argument that can be used to defend anything from New Coke to the Holocaust.')
