Nobody I know, in person, goes to protests or stops talking to each other because of how they vote. I literally mean nobody. No division. The most extreme is that some people I know cry when an election doesnâ€™t go their way and then their friends make fun of them.<p>Division is a perception created by keyboard warriors and news that needs something to report on and the rest of us find crazy people entertaining. If you turn the news off and step away from social media the artificial insanity goes away.<p>I do understand some major metros have witnessed massive protests this year with large scale property destruction. From the outside looking in it looks like communities with a lack of diversity and severe economic stratification. I say that because I live in a major metro that experienced none of that insanity and this major city is either or about to be the most diverse major US city and is very healthy economically.')
