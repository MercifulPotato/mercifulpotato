The same is true of Facebook. From the point of view of corporate success, they are doing the right things. My point is just that these are not <i>good</i> things, in the larger sense.<p>Thank you for informing me about the role of Outlook in this. I used Gmail as my example because it seems to be taking over, at least for “normies”, as you call them. So the average person’s idea of what email is comes from experience with Gmail. It’s possible I’m underestimating the importance or prevalence of Outlook, as I deal less with corporate types than academic and publishing types.')
