That’s false they have to comply with the same kinds of safety and environmental regulations as you mentioned.<p>As to the government controlling design of products, the precedent is narrow and scoped only to prevent direct harm to consumers for a reason - liberal democracy is based on the principle of freedom as long as you aren’t harming anyone.<p>If you broaden the scope to the government imposing arbitrary design decisions on companies, you stop having a liberal democracy, and move into fascism.<p>I know that’s an inflammatory word to use - but state control of companies is a defining feature of fascism, and limiting state control to only what is needed to prevent direct harms is a defining feature of liberalism.<p>So I think we must oppose the generalization.<p>The environmental argument is reasonable to consider, in the sense that it is within the scope of liberal democracy to control environmental harms, because those are ways we harm other people through our actions.<p>By this logic, design changes could only be required <i>if they had a substantial impact on reducing waste</i>.<p>Apple themselves are investing an enormous amount in increasing the life of their products, especially phones.<p>I think it’s likely that if they had to compromise their designs in arbitrary ways, there would almost certainly be more broken phones and more waste, not fewer.<p>This is where the rubber meets the road for me.<p>Does making a phone easier to repair make it last longer?  I’d say most likely not.<p>Things that make phones last longer are more robust physical designs so they can withstand heavy use, and everyday use without breaking.<p>Reasonable people may disagree on this, but for me this is where the argument gets interesting.<p>What designs lead to the most sustainable products?')
