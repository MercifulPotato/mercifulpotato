I spent a decade in government consulting trying to implement anything resembling &quot;data science&quot; or &quot;DevOps&quot; and got repeatedly shut down by higher ups or by random bureaucrats that saw any modern practices, including any technology, as a threat.<p>Excel macros working one day, then prohibited the next by new IT policies.<p>Directors demanding that service line bosses meet with me to discuss &quot;data-driven decision-making&quot;, followed by a solid week of said chiefs telling me that my job is a joke.<p>Actual honest-to-God employees trying to make a difference in financial openness having their coworkers walk by their desks and loudly shout they &quot;ain&#x27;t doing that shit&quot; and walking away.<p>Two years hunting for a database to store 2 GB of data, and only finding one when a new contractor onboarded and knew a guy in the next office over who would let them have a partition of SQL Server.<p>I wish I was making any of this up. The federal government has massive, massive employee culture issues. This list is... a nice dream.')
