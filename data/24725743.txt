Back then most users on it were from the “beer money” community looking for extra cash, rather than people trying to make a living. I picked up a request that was basically light research and data entry into a spreadsheet. The guy had tried to get it done via MTurk but the Turkers hadn’t followed directions well, and there were a few hundred lines left to fill out. I don’t remember actually agreeing on a payment in advance, other than my request that it be in Amazon gift cards. He paid $5 when the work was done, insisted that he’d send the full payment later, then sent some oddly specific amount like $52.23 a week later. Good pay for a couple hours’ work, but it felt shady the whole way through.')
