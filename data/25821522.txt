If you think anything gets &quot;stuck&quot; in your foam, you&#x27;re underestimating the speeds at which objects in orbit move. It&#x27;s more like shooting a railgun at your impactor. I also recommend Netwon&#x27;s impact depth approximation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Impact_depth" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Impact_depth</a><p>For the purposes of deorbiting junk it may be sufficient to just impart <i>some</i> delta-v, but you neither want that to be uncontrolled collisions sending stuff into even more erratic orbits, nor would you want to risk generating even <i>more</i> tiny pieces.')
