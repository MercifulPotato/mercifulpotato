Item(by='ChrisLomont', descendants=None, kids=[25718018], score=None, time=1610278567, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25711070, text='&gt;How many of these techniques wouldn&#x27;t have been reinvented a dozen times over in less time, if the original patenter never existed?<p>In the exact same details? None. There is an extreme number of parameters and details in each of these codecs.<p>How many times have you or a small band of people invented a world class video compression codec? They take a huge number of people and a lot of funding to create. That funding, in many cases, was paid for by places like Fraunhofer that has invented many such codecs before anyone else, and they do so because they know they will get a revenue stream to pay for the work.<p>If these things were easy to make, there would be constant new ones, each improving the last one. This is not the case - they take years and the effort of a lot of people to make new ones that are better enough to slowly replace old ones.<p>A simple way to see it - if these were so easy that people would invent a dozen if only patents didn&#x27;t stop them, then people would invent those anyway and publish them for fun. I am unaware of ANY world class video codecs that some hacker invented in their basement, and the only ones close to best in breed were funded to the tune of the prices above by huge companies that want to use their leverage to move markets, for their own gain.<p>These things are in no way trivial to create.<p>&gt; You could probably get a bigger group if there wasn&#x27;t a patent vs. no patent conflict.<p>Removing a funding channel means there would be less, not more, incentive to pay tens of millions to billions to develop one. If you pay the R&amp;D and anyone else can simply take the work and not pay for it, then less companies will work on it.')
