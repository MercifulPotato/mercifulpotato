In the case of a risk tolerance mismatch, you can work out shared criteria, scoped to the initial disagreement, for how to collaborate.<p>I&#x27;d also suggest that one of the reasons we are encouraged to seek diversity is because we benefit from having people around us who <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> make the same decisions we would make in every situation.<p>If I am reading between the lines correctly, it sounds like predictability is what you expect shared values to provide.  I think a shared vision is more important than shared values in this case.  You can still predict that with which you disagree, if you communicate mutual expectations for how to scope disagreement within collaboration.')
