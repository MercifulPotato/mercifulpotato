The former is a user-friendly word processor and the latter is a fairly complex plaintext-based document preparation&#x2F;typesetting tool.<p>I doubt that most offices would benefit from teaching their employees that instead of just hitting control-B to bold some text, they should now do \\textbf{foo}, or that quotes should now be types ``like this&#x27;&#x27;. If you need the huge array of features (which is typically only the case in the context of academic publishing), then it&#x27;s worth making the investment to learn. But for 99% of corporate documents, Word likely can do what you need with much less pain.')
