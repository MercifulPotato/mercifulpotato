It adds complexity, but the value it brings with that complexity pays for itself.<p>So I have no idea if this framework really delivers enough value to be worth it.  My gut says no, but I haven&#x27;t used it, and I&#x27;m not a huge ruby fan in the first place, so I&#x27;m the first to admit I&#x27;m a biased judge.')
