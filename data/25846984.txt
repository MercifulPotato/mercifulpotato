I would venture a guess that the only the people of the &quot;swamp&quot; (i.e. people who&#x27;s pay stubs have the seal of a TLA at the top) are against Snowden&#x27;s pardon.  Snowden did everything right.  He read the room (i.e. looked at what happened to people who used the &quot;proper channels&quot;) and leaked more or less the minimum to expose programs that are constitutionally indefensible without some serious mental gymnastics.<p>Assange is much more controversial, especially now that he won&#x27;t be extradited and prosecuted, since his crimes are much more political and he wasn&#x27;t tactful like Snowden, he published everything he got.  There&#x27;s definitely less public support for his pardon but if the goal is to give the middle finger to the establishment this is the better one because it is controversial.')
