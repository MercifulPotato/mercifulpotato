The problem is, London is a world-class city that concentrates the entire political and financial establishment. It&#x27;s also a city with very obvious parallel worlds, where if you move in certain circles, you meet the same people, so while it is a massive city, it sometimes feels quite small.<p>To me, the worst part is not that both Johnson and Cameron went to the same school, the same university, or even the same exclusive dining club - the bad bit is that because any given person with political, social or economic power in the UK is so closely connected with any other, there&#x27;s a real incentive not to rock the boat. You get an enormous amount of cohesion, because if you go around making enemies, you&#x27;re ultimately making things awkward for a lot of your friends and acquaintances.<p>On top of that, the fact most people in this world have similar backgrounds makes a lot of them &#x27;on the same page&#x27; by default.')
