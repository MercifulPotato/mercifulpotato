There are many ways around it and it&#x27;s much easier when Canada&#x27;s AML and KYC requirements would make a 1980s&#x27; Caribbean Banker blush.<p>Yes, if you have the right connections, which almost all these investors have, it&#x27;s no biggie to move money out of China. I don&#x27;t know about Canadian laws to make a comparison about Canadian laws to a Caribbean banker in the 80s. But I do know that the Chinese are plowing money everywhere - Malaysia, Thailand, parts of Europe, Singapore, almost all of them are being massively bought by Chinese investors. Does not take a genius to figure out that the CCP plan has either failed, or more likely was just political grandstanding for their Weibo and QQ fans.<p>&gt; Even a municipal vacancy tax is just a new cost of doing business.<p>When you&#x27;re a monied investor, taxes just become operating costs. I remember back in the day, my family in a Gulf country had to pay an exorbitant part of our income to get a &quot;license fee&quot; to set up a tiny restaurant no bigger than a Subway. Now, I just opened a satellite office for investors in one of the fanciest districts in the country and those license fees are just a cost of doing business. Not to mention, I&#x27;m getting a fuck ton of local subsidies to do that, driving my costs further. This is the case with almost all major cities in emerging markets I know of struggling to build an ecosystem (Singapore, KL, Dubai, Riyadh, etc).<p>&gt; Further, the Canadian Liberals and BoC have both signalled that they intend to devalue the CAD and prop up real-estate. You&#x27;d be a fool as a Chinese foreign investor to not dump money into Canadian real estate. It&#x27;s de-facto government-backed at this point, comes with a Canadian passport, and the Canadian Liberals will never move a finger against you or China.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s tied to the Liberals, but the CAD has seen significant devaluation against the dollar the past 5 years or 10 years (excluding the effects of USD appreciation too). I also do not know about Canadian govt incentives to boost real estate, but that&#x27;s not far fetched to assume from #2. Current requirements for citiznship by investment (in Quebec, the federal programme was shut down) show a requirement of only CAD 2 million as net worth, not even direct investment, and an intention to settle in Quebec. Alternatively, one could set up a BS company and get a federal pass through. Both of which aren&#x27;t hard for the typical Chinese investor to prove. So yes, the government programme does come with an easy passport at the end of it.<p>Lastly, let&#x27;s be honest - Canada only took on Meng Wanzhou because the US told them to. If they were really serious about Huawei breaching the Iran sanctions, they would have to arrest a number of other Chinese businessmen who own property in Canada, as well as a number of Arab and Iranian businessmen, who don&#x27;t have qualms skirting the sanctions. Canada is only standing up to China at the moment, because they have US backing, and because it&#x27;s Meng Wanzhou.')
