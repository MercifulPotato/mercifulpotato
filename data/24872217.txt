Our goal should be the greatest wealth for the most people for the whole Earth. This is accomplished with innovation and peaceful trade. One &quot;side&quot; discovers a new technology and the whole world can benefit.<p>The primary driver of innovation is a competitive market in which individuals innovate through the pursuit of self-interest. The 20th century was a large experiment finalizing this hypothesis, including China through Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s reforms.<p>The incendiary thought to both &quot;sides&quot; is that they&#x27;re both suppressing such innovation: China through explicit communist philosophy and Western countries through some sort of devolution into Crapitalism due to varied causes.<p>In other words, are China and Western countries qualitatively different? In my opinion, not by a magnitude, and that&#x27;s the scary thing.<p>However, barring idiotic wars by country leaders, humans are likely to continue to innovate _despite_ the chiefs, priests, and thieves, as we have done for the last few hundred years (see Pinker, Goklany, etc.).')
