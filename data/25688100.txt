I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll bubble up here if it does with more details just like when they got nuked from Reddit. Arguably sites like this one are a good way to gauge the true robustness of the Internet - given the situation this week they <i>clearly</i> now are in the realm of law enforcement, but up until these rather insane events to me their continued presence was an existence proof that speech on the web is still in a good place. Now if they get taken down I won&#x27;t judge it too harshly against that thesis since they basically fomented a theoretical insurrection by the letter of the law, even though in practice the &quot;coup&quot; turns out was never a real threat given how ridiculous things went once the dog caught the car.')
