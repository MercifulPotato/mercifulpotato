As I recall, he believed that history had a certain determinism to it; it had universal laws like the laws of physics. I don&#x27;t think it does, and I have a hard time understanding how he could have thought this was true. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goodlifeodyssey.com&#x2F;universal-historical-laws" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goodlifeodyssey.com&#x2F;universal-historical-laws</a> for an essay about this, but basically what one dictator ate for lunch can have big effects. Thus, no law could account for such complexity. Its like he took the idea that history repeats itself and over-generalized it.<p>Spengler also seemed to believe it was impossible to &quot;truly&quot; understand how people from earlier times thought. But then he made some very strong claims, like stating that the ancients didn&#x27;t have a sense of time. Once again, there is some truth here, but he over-generalizes.')
