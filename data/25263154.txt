If a journalist interviews someone and then goes to print, and a Wikipedia article is trying to cite a source for something the interviewee said, you don&#x27;t need another organization to quote the part of the article where the interviewee&#x27;s words appear in order for a secondary source to come into existence.  The article where the quote was first printed is a valid secondary source.')
