It&#x27;s a lot of money, but it&#x27;s a small fraction of the federal budget. It&#x27;s also less than the amount of money in existence - M1 is $5.5 trillion and can easily be expanded, as mentioned.<p>(It also wouldn&#x27;t necessarily matter if the interest per year were greater than the total amount of money in existence. If the money supply were $20, that wouldn&#x27;t make it impossible for me to pay you $21&#x2F;year; I could pay it in 21 $1 payments.)')
