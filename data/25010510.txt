The question isn&#x27;t whether Silicon Valley can do better. The answer to that is trivially yes. We can all do better.<p>The question is, is the quality of management in Silicon Valley worse than it is in other industries and other locations. I would argue no. I would argue that the quality of management in Silicon Valley is <i>at worst</i> average, and is likely above average. In Silicon Valley, workers have far more bargaining power than they have in other areas of the country, and, as a result, if the management is truly awful, they&#x27;ll simply leave.<p>That&#x27;s not true elsewhere. If you&#x27;re working for say, Epic Systems in Madison, Wisconsin, and you have a bad manager, what are your options? Sure, you can quit... and go work for who else, exactly? The employee&#x27;s next-best opportunity isn&#x27;t nearly as valuable, so management can get away with being less competent.<p>This isn&#x27;t a theoretical consideration, either. I&#x27;ve moved from the West Coast to the Midwest, for family and cost of living reasons, and one of the things I&#x27;ve noticed is that the management here just really isn&#x27;t as good, especially with regards to software projects, as it is on the West Coast. Partially that&#x27;s down to the companies here being less software oriented than they are on the West Coast. But I would also argue that a significant part of it is that the management here is simply less competent.')
