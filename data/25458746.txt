It has a concept of &quot;filters&quot; that are applied in &quot;chains&quot; over &quot;blocks&quot;. One filter happens to be &quot;lzma2&quot;, but to say xz &quot;uses lzma2&quot; is a bit of a confusing mental model, as xz could just as easily &quot;use zstd&quot; if someone allocated a filter ID for such.)')
