I believe in the “first amendment” which includes freedom of association including for the non-government people that create venues and platforms. “We have the right to refuse service to anyone” as seen on any shop any where.<p>If you would like Congress to create a new regulation on interstate commerce preventing internet platforms from doing some particular thing, then articulate that specific position.<p>I am absolutely not bothered the current reality, it is the expected reality and I would like the same privileges on my own venues and platforms.')
