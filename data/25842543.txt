Big red button on the taskbar that you can choose to turn on for a given application or url on demand. Would be great if the OS would log access to the devices too.<p>The browsers are over trusted for things like this and should never have direct access. Google Meet after a crash or the browser was shutdown and restarted with all the old tabs would open up your meeting again hidden behind a bunch of other tabs. No one was ever on them long after the meeting but it was freaky. This isn&#x27;t the behaviour that I&#x27;ve seen recently thankfully.')
