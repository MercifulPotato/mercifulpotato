That’s because Robinhood gets forced to increase collateral with everyone they do business with, everyone try’s to pull their funds out, and Robinhood  files an instant bankruptcy. Meaning customers get paid a fraction of their accounts years from now.<p>He didn’t lie, he mislead. And he did it for you.<p>Edit: Actually to correct myself, Robinhood accounts are insured, so customers accounts are at no risk in a bankruptcy. It may have meant you couldn’t sell your shares for months, while GME slowly works its way back to $20, so I think the point about bankruptcy hurting customers stands.')
