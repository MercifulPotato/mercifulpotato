If you&#x27;re a member of Teams across multiple organisations or, god forbid, multiple accounts, the Electron version is basically useless. You only get notifications from the org you&#x27;re actively using, and you can&#x27;t switch accounts without completely signing out of one and into the other.<p>The iPad version just lists all accounts and all orgs in the sidebar, no trouble.')
