There are plenty of reasons to bash on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and PoW, and you&#x27;re great at articulating them; however, completely discounting the work of thousands upon thousands of open source developers is getting kind of tired.<p>Also, I think what most cryptocurrency detractors are missing in terms of a mental block is an understanding of just how big the world&#x27;s shadow economy is.<p>For arguments sake, tell me what you think is &quot;better&quot; than cryptocurrency for dark net market transactions.<p>Always happy to discuss :).')
