I have noticed that video games with cooldowns tend to agree with me; some ability has a 4 second cooldown, you press it, and the UI says &quot;4&quot;, even though 3.999 seconds remain until the ability is back.  (This means that you never see &quot;0&quot;; the counter reads &quot;1&quot; for the last second before the cooldown is available again.)')
