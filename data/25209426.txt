Next time your sister brings the topic up say &quot;yeah right&quot; and move on.<p>Don&#x27;t worry, that&#x27;s why I emphasised the loving relationship part, we really don&#x27;t take our political opinions into this and wouldn&#x27;t have emotional fights about them. Family comes before all that.')
