Of different flavours, textures, ingredients, sources?<p>You&#x27;re taking a very obvious example of &#x27;lack of choice&#x27; and trying to spin it as an example of choice?<p>The government says &#x27;we can only have 1 type of SUV, 1 type of Truck and 1 type of Sedan&#x27; - and this would be &#x27;choice&#x27;?<p>No, that&#x27;s absurd, I can&#x27;t really think you meant to actually write that.<p>As for &#x27;towing&#x27; - you&#x27;re mixing my metaphors here.<p>The &#x27;Golden Gate&#x27; towing situation is an example of &#x27;single point of failure&#x27; where there probably needs to be intervention, I was merely explaining how that &#x27;special towing service&#x27; they have might very well be extremely inefficient. None of that example really folds over into the &#x27;regular market&#x27; for towing&#x27;.<p>So yes - you have indicated that &#x27;towing will be competitive&#x27; - but that&#x27;s literally the artifact of the industry that keeps it efficient. When there is &#x27;overcapacity&#x27; it adjusts, likewise &#x27;underapacity&#x27; - it adjusts.<p>Those artifacts of the &#x27;invisible hand of the market&#x27; are the literal functions that help us do price discovery and understand &#x27;how much people are willing to pay&#x27; for stuff.<p>Any industry can be taken over by the mafia - more likely than not, it depends on the kinds of people involved in the work. You local drug R&amp;D company is probably not going to be related to the Mafia. The &#x27;Auto Shop&#x27; is full of the kinds of people who may &#x27;know someone who knows someone&#x27; and since it&#x27;s small business, local, it&#x27;s more amenable to problems - but so are many industries.<p>Fighting the Mafia is no excuse to socialize.<p>At no point has the OP or yourself really given a good reason for why, systematically, towing should be socialized - again - the GG example is a very special case, not a general one.<p>Finally, yes, &#x27;Government run liquor stores&#x27; were enabled in to help control the distribution of alcohol, so there is a historical social externalization there, but that&#x27;s a very long gone artifact of history. It hasn&#x27;t been relevant for 50 years.<p>In reality, there is no difference between distributional impact of social behaviour in Alberta &#x2F; BC &#x2F; California (open sales) or Quebec &#x2F; Ontario &#x2F; Sweden (Government sales). So it&#x27;s not an argument, just a historical artefact.<p>The government is materially &#x27;not succeeding&#x27; in 2020 to do anything with respect to social policy whereas the other social cost: expensive alcohol and lack of choice, is a material cost.<p>There&#x27;s no reason for them to exist, they exist because of incumbency and the guild of people involve who benefit from it over others.')
