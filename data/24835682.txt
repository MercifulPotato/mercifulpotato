The RAF was the first line. To invade, the germans would have had to have eliminated the RAF, then eliminate the navy (bear in mind that at this point its still twice as big as anyone elses, and that uboats are still not very good at this point)<p>Not only that they&#x27;d have to somehow get across the channel (which given that the germans didn&#x27;t like standardisation and were nowhere near as mechanised as the french, would have been a challenge)<p>Plus they&#x27;d have to over come the anti air defences.<p>The _only_ doubt about WWII is whether britian would have signed a peace treaty.')
