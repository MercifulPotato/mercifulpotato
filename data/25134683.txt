This is the 1000th time a government has said &quot;no action today but maybe in a decade&quot;. That signals no action. That&#x27;s the same signal markets have been given for several decades now.<p>I am happy to admit this is a complex issue, one that needs a global solution, an expensive one, maybe an unsolvable one.<p>But we also have to admit that so far no action has been taken. And this isn&#x27;t action either.<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m asking for here: let&#x27;s all be honest for this thread and admit this is worthless and we&#x27;re running out of time and we either need to make hard choices OR admit we&#x27;re not going to fix it...')
