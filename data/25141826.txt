So, no, they&#x27;ve fairly explicitly abandoned the original purpose.<p>They retained functionality has a more limited purpose, which I would describe as providing a vehicle for the user&#x2F;browser&#x2F;OS to provide defaults which pages&#x2F;apps can reference, which when provided by the OS, minimize aesthetic clash and preserve contrast&#x2F;accessibility between the page&#x2F;app features and native UI without disguising the nature of the web page&#x2F;web app, rather than actually mimicing native system UI.')
