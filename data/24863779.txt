The syntax between the two is similar, but not identical, as can be said for several other &quot;plain text markup&quot; formats that are, you know, not Markdown. (Like Textile, which was also not created by Aaron Swartz.) Not insignificantly, the original Perl script that implements Markdown was John Gruber&#x27;s. It functions as a plugin for the Perl-based Movable Type blog engine because that&#x27;s what Daring Fireball uses. Swartz wrote atx, by contrast, in his preferred programming language of Python.<p>So, to be factual: John Gruber created Markdown.')
