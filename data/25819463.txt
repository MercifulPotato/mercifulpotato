Dark energy refers to a factor that increases the expansion of the universe, ie a cosmological constant.<p>Dark matter on the other hand is matter we can’t detect currently, but we theorize is there from its gravitational effects.<p>There’s a lot of other data like galaxy rotation rates, CMB, gravitational lensing, etc that effect dark matter estimates. I’m not sure how much of the current estimate is based on larger observable universe structure, so it’s an interesting question.')
