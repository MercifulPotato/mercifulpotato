You&#x27;re implying that you got a 25% raise to move to SF and were able to life off of only 20% of your new salary?<p>I&#x27;m not comparing average middle of nowhere salary to SF, I&#x27;m saying that for remote workers you typically get something like 80% of an SF salary, typically dramatically higher than most locals get for similar work. Were I lived I was still easily making double what most other tech people in the area were paid.<p>Getting double or triple your old salary will of course make the move to SF worth it. But if you can work in the FL pan handle for just 20% less than you make know, you&#x27;ll live amazingly.')
