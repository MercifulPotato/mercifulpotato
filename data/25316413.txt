Just this morning I read a recent Kottke post and noticed he&#x27;s got a shop set up on bookshop.org, and so decided to check it out – it&#x27;s a site that says they help small local bookstores. Great! But I prefer e-books, and the only way I can consume ebooks through this service (or through kobo’s similar “support local bookstores” marketplace) is to use their terrible apps (I know, I know, you who are reading this find Kobo’s app to be just fine, but I’m picky and don&#x27;t like it) so Apple Books or Kindle it is, all because of DRM.<p>I know from their perspective it&#x27;s a calculus – they&#x27;ll lose some money to piracy, and maybe that adds up to a lot more from what they&#x27;d gain from selling to persnickety people like me, so maybe they&#x27;re making the right call. But what I want as a consumer is to sometimes buy hardbacks, mostly buy ebooks, read them in the reader of my choice, and to support my local bookshop and the authors and editors, which I guess is an impossible dream.')
