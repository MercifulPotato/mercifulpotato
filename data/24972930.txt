Convert it to public and access it as such.<p>2. Remove it.<p>3. Leave it alone, possibly intending to privately access it in the future if they can re-subscribe.  (It&#x27;d seem reasonable to me if a service provider opted to automatically delete inaccessible content after some time-out period of non-subscription; I&#x27;d see their retention of such inaccessible content as a professional courtesy rather than an obligation of theirs unless the contract says otherwise.)<p>Then I&#x27;d think that a good service would offer migration tools to help make these options easier on the customer.  For example, offer an easy option to make everything public or delete everything.<p>But it&#x27;s hard for me to see how forcing publication upon canceling a service could be defensible without some sort of contractual provision to that effect.')
