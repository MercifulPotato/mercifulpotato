The product launch was delayed due to the contractor  and thus the government lost lots of revenue from tolls. A 15 year long fight with the owners of the company ensued. Maybe they wanted to avoid that by just putting a large pile of cash onto the table, ensuring that SAP+DTG put their best people behind it. Delays in COVID-App deployment cost real lives instead of just revenue.<p>It&#x27;s great that it worked nice in Italy, but giving the contract to a random startup is more of a gamble I think.')
