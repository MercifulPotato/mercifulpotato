I&#x27;d imagine an offering like the suggested one would have some kind of: a) UI to inspect the state of other clouds, b) provisioning capability that allows creation of resources in other clouds.<p>On the UI front:<p>- AWS UI toolkit has aged by this point and each day it feels more dated<p>- CloudFormation, as their main cloud management UI is particularly bad (e.g. limited info on what caused a problem, not displaying ARNs of resources belonging to a stack systematically etc.)<p>On the provisioning front:<p>- Terraform and Pulumi are so much better than anything AWS offers, and that says something because even these tools are not great.')
