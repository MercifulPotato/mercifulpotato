I&#x27;ll call out Fauci for not sounding the alarm on this one. He&#x27;s mostly been preachy about what to do and what not to do. In September, he should have been pushing for cheap rapid tests behind the scenes. In November, he should have started saying &quot;stay home if you can, but we know you&#x27;re going to want to see family, so we made it super easy to get tested.&quot;<p>Fauci has basically been following the sex-ed abstinence script, and it&#x27;s well-documented how well that works.')
