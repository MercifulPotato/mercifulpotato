We got it to watch a few big name films and shows that we weren&#x27;t so keen on that we were going to buy them on disc (which we did, and still do, for &quot;keepers&quot;).<p>When they started making their own shows, I watched a few, but nearly all of them ended up disappointing either immediately or after jumping the shark within a season or two. The words &quot;Netflix Originals&quot; are now a synonym in my mind for &quot;probably won&#x27;t be worth it, let&#x27;s watch something else&quot;. Frankly, I don&#x27;t even bother scanning that list on the home page for stuff to watch any more, unless I&#x27;m looking for a specific show that I already have reason to think I&#x27;ll enjoy.')
