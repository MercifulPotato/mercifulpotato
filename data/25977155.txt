If you buy a kindle book from Amazon, regardless of legal details, it&#x27;s fairly &quot;yours&quot; and just as is the case with a physical book, you should have the right and inclination to strip off its DRM and then use it across devices as you please, even send a copy or two to friends. The right because you bought it, just like you&#x27;d have once bought a paper book, and the inclination because as we&#x27;ve seen with many cases of sealed digital content &quot;ownership&quot; platforms in the past, buyers have a funny way of suddenly losing everything they supposedly own. Stripping DRM removes  both problems completely and, yes, it&#x27;s usually very easy to do using perfectly legal software like Calibre, for example.')
