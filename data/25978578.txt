When I Google &quot;Mattermost vs Matrix&quot; (because I&#x27;ll be honest, they seem the same to me as a casual) the insta-Google popup result&#x2F;excerpt inline is this article:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.troopmessenger.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;mattermost-vs-matrix" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.troopmessenger.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;mattermost-vs-matrix</a><p>That&#x27;s a year old, so Google isn&#x27;t doing y&#x27;all a service by highlighting that as it&#x27;s insta-hit, we need something updated out there for 2021 for Google to latch onto.<p>I&#x27;ve created a Mattermost account for Rocky stuff and honestly, as a casual I can&#x27;t tell why I&#x27;d want one vs. the other, they seem pretty much the same to me (even the UI is kinda the same). Matrix touts a lot of extra privacy stuff I think, that&#x27;s about it...<p>$0.02 from the peanut gallery! :) I&#x27;m just using web clients and not the mobile clients (per my preference for this stuff) and use app.element.io as a comparison.')
