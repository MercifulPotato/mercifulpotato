They take in base textures&#x2F;resources (NB: a &quot;texture&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily correspond in any straightforward way to the final image, and shouldn&#x27;t be thought of as an &quot;image&quot; except in the mathematical sense) and apply all sorts of processes to get a good looking final result.<p>Not everything can be procedurally generated on the fly (at least with a small algorithm that would run quickly enough on a GPU). At a certain point just providing compressed bitmaps becomes more efficient, especially since GPUs are highly specialised to work with exactly those. Everything is a tradeoff in real time graphics.')
