I manage a handful of projects (10+ websites) and won&#x27;t touch Elastic with a 10 foot pole now that they aren&#x27;t Apache anymore. It actually doesn&#x27;t matter how much they yell about their &quot;intent.&quot; â€“ It&#x27;s an unproven license with some restrictions and I don&#x27;t even want the headache and cost of having to talk to lawyers about why &quot;it&#x27;ll be fine!!&quot; or even waste a minute during a meeting about the license impacts of solving any of the problems we face.<p>The ambiguity is just simply not worth the cognitive overhead. I have enough to worry about without this silly game Elastic&#x27;s playing where we (customers, users) are left having to figure out the legal ambiguities and wink-winks of their new license.<p>And right now, we&#x27;re actively searching&#x2F;researching a self-hosted log analysis solution. And we&#x27;ve been looking at Elastic&#x27;s offering and comparing it to self-hosting. Not anymore.')
