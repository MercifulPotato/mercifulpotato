I am on the other side - excessively academic. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that understanding something does not equal having working knowledge of it (knowing how to implement it, etc.), a person with a theoretical background would often try to place a concept within a large framework and then make it owrk, an &#x27;empiricist&#x27; or tinkerer would work the way from the bottom which would result in actual useful results. I sometimes ponder about this, and while I don&#x27;t mean that one should invent the wheel, my conclusion is that In order to have an approach of knowing what would work in many different problems, a person with academic background would need to spend years delving into their discipline. The solution seems to have a combination of both approaches or as Nassim Taleb says, &#x27;street+personal library&#x27;.')
