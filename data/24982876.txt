The model itself is actually pretty solid. That is, everything it describes is something a good organization should do, and the requirement to document the processes + train people is a sound one.<p>But the appraisals and how most businesses treat it are, well, moronic.<p>The appraisals are easily gamed so that if you do everything on paper you&#x27;re pretty much going to get your target level (3 is good enough for 99% of contracts if matters at all). And businesses try to treat the model as a process, when it&#x27;s not.<p>The former means that the appraisal results are useless. You cannot judge anyone by being level 3 or 5. That often just means they played the game better, not that they&#x27;re actually better.<p>The latter, though, is the worst part. CMMI is broken into a number of process areas (I&#x27;m happy to report I no longer recall the number of areas). It describes them in psuedo-process or procedural terms. That is, you <i>could</i> take what they describe and make a process, but it would be a very linear and simple process. What&#x27;s intended is for you to say how <i>your process</i> maps to <i>their model</i>.<p>But organizations don&#x27;t do that, they do moronic things instead like scrap the above and write a whole new document that&#x27;s 40 pages of nothing but plagiarizing the CMMI book saying how they do things, but it&#x27;s almost entirely a lie because no one (except the sacrificial team sent to be appraised) actually does it that way.')
