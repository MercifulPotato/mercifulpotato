I am seeing way too many small orgs&#x2F;teams use Kubernetes to orchestrate dozens and even sub-dozens of machines. From the perspective of solving for sub-dozens to thousands, I think there is some merit to TFA&#x27;s perspective, even if it doesn&#x27;t match the Kubernetes use-case you describe.')
