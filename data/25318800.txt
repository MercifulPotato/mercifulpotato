I used to work out quite a bit but could never get into running and sought other cardio exercises - literally anything that wasn&#x27;t running.<p>Over time school, then work, then life simply got in the way and my exercise lapsed. Now in middle age I worked up a minor health issue and my doctor strongly encouraged me to start up on cardio again -- this coincided with both the start of COVID lockdowns and wasn&#x27;t long after a move to an area with lots of trails nearby.<p>So I started walking about an hour 3 times a week as weather permitted. Health condition went away, blood pressure dropped, mood improved, sleep improved. I also started enjoying the changing of the seasons more, enjoying nature, being outdoors and all that. I started feeling like eating crap wasn&#x27;t &quot;right&quot; and started eating better. It&#x27;s like an entire cascade of wellness.<p>Not once have I gone for a walk and thought &quot;I&#x27;d rather not be doing this&quot; like with running. In fact I usually look forward to my walk and look for excuses to go on one.<p>Turns out I should have just gone walking all the time instead.')
