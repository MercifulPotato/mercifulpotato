That is known since the Battle of Thermopylae but maybe getting lost from time to time. There is also a lot of military tech that is trying to prevent soldiers from shooting themselves in the foot, which fails from time to time.<p>We also know that just adding more developers to project is not increasing velocity and that small focused teams outperform large teams by orders of magnitude.<p>Problem we have to tackle are big orgs that need a lot of code and have high dev turnover. That is why frameworks like angular and tools first are so important, they help to scale code better than plain code or plain js.')
