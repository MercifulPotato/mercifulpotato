The problem is you can only use it if you provide a phone number.<p>So I guess that&#x27;s a way to enforce that users have only one account (or a small number).<p>I have a dozen accounts. I don&#x27;t really use most of them a whole lot. And all but 2 of them have very small amount of data stored.
