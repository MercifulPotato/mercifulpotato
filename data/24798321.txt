While I agree it&#x27;s not possible from here to prove it&#x27;s false, it&#x27;s borderline lunacy and is clearly a fraudulently created attempt to firebomb Biden&#x27;s campaign at the last minute just like what worked with Hillary last time. The Republicans wouldn&#x27;t care nearly as much about this story that the FBI itself dropped if they weren&#x27;t so panicked about losing the election and reaching for yet another vote manipulation tactic.')
