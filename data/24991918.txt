I write down a list of key points, and I write down a list of topics I&#x27;m not as familiar I&#x27;d like to be with, including breaking expectations.<p>I go further and I google around investigating this list learning more on the topics beyond what the paper has to say.<p>This style may or may not be ideal for you, but it works well for me.  Highlighting has always, for me, been not very helpful when compared to taking notes and getting a more solid understanding by combining sources of information on the topic when possible.')
