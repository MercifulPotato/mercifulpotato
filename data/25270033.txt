Your also stuck in a tighter situation when it does occur.<p>With years of colocation I have never encountered a power-out event within the datacentre. That&#x27;s a potential seven years of uptime if I hadn&#x27;t changed providers in-between.<p>Nor have I ever suffered a corrupt filesystems and that includes myself preforming DR monthly via sudden power-loss cold-boots. Sure I accidentally deleted &#x2F;etc&#x2F; once.<p>The only issue out-standing is a failed RAM stick however it&#x27;s a poorly server which I&#x27;m retiring in the new year. Poor thing.')
