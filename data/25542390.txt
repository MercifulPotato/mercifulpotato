Since I use multiplatform libraries all active development and debugging happens actually on Windows. I maintain parallel project for CodeLite and makefile on Linux. Normally after I satisfied with the results on Windows I just click a button that triggers my build&#x2F;test&#x2F;deploy pipeline. From here all happens automatically but if the tests on Linux fail I would then fire up CodeLite to debug and find the reason. Mind you during last year I only had to do it twice. If I add&#x2F;remove files &#x2F; libraries this would be another reason to launch CodeLite to adjust Linux project accordingly. In theory I could do this on using CMake but it is simply not worth it for me.<p>I tried CLion and bugs &#x2F; crashes with debugging and some other parts (do not remember exactly as it&#x27;s been a while) prevented me from using it. Was not fond of its sluggishness either.')
