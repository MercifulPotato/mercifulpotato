I&#x27;m not, for sure.<p>This is a rational position for folks like us who a) work to live, and b) probably haven&#x27;t built anything to the level of the second most popular language in the world.<p>Now say you&#x27;re Guido. I don&#x27;t know him, but I feel like we&#x27;re on a first name basis. Guido is clearly driven to invent, and has developed one of the major building blocks of modern tech. He&#x27;s probably set for life financially, but Guido has the urge to innovate. Along comes Microsoft, who basically is paying him to do whatever he wants, however he wants. If you&#x27;re Guido, you take that.<p>Now if you&#x27;re me (and it sounds like probably you too), we don&#x27;t have those kinds of offers, and I personally don&#x27;t have that specific drive either. Ideal retirement for me is more time in my yard and also probably spending the cold months starting app projects that I&#x27;ll never finish. The way life should be!')
