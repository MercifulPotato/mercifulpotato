Item(by='Al-Khwarizmi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610882078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25809630, text='Again, I think from a shallow perspective it makes sense.<p>If an algorithm always runs in O(n^3), then it&#x27;s guaranteed that it runs in O(n^3) in the worst case. And if an algorithm runs in O(n^3) in the worst case, then it&#x27;s guaranteed to always run in O(n^3) (but not in Î˜(n^3), of course). So if you only care about worst-case performance, it&#x27;s reasonable to only use the big O.<p>Of course, what your parent comment says is also true - you could say that mergesort is O(2^n), in the worst case or in any other case, and be correct because it&#x27;s an upper bound. But people using Big Oh informally don&#x27;t say that because you typically want to show how good your algorithm is, so you use the tightest upper bound possible (i.e. the big theta of the worst case).')
