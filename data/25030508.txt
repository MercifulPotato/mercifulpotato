Item(by='stubish', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604883970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25021908, text='&#x27;Price they&#x27;re willing to accept&#x27; is interesting. Here, Spotify is $1&#x2F;month more than Netflix. And $4&#x2F;month more than Amazon Prime. This makes Spotify look very overpriced, since intuitively we think Video &amp; Movies should be more expensive than Music. My gut feel is Spotify needs to be priced a lot cheaper for general acceptance, because people don&#x27;t evaluate pricing of these services in a vacuum. I think this is why households are subscribing to two or three video streaming services, but not Spotify.')
