I knew a kid in high school who had aspergers and he tried to be a witty comedian, but it was just bad and grating.  He had a hard time dating, a hunchback, bad hygiene and from my impression, average academics and below average physical ability, I really felt sorry for him.  ASD does not give you an IQ boost, maybe at most an obsessiveness which can help you have the will to practice more.<p>0. I like ASD better because aspergers sounds like ass-burgers TBH and once explained it makes people understand immediately that you have various degrees of it.')
