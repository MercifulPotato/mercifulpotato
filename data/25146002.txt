Judge people by what they do, and not what they say.<p>While corporations like FaceBook would purport to have liberal values, in reality they hold these beliefs only insofar as it furthers their own financial well-being. While the elites in this company seek to concentrate wealth and power, those at the bottom receive scorn and poor working conditions. Image having to work such an emotionally draining job, and not being given the mere dignity of being a full-time employee.<p>This sounds rather dehumanizing in my view. You are just there for labor, and they will do everything they can to minimize the amount of monetary value that they provide to you. This means humane working conditions, inclusion, respect, and psychological support and are all liabilities for them.')
