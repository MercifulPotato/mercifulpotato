Many thanks!<p>Congrats to JeanHeyd for the perseverance &amp; not trying to take away anything from it as it&#x27;s an accomplishment. I do want to discuss how long changes take to land in C++.<p>For something as relatively straightforward &amp; non-controversial as P0330 that took 8 revisions, how do other languages compare? Do changes to Python, Rust, Go, or Swift take this much effort?')
