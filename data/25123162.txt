But said &quot;we don&#x27;t store any of your data&quot;. Not sure how, maybe encrypted at rest so it&#x27;s not possible for them to gleam info... Would that still be profitable somehow? Not sure if data storing is where most of the money comes from, specifically Trello. I use Trello too now having doubts if I should detail out aspects of my life.<p>Admittedly I have built my own note-taking type apps however can&#x27;t deny the interface of Trello so convenient.')
