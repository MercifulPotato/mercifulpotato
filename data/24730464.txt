We do stand on the shoulders of giants, and you will not be able to verify centuries of scientific progress all on your own, from first principles.<p>Absolutely.  You cannot verify everything.  One should try though, at least where possible.  Of course we cannot verify everything.  We should also get used to saying &#x27;I don&#x27;t know&#x27; rather than presenting hearsay as truth.<p>When one has not verified a thing, one should be open about the level of knowledge we have.  It is absolutely acceptable not to know everything.  It is not acceptable to carelessly relay what might be lies.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that we stand on the shoulders of giants.  I don&#x27;t have any heroes.  I stand by own judgement alone.<p>The way I see it, if we don&#x27;t verify a thing, we should not accept it.  We simply say we don&#x27;t know, that we are working on a hypothesis.  We should explicitly state our assumptions and gratefully receive correction.  We can say that &#x27;such and such is the common consensus but that I have not proven this to myself&#x27;.  We should let a modicum of doubt be expressed in what we say, if there is a modicum of doubt in what  we are stating.<p>You can even consider this from a spiritual perspective.  If you erroneously believe something to be true, but in fact it is a lie, but you repeat it, are you a liar too?  Are you stating a case that you shouldn&#x27;t be stating?  I think so.  I think not living and breathing truth, you are relaying unverified hearsay.  I think is in fact lying.  It is careless use of language, and misleads the next person as you were misled yourself.<p>I love to recommend this video, that I think accurately expresses the problem we have in trying to determine truth:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nFLs6nufCj4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nFLs6nufCj4</a>')
