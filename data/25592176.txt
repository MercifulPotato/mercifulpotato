I find that the internet in my own language is very low quality compared to online content in English. If I go to a bookstore, probably 70% or more is translations of books originally written in English. So I prefer to just buy the original on Amazon. There are entire subjects I only &quot;know&quot; in English. Every once in a while, when having a conversation about one of those subjects, I just can&#x27;t find the right words in my language. I think it happens to a lot of people here and everywhere in the world.')
