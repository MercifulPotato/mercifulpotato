Just squats, pushups, rows (I have a TRX), and dips. All bodyweight, easy to do at home (harder in the office if you&#x27;re in a shared space, but you could always take an hourly break to walk somewhere better than the desk and do this, only takes a couple minutes). Paired with running, I trimmed down a lot during the summer (then two injuries related to neither running nor this exercising stalled me).<p>I also enjoy baking and picked it up a few years ago. But I didn&#x27;t gain any weight because I&#x27;d take almost everything to the office or parties. Neither of which are really options for me right now so I avoid it, or occasionally give something to the neighbors I do like.')
