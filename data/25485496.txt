Have had no real problems in the 50ish hours I have in.  A little sluggish through some of the open world parts until I dialed the graphics back to &quot;high&quot;.<p>I think part of the problem here is they are trying to include beautiful effects like ray tracing for the newest machines, but have to also support 7 year old previous gen consoles as well.  With the new Series X and PS5 consoles only recently on the market, this is a tough time to release a big title - because the player base is overwhelmingly not on those new consoles, and that&#x27;s too much of a market to lose.')
