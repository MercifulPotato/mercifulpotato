Also, I’m not a mobile app developer&#x2F;administrator so forgive me if I sound ignorant.<p>I’ve only read a few bits and pieces so I have a few questions.<p>1. Does getting booted off AWS actually mean the end of the service? Somebody sent me some quote about how the software was built to run on bare metal servers, so are they having difficulty getting servers at OVH&#x2F;Linode&#x2F;DO&#x2F;whatever? I know that Amazon is HUGE but it’d be a trip (and HIGHLY worrisome) if they actually dictate who gets to be on the internet as a whole.<p>2. Again, never dealt with apps. I’ve 100% always dealt with clients using  websites, packaged software, email, phone calls etc. Is user behavior and&#x2F;or mobile browser design such that having a mobile-friendly interface (like mobile.twitter.com) that’s entirely under Parker’s control an untenable way to run the service?<p>Maybe I’m just old but I’ve grown up as a huge fan of bookmarks and still make heavy use of them today, even on mobile. I don’t install almost anything on my phone unless the app is a huge value add like VR&#x2F;AR stuff or the Audubon bird guide that I can use offline.<p>I suppose my overall question is: Is this irreparable? If so, that’s pretty terrifying.')
