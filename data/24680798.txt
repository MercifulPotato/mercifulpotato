Item(by='xoa', descendants=None, kids=[24685532, 24681580], score=None, time=1601833502, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24680616, text='&gt;<i>The fact remains that the ultimate responsibility for what goes into the body of a functioning adult who is not coerced in any way lies solely with that adult.</i><p>This is horseshit sneak. You <i>know</i> it&#x27;s horseshit. You&#x27;re on HN, you deal with tech all the time. Would you say that responsibility for any security flaws or leaks in software lies solely with the &quot;functioning adult who is not coerced in any way to install it&quot;? Individually we&#x27;re humans, we have fixed brain size and thermodynamics and thus have hard absolute limits on the total amount of information we can ever know and much much tighter limits on the rate at which we can ingest new information, process it, or make decisions. It is impossible for a human brain to be in charge of everything in modern society. IMPOSSIBLE. There is not enough time in a day, not enough days in a lifetime, to learn more than the tiniest fraction of what all of us use constantly. We deal with that by massively externalizing onto other people&#x2F;organizations and trust frameworks, and then working to ensure there can be enough confidence in those.<p>So responsibility is absolutely a spectrum, in medicine, in tech, everywhere. We cannot verify it all ourselves. Something must involve external relationships, and those external relationships are <i>themselves two way</i> aren&#x27;t they? In a relationship, BOTH sides have responsibilities.<p>&gt;<i>We fault the individual when they don&#x27;t take their medicine. Why do we fault their physician when they do?</i><p>Um, because it&#x27;s a two-way relationship? The patient&#x27;s part of it is to seek external expertise, and then follow through on expert instructions. The medical expert&#x27;s part of it is to faithfully give instructions that are wholly in the patient&#x27;s best interests to the best of their knowledge and capability, without any self-interest beyond the remuneration the patient offers for said service.<p>&gt;<i>Your doctor is NOT the authority on what goes into your body: you are.</i><p>As vacuous as claiming car manufacturers are not the authority on what you drive or it should be fine for food&#x2F;medicine&#x2F;anything manufacturers to lie about what goes into their products because hey, your fault for not verifying it. No, that&#x27;s not how any of this works.')
