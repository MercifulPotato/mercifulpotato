IIRC, the BMC was logging &quot;correctable memory errors&quot;, but I may be misremembering that.<p>&quot;We&#x27;ve run this test on every server we&#x27;ve gotten from you, including several others that were exactly the same config as this, this is the only one that&#x27;s ever thrown errors&quot;.  Usually support is really great, but they really didn&#x27;t care in this case.<p>We finally contacted sales.  &quot;Uh, how long do we have to return this server for a refund?&quot;  All of a sudden support was willing to ship us out a replacement memory module (memtest86 identified which slot was having the problem), which resolved the problem.<p>They were all too willing to have us go to production relying on ECC to handle the memory error.')
