The fact I can change how cpu&#x2F;mem&#x2F;disk&#x2F;etc is limited per apps (cgroups), or globally to use less power... (I get +20FPS to reliability and stability hit 60Fps in OverWatch cause of this, I don&#x27;t think this PC could run OW on windows nicely at all)\nI use xdotool to automate all the things...\nI play with filesystems, audio (I still haven&#x27;t seen any other system as good as mine for making my ears never bleed).\nIt also handles faulty HW perfectly fine, I can reload it, restart it, etc, isolated to just that component.\nIt handles old HW very well.\nDrivers for everything I&#x27;ve ever tried always without any hassle (Albeit windows seems to have improved this.)\nI can also disable the CPU mitigations and get a bunch of performance back... as my desktop PC doesn&#x27;t run untrusted code.. nor have services accessible.<p>Windows goes bizzerk within a week every week and somehow just maxes out my work laptop&#x2F;desktops CPU for no apparent reason... needing reboots to fix it.\nWindows updates ruin all long-running tasks (like, unittests).. and unitTests cannot be run at low priority, cause they still effect normal priority apps way too much...\nIf you start playing with low level systems in it, it&#x27;ll just start blue screening .\nMS telemetry... Ad&#x27;s on desktop...\nA LOT of crap I don&#x27;t care about comes with it and runs by default.. vs ~32Mb of ram usage by the time I hit desktop.')
