The most basic use of stackoverflow (other than arriving through a web search) is to use its own search bar to search for something. Every time I do so, it asks for a captcha. It would make some sense to ask for a captcha when asking or answering a question, but why ask for a captcha when searching? And it&#x27;s always the first search after opening the browser (the browser is set up to clear cookies on close), so it&#x27;s not some sort of rate limiting.')
