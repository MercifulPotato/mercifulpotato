Then because they control a large part of The OS and applications they rewrote the underlying macOS libraries and the applications to make use of these specific co processors. They were able to achieve this because they are vertically integrated.<p>When AMD would switch to RISC they could also create a huge out of order capable cpu but would be lacking the co processors plus the tight integration and if they could add them they would lack the capability to drive and dictate that the cpu would be used in the most performant way.<p>So it seems to me that Apple is perfectly aligned to take a  large part of the market and AMD as a general purpose cpu designer will need to come with a very competitive cpu either on x86 (ZenX) or on RISC to stay competitive. They can outsource the fabrication the chips. Intel meanwhile with its owned fabs has a lot more inertia and ego to turn around.<p>On the other hand, maybe AMD or Intel will find a way to increase the re-order buffer and the amount of “splicer” (I forgot the official name for the unit that takes the instruction code and translates it into chunks of microcode).')
