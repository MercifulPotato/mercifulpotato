A voter registration of a T R D* in the Detroit area in the 1970s<p>2. A death certificate for T R D from the 1980s<p>3. A record of a T R D voting in the Detroit area in the 2020 election.<p>That&#x27;s because T R D from #1 and #2 was my uncle, who grew up in the Detroit area, and died in the 1980s; and the T R D from #3 is my brother, who also grew up in the Detroit area, and is still alive and well.<p>It turns out that 1) a lot of people are named after their relatives.  And also, 2) a lot of people still live where those relatives lived.  And, 3) a lot of those relatives, being from the previous generation, have died.  Any intersection of #2 and #3 will give you the &quot;evidence of dead people on the voter rolls&quot; (or &quot;evidence of dead people voting&quot;) that we&#x27;ve been hearing so much about.<p>How big is that intersection in a state with 10 million people?<p>(* Full name redacted, but I have a very specific T R D in mind)')
