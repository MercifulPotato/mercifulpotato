There are Kantians who do the same.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with either. In my view, the kinds of arguments they make are not even valid kinds of arguments.<p>&gt; believe in moral reletavism or moral objectivism<p>I&#x27;m neither of those things, nor do I think they are valid positions.<p>I realize that it&#x27;s a bit unfair for me to just say that and leave it there, but I can only spend so much time discussing this on HN.<p>&gt; We&#x27;re not talking about rights, we&#x27;re talking about moral consideration.<p>OK. I wouldn&#x27;t modify the substance of what I&#x27;ve said even if I accept that. (Though I don&#x27;t actually agree with this way of separating out the problem space).<p>On the citations of Singer&#x2F;various Kantians&#x2F;etc.:<p>It&#x27;s not my intention to talk past you, it&#x27;s just that if you say &quot;well, $BIGTEXT has a good argument!&quot;, that&#x27;s not really the kind of thing we can discuss efficiently here. I can make very simple and direct arguments for my views without pointing to some $BIGTEXT.<p>There is nothing <i>wrong</i> with pointing to $BIGTEXT. In fact, somebody might say &quot;Aha! Now I know I need to go read $BIGTEXT.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s just that we can&#x27;t really &quot;go there&quot; efficiently on HN. It&#x27;s better if you can make simple and direct arguments, so that people can actually grapple with them.<p>But I know that is not always possible (and this time, I&#x27;ll grant you, probably isn&#x27;t, if your views happen to agree with some of the people you&#x27;ve cited).')
