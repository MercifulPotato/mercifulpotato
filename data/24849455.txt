Further, they now are so heavily biased in results in so many ways, they are actively harming consumers.<p>By slowly cornering off huge areas of the web, tilting favor, inlining answers into search, releasing free competitors (assistants, cloud, email, maps, docs, travel, shop, the list goes on and on) they’ve flat out killed more potential business than any other company I can think of.<p>I actually think about this often, if Google had real competition I really believe we’d be in a renaissance.
