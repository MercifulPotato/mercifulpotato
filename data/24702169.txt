In 2016, some swing states were poorly polled, so they were flying kind of blind on those.<p>And, of course, a few tens of thousands of votes different on the day, below the margin of error of any poll, and no-one would be bothered about them. In a way, 538 can&#x27;t win here; they said &quot;there&#x27;s a 30% chance of this thing happening&quot;, it happened, based on differences below the resolution that they could even see at, and everyone&#x27;s annoyed with them.')
