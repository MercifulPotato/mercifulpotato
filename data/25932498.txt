Not to imply that Sanders didn&#x27;t previously support BLM, but he rhetoric changed after that. It was clear to me that Sanders thought the primary issue was class and that by addressing that we would improve everyone&#x27;s life who was affected by the economic troubles due to the issues you mention. It&#x27;s almost as if someone has something to gain by splitting us apart rather than letting everyone focus on their common issues.')
