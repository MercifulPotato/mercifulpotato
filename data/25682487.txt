Or read back its binary data.<p>Hard drives can be demagnetized, and its controller board will eventually fail. This is its Achilles Heel.<p>Flash drives can get electrocuted and fried.<p>Tape is still magnetic, but it separates the reader and writer device, from the actual medium. But it’s too large and cumbersome.<p>Something like a MEMS storage device, will be fully solid state. Fully enclosed. Electrically neutral. Magnetically neutral. And can last for millions of years. It’s the ultimate time capsule.')
