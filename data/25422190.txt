THAT is often far more disruptive to large swathes of people.  Perhaps not billions, but I would hazard to say millions of people have been affected by various product shutdowns, and there&#x27;s never any rebound from that.  Making UI changes can be rolled out to groups of folks with adjustments made on feedback, then further rolled out, or ... scrapped.')
