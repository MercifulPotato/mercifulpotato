I&#x27;ve got a mild form of arthritis in the hands that makes working with them for more then an hour or two unpleasant.<p>Something is wrong with my left knee that makes physical exertion painful. Walking is okay but it really doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to make it painful enough that I have to sit down for 4 or 5 hours to recover.<p>Something else wrong in the chest that makes breathing uncomfortable most days; like I was lying down and like fully grown St Bernard is sitting on of me. Occasionally feels like God taking a long thin ice pick and just jabbing it slowly through the ribs.<p>I can manage most of it with aspirin and alcohol but obviously that brings with it a slew of it&#x27;s own risks. Add in deteriorating eyesight, constant fights with insomnia that leave me tired most day, and teeth that are wearing away fast enough that it&#x27;s scaring my dentist.<p>It&#x27;s not that 40 sounds depressingly old. It&#x27;s that I&#x27;m already old and now getting older. It&#x27;s been a good life mind you, and I&#x27;ve gotten everything that I was supposed to out of it; university degree and a job. There&#x27;s little else that I care enough about to make me want to stay beyond for what I have to.')
