I have a long view and cynicism that m$ has retreated to the Embrace phase.  To vastly oversimplify their governance, they&#x27;re a new CEO away from Extend and Extinguish.<p>Lately, I <i>love</i> what they&#x27;ve been doing.  Even github -- there have been disappointments, for sure, but nothing like the egregious misbehavior in the bad old days.  But given their history; given Google&#x27;s &quot;do no evil&quot; bait&amp;switch... I don&#x27;t want to hand them more power.<p>It&#x27;d be cool if an interested third party could build out an app store that automatically sources from github (and its competitors), though.')
