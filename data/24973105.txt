Letâ€™s bring it back together.<p>Relaunch Turntable.FM, a &quot;Clubhouse with Music&quot;, or &quot;ProductHunt for Music,&quot; a fun virtual lounge app and digital game for music discovery, and use a points system to reward DJs who make and play popular songs that make people dance their virtual avatars.
