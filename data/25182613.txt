I don&#x27;t think you will get many complaints if your cause is lower taxes or increase minimum wage.  If your cause is to to take away rights of a coworker, you can&#x27;t really stay neutral.  I wouldn&#x27;t accept my employer being neutral on gay marriage for example if I was a gay person.<p>As the culture war has become a bigger part of politics, like the grandfather comment suggest, more of these issues fall into that second bucket in which it is tough to accept neutrality.')
