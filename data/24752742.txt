When searching for something in a discussion a long time ago, it seems you first need to scroll back to make sure the text is somewhere in view and then you can use the search functionality. If the text is not displayed in chat, you cannot search for it.<p>What makes matters worse is that the history reload capability becomes progressivly slower as you have more text history is loaded (and Skype makes use of some infinite scrolling mechanism, so you can&#x27;t just scroll back to a given year). I&#x27;m guessing the Chromium based UI is the issue here, but not sure. So in this very instance, scrolling becomes a huge time waster.')
