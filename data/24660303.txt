There is a big community of people building novel types of neural network using spikes and so on.<p>And you are right - it isn&#x27;t clear who is right. On one side the &quot;no nature&quot; folks might say : we don&#x27;t even understand neurons to the point where we can definitely categorize them in a mouse brain, let alone explain their behaviour, or actually properly measure their behaviour, and so on and so on - this before understanding any of it really.<p>On the other hand the &quot;lets mimic things we don&#x27;t understand&quot; folks would say - we need to understand this because the human brain out performs all AI today on a 20 watt budget.<p>My view is the understand stuff agenda is right - but not now and probably not for 20 years (in a big way). We need small scale capability and direction finding work - and we will need to do that for a long time.')
