When confronted with questions about the violence on 1&#x2F;6 you responded with references to the violence perpetuated by BLM protesters.  However I can&#x27;t find a single instance of collective violence at the BLM protests that comes close to a mob beating a police officer to death like happened in DC.<p>As far as I have seen, there were no murders committed by BLM protesters as part of any protests, riots, or whatever you want to call them.  Even in this post you are still referring to &quot;BLM murders&quot;.  In a previous comment a few posts up I directly asked you how many murders occurred at these BLM protests and you didn&#x27;t respond.  Is that because you know that the person to person violence that occurred at these events was routinely instigated by the police, other right leaning people, or people using deadly force in response to looting?<p>And like I said previously, we are already comparing millions of people protesting over months in cities around the country to thousands of people in one city protesting on one day.  There were vastly more opportunities for violence at the BLM protests and yet the only person to person violence seen appears to be in response or initiated by people on the other side.<p>I appreciate the complement and agree with most of the second half of your post, but it isn&#x27;t just the origins or motivations for these two groups that differentiate them.  One was much quicker to instigate violence against people.')
