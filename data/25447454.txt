It was a rocket sled, not a car. It ran on rails extending from an abandoned mine shaft. They aimed the sled <i>toward</i> the mineshaft so it had a hard stop, and they built gravity-fed brakes into the sled: Between the wheels they cemented tire treads to the frame, then hydraulically lifted the entire chassis. Dump the fluid, and the entire sled weight settles onto the rails.<p>The main things I don&#x27;t recall are how the hydraulics get cut (dead man&#x27;s switch?) and whether they managed to stop the sled before it slammed into the mine entrance.')
