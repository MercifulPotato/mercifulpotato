First of all, I made a decision Facebook is not the center of my life and decided to stop posting personal things on it except for major announcements.  I also started doing the following very aggressively:<p>- unfollowing everyone who only tended to posted stuff I didn&#x27;t want to see,<p>- using the &quot;Hide Post&quot;, &quot;Hide All From X&quot;, and &quot;Hide Ad&quot; options very liberally - if I had any problem at all with the post or ad whatsoever,<p>- reporting posts that had content I didn&#x27;t like and even had a hint of violating Facebook policies--none got deleted but I think this affects Facebook&#x27;s AI.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a list of everything I&#x27;ve blocked and share it, but I don&#x27;t see how to get that from Facebook.<p>It took several months, but probably would have been less time if I was a daily Facebook user.<p>At this point I have no political or news items (things I hid like crazy) on my Facebook at all.  I have fun things from groups I&#x27;ve joined and that&#x27;s it.<p>It&#x27;s boring and quiet, and there if I really need it without annoyances.<p>But it did take some work and it&#x27;s true, not everyone cares to put in that work.  But they&#x27;ll repost dumb meme stuff all day.')
