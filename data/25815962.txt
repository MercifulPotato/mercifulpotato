Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610923144, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25815599, text='&gt; The scarcity of bitcoins depends on the scarcity of computational power<p>No, the scarcity of Bitcoin is hardcoded into the protocol. The protocol doesn&#x27;t care if 1 miner or 1 million miners are validating the blockchain. The number of BTC is the same.<p>...as long as everyone agrees to use the same Bitcoin, that is. People could simply fork the Bitcoin chain with a different number of maximum Bitcoin and call it &quot;Bitcoin 2&quot;. The scarcity relies on Bitcoiners all agreeing to not recognize any other protocol with a higher limit on Bitcoin, which is currently an attractive proposition to all of the BTC early adopters who would profit greatly from forcing the rest of the world to buy their BTC at inflated prices in the future to get anything done.')
