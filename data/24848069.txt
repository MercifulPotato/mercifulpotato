I couldn&#x27;t find specifics, but I would be curious what their baseline condition is.<p>I wonder if the baseline case is &quot;no control optimization&quot; or if it was based on current control best-practices. For example, one article claims it produces cooler water temperature than normal based on outside conditions. This is a best practice in good energy management through wet-bulb outdoor air temperature reset strategies without using ML. If their 40% savings was above and beyond these best practices, that&#x27;s a pretty big accomplishment. If it&#x27;s based on the static temperature setpoint scenario (i.e. non best practice), it&#x27;s less so.<p>Edit: after skimming [1], it seems like their baseline condition was the naive&#x2F;non-best practice approach. I&#x27;m not discounting the potential for ML, but I think a more accurate comparison should use traditional &quot;best practice&quot; control strategies, not a naive baseline condition. In some cases, it seems like the ML approach identified would be less advantageous than current non-ML best-practices (e.g., increasing cooling tower water by a static 3deg rather than tracking with a wet-bulb temperature offset)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.google&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;pub42542&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.google&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;pub42542&#x2F;</a>')
