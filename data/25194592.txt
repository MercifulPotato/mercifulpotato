I&#x27;ve only had Intel laptops and it&#x27;s a real pain to get them to not throttle regardless of temperature, power management and being plugged into the AC.<p>The steps are something like the following:<p>Install ThrottleStop\nDisable &quot;BD PROCHOT&quot;\nSet a mild undervolt via FIVR -&gt; CPU Core Voltage -&gt; Unlock Adjustable Voltage\nEnable FIVR -&gt; Memory -&gt; Disable and Lock Turn Power Limits\nIncrease Turbo Boost Long Power Max, Turbo Time Limit and PP0 Current Limit<p>If I replace my existing XPS 13 (1065G7) I&#x27;ll definitely consider AMD if throttling is less of an issue.')
