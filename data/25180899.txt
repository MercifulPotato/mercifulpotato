In case it helps, the problems that I see in the GP comment are: (1) inflammatory over-claims like &quot;<i>designed</i> to keep people poor&quot; (emphasis added), (2) lashing out against downvotes, (3) aggressive (or passive-aggressive?) phrases like &quot;Bite me&quot;, and (4) attacking other users or classes of user. None of this is compatible with <i>curious</i> conversation, which is what we&#x27;re trying for here.<p>I certainly understand how internet comments can be frustrating and I think we all feel like responding this way sometimes, if not all the time. But it just means we all need to learn how to pause until the initial rush dies down. Then we have the freedom to either respond curiously, or not respond, which are the two modes that best fit the intended spirit of the site.')
