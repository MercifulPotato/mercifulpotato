This means we need to be cognizant and vigilant around the precise nature and boundaries of those circumstances, because &quot;plaintext doesn&#x27;t leave the device and get transmitted to Facebook&quot; is no longer true.<p>A tap or two by one of the people you&#x27;re talking to could upload your decrypted plaintext directly to the person-in-the-middle; this is a relatively significant footgun that we should remain aware of.')
