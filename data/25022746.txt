At the end of the day both of these platforms serve to defend their core ecosystems. It is clear that the app &#x2F;container concept is the one thing Apple holds dearly. Streaming services represent a leak&#x2F;wedge into another app&#x2F;container ecosystem. That alternative ecosystem has its own business models, review process, developer relationship, etc). It will never fly in it&#x27;s current form, for any of these streamers (geforce now, stadia, xbox, etc).<p>I don&#x27;t think we are stuck though. Both major mobiles would love to have a way to make this work from both a product and business standpoint. The platform just needs to evolve to support them properly and we aren&#x27;t there yet.<p>For Apple, I could see a path where upon pairing your existing Xbox console with Apple, it unlocks an Xbox branded app store across your devices. Apple would be fed meta-data for that entire store so they would have some levers of control over the experience. The key thing here would be no onboarding flow to the xbox store. You are a clear xbox platform user and you want to extend that experience onto your Apple devices through a pairing flow originating on your purchased xbox. Same could work for any hardware console.')
