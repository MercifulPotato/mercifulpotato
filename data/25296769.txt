Item(by='jschwartzi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607037425, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25292365, text='&gt; To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying people shouldn&#x27;t give a damn, I saying why couldn&#x27;t they i.e. why should they be forced if they choose not to.<p>In a lot of these cases it&#x27;s probably true that there&#x27;s no direct, measurable, benefit. One has to look past the direct benefit to the indirect benefit to understand why we would be forced to do something that has no direct benefit to ourselves.<p>For example, a property tax increase to pay for improved schools doesn&#x27;t have any apparent benefit if you&#x27;re a single adult with no children in school. In fact the whole education system has no measurable benefit to you if you&#x27;re an adult. It seems like a waste of money. So we can say it has no first-order benefit.<p>But suppose that the increased funding would help pay for things like civics education. There&#x27;s a second-order or third-order benefit to paying those taxes. By ensuring other peoples&#x27; children are educated in how our Democratic institutions work, they are better able to navigate those institutions, and they will make more informed decisions about their elected officials because of this. If you care about maintaining and improving those institutions then that tax increase is very worthwhile even if you have no kids. But it has no measurable economic benefit.<p>I think our Capitalist system has gone insane because it no longer acknowledges those benefits that have no tangible monetary value. It also encourages us to think in terms of money above all else. We&#x27;ve gone so far into the weeds with Scientific Management that if we can&#x27;t measure the direct monetary benefit it doesn&#x27;t exist. And that&#x27;s not true.<p>Being unable to measure something simply means we can&#x27;t quantify the benefit. It doesn&#x27;t mean it has no benefit. And that&#x27;s at the heart of a lot of economic arguments against tax increases. They&#x27;re arguing that being unable to quantify the benefit implies the benefit doesn&#x27;t exist. And that&#x27;s patently untrue in a lot of cases.')
