What they said is &quot;x86-64 is incredibly slow&quot;, and then when you teased them for details, what they meant was &quot;this Linux feature is incredibly slow on x86-64&quot;. To which the answer isn&#x27;t &quot;it&#x27;s fast on RISC-V&quot;, but rather, &quot;that&#x27;s a problem with Linux, not x86-64&quot;.<p>If you have a beef with GNOME, then bring it to GNOME. Don&#x27;t pin it on a tangentally related technology which bears none of the fault, and which has had hundreds of thousands of hours of work invested in it by volunteers all to make something nice for you to use.')
