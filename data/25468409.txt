It&#x27;s part time-blocking, part time-tracking.<p>Here&#x27;s what my &quot;Study&quot; calendar looks like:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;BBLeYmy.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;BBLeYmy.png</a><p>In green are events I created manually. In orange are predicted study sessions based on tracking data from ActivityWatch [1], which tracks my desktop, laptop, phone, and even my Chromecast usage. I get roughly 80% coverage with it, and 100% coverage with manual time tracking.<p>In fact, I built a &quot;WGU Time Tracker&quot; for my capstone project, which attempted to automatically classify my ActivityWatch data into study sessions using NLP, machine learning, and heuristics. I might write a post about it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;activitywatch.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;activitywatch.net&#x2F;</a>')
