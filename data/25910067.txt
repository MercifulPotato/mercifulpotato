The machine is a means for producing surplus-value.&quot;<p>&quot;Hence that remarkable phenomenon in the history of modern industry, that machinery sweeps away every moral and natural restriction on the length of the working day. Hence too the economic paradox that the most powerful instrument for reducing labour-time suffers a dialectical inversion and becomes the most unfailing means for turning the whole lifetime of the worker and his family into labour-time at capital’s disposal for its own valorization.&quot;<p>Marx (1867), Capital Volume I, Chapter 15 (&quot;Machinery and Large-Scale Industry&quot;)')
