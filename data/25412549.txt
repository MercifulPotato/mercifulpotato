The existing automakers know how to do all that<p>I have to disagree to some extent with that. I think by now Tesla has figured out the logistics of assembling cars at least as well as other manufacturers, but they still nees to build more lines however.<p>However Tesla is not stopping there and is continuously improving its logistics past the industry standard, it&#x27;s not catching up anymore, it&#x27;s pulling out. For example a lot of effort right now is invested into streamlining battery making and integration, this is something no other OEM is really doing right now. Tesla is willing to take on battery production and even potentially mining, allowing them to fine-tune and optimize the process end to end as much as possible, while traditional OEM rely on suppliers for everything and any improvement needs to be negotiated and takes forever.<p>Tesla last battery day had an extremely interesting presentation about battery making and logistics that illustrates just how deep the stack they are willing to go for the sake of optimization.')
