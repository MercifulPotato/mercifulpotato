I think the article is presuming some things to come to this conclusion.<p>The main thing that is being presumed is the &quot;big bang&quot;. If you proscribe to believing in the big bang, then the entirety of everything we see is an expansion from a single dense explosion of matter.<p>It is still a valid theory but I myself don&#x27;t understand the physics of what is observed well enough to be convinced this is true. I believe that they are seeing something similar enough that it could be perhaps a &quot;localized bang&quot; or something like that.<p>The main evidence used as &quot;proof&quot; of the big bang is the observed data seeming to show that the everything in the universe is &quot;dispersing&quot; slowly. That is at least what I&#x27;ve heard claimed.')
