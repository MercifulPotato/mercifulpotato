Personally, I don&#x27;t use GUI tools for Git because they are either as complex as the command line version or I&#x27;m afraid they do something under the hood that is not what I intended. I&#x27;m not sure GUI tools for Git are programmed in a way that makes data loss impossible.<p>Some kind of troubleshooter GUI tool that covers 90% of all use cases would be great. I&#x27;d certainly be willing to pay for it.')
