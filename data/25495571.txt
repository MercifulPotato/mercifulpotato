I moved to the bay area in 85, stayed 20 years, then left. If you moved there and were already well established, sure, real estate would have been more affordable then than now. But as a young engineer, things were still pretty expensive.<p>My starting salary as a BSEE working for a minicomputer company was $30,000. Two weeks after arriving they had layoffs.
