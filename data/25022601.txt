Item(by='jsgo', descendants=None, kids=[25022633], score=None, time=1604805954, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25022362, text='Memory is hazy, but from what I&#x27;ve read most people that call Chrome the new IE is because it likes to incorporate non-standard aspects that other browsers don&#x27;t (because they&#x27;re not standard) which causes apps to lose functionality (or outright break) outside of Chrome.<p>I can kind of see it both ways. I appreciate that Chromium browsers may have little extras you can tap into as it&#x27;ll make for neat features (Project Stream and I imagine later Stadia is because of that sort of thing), but it does break browser compatibility so it runs the risk of replicating that &quot;works in IE&quot; experience from way back when.<p>The IE I don&#x27;t specifically miss though was needing to support older releases of it at work, personally. But I could see disliking the &quot;what do you mean it doesn&#x27;t work in Safari&#x2F;Firefox&#x2F;etc.?&quot; discussions that may happen.')
