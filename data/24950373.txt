I took a CMM (pre-CMM<i>I</i>) course there, about twenty years ago.<p>I tend to write stuff I architect from the ground, up. This has earned me a number of sneers, and comments about “reinventing the wheel,” but I seem to have picked up a knack for it, from many years of experience (my very first engineering project, in 1987, was a complete design of a microwave routing tool; including chassis milling, electrical design, firmware operating system, and host drivers)[0].<p>One of my biggest motivations, is that I “eat my own dog food.” I am usually the poor bastard that needs to back through my legacy, and figure out what I did (in fact, I’m doing that, right now). It has taught me to leave a good legacy [1].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;TF30194&#x2F;TF30194-Manual-1987.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;TF30194&#x2F;TF30194-Manual-1987.pdf</a> (downloads a PDF).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;miscellany&#x2F;leaving-a-legacy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;miscellany&#x2F;leaving-a-legacy&#x2F;</a>')
