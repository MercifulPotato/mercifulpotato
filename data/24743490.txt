Estimates are not available at all times, especially when involving complex product.<p>If the engineer is not comfortable giving estimates for a certain complex deliverable, give them &quot;task&quot; time-boxed to research for estimates.<p>If the engineer is TOO comfortable making estimates, make sure you have a senior around to help you assess the situation.<p>&gt; Sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m the only person obsessing over it<p>I must assert that it&#x27;s actually more important to care about customer satisfaction than estimates. If your customer trust you, they trust your estimation. With their trust, you can add reasonable buffer to partially nullify the importance of accurate estimates. And by customer, I mean all those the actual product customer, the upper-management, and THE TEAM. I know PM&#x27;s tasks are not easy tasks.<p>Now if you feel you are the only person obsessing about CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. I think you will need to inquire if those people don&#x27;t care, or don&#x27;t have a bandwidth to care. If it&#x27;s the former, then it&#x27;s bad. If it&#x27;s the latter, you will need to ask how you can make bandwidth for it.<p>&gt; tendency to underestimate<p>If you haven&#x27;t, read the mythical man month. It&#x27;s not just about the mythical man-month really. It has other useful stuffs.<p>References:\nI&#x27;m a lead engineer, my GF is a producer, we exchange ideas alot. (fortunately we are not in the same team)')
