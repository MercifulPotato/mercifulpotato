The check is less useful, but it&#x27;s still a check)<p>&gt; Why would any experienced programmer make such a blanket statement?<p>Because type annotations are less work than tests or documentation, don&#x27;t suffer from falling out of sync like doc does, and because experience shows that haskell users typically find it useful to write types despite it not being necessary to compile. It would be surprising to skip types but invest in writing more complicated means of documenting and testing the software.')
