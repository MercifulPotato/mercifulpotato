Maybe a nice makefile.  And I did set that up for a few arduino devices in the past, but it was just too much jumping through hoops for me to really bother with longterm.  Much easier to just grab a RPi Zero and install a compiler or python on it and then just code directly on the device, over ssh.<p>If there’s a better approach to handle the coding side of things than the standard Arduino IDE, I’d be super interested to learn about it!')
