Anyone thinking it&#x27;s unfair is also outta their minds... or thinking it&#x27;s about censorship. Nah, it&#x27;s about not-supporting a coup of the USA and murderous assholes.<p>In the USA, of all places, we don&#x27;t have to do shit we don&#x27;t want to do (except pay taxes). No one wants to share anything with fucking Nazis. These insurrectionists are fighting against the very fabric that gives them the things they want.<p>They have completely disconnected from reality if they expect the benefits of a diverse intellectually rich society, but want that society eradicated, locked up, and enslaved. Do you really think we&#x27;d have the fucking internet if the nazis had won? ROFLCOPTR. Fucking ROFLCOPTRs. They&#x27;re attempting to overthrow the USA&#x27;s election results-- they&#x27;re traitors.<p>I&#x27;d even be against using the word &quot;traitor&quot; if they weren&#x27;t nazi-white-supremacist fuckheads. I&#x27;m using it because they&#x27;re traitors, not just to democracy, but to humanity. They seek the destruction and enslavement of others. This is not a fucking joke. FACT: Hitler was laughed at AND staged a failed coup; which went unpunished (he was having guests and was free to roam the prison) before the camps and WWII. I can&#x27;t even make this shit up. It&#x27;s honestly like Trump is reading Hitler&#x27;s bio for tips on how to get ahead... but back to the point.<p>If someone wants to murder me, enslave me, deeply believes I am inherently unequal, and that I am not even human; no, I will not help them. Is that strange? I have a pretty strong feeling it&#x27;s not.<p>So then no one, fucking no one, should be surprised that the PEOPLE who built AWS, Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, reddit et. al do not want to empower those that want to destroy, enslave, and torture them.<p>To be clear, this could not be less about censorship. If anything, it&#x27;s a testament to free speech this shit went on for as long as it did. I&#x27;d even be more pissed about it going on for as long as it did, but better late than never, if we all weren&#x27;t balls deep triaging an attempted coup of the USA.')
