All the things like RDP access to powerful machine or even something in-browser (yes, I know that VSCode is also having electron underneath) are just too slow and too inconvenient.<p>I had desktops for a while. Then I decided to switch to laptop and bought latest Thinkpad X1 Extreme (at a time). It throttles, it struggles to play even relatively easy games. Occasionally it loses connection to the lenovo dock and I need to restart it. It can&#x27;t have more than 3 monitors.<p>When the time of next upgrade will come I&#x27;m certainly going to desktop + some light laptop like my wife&#x27;s X1 Carbon. I don&#x27;t like macs and I strongly believe that Win + WSL &#x2F; dual  boot to linux are much better for development.')
