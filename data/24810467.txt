Jon Stewart, to me, is emblematic of everything wrong with liberal politics in the United States. He spent 8 years dunking on George W and Republicans for being &quot;stupid&quot; while they consolidated power. He had a massive platform to mobilize liberals and instead they all made jokes about how uncultured Republicans were, while the Republican Party played a ground game that let them redistrict and take control of courts at every level to establish minority rule over the country.<p>Bill Maher - I don&#x27;t follow him as closely, but everything I hear is basically regurgitated reactionary schtick. He says &quot;the things <i>they</i> don&#x27;t want you to say&quot; which really means punching down at fat people, queers, people of color, etc. He&#x27;s a relic of the early 2000s when you could attract a sizeable audience just by being a substance-less edgelord. As far as I know he&#x27;s basically done a 180 politically because liberals used to enjoy that stuff but now it&#x27;s more popular with right wingers.<p>The person in the article also discovered Ray Romano, so... he&#x27;s 3&#x2F;3 in my book.')
