Even if it is &quot;enough&quot; it&#x27;s still what my MacBook Pro I bought 6 years ago shipped with for several hundred dollars less than this one.<p>Why are we giving Apple a pass on RAM being stuck at 8GB and SSD being stuck at 128GB (only very recently bumping to 256) for almost a decade. Not to mention some of us get stuck on 8GB 128GB machines because our workplaces only buy the base &quot;Pro&quot; machines, refusing the drop the extra few hundred to make it what Gruber considers the base level.<p>SSDs are no longer expensive, go on Amazon and see how much 1TB M2s cost these days.')
