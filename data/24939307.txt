Wonder what professions SWEs tend to dropout to?<p>2. The average earnings by degree chart is interesting. But software, being so winner takes all, probably has much higher variance than other industries. Would be interesting to see the comparisons at higher percentiles.<p>3. &quot;The return to being a fast learner is higher in jobs with low rates of skill change because the learnings can compound over time instead of dwindle in relevance.&quot; The caveat being that there&#x27;s a high skill bar for those other jobs. My hunch is that lots of professions (outside of ones that need years of schooling like med) actually don&#x27;t have that high of a skill bar, just a matter of pedigree&#x2F;experience&#x2F;networking&#x2F;playing politics.')
