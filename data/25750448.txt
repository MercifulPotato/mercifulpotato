Item(by='Moodles', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610473643, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25749729, text='&gt; This is another question in good faith. Can you provide any evidence at all that you&#x27;re not knowingly asking that as a political&#x2F;debating tactic to suggest your proposition is reasonable, knowing full well that the purpose of Parler&#x27;s existence is (was) to facilitate communication that larger social networks stifle, and categorize as hate speech?<p>Maybe something is lost over text, but I genuinely prefaced my question because I know it&#x27;s a delicate political topic for people. But your response is just childish. I literally barely know anything about Parler. Also, how is asking for evidence so triggering? That should be the cornerstone of any these types of discussions.<p>But to answer your question: No, I can&#x27;t prove to you what I&#x27;m thinking. Nobody ever can. So perhaps you should just take my question on face value and stop assuming malicious intent.')
