I don&#x27;t want pollution, slavery, and all sorts of other problems, some of which directly affect me. But <i></i><i>within</i><i></i> the existing system, it might be my best individual choice to still buy a product that has those problems in its production because the alternatives available give me a worse experience.<p>The whole <i>point</i> of government intervention is to change the situation so that we don&#x27;t have this dilemma.<p>I don&#x27;t want the externalized <i>costs</i> of certain cheap conveniences! But if everyone <i>else</i> keeps doing that and I refuse to go that way individually, I <i>still</i> get the externalized costs anyway! I don&#x27;t HAVE an individual choice that will eliminate those costs. If I did, I actually WOULD choose that over the cheap conveniences.')
