In all the interactions I can remember where this has come up, this has not been made clear to me, because people usually equivocate between attitude and action, or are unclear which of the two they are referring to. Even in the original comment, I think I misunderstood what was being said:<p>&gt; If one of the main parties running wants to prevent you from marrying the person you love, you can&#x27;t just be apolitical.<p>I interpreted this as &quot;you are compelled to act&quot;; apparently in fact it means the much more obviously-correct &quot;you can&#x27;t avoid having a political opinion&quot;.')
