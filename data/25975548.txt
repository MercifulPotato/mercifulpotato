Mineral pigments like ultramarine (i.e., finely ground lapis lazuli) are essentially perfectly lightfast.  Cobalt blue is a metal rather than a silicate but still considered gold standard lightfast where artists are concerned: Chinese pottery has used it for millenia and shown no tendency to change hue.  Cobalt blue is toxic but ultramarine isn&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s possible that YinMn is similarly lightfast, but the historical blues remain cheaper and more than lightfast enough for virtually any artist concerned with longevity.')
