I hear you on the expansion idea - there&#x27;s quite a bit you can do with the Qwiic&#x2F;I2C port, but it&#x27;d be super cool to have it in some kind of cartridge format like a gameboy. Could probably attach faster peripherals or analog effects cards, that kind of thing. Thanks for your feedback!')
