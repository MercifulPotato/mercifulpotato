You said that HFT was absurd. It was easy to point out that there are real, practical benefits to HFT (those benefits become even clearer if you do some reading on how crooked the human-scale market making system was prior to HFT; Google, for instance, [odd eighths]).<p>That&#x27;s the extent of my interest in this discussion. If you do some research and find out something that refutes my argument about HFT, I&#x27;d be interested in learning about it. Otherwise, I think if we&#x27;re on the same page about this detail of the thread, it&#x27;s fine to leave it there.')
