Nothing else really compares. One big issue was that the best features (like mouse-like joystick and gyro-assisted aim for FPS) took time to configure when most controller users want a controller to just work. But Valve’s community configs solved this extremely well. I can jump into just about any game and have an excellent controller config running out of the box.<p>The touchpads, gyro, and back paddles make it so much better than any other controller. It’s a shame they discontinued it. The more mainstream reviews of the controller by tech news sites and Linus Tech Tips didn’t quite grasp its potential, which is understandable. But there are some solid niche YouTubers like RambleTan and Critical Input that have made entire channels out of exploring its potential, and the subreddit is pretty good too.')
