And for a long time I have been saying that a &quot;heuristic&quot; model for folding is going to win (and it looks like it has).  However, I would also caution that, there are going to be protein structures that are not in the opus of known structures (being able to solve the structure at all is itself a biasing factor) and AlphaFold&#x27;s capability to figure those out will be interesting.  I would not necessarily be confident it could.  (think of issues, like face detection algorithms not being able to correctly identify minorities, e.g.)')
