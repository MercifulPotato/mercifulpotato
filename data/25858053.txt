I got to listen to Dawn Hampton though which was great. It&#x27;s pretty popular with tech people (at least in Australian and UK circles) so I&#x27;m sure there are more of us on HN.<p>(Herrang is a small village (pop 400) in Sweden which becomes an international swing dancing festival &#x2F; camp for 5 weeks each summer)<p>Frankie Manning has a good autobiography published - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frankiemanning.com&#x2F;book.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frankiemanning.com&#x2F;book.php</a> well worth reading for an idea of what his days looked like. He was at some historic events like battle of the bands with Count Basie and Duke Ellington.<p>Re. missing the dancing: I know it&#x27;s not the same as the real thing, but have you tried joining some &quot;local&quot; zoom classes?
