Turns out a lot of people say he&#x27;s actually far kinder than you&#x27;d think, off-camera, to all the people he&#x27;s seemingly abusive to!<p>All the yelling and vitriol is kind of a spliced-down highlights reel, is the impression I&#x27;ve gotten, the stuff that makes for good tv. It&#x27;s there and it&#x27;s real, but it&#x27;s a smaller part of a guy who&#x27;s generally nice and genuinely cares about the people on his shows.<p>Good suggestion though.')
