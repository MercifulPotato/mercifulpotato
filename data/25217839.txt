The thing that bothers me about sidewalk is that amazon is leveraging their favorable market position to share my internet connection with their devices that belong to other people to add more value to their products under the guise of promoting community safety.<p>I&#x27;d be much more supportive of what could be a very helpful and generous service if they used their position to do something truly altruistic and still have the first mover advantage by making this service an open standard for all device that benefit personal and community safety. Amazon, please open this up.')
