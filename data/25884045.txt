Just because one demographic is weak at something doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re strong in another.<p>While intuitively I agree that what Camile Pagila says makes sense, there is no definitive evidence that was causes men to more likely be serial killers is what causes men to more likely be geniuses. Scientifically we still need to entertain the possibility that women aren&#x27;t geniuses because of biology and this has nothing to do with the fact that they&#x27;re unlikely to be serial killers. It might be true it might not be true, don&#x27;t let ideology or pride in your own race&#x2F;sex blind you from the truth.<p>Case in point, white people are more likely to be serial killers than other races. You may automatically think a racial centered biological origin of serial killer behavior is absurd but again this is the irrational need for &quot;balance&quot; and equality that is throwing you off. There is no scientific evidence either way, it could be Caucasian in origin it could not be.<p>Behaviorally we should be ideologically neutral for different demographics, but for observations of reality and discussing truth we should be scientifically neutral.')
