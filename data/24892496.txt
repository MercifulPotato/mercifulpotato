Item(by='OldHand2018', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603681531, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24892137, text='You are right, GPS has a margin of error that gets exaggerated in concrete canyons.  It may take longer than you want to wait to resolve, etc.  An error introduced by GPS can get the ticket thrown out if someone contests it, but misspelling a street name is not.  Why bother?<p>Chicago addressing is on the grid system.  Anyone familiar with it can identify the location of something just with the street name and block number.  No need to reference a map or GPS or anything.  1166 N State St is about half a block south of Division, on the west side of the street.  Any city worker will instantly make that connection.  You have a really high bar to climb over to make improvements worth implementing.')
