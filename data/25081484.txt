I tried to give manufacturers the finger and try to play with systems level software on modern PC&#x27;s and ended up retreating after realizing, among other things, just how much modern computers are <i>not</i> for hackers. Everything feels like a &quot;undocumented&quot; (by which I mean the documentation is likely only accessible to OEM&#x27;s and those with large business deals woth them) mess. Even  when it is available, I&#x27;m too scared to touch it. I found something I wanted to try to to hack around with till I saw the license agreement I had to read in order to access the docs. I couldn&#x27;t parse out the legalese, especially regarding open source works and I&#x27;m not consulting a lawyer to figure out if I can post some project I <i>might</i> hack together online under an OSS license. The few things that do get open sourced are incredibly half assed and you can still tell they&#x27;re designed for corporations, not hackers (i.e. edk2)<p>Conversely, I have an old IBM XT compatible luggable sitting in my closet. The manual for that has the full BIOS source llisting.  Nowadays I mostly just hack around woth old non-PC devices, but for the most part computing just isn&#x27;t fun for me anymore.')
