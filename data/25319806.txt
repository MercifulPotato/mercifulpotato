I&#x27;m not sure how it affects that substance of the argument you&#x27;re making. I&#x27;m not trying to argue from authority here -- I&#x27;m pointing out that I have <i>direct experience</i> in this <i>specific area</i>, just so that you know I&#x27;m not some random commenter.<p><i>&quot;It is my judgement that if you presented these results in 2003 anyone would have said &quot;the protein folding problem has been solved&quot;.&quot;</i><p>Your judgment is your own. At the very least, your use of the word &quot;anyone&quot; should give you pause.<p><i>&quot;Nobody then expected &quot;the solution to protein folding&quot; to solve every single protein, and it&#x27;s silly to now.&quot;</i><p>Not the argument I&#x27;m making.<p><i>&quot;If you&#x27;re complaining about the 33% error rate, you don&#x27;t know enough about ML to realize that that gap is going to get closed, and rapidly.&quot;</i><p>Not the argument I&#x27;m making.<p><i>&quot;My argument is that it is &quot;good enough for the uses that are in the domain of protein folding&quot;.&quot;</i><p>I have no idea what that means. Uses &quot;in the domain of protein folding&quot; are equivalent to uses &quot;in the domain of structural biology&quot;. So obviously, it depends on the quality of the structure being generated.<p><i>&quot;There are a lot of things that are adjacent to protein folding (enzyme pocket analysis .e.g), but they never have been considered to protein folding per se.&quot;</i><p>You seem to have some internal dialogue where there is a field called &quot;protein folding&quot;, where there is an unambiguous threshold for success that has now been crossed. There is no such field, and there is no such threshold.<p>Are these structures good enough to do some kinds of things, like structural genomics or docking? I dunno...maybe? Are they good enough to do structure-based drug design? Not from what I&#x27;ve seen. TFA seems to be saying the same thing, and your comment was that TFA is just wildly wrong, which seemed...unfair, at best.')
