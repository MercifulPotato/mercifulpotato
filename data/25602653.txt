So many lessons learned (most of them hard ones), spending three weeks in bed and many months in recovery was no fun at all. But much better than the alternative.<p>Now, something tells me that 2021 can&#x27;t possibly be worse than 2020 was but I&#x27;ve learned to allow for a little bit of superstition here on account of previous sentiments like that. So let me just say that I hope that all of you will make it through the COVID crisis in one piece and healthy and that 2021 will bring you much good luck and good fortune.')
