The stitches usually need to be removed from many of my pants pockets too, so I&#x27;m very familiar with removing stitches.<p>However, the vast majority of logos I see on clothes are actually part of the clothing, that&#x27;s what I meant by &quot;stitched in.&quot; I realize now, via Google, I meant &quot;embroidered on.&quot;<p>EDIT: Just went through my closet and I found there&#x27;s another large category of logos that are screen printed on. There were zero I personally saw that could be removed with a knife without heavily damaging the fabric. Maybe men&#x27;s clothing is different.')
