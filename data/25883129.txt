But now I use it as an invitation to make small talk. So if someone just says hello, I start asking them questions: how&#x27;s it going, how&#x27;s  is &lt;whatever fact I remember about them&gt;, etc. This makes some people go straight to their original question, but I think it also helps both of us feel a little more connected while everyone is remote.')
