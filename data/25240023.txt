We have all your jars. We buy out ULINE, we go to Fred Meyers &#x2F; Meijors &#x2F; Fleet Farm, Walmart, etc...<p>Amazon could charge 4 times (currently about 2.5 times) the price per 12 quart jars shipped, and it still makes sense to use them when your product is $10-$60 a gram.<p>It&#x27;s not all our fault, but not all extractors in the commercial industry are using lab glass, and it shows on the shelves in legal states.<p>Typically, some ULINE commercial accounts will show items as &quot;Sold out&quot; when customers with upgraded accounts will see at least some quantity. You can also order Ball brand jars from the company themselves in most cases.')
