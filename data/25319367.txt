Of course not, no better than it would be for learning math or physics.<p>But it&#x27;s unsurpassed for learning <i>what all the kinds of philosophy are</i>, for getting a sense of all the stuff that&#x27;s out there.<p>Simply because any &quot;philosophy&quot; intro text you buy, no matter how broad, will ignore huge swathes of it. Wikipedia really is the best place to get an initial &quot;lay of the land&quot; I&#x27;d say.<p>From there you can move onto survey texts in a particular subfield you&#x27;ve identified, then drill even deeper into Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy articles, and <i>then</i> make your way to primary texts.')
