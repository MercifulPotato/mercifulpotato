Determining Tar correlates with cancer does not eliminate the genetic factor.<p>The only assumption for direct control of the hypothesized causative factor that needs to be made is that your influence on the causative factor is 100% side effect free. This is not fully possible in reality but still assuming this in your experiments allows you to arrive at a conclusion without assuming other correlations.')
