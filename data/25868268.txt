There&#x27;s no reason to bother doing the research to add another mechanical component which can wear and fail early, when you can just put a more powerful electric motor in.<p>That&#x27;s the thing: the incentive structure has changed. The better use of time and research dollars is going to be just upgrading that motor till it&#x27;s adequate.
