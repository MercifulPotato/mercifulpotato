Pfah, youth these days, when we was young we had to stream our bits over barbed wire fences through thunderstorms and solar flares, both ways. Oh, by the way:<p><pre><code>   frank@serve:~$ find &#x2F;mnt&#x2F;audio&#x2F;music -type f|wc -l\n   134594\n</code></pre>\nThe result of &quot;Waste not, want not&quot;, i.e. save what you like for later, times might not always be good. I started doing this with a cassette recorder, finger passed over the <i>Record</i> button for when some song came on the radio (a box with electricals in it and a wire sticking out, you turned a knob and music came out, for free!) but graduated to the intertubes when they became a thing around 1993.<p>In other words, both young and old keep local collections, this is not purely an age thing. My 16yo daughter uses both our own library as well as commercial streaming services, my 9yo daughter (who doesn&#x27;t have a phone yet and will not get one for a while) primarily uses our own library.<p>Just like some folks are preppers who keep enough food and necessities for a few months to years while others live from one Ãœber-eats to the next, so do some curate their own library (etc.) while others rely purely on commercial services.')
