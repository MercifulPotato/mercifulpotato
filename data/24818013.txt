That duration and the fact that it&#x27;s consistent means it&#x27;s clearly a network timeout.<p>I have a locked down computer, layers of security enhancements so I kind of understand something I&#x27;ve done is causing it.<p>However, why should it lock up for 30 seconds if it can&#x27;t do some background thing! On startup! It&#x27;s an atrocious UI failure. And it&#x27;s been this way for 5 years that I&#x27;ve been counting, through their Quantam speedup etc. Major flaw and unfixed for aeons of 6 week release cycles.<p>Btw it&#x27;s not updating as it still updates ..<p>It&#x27;s actually really bad design to have a lockup like that, and especially on the critical hot path of the first time you use it! It&#x27;s a sign actually of bad user experience design, and it&#x27;s one of a number of bad anti-user things I&#x27;ve found about it. Things that Chrome gets so right!<p>I want to ditch Chrome because of the many Google anti-features, but UX is also very important to me I use the browser all day every day and I&#x27;m extremely fast at the UI with advanced shortcuts etc. Firefox locking up for 30 whole seconds before I can use it not only destroys my flow but is actually an eternity - I could have about 40 chrome tabs opened with urls types and autocompleted or pasted into the url bar in that time ..<p>Sadly Firefox blows on a large number of design decisions. I get the impression that user experience is down the list at Mozilla, below either Google donations or SJW antics. Whatever, but they consistently fail on important points. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so I truly do. I&#x27;m in the process of moving to Brave in anticipation of uBlock finally being sabotaged by Google.')
