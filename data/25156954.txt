(It would be convenient, but incorrect to say that they are radiating cold at you).<p>If you insulated the walls and ceiling, but not the floor, you could have a warm space, but cold feet due to conductive heating (of the floor, from your feet).<p>Humidity and air movement is more important in cooling, because the human body cools itself with sweat; but humidity in a structure has to be controlled, even if you want more humidity in the wintertime, it will condense and cause rot.<p>So basically I&#x27;m saying you want the insulation just for comfort even if it didn&#x27;t make economic sense.')
