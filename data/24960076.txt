If a company&#x2F;product doesn&#x27;t establish enough credibility it won&#x27;t even be considered for further discussions&#x2F;approval in many cases. It seems that in your purchasing experience the credibility criteria was already met, so your team didn&#x27;t even bothered to review the &quot;many logos&quot; slide from the sales pitch.<p>Many B2B startups (including my own mobile market research startup) struggle to reach this credibility threshold. It&#x27;s a critical factor for scaling sales. Most big companies aren&#x27;t willing to buy from a startup they&#x27;ve never heard of, no matter how great their product is.')
