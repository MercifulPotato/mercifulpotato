In my experience the retail &quot;Genius Bar&quot; and AppleCare policies and processes (or at least their implementation) have subtle differences. I had good luck with it with an old 1st gen iPad Pro. Just did it last week and expected to get a battery replacement but got a whole device replacement, which was interesting since I did not think they still make such devices in 2020--the serial number indicates they do and the device was made in the latter half of 2020. End-to-end it took probably 3-4 days.<p>If that doesn&#x27;t work out, easiest thing is probably to sell on Craigslist with some disclosure and buying a new one.')
