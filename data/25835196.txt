If hosting keeps consolidating the way it is, it will be on par in future years.  And the reason Parler didn&#x27;t build its own servers is because its massively expensive to do so.  So expensive that its a non-starter rather than an inconvenience.  Giving preferential treatment to some startups but not others to cut the corner on hosting by dominant players which determines winners and losers is still not a free market.')
