Associate files, notes, alerts, calendar entries, emails, documents with your contacts or contact group. Chat using an open protocol. This is in stark contrast with the data silo approach we have going on now.<p>- Project Based. Want to create a new app? Create a new project. All files associated with a project can live in a container and be shared in other containers. Filter for types of files that you are looking for. This basically reinvents the Finder&#x2F;Explorer UI to avoid creating complicated hierarchies for the user.<p>I’d argue that this approach to a more people centric UI would be scalable to mobile as well.')
