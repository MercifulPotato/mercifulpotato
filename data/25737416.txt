I asked if you can point an alternative that lets me monetize my attention and give it forward. Show me any system as straightforward as Brave that lets me give 2-3â‚¬ every month to wikipedia and archive.org and any one else I desire.<p>&gt; The affiliate link is just one of many examples.<p>Extraordinary claims and extraordinary evidence. I see you already failed at providing an alternative for supporting content creators, will you also back out of showing what &quot;many examples&quot; you are talking about?<p>PS.: Curious that you single out the CEO. If you don&#x27;t want to use Brave for having a beef with the CEO it&#x27;s one thing, but at least be honest about instead of making it about the product.')
