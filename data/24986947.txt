While it&#x27;s bad to demonize people with mental illness, these people don&#x27;t typically think they have a problem, unlike depression or alcoholism the victim is someone else not the mentally ill, they typically won&#x27;t care until they are shamed.<p>I&#x27;m just saying this website should have a warning because I can 100% guarantee pedophiles are trawling it looking for access to children, like they would any other kid based online forum.')
