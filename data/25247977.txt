I don&#x27;t have to worry about how some algorithm is going to treat keywords in my comment, upvotes, downvotes etc. Instead, I just upvote what I find interesting and write what I think others might find interesting.<p>There are definitely downsides to the system too (like the ones you mention), but ultimately I think it&#x27;s a decision to pick the least bad interface. Sort of reminds me of that Churchill quote ~ &#x27;democracy is the worst kind of government except all the others&#x27; (or something like that).')
