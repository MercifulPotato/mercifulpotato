Today they may be good guys on our side and stop various evil leaders and hateful villains from gathering followers but someday they may be a different kind of &quot;good&quot; guys - guys very intent on stopping us from &quot;undermining the security of the state&quot; or &quot;spreading immoral ideas&quot; or &quot;smearing upstanding citizens&quot;.<p>There is no way to guarantee &quot;good&quot; censors (we can’t even agree what those accepted ideas are or that they will not change) so we MUST fight for freedom of speech.')
