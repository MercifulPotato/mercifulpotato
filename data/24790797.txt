Item(by='nexuist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602780987, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24790179, text='&gt; What kind of dystopian platform is Apple running where police have to look through everything you type about your own product to make sure you haven&#x27;t written any thoughtcrimes?<p>What do you mean? Do you think it would be fair for Apple to allow developers to serve change logs with racial slurs or political conspiracies to young users? Literal toddlers interact with the App Store on a daily basis. The release notes are not a place to spew bile, so obviously they must be moderated to some degree. We can argue over the acceptability of them trying to blame their failings onto an innocent developer (if that was actually the case), but obviously you should not be allowed to type whatever you want in a text field that gets served to their customers.')
