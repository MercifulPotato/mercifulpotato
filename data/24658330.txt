Playing a coy game where you realize someone is trying to infer something about you so you dodge the question. It&#x27;s weird to imagine that people engage in a cultural dance where you need certainty of arbitrary facts before you decide to act like a dick (oversimplified).<p>But it&#x27;s really weird to see that there&#x27;s not overt cultural movements to shed this stuff. Trying to hide the fact that you&#x27;re a lower caste, in a way, seems to embody the fact that you&#x27;re a lower caste, shifting it from an outward identity to a hidden identity. Seems like the obvious thing to do is to get ahead of the issue and state that you don&#x27;t have a caste. Or make up a post modern American one. I get this is hard to do when you&#x27;re in a position of weakness relative to the other party (like manager&#x27;s as described). But like, this is clearly a social movement waiting to happen. If someone of equal social standing starts probing you for your caste, you should confront them on it and say you don&#x27;t subscribe to it, because otherwise you do, on some level, subscribe to it.<p>I won&#x27;t pretend it&#x27;s not much, much easier said than done, but geez. Is there really such a collective power by upper indian castes that you can&#x27;t bring the issue to the table if you&#x27;re reasonably well established? Say, a second generation citizen, with a multi racial network?<p>Racial discrimination between people of color and whites is a frustratingly stupid problem to deal with. Caste discrimination seems, somehow, even dumber, because based on non-obvious, made up facts.<p>What am I missing?')
