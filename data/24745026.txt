I can&#x27;t count how many hours I&#x27;ve had to put in to wrangle the RN packager in to a monorepo with TypeScript and code-sharing across packages, and it&#x27;s still unbelievably fragile and I can&#x27;t actually share components between them. At this point I&#x27;ve made so many little alterations to the config from GitHub issues and StackOverflow answers that I literally have no idea how it works or how to replicate it to a new project. It&#x27;s an absolute nightmare.')
