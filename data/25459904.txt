I suppose I was unintentionally channelling your style.  Just trying to provide synthesis and direct attention at some nuance that usually doesn&#x27;t show up when this topic gets perennially brought to the fore.<p>Messy as my piece above is, hopefully there&#x27;s enough there and&#x2F;or it&#x27;s received at a deep enough level for a sufficient number of folks that it doesn&#x27;t smolder out.  There&#x27;s a flame here that I&#x27;d like to see kept alive and hopefully renewed, ideally at a frequency matching how often these discussions periodically reappear, or at a minimum some fraction of thatâ€”at least until we&#x27;ve arrived in utopia.')
