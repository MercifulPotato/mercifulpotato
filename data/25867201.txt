Item(by='__blockcipher__', descendants=None, kids=[25867472], score=None, time=1611279943, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25866936, text='Great comment.<p>Just to add a bit more nuance, I think we tend to focus a lot on community contributions, but IMO the biggest benefit of FOSS is not that; it&#x27;s adoption.<p>Even if Elastic writes 100% of the code, by making it open source, they are promoting the widespread adoption of their software. A project with a non-free license or a custom license is a non-starter at many (most?) companies, or at a minimum requires talking to legal which is a PITA.<p>So, even with no community contributions, Elastic would never have been able to get to where they&#x27;re at now - making $500MM in revenue a year and at a $15B evaluation - if it weren&#x27;t open source.<p>Now just to be clear, Elastic is totally allowed to close things up now that they&#x27;ve reaped the benefits. The beautiful irony is that, when you close source after <i>you&#x27;ve</i> reaped the benefits, by definition you&#x27;ve also hit the point where it&#x27;s now obviously beneficial for a company like Amazon to make their own fork and keep their AWS Elasticsearch cash cow going.<p>So, ultimately the community is totally fine. Indeed Elastic has been going down this road for a few years now, so it&#x27;s actually a good thing for us that this happened. Better to have an amicable divorce early rather than a messy one later. But I can&#x27;t help but point out that Elastic has broken its promises and misled the community - to their detriment more than to ours.')
