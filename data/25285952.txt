She made demands to Google which they did not accept, but she does not specify what those demands were.  She also says that she doesn&#x27;t have a copy of the post she made to the &quot;Brain women and allies&quot;, but she doesn&#x27;t summarize it either, and given her position, I imagine she could get a copy from someone else in the group if she cared to.<p>I&#x27;d suggest given Timnit is choosing to only tell a very small part of the story here, and Google is obviously not going to publicly comment on an HR matter, especially one this sensitive, that it&#x27;s best to withhold judgment.')
