It&#x27;s the only definition of the term that I&#x27;m familiar with. Like the difference between writing your application and managing lifecycle and peripheral access all yourself directly to your MCU vs. using an RTOS to provide you facilities for task scheduling and I&#x2F;O primitives, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve never before encountered, &quot;Includes a full feature-rich OS&quot; as &quot;bare-metal&quot; before. Reading the title I assumed someone managed to get some flavor of Kubernetes running right on the hardware as the lowest-level software layer of the system. That would have meant bare-metal to me. What&#x27;s described here is running Kubernetes on a physical host rather than a virtual host from what I can tell, but it&#x27;s not running Kubernetes &quot;bare-metal&quot; because between Kubernetes and the &quot;metal&quot; is Linux.<p>Or at least that&#x27;s what it would mean in my world, but the interpretation appears to be different for others. Outside of confusion, I was also just disappointed. This article is just basically setting up Kubernetes. That it&#x27;s on a physical host is a lot less interesting and novel to me than if they&#x27;d managed to implement some shape of Kubernetes as the OS itself, which is what I&#x27;d originally interpreted the title to mean.')
