Quantumly randomise the list, such that there is no way of knowing what order the list is in until it is observed. This will divide the universe into O(n!) universes; however, the division has no cost, as it happens constantly anyway.<p>2. If the list is not sorted, destroy the universe. (This operation is left as an exercise to the reader.)<p>3. All remaining universes contain lists which are sorted.<p>- <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?QuantumBogoSort" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?QuantumBogoSort</a>')
