I think that just any of us has wishes and ways &quot;to do it&quot;.<p>If I ask somebody to cook for me, I expect the food to be palatable _to me_. But since I&#x27;m Italian, I&#x27;m probably picky about food, and I may not like some kind of exotic tastes. That&#x27;s totally ok.<p>What is not ok is to say to somebody &quot;cook for me&quot;, then classify the food as shit because &quot;I don&#x27;t like it&quot;. I should probably investigate a bit with the other person about my tastes (and the other person should, rightfully, ask questions!). They will still have plenty of opportunities to exercise their creativity, without pushing too many boundaries. Mind you: I think that boundaries should be pushed, but it&#x27;s unwise to push them too hardly at first.')
