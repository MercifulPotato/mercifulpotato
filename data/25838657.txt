Item(by='chme', descendants=None, kids=[25838740, 25843253], score=None, time=1611089183, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837317, text='Well copyright is, when it comes down to it, not very logical.<p>In the digital world every picture, video, audio or other copyrighted material is represented as a number, which can pretty much be any number, if the encoding can be freely chosen.<p>Transferring and storing those numbers (looking at you Ï€) could be a copyright violation or not, pretty much just depending on the intent.<p>Because proving intent is very difficult, the rules seem to have changed here a bit, so now the defendant would have to prove that they didn&#x27;t intent to do so... Which might be even more difficult, but who with money and influence cares about that.')
