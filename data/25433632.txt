It feels a bit like a chicken &amp; egg problem where to get recognized you need people to click on your site when searching, but to get people to click on your site when searching, your site needs to show up at least for your own name.<p>I already did all of the SEO recommendations<p>- Go to web.dev and make sure site is performant, accessible and crawlwable<p>- Added meta tags, nofollow tags, title tags, h1, etc<p>- Made sure the name of the site - Flurly - is in the title<p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can get around this problem?<p>Thanks!<p>FWIW if you google with quotation marks &quot;flurly.com&quot;, it will show up... but very few people who know that unfortunately')
