I could only find two sources with a version of that quote in French and neither had a citation of the original source. In fact, the only real quote from him I could find on soccer was «Au football, tout est compliqué par la présence de l&#x27;équipe adverse» (&quot;In football, everything is complicated by the presence of the other team.&quot;).<p>Interestingly, during my search I found an apt quote for this discussion from another 20th century French philosopher. Camus once said «Ce que je sais de la morale, c&#x27;est au football que je le dois» (&quot;What I know about morality, I owe to football&quot;). I guess he would be missing the point here too.')
