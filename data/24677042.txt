A wide variety of species enables equilibriums to be established with changing conditions, given a proper allowed rate of evolution.<p>From what I understand, the main existencial issue of CO2 and the subsequent global warming is the extinction of oxygen producing plankton in the oceans, which are apparently much more significant O2 producers than a typical forest.<p>This isn&#x27;t a large multi causal multi-species antropogenic extinction, it is a single group extinction failure mode, directly caused by &#x27;just global warming&#x27; which will automatically mean game over. We absolutely do need to curb greenhouse gases (not just CO2) and decelerate the trend of global temperature increase.')
