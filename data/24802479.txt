You see similar issues in a language like Swift, but Swift lets you create a memory leak very easily if you&#x27;re not aware of the issues. Which can be fine when you&#x27;re just starting out, you can always learn about it later. But Rust isn&#x27;t so charitable: you must learn about memory safety upfront. The plus side is that it&#x27;s significantly more difficult to accidentally create a memory leak.')
