I put your own reply through a character counter and got 470, roughly 2 tweets.<p>Any transcript of an in person conversation would substantially dwarf all but the longest comments; even a minute of a typical podcast is enough to fill several pages worth of paragraphs.<p>That we all seek the simplest way to express a thought is not a bug, it is a feature. Audible speaking has tons of filler words and useless offshoots that do nothing to further the main concept being conveyed. We choose to write down sentences instead to minimize cruft and maximize content. Twitter just takes it a step further, and incentivizes the optimization of written text itself.')
