I’m in London and often get boards within a week via DHL, or 2 weeks with the cheaper shipping option.<p>So, even further from &quot;dirt cheap&quot;. And it&#x27;s still not even in the same ballpark as going down to the store.<p>&gt; If you just want to play around with simple circuits then sure, use a breadboard.<p>And what do you think beginners are going to do? Of course there will usually come a time where you need a PCB for something, but the longer that can be delayed, the more likely that they&#x27;ll actually get past the hurdle.<p>&gt; There’s nothing “special” about a hot air station.<p>It&#x27;s another thing to buy, another thing to need to store somewhere, and another skill to learn.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it isn&#x27;t valuable, but there is also value in a gradual learning curve.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s easy to learn how to solder SMD components. Beginners will screw it up, but that&#x27;s the whole point of being a beginner, right?<p>See above.<p>&gt; It doesn&#x27;t only apply to your first order. I&#x27;ve ordered at the $2 price many times.<p>That hasn&#x27;t been my experience.')
