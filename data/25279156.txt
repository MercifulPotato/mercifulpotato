A few examples:<p>1. I have my phone set up to trust bluetooth in my car and unlock my phone.  I get in the car and say &quot;okay google, open spotify&quot; -- this is so that it will continue playing what I was listening to before I left work.<p>&quot;Okay&quot;, she says, and then tells me that she can&#x27;t do that because my screen is locked.  Sometimes this works, and sometimes it does not.<p>2. When I had Google Play Music it reliably would play random sub-par covers of songs rather than the original, even when I specified the artist.<p>3. Sometimes it decides to rely on screen input instead of audio controls.  I can&#x27;t do that while I&#x27;m driving.<p>4. It sometimes ends voice input too early or does voice input inconsistently.  I&#x27;ve sent messages to my wife saying &quot;I&#x27;m on my way home exclamation point&quot; instead of &quot;I&#x27;m on my way home!&quot;<p>5. Commands which have worked for months suddenly stop working.<p>6. Sometimes my screen stays on, forever, after asking to play music.  (OnePlus 7T, Android 10).  This does not always happen.<p>7. Google: &quot;Here&#x27;s your message, send it?&quot;\n   Me: Yes\n   Google: Sits there for a moment and pops up the results for &quot;Yes&quot; in the assistant.<p>My biggest gripe isn&#x27;t what it can and can not do.  It is the inconsistency that drives me up the wall.  I am not a heavy user and most of my requests are because I wish for it to be hands-free in a car with bluetooth audio.  I&#x27;m sure that this is a harder problem to solve than just me interacting with the phone, but it is a common use case.')
