This whole batterygate to me is kind of based on conjecture-- that Apple slowed old phones with the intention to sell more new ones. If there&#x27;s any supporting evidence, or anything that&#x27;s come up in discovery that Apple acted in bad faith, I&#x27;d possibly change my (admittedly biased) mind.<p>But really, slowing the phones down to extend battery life is a reasonable tradeoff and there&#x27;s just not a preponderance of evidence suggesting Apple acted in its own interests and hurt existing users. The main problem is this &quot;feature&quot; wasn&#x27;t out in the open, but again, it just doesn&#x27;t seem that bad to me.')
