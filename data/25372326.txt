Stop concentrating on immaterial issues, push for more competitive economy, lower taxes, less regulations<p>I agree that our dear leaders have to wake up - but <i>that</i> is not the direction they should go at all. Our taxes are already so low that many countries have problems financing taking care of basic needs like healthcare. Less regulation? This will directly, and <i>negatively</i>, impact the people of Europe because corporations always exploit every legal (and illegal) avenue to cut corners at the expense of the people.')
