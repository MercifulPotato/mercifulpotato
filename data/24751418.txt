Item(by='creato', descendants=None, kids=[24751530, 24751557, 24751428], score=None, time=1602477222, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24751345, text='The point of bail is to put the defendant (or someone close to them) on the hook to pay the bail if the defendant doesn&#x27;t show up in court.<p>Bail bondsmen offer a different deal: pay us a fee (smaller than the bond), we&#x27;ll pay your bail. If you don&#x27;t show up to court, the bondsmen loses the bail bond unless they can go find the defendant and bring them into court.<p>I think maybe the thing that should most change in this system is that practice of bail bondsmen&#x2F;bounty hunting is made illegal. That should lower bonds significantly, and maybe enable bail bonds to function more as they were originally intended.<p>I have no experience with any part of this, this is just my understanding.')
