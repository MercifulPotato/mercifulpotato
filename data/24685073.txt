It comes in two major versions: Microfiltration or a heating akin to UHT but shorter and at a lower temperature (127 °C vs 150 °C). Microfiltration won&#x27;t change the taste, heating will. Microfiltration may be combined with pasteurization (heating to around 72 °C) to inactivate enzymes which may affect shelf life.<p>Pasteurized milk will keep for 5 to 7 days, while ESL milk can keep for 12 to 21 days in the unopened container.')
