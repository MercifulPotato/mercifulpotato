So the analogy is not helpful.<p>Maybe 64 bit CPUs can get more resource efficient than older 32 bit models. But that&#x27;s a misdirected use of resources if you use such technolgy to make 32 bit CPUs obsolete. With the same technology 32 bit will always use less resource-demanding than 64 bit. And the claim was that 32 bit has so many use cases (basically all phones and many PCs) that economics of scale are possible.<p>Of course the nonsense model that you don&#x27;t pay for Internet services directly, but use Javascript and a lot of other bloat software to run advertisements on your phone to pay via a massive detour is not an energy-efficient approach.')
