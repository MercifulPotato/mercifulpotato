Most languages treat them differently (C assigns them a type, and a stride with it), but that is usually on top of them being integers.<p>Pointers &quot;point&quot; to (are addresses to) bytes, as he said. If you want you can pack data to a resolution of a bit, and some languages help you do that as well.<p>You can also do whatever you want with pointers (in some languages, ofc), like do bitwise operations on them. Aliasing them can be useful as well, in more then one way.<p>Why not just get rid of pointers ? You know you can.<p>Also, a byte is 0 .. 255. The hardest problem; naming things, and off by one errors.')
