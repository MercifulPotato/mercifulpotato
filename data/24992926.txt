But a lot of that of that control states used to have over such enforcement went out the window with the creation of the FBI, and before that with the surprisingly early invention of US Marshals and subsequent marshal law precedents (especially the amount of over-reach and expansion that happened in the &quot;Old West&quot; and &quot;frontier justice&quot;, even if most of that was with state&#x27;s permissions).<p>It&#x27;s a real head scratcher, though, how the party supposedly for &quot;state&#x27;s rights&quot; and &quot;constitutional originalism&quot; seems to be the party of frontier justice federal enforcement over state&#x27;s rights.')
