Its not clear if they were comparing to existing mac&#x27;s or more recent ryzen&#x2F;intel xe machines. Both of which have very significant GPU uplifts with their integrated GPUs.<p>AKA, I suspect a big part of those perf uplifts evaporate when compared with the laptops that are appearing in stores now.<p>And the ipad benchmarks also remain a wait and see, because the perf uplifts I&#x27;ve seen either are either safari based, or synthetic benchmarks like geekbench. Both of which seem to heavily favor apple&#x2F;arm cores when compared with more standard benchmarks. Apples perf claims have been dubious for years, particularly back when the mac was ppc. They would optimize or cherry pick some special case which allowed them to make claims like &quot;8x&quot; faster than the fastest PC, which never reflected overall machine perf.<p>I want to see how fast it does with the gcc parts of spec..')
