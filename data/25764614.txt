But it isn&#x27;t nearly important as the automatic immune system that quickly dispatches most potential pathogens that find their way into our body without any period of learning.  And that isn&#x27;t as important as the barriers like skin and mucus that prevent all the critters of the world from getting into us in the first place.')
