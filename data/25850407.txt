It doesn&#x27;t make sense to attribute presidential pardons to The Republican Party when there is a sole individual who decides who to pardon and why.<p>I&#x27;ll point out that, now that Donald Trump is out of power, many in the GOP in general have been rather quick to turn their backs on him and outright criticize him. While he was in power, sure, Republicans politicians were politically savvy enough to side with him, knowing that the alternative was suicide. But there is now room to disagree with Trump and we&#x27;re seeing many (like Mitch McConnell, and you don&#x27;t get more Republican than him!) use that opportunity to distance themselves.')
