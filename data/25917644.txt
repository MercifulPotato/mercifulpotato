These new injectables are reported by the article to be 89% and 66% more effective at preventing transmission.<p>What is this based on? Was I misinformed about Truvada&#x27;s effectiveness? Is this a decrease in an already very low chance of transmission? Or is this in comparison to people forgetting to take their daily pills vs a shot that a health care provider had record of administering?<p>It&#x27;s currently common in the gay community for sexually active, healthy people to take Truvada proactively to protect against HIV because it&#x27;s understood to be even more effective than condoms. If there is a better option or if the current option is not as effective as widely believed then standard of care should change.')
