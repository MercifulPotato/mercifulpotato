You can add in exceptions, but it turns into a can of worms. eg. should &quot;home&quot; users be able to bypass patent laws in any product? what counts as &quot;home&quot; users? can other companies abuse this to bypass the patent system entirely? eg. you invent a widget, you patent it so competitors can&#x27;t rip you off, but they sell widget kits: parts that allow a home user to assemble their own widget, exploiting the home use exemption. should that be allowed?')
