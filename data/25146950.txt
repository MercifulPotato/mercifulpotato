Oh, and AMD&#x27;s ROCm&#x2F;OpenCL support is really for general computing, i.e. CUDA alternative, unlike the ML Compute here. ML Compute is something Apple created specifically for running neural networks, nothing more, and roughly equivalent to TensorRT &#x2F; Android NN if you want to compare with other platforms. And it was here because the wall of Apple&#x27;s walled garden is too high that nobody other than them can effectively optimize NN inference&#x2F;training on their chip.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;tensorflow-rocm&#x2F;#history" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;tensorflow-rocm&#x2F;#history</a>')
