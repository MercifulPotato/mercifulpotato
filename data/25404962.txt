The curves match other respiratory viruses - or put another way, it&#x27;s flu season.<p>This was one of the running theories back in the spring, but it was hard to tell for sure until seeing it spike back up this fall exactly as one would expect if this were the case.<p>&gt; - Masks arenâ€™t as effective as we think<p>Also this, I think - masks are good at catching droplets from talking or coughing, but sometime between summer and now it&#x27;s suddenly become commonly known that this virus can hang in the air for an extended period indoors when there isn&#x27;t good ventilation - being truly airborne like that means it can just slip around the edges of the mask as you breathe.
