The layout of individual transistors and the layout between transistors is not going to be the same for different processes.  What customers actually want is high transistor density and low leakage current.  That isn’t how new processes are marketed though.  They’re marketed as the smallest feature, which does not have a linear relationship with performance metrics.')
