The ads actually load before the map renders.<p>While I love this site, it is not clear what <i>you</i> want the user to do. The subscription plan has a green icon, if that is the primary CTA, you should make it larger and red.<p>The left hand Nav is a distraction.<p>I guess in the end, I would do this:<p>Make a dedicated homepage that has the social feeds and global aircraft data on it and do not open directly to your map. On the homepage you can place more explicit calls to action for your subscription service.<p>This would likely allow your homepage to load in a second or two rather than a minute.')
