Unlike Twitter&#x2F;Facebook, scrapers won&#x27;t see your every mouse movement, how long you stare at any individual post, or any other of the more invasive tracking opportunities that are available to Twitter&#x2F;Facebook.<p>The scraping services also won&#x27;t know your email address unless you post it publicly or they figure it out some other way, so they&#x27;ll find it much harder to associate the data they scrape with your other online identities, too. This also makes the data less valuable to advertisers, so I imagine there&#x27;s less incentive to scrape it.')
