Each piece would be warm.  Assemble it and you have far more concentrated heat.  RTGs also work on temperature <i></i>differential<i></i>--when operating there&#x27;s going to be a system to eject that heat to get a maximum temperature gradient.  I can easily picture something like a fan blowing air over a radiator to maximize the power output--and there&#x27;s your &quot;wave of heat&quot;.')
