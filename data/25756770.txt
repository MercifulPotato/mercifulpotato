What a founder says at a TED talk (which I admit can often sound like the former) shouldn&#x27;t be conflated with the nuts and bolt conversations they have with their closest lieutenants and investors. Assuming we mean venture funded by &quot;startup&quot; the definition has always been growth oriented, highly risky and innovative through disruption.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also kind of indicative of how small startup ambitions have become. Acquisition has become a measure of success, not failure.<p>Really? I&#x27;m surprised you think that acquisition is either a measure of success or failure in a vacuum. Wouldn&#x27;t the terms and the specific deal be important than how a company exits? After all, there&#x27;s a world of difference between an acquihire and a strategic merger.')
