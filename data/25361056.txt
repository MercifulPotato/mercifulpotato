It&#x27;s just a number. You can lose weight by chopping off a limb or two. Weighing yourself every single day isn&#x27;t too useful either, because water weight can fluctuate too much from my own experience. On the other hand, gaining muscle weight is something to be happy about for most people, so it&#x27;s counterintutiive if you&#x27;re busting your ass training thinking you&#x27;re going to lose weight and end up gaining or reaching equilibrium by losing fat and also gaining muscle at the same time. A more meaningful goal would be aiming to lower bodyfat percentage, which is what most people are actually after. But most people don&#x27;t learn to measure bodyfat percentage at home. A scale is just the easiest way. I say, throw away the scale. My mindset is that I&#x27;m working out is becuase I&#x27;m trying to become stronger, and so that my body can handle more work. This way I can do more things that I enjoy doing. I try to eat healthier because it just feels good. Sometimes I may not eat as healthy, because that felt good at the time. Making skillful use of cheat days is important, because if you burn out and quit training or dieting, it&#x27;s downhill from there. My philosophy on diet is that, having special days to enjoy not so healthy, delicious food makes that food even more enjoyable compared to eating that way everyday and feeling like crap.')
