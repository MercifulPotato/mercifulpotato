I didn&#x27;t buy it because of that feature and had never even heard of it before.<p>My first reaction was thinking it was kind of ugly so initially I didn&#x27;t leave it on but after a month or so I noticed my eyes were getting strained so I tried it.<p>It is ugly, but it makes a big difference. Now, when I turn off the Low Blue Light mode I can instantly feel the strain on my eyes. The picture is gorgeous but it&#x27;s too bright and intense for work. Since I use several monitors I manually adjusted the others to reduce the blue.<p>The biggest downside is selecting colors for design work. The Low Blue Light screws that big time, but after comparing how different colors look on different monitors I decided not to worry about that too much because I have no control over that at all.')
