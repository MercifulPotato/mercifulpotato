The very definition of <i>rape</i> hinges on the detail of consent, which is why we can distinguish between kink and rape: People can consent to BDSM. The definition of <i>rape</i> does not hinge on the detail of whether or not it is physically aggressive or even violent.<p>If their primary issue is that it is an affront to their sense of dignity, making money off of it doesn&#x27;t fix the issue. That&#x27;s a bit like saying &quot;If you give a few bucks to the woman you raped, it&#x27;s somehow okay now that she didn&#x27;t want to have sex with you.&quot;<p>She&#x27;s highly unlikely to feel like giving her money afterwards somehow makes it okay to assault her.')
