The only way it can truly not affect anyone else is if no one else knows that you use ligatures.<p>And dark&#x2F;light is fundamentally different: it doesn’t actually <i>change the content</i>, just the colours. Similarly <i>most</i> font choices are purely presentational in effect, with the variation easily within what a normal viewer can be expected to read. (There are exceptions; for example, I’ve seen a couple of fonts go for a very old style of r in their fancy joined-writing style italics which Indians will have no trouble reading, but which has completely fallen out of use in most of the English-speaking world, certainly in Australia, and so may be difficult to read.)<p>But ligatures change the actual glyphs, so that your fingers must type something other than what your eyes see, and any viewer must decode the ligature’s meaning. And this is the key reason why the proliferation of ligatures in coding fonts becomes a problem for everyone.<p>If anyone else ever sees your screen (in person, in a screencast, or in teleconferencing with screen sharing), it has affected someone else.<p>At an objective level, I think it’s fairly clear that for most people in most circumstances, a light background is superior to dark, and ligatures are a bad idea. However, at a personal level, the subjective factors routinely outweigh the fairly slight objective factors.<p>Popularity breeds popularity. I have been exposed to ligatures in coding fonts on websites and other people’s screens. I never chose to use ligatures.<p>There’s an ancient philosophical question about personal freedoms in all this.')
