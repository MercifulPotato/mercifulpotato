Words that two black might say to one another may be casual but appropriate and yet extremely offensive if said by a white person, or, presumably, an AI, in a different context.<p>What the AI should say is hard given that there is no one right answer to the question of what any individual should say.  Different contexts change the equation completely.  Seems like a nightmare to define the behavior or test it.<p>The right solution may involve training a model on everything we have access to and finetuning it based on the context you want to use the model in and the historical examples we will build up of mistakes previous models have made.')
