You don&#x27;t have to be an avid reader to enjoy a novel, just as you don&#x27;t have to be a graphics designer to become a novelist.  The austere presentation may not appeal to some, yet it has relatively little to do with what can be contained within the pages or who can access it.<p>I would also argue that Gemini is very usable from the reader&#x27;s point of view.  Suggesting otherwise says more about technical literacy than anything else.  GUI clients are available for the major platforms and are straightforward to install on Macintosh and Windows, so the only real barrier to entry is being able to install one&#x27;s own software.')
