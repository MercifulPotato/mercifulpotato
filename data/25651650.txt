For these, JMeter and whatever service you&#x27;re using for analytics&#x2F;metrics work perfectly fine (New Relic, is the current favorite). Then we can compare average latency, Error Rates, etc. with what we get during JMeter.<p>The issue is that most managers or other PHB want more than just a one off for load testing. And this article greatly covers that.<p>A lot of time people want a Swiss Army Knife of tools for &quot;automation&quot;, where load testing falls under that category for them.<p>This magical tool should be able to:<p>* Test your API calls from a functional, integration, and a performance (not load testing; just making sure we&#x27;re under specific latency)<p>* Test your Web-sites from the same testing perspectives, as well as being modular (ie: Selenium&#x27;s POM)<p>* Integrate with CI so specific tests, test suites&#x2F;flows can be tested for every new build, and we can run specific workflows by clicking a button<p>* Be used during load testing so we can measure latency and run tests while recreating customer experience from the Web side of things<p>For each of these steps, there is at least one good tool or library to handle things. However, I&#x27;ve found it difficult to find something that handles all of these well and where (most importantly) the other devs are willing to pick it up.<p>Selenium&#x2F;Web Driver handles the UI tests. Postman and a handful of others can perform the API tests. JMeter is the de facto for load testing at every place I&#x27;ve been to. And you can write any of these into your CI.<p>Is there something that can do all of this well, and has a low enough overhead where devs on your team are willing enough to actually use it as more than just a toy or experiment?')
