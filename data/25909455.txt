Adams is taking snippets of videos completely out of context to try to tell a story.  He&#x27;s known to do this. And just watching the start of the video that&#x27;s exactly what he&#x27;s doing here.<p>Why would anyone waste their time tracking down the original videos when they already know, out of the gate, that he&#x27;s taken things out of context?  That&#x27;s a waste of everyone&#x27;s time, and EXACTLY why he&#x27;s doing what he&#x27;s doing.  He knows most people won&#x27;t bother to fact check his lies.<p>The correct course of action is to tell everyone what he does, and until he proves he&#x27;s changed his stripes and starts acting in good faith, to ignore him.')
