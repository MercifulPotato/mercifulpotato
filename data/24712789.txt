Item(by='Fej', descendants=None, kids=[24714129], score=None, time=1602105104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24710897, text='&gt; my favorite part is the PS5 consumer friendly expandable storage<p>This is a pattern, the PS3 and PS4 both had end-user accessible bays which contain a 2.5&quot; HDD. Any drive can be formatted even from blank using the console&#x27;s safe mode.<p>&gt; the XboX overpriced and proprietary SSD cartridges<p>This is also a pattern. The original Xbox and Xbox One had internal hard drives that were not end-user serviceable. The Xbox 360 used 2.5&quot; HDDs in cases. The original 360 drives had a special port on the cases, for whatever reason. The 360 S&#x2F;E drives used regular SATA connections, it&#x27;s plainly obvious looking at one that the connector is just the edge of a 2.5&quot; HDD.')
