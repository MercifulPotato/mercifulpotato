It forced me to ask existential questions like, &quot;Should there really be salt in butter?&quot; But the fact is, putting salt in stuff is an old conservation method. Because of it, unsalted butter was looked upon as fresher, and thus of higher value when used as spread or in cooking. As far as I know, the idea of unsalted butter was actually popularized by French gourmands! But as newer and cleaner dairy production methods came about, the production of unsalted butter became more common. On top of that, the colder climate in Scandinavia means that unsalted butter keeps for longer than in warmer countries. So that&#x27;s why Norwegian butter isn&#x27;t salted. But yeah, as for the &quot;grater knife;&quot; I think it just made it to the top of my wish-list for Christmas!')
