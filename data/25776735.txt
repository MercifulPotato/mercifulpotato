I worked for a small electrical engineering firm building software to configure our devices. We were pretty apolitical overall, but I guess you could say we had a slight interest in legalized marijuana because our product was being used in the grow industry. Even then, no politics ever arised except for the occasional quip during a meeting.<p>The place I currently work does software in a trade industry (think electricians, plumbers, etc) and there is pretty much no politics either.<p>Outside of &quot;big tech&quot;, I think the political portion decreases dramatically, at least for the employees. I&#x27;m sure owners have to focus on tax laws and such, but as an employee writing code, not so much.')
