Democrats and Republicans agree on more than they think. At least those in the middle. We&#x27;ve fallen into this trap of thinking we&#x27;re totally divided when we argue on the margins about taxes and healthcare (and don&#x27;t get me wrong, there are some pretty big divisions there).<p>But today we&#x27;re not really arguing over the margins; the question before us today is &quot;should we live in a democracy where the people decide the outcome of elections?&quot; 90% of Democrats and Republicans will agree that yes! We should!<p>Let&#x27;s secure our democracy, then we can go back to arguing over the tax rate.')
