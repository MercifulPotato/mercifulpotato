Every article of clothing that has persisted is still in pretty good shape, maybe a little faded at the worst. If anything, over the years I&#x27;ve started to pay more attention to what materials my clothes are made of so they do last. For example I stopped buying any kind of stretchy t-shirt as all of the necks become ribbons within a few months. I have cotton shirts that are 8 years old that look great. Everything wool looks just as good, too; if anything they&#x27;re more comfortable.')
