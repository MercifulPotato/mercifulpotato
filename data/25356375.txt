A YHOO stockholder would get some amount of Altaba stock, and whatever the Verizon part was (I don&#x27;t remember if that was Verizon stock, cash, a choice, whatever); probably no fractional shares.<p>As the holdings were sold, there were large cash dividends, with holdbacks for taxes and contigencies. As the contigencies timed out, smaller dividends happened, and I think Altaba formally wound down with a final dividend earlier this year.')
