They actively seek out channels of bias. If everyone were so conscientious as to be seeking the truth society would have far fewer problems.<p>Second, there is no such thing as &#x27;web of trust&#x27;, it&#x27;s an academic idea.<p>Third, it&#x27;s unnecessary. We already have pretty good institutions.<p>FYI I just checked the commentary on Fox to see where there plebes minds are at this morning, and this was the 4th comment on the top article:<p>&quot;The military must restore President Trump to the presidency.<p>Any pockets of military resistance should be dealt with.<p>Our country needs military law and God&#x27;s chosen President, President Trump.<p>President Trump for life!!!!&quot;<p>A few comments down:<p>&quot;MARTIAL LAW MARTIAL LAW MARTIAL LAW MARTIAL LAW MARTIAL LAW MARTIAL LAW MARTIAL LAW MARTIAL LAW MARTIAL LAW MARTIAL LAW<p>FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT<p>STEALING AN ELECTION IS AN ACT OF WAR!
