I&#x27;ve wanted to use COBOL for a real project for a while, and porting the backend seemed like a fine excuse :-D<p>It&#x27;s been slow going because the IBM docs are <i>extremely</i> dense, but the project so far has convinced me that if IBM i were available to hobbyists at a reasonable price, it would be a much bigger player in the market. Building simple CRUD-style apps is trivial, with the &quot;GUI&quot; design being almost VB-levels of easy.')
