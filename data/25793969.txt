Machine learning and hacking. I think machine learning will be too similar to normal software development though. So maybe hacking is a good direction for me to try.<p>I&#x27;ve tried and failed with metasploit in the past. Failed because I couldn&#x27;t find a good book. I know to be a hacker you have to know about a lot of things. I&#x27;m more interested in hacking into networks, finding vulnerabilities, and exploiting them. All legally, of course.<p>Please tell me what book I should read first. Thank you, and I will see you in Zion.')
