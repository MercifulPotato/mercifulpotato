The tension exists, but it&#x27;s not such a simple trade-off, and the dynamic is highly context dependent. The complexity is in identifying and achieving the best business model.<p>Like with the GPL 20 years ago, the intuition <i>today</i> seems to be that licenses like the AGPL are simply anathema to adoption (because &quot;viral&quot;, etc) and therefore market capture, and if you can&#x27;t capture the market you can&#x27;t monetize your investment. It&#x27;s something of a self-fulfilling prophecy, but eventually more people (authors, users, etc) will begin to explore the space commercially and, hopefully, disprove the conventional wisdom.')
