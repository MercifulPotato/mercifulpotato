It says &quot;fastest integrated&quot; (and in the fine print that integrated is specifically unified monolithic die, eliminating chiplet-style products), and then also &quot;M1 delivers significantly higher graphics performance than the very latest PC laptop chip â€” for up to 2x the graphics speed.&quot;<p>So take the 4800U, which has among the fastest commercially available integrated graphics in a monolithic die, and double the GPU performance. If you needed a discreet GPU in your laptop previously this probably won&#x27;t change that.')
