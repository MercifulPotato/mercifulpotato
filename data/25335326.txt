The high school principal passed out bibles, prayer was held before many sports practices or events, recruiters&#x2F;councilors for Christian youth groups sat with the students at the cafeteria at lunch, etc.  Some of the science teachers taught science well, though others made it explicit that they were Creationists and were only teaching evolution&#x2F;Earth science because they had to, and that the students could stick around after class to hear &#x27;what really happened&#x27;.<p>This was on top of another layer of class conflict between the middle class teachers&#x2F;administration and lower class&#x2F;trailer park kids, who mostly dropped out at 16 which was fine with the admin. Lots of additional pressure on other students who didn&#x27;t conform for various race&#x2F;gender&#x2F;etc. reasons.  And then completely bizarre stuff like, though the official reason for not having a soccer team was that it would detract from the sacrosanct football program, many of the teachers were clear that believed soccer to be a Communist sport (this was in the 90s when the cold war was long over).<p>Many of the perpetrators here are very nice people and fine neighbors, but if you aren&#x27;t an evangelical Christian it can be a challenge.  Especially if you&#x27;re not white: the KKK is still a well known presence just down the road in Harrison, AR, so it&#x27;s not just woke fearmongering.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to live in these environments as an adult and be able to blow a lot of it off, but it&#x27;s another thing completely to have kids there, which really detracts from the &#x27;leave California to raise kids&#x27; motivation.<p>And it would be better at a larger city like St. Louis or Indianapolis but some fraction of the population of those places are from towns like mine and don&#x27;t find these beliefs and practices to be particularly problematic.')
