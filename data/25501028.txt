It loads fast.<p>What I don&#x27;t get - all these high and mighty web devs can&#x27;t seem to deliver clean websites that work without Google beating them over the heads with AMP. Is it that they cower in front of management with demands for YET ANOTHER tracker (seriously, websites ship with like 10 trackers - why?) They feel the need to show off their lazy loading dynamic content skills that jank the page?<p>So thank goodness for AMP, perhaps developers will actually try to compete with it a bit by building usable non-amp websites.<p>And trust me, users are getting trained that the lighting bolt actually does mean FAST.<p>Anyways - when I read another rant from a web developer about AMP - a small request. How about de-jankifying and de-scamifying the web first a bit more? Then we won&#x27;t need to turn to google for all this stuff.')
