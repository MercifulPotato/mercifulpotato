Past systems are a useful benchmark for what it&#x27;s practical to do with a certain level of computational horsepower.<p>&gt; Slack is taking less than 1% of my Ram.<p>My system has 8GB, so 3.7%. I&#x27;d rather have 3.4% of my memory back.<p>More broadly, we should consider that we may run <i>many</i> bloated apps. Even if Slack doesn&#x27;t do too much harm on its own, if all your desktop apps are using 10x the resources they could be using, it adds up to you spending more on hardware than you should have to.<p>You paid for that 16GB of RAM. That should let you do a lot more than old computers can, rather than doing the same things we did 15 years ago with bloated software.<p>&gt; At the time AIM was the dominant chat client, and it probably took more like 5% of RAM available.<p>Right, like Ripcord, it did roughly the same thing Slack&#x2F;Teams do, using far fewer resources.')
