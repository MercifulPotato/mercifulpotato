But it can be unfair to judge a religion by the worst parts of its holy texts. Here&#x27;s 1 Samuel 15:<p>7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.<p>8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.<p>9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly....<p>10 Then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, saying,<p>11 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the Lord all night.<p><i>and then Samuel tells Saul:</i><p>18 And the Lord sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.<p>19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the Lord?<p>So here we have the Israelites slaughtering an entire population. But God is angry with them, <i>because they did not also slaughter all the cattle.</i><p>Would it be fair to make that a summary of modern Christianity?')
