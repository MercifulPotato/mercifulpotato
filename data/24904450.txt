I&#x27;m mostly not.<p>First I don&#x27;t want to catch something (aids, chlamydia, herpes, ...) so a few minutes of sex doesn&#x27;t seem worth the risk. I know, at least according to popular media that puts me in the minority. If my attitude is common it&#x27;s probably not easy to spot.<p>Second, I don&#x27;t want to hurt people. I know they exist but 9 times out of 10 people I meet want a serious relationship and would be hurt if we slept together than then I called it quits. I wouldn&#x27;t lie to them directly but they&#x27;d feel like I was lying to them if I say, slept with them 2-3 times and then stopped seeing them. So, I basically don&#x27;t get into it in the first place unless I believe that I&#x27;d like to be with them longer term. Of those people that could be more casual usually issue 1 comes up. They sleep around so they are more likely to have something and plus I don&#x27;t want my heart broken.<p>Third, I&#x27;m also someone who just wants one person not just for sex but for love and companionship so my attitude is bad when meeting &#x2F; looking for people. My attitude is &quot;can I see myself being with this person long term&quot; instead of &quot;would it be fun to be with this person for the moment&quot;. That answer is quite often &quot;no, I can&#x27;t see myself being with this person long term&quot;. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s that strange of a thought. A stereotype of a story is the person that doesn&#x27;t think this way and has lots of failed relationships for choosing superficial qualities of attractiveness as their reason for getting into a relationship. But, at least they had a relationship.<p>Anyway, the sum of those 3 things and possibly some bad luck being in jobs which have few members of the opposite sex and friends that have few friends of the opposite sex means I haven&#x27;t had a relationship for ~17 years. I hope every day that will change, I frequent 5 dating sites. I have matches. But getting something started seems really hard. I would do much better if I went to church (I&#x27;m atheist) or did some activity where I got to know people over time and become friends first. I&#x27;ve gone to several meetups but if they are truly about something I care about they usually have few members of the opposite sex. I&#x27;ve been to a few otherwise but it&#x27;s been the same bad luck I guess. No one I&#x27;m interested in or no one that shows interest.')
