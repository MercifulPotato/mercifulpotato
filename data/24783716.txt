That a Mac repair shop owner violated all ethical standards to spy on a customer laptop.\nThat after stealing the customer&#x27;s laptop and data and finding supposedly treasonous data on it, he gave it to Trump&#x27;s campaign team instead of the FBI.<p>There&#x27;s no evidence that it&#x27;s true and substantial evidence that it&#x27;s false.')
