Points don&#x27;t matter if a mod likes or dislikes a story.  Think of them as Editors and we are submitting stories they (the mods) may enjoy.  The point value on the story is irrelevant.<p>A single person with 500 karma can &quot;gray out&quot; your post and suddenly you&#x27;re outed as someone with a &quot;wrong&quot; opinion.<p>Users have the ability to flag posts, essentially make them invisible if they don&#x27;t agree with an opinion.  Get a few users to gang up on someone and you can silence people and ideas easily.<p>Points on HN are an illusion.  People with 500+ karma and the mods are the only ones with power here.')
