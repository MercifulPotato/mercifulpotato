Decoupling is making something truly independent, not making the dependency injectable. Making it injectable is the last resort when you can&#x27;t make it independent.<p>The real thing you should be thinking of is, look at those libraries and their documentation &#x2F; READMEs (depending on library size, smaller actually preferred). Can I make my code modules more like that? Will the API boundaries I define make sense?')
