You are free to engage in this dialog without using false dichotomies if you choose.<p>As to making people “seem like they are anti-police”, why would I need to do that?  I don’t think people have a problem with being seen as anti-police.  Is there something wrong with being anti-police?  It seems like an entirely valid position to hold.<p>Being anti-police as an institution doesn’t automatically mean being in favor of mob violence against individuals. You can be strongly against a structure, without hating the individuals who occupy the role.<p>It is possible to want to hold the police accountable without believing that the <i>only</i> way to do this is to dehumanize them, or to doxx them.<p>All you have done here is double down on an extremist position.<p>“The police” is a very large and diverse group of people.  You have said you feel no remorse for anything that happens to them.<p>You have said that you are willing to completely dehumanize all police, and support violence of any kind against all of them and the killing of innocent people in the name of your cause, which is an unspecified ‘accountability’.<p>You are therefore a politically violent extremist, or at the very least someone who supports politically violent extremism if such a distinction can be made.')
