In the near future, when Apple drops Intel from their <i>entire</i> laptop product line, it is very likely that they&#x27;ll bring their Apple Silicon cameras from their mobile products to their laptop products. (Yes, there&#x27;s a &#x27;version zero&#x27; MBP with the M1, and a teardown showed that it&#x27;s literally a drop-and-swap of the motherboard with no other component changes at all. It&#x27;s literally the &quot;get this out the door so that developers can start finding issues so we can fix them for the masses&quot; model. Hope y&#x27;all waited to upgrade if you&#x27;re not developers for Apple products!)<p>Everyone assumes that it&#x27;s only the camera module that needs to be updated, but forgets that it&#x27;s the image processing hardware circuits that make DSLRs and iOS devices produce such gorgeous images. This, in a nutshell, is why USB webcam makers can&#x27;t compete: they aren&#x27;t willing to raise their price by $50 to incorporate a real image processing chip that&#x27;s able to handle the sensor adequately, and their software is crap because it&#x27;s bargain-basement and hacked-together to avoid the hardware spend. Imagine if we could purchase Leica and Nikon and Canon webcams, with the ability to use DSLR controls to set them up, and then have them just produce gorgeous photos at any time. So far, Apple is the <i>only</i> webcam maker that&#x27;s taken it far enough to earn praise. It&#x27;s really unfortunate.')
