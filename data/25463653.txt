Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t look perfect but it always feels correct and closer to true to life.<p>I have long held that lighting more than textures was the missing realism in games, and if you have ever played retraced minecraft I think you get what I mean. Even the pixelated textures and block world of minecraft feel like a real world when rendered with correct lighting.')
