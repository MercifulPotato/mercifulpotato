Even the most sophisticated Arab diplomats that I dealt with did not understand why the First Amendment allows someone to burn a Koran. Why, they asked me, would you ever want to protect that?&quot; -Richard Stengel, Biden Transition Team Member<p>That quote is clearly an observation, not a call to action in itself. It is an observation that the US&#x27;s notion of free speech is not at all universal, and can be confounding even to people with some quality (&quot;sophistication&quot;, perhaps &quot;worldliness&quot; or other terms would be more helpful descriptors) that the author wouldn&#x27;t expect it to confound.<p>You&#x27;re claiming that it&#x27;s some kind of call to action against &quot;unfettered free speech&quot; (which we already don&#x27;t have in the US anyways).<p>Present an actual argument instead of taking a quote (properly attributed but sans context) and jump to conclusions that aren&#x27;t in it. How hard is that to do? Learn how to construct and present arguments in ways that actually have a chance to persuade instead of making statements that verge on non sequiturs.<p>Here, I&#x27;ll help you: Link to the actual opinion piece [0]. It&#x27;s clear from that that he&#x27;s arguing in favor of hate speech laws (which is a slippery slope, I&#x27;m pretty sure a few &quot;Christians&quot; I know would like hate speech laws so they could stop me from calling them anti-Christians), and thinks there&#x27;s already precedent for such laws.<p>&gt; The modern standard of dangerous speech comes from Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) and holds that speech that directly incites “imminent lawless action” or is likely to do so can be restricted.<p>You didn&#x27;t present that part though, I only stumbled on it because someone else linked to it in this thread.<p>TL;DR: You are terrible at argumentation.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;why-america-needs-hate-speech-law&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;why-ameri...</a>')
