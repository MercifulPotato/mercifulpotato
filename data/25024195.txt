Any idea if he has a blog or anything less time consuming than one of his books?<p>&gt;  But there is no way the Biden campaign and professional media whose job it is to suss these things out had no idea.<p>That&#x27;s what&#x27;s so hilarious about reading forums, especially populated with intelligent people.  It&#x27;s like, do you guys really think not a single politician or member of the media can spot the gaping holes in these stories?  Or, does it seem plausible that almost half of voters opted for reelecting Trump because they&#x27;re racist, cult members, etc?  But then those questions are answered on the regular in comments and voting.<p>&gt; The hard part is not falling into Gell-Mann amnesia. We saw this with our own eyes and know they misled us. When the next news story comes out, will we just accept it as fact? Most will, I admit I catch myself struggling with this.<p>I am really looking forward to the drastic swing we&#x27;re going to have in narrative, and observing how the masses react to it.  Reddit is already well underway, but once the momentum gets going it will be awesome.  Will be interesting to see how long it takes before we need to engage in some regretful military intervention in the middle east.  Seems like street level terrorism has suddenly reappeared out of nowhere in Europe, seems like a decent enough base for some narrative spinning.')
