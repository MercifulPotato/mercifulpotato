PCB traces themselves add a maximum of 6ns roundtrip.<p>DDR PHYs on both sides do huge amounts of analog, and digital signal conditioning. Refresh system add random latency if you hit a refresh cycle. Prefetch-burst mechanism also adds limits of your effective random access times.<p>This is why HBM may well beat regular DDR on real world latencies.')
