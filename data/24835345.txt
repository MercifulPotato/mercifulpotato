Vista, 7, 10. All of them &quot;bootlooped&quot; i.e. an error occurs during update but windows does not delete the failed update from cache.<p>Imagine being a 13 year old kid with a Vista laptop trying to install .NET Framework because he wanted to play Terraria but then his laptop becomes useless. Of course that is going to breed resentment and fueled my switch to Arch Linux.<p>I managed to &quot;unbrick&quot; a  Windows 10 system by disabling the windows update service and by deleting the cache folder. Windows updates are just universally bad.')
