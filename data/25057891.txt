Basically I found out that I could spawn a separate process for each physical storage interface, and I was able to hash like 7 TiB of data in a little over 7 hours. My understanding was that threads are subject to GIL and thus cannot run on multiple cores, whereas processes don&#x27;t have that same restriction, so I needed to use the multiprocessing library, NOT the multithreading library to parallelize my I&#x2F;O.<p>Also, the featured video is from 2015. Maybe it&#x27;s just outdated information?')
