I have been part of both software startups and biotech startups and I can tell you the latter is significantly harder than the former for a fresh CEO to do well. The college drop-out CEO of a software company can be the expert in the product and know everything about where they want to take it and how it&#x27;ll function. In biotech, no one knows biology--we have ideas about how it works, but no one fully understands it the way we understand computer systems because humans didn&#x27;t build it. There is no instruction manual. The other issue are regulations around protecting human health and manufacturing. I can go on, but I think you get my point.')
