I&#x27;m fairly certain a lot of the posts are self-deprecating - eg. &quot;my wife&#x27;s boyfriend&quot;, &quot;i&#x27;m a r**d&quot;, &quot;someone smarter than me&quot;, &quot;i&#x27;m a gay bear&quot;.  My wife doesn&#x27;t have a boyfriend (hopefully), but I&#x27;d say that in a post there.<p>This isn&#x27;t necessarily inflammatory.  It is - like it or not - WSB&#x27;s culture.  It is not meant to be taken literally.<p>It is a frothy place, full of herd mentality.  That is part of the clique.  Going against that does incur the same tone of language against you.  But it&#x27;s not for who you are personally.  It&#x27;s the same language they use to describe the &quot;in group&quot;, but it _seems_ worse to the out group.<p>Is the intent to mock people?  No.  Does it mean anything negative?  No, 99% of it is literally re. the financials.  Are there bad people in every group?  Yes.')
