But I would like to push for a higher standard of discussion, which has always been the draw of this community, particularly for technical articles (and this is actually a high quality technical article!). So I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be happy being generous to a low value comment that re-states an opinion from the submitted article without adding anything or even without adding much.')
