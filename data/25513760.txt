A story can&#x27;t just be a moment feel good?<p>It has to be reinforcing systematic injustice or a looking glass for how terrible so many have it?<p>It can&#x27;t just be something that makes you go &quot;huh, neat, good for him&quot; and you move on with life?&quot;<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying it <i>has</i> to be that, I once again reiterate it&#x27;s fine to look deeper and for negatives, just maybe actually keep it relative to the story... but just &quot;accepting the bait&quot; as it were...<p>Would it really be so terrible if all someone got out of it was a moment of a smile rather than some grand philosophical prototypical mind twisting that defines a story?<p>Stories don&#x27;t have some sort of &quot;answer&quot; there&#x27;s no singular reason why they all exist.')
