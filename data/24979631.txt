If you got pushed that way by a one-on-one shoe fitting, you certainly did get &quot;conned.&quot;<p>As someone who has had only one professional running shoe fitting in my life, I found it invaluable. They were able to immediately identify where my stride was going wrong.  They advised me not just on the shoe, but on improving my gait.  I bought one full-price shoe once, then was able to buy similar shoes on sale&#x2F;clearance. Following the fitting (and guidance), I&#x27;ve not had the same knee pain since.<p>YMMV, but it&#x27;s not all cons.  It&#x27;s a middle-ground between nothing and a full-fledged sports therapy.')
