Item(by='erlkonig', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604951147, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25036036, text='An IDE has some integration benefits, sure, for a relatively tiny number of languages, typically, compared to Emacs and Vim, at the cost of <i>amazing</i> raw editing capability no IDE comes close to.  Samples: copy&#x2F;paste rectangles of text, interactive regular expression replace, dynamic abbreviation expansion, edit remote files via SSH, exchange words around punctuation, treat words, lines, sentences, expressions, functions as movable units, works on a bare terminal, works via X, spawns windows on other displays while sharing the same buffers, saves multiple cursor positions, supports macros that can cross modes (open&#x2F;close files in the directory browser and mod them in a single macro), and so on ad nauseam. Anyone only aware of just using arrows keys in their IDE to move around and DEL + text insert to edit is blind to an entire universe of elevated editing possibilities in true power editors like Vim and Emacs.<p>Emacs is my IDE.  I use Vim too.  Both in their native keybindings.  And when I taught, I had all my Unix students learn both of them the same way.  I have <i>never</i> seen another editor that comes even close to them for power of raw text manipulation.  Got one?')
