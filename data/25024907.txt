But that quote, in context, might easily be read as &quot;we don&#x27;t want them to think this [because it isn&#x27;t true]&quot;.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Sanger didn&#x27;t like black people, but based on the evidence you&#x27;re throwing out in dribs and drabs she expected them to stop having children <i>because that would make them better off</i>.<p>Let me ask you straight up: are you arguing that black people shouldn&#x27;t have access to contraception and abortion? Because Sanger is basically arguing that black people (and indeed, all people) should have voluntary access to contraception and abortion, and that black doctors should be trained to provide them as services. Even if you doubt her motives, it is a struggle for me to see what the complaint is. Would that my enemies were so dedicated to giving me options.<p>Also, note that she is very direct and willing to use phrases like &#x27;colored people&#x27; and &#x27;negro population&#x27; when she is talking about black people. No dog whistles.')
