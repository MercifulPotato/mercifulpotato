The RCE is in a product for which Microsoft don&#x27;t have any bug bounty product at all (they only run a bug bounty for a very limited number of products, and Microsoft Teams Desktop is not one of them). Hence the RCE falls outside of the classification.<p>The technicality is still absurd and beyond belief, but I&#x27;d say the responsibility for that absurdity falls with company policy, not with the MS security staffer&#x27;s classification.')
