If you would find yourself searching Twitter for &quot;mayos&quot;, &quot;yts&quot;, or &quot;white people&quot;, then I can see why you don&#x27;t enjoy it and I can see why you don&#x27;t want to use Twitter. That&#x27;s a very reasonable decision.<p>I just wanted you to have the information that there are certain ways to use the tool to get good SNR. If you decide that using the tool in those ways is not worth it to you, that would be reasonable as well and I won&#x27;t try to convince you otherwise. If you already had that information, then it was just wasted effort on my part, which I&#x27;m willing to accept.')
