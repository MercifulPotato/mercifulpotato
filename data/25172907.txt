And to make the waters even more muddy, some of it just boils down to personal preference.  My office was open-plan, but my section of it was always relatively quiet, so it usually wasn&#x27;t difficult to focus and get work done, even without headphones.  It was nice to see my teammates and do 1-on-1 meetings actually face to face, in person, and to run into other colleagues and have an impromptu chat, either about work or non-work topics.  I had a 30-minute walk to&#x2F;from the office that helped me clear my head and get ready to start the day, or wind down and end my day.<p>Even then, pre-pandemic, I preferred to work from home most of the time, even though I didn&#x27;t have a desk at home.  Turns out I just <i>like</i> being home during the day, and like being able to take little short breaks here and there, without feeling weird about it at an office.  And even though our office wasn&#x27;t too bad with random interruptions, I liked having essentially zero interruptions at home.<p>Fortunately we (coincidentally) moved into a larger space a few days before SF&#x27;s shelter-in-place order back in March, and now have a dedicated office room with an adjustable desk and monitor (a big thanks to my employer for providing reimbursement for some home-office expenses this year).  Pre-pandemic, my partner did go into the office most of the time, and I don&#x27;t think the two of us would have been comfortable in the old place (a loft with no doors and walls), working and taking Zoom meetings every workday.  (But I easily recognize that if we had kids, neither space would have been great for permanent working from home.)<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to recognize that everyone&#x27;s situation really is different (as you point out), and that even people with similar situations can just have different preferences and attitudes that can make them productive and happy with some setups, and unfocused and uneasy with others.<p>I think we also need to remember that this is not a standard shift to working from home.  We&#x27;re doing this as part of a global pandemic that has nerves frayed and has put a lot of other restrictions on our day-to-day lives.  I expect that many people who are having issues working from home due to social&#x2F;collaboration reasons would have fewer complaints if there was no pandemic and they could get their social interaction from hanging out with friends at their houses or in public places.  And many who previously worked at an office 5 days a week, every week, and miss the office, might be happy in normal times working from home anywhere from 1-4 days a week, getting their &quot;office fix&quot; on the other day(s).')
