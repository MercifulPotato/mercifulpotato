The &quot;escaped from lab&quot; odds increase the most because they guess (and it is a guess) that the Wuhan lab does &quot;20% of the gain-of-function research in the world&quot;<p>That only makes anything resembling sense if they can establish that C19 is caused by gain-of-function research - but they haven&#x27;t done that.<p>The whole hypothesis chain is full of this weak reasoning. For example the &quot;lab dissociated itself from bat research&quot; claim uses an unreferenced article by Miranda Devine in the NYPost as a source. Devine is an Australian columnist who left Australia after being forced to apologise for making up a story that a 9yo boy with dwafism was running a scam[1]. If this site was being honest in their approach they&#x27;d include that as evidence her claims on this story might be made up too.<p>Edit: and in (sarcasm) astonishing news, they also think the Syrian chemical attacks weren&#x27;t carried out by the Syrian regime[2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;junkee.com&#x2F;miranda-devine-apology-quaden-bayles&#x2F;271526" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;junkee.com&#x2F;miranda-devine-apology-quaden-bayles&#x2F;2715...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rootclaim.com&#x2F;claims&#x2F;who-carried-out-the-chemical-attack-in-ghouta-on-august-21-2013-8394" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rootclaim.com&#x2F;claims&#x2F;who-carried-out-the-chemica...</a>')
