Item(by='mikepurvis', descendants=None, kids=[25552484], score=None, time=1609002903, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25537887, text='&gt; You don&#x27;t need them until there&#x27;s a home invasion.<p>I would argue that this also is a uniquely American perspective— for me (an urban Canadian), the thought of starting a firefight with an intruder is horrifying, especially once the possibility of accidentally firing on a child or pet is accounted for. I&#x27;m also deeply uncomfortable with the numbers around what &quot;gun in house&quot; means for suicide and domestic disputes (even if I know <i>I&#x27;ll</i> always be level-headed, what about down the road when my kids are teenagers and have friends over, etc etc).<p>Obviously, part of the guns-make-us-safer story is that criminals don&#x27;t know which houses have them and which don&#x27;t, and as a passive effect that&#x27;s difficult to really study. But for a lot of us on the outside of this mentality, it&#x27;s hard to escape the feeling that the safety provided by a gun is kind of like the safety provided by driving an SUV— mostly illusory, and comes at significant costs both to self and others.<p>&gt; And if you&#x27;ve built up a network of cameras powered by facial recognition on every street corner, you&#x27;ve now built the apparatus for an authoritarian-leaning government to harness.<p>I would argue that this is a distraction— that level of surveillance already exists, but it&#x27;s away from public scrutiny and is managed by Facebook and Google.<p>The clear and current authoritarianism threat in the US is the 106 house Republicans who supported Trump&#x27;s absurd Texas lawsuit, that the leaders of one of the two major parties are unwilling to clearly speak with one voice to shut this nonsense down. And I&#x27;d be happy to be mistaken on this, but my impression is that gun owner clubs are mostly on Trump&#x27;s side— those who are talking about taking to streets wouldn&#x27;t be doing so to ensure a peaceful transition of power, they&#x27;d be doing so because they believe conspiracy theories about a stolen election.')
