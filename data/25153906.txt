The latest data on that chart is from July 2020, several months ago when Sweden had their numbers under decent control.<p>Even at that take a look at the last few columns, more particularly the slope from month to month in the last couple years.  Note how from July 2019 through March 2020 the levels were at or below the previous years, however in the last few months the slope accelerates to an increasing upward monthly trend. I would be quite curious to see this chart with August, Sept, and Oct 2020 data included to see if that acceleration continued.  Consider this is what Sweden&#x27;s case count has looked like: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;ofUhXvK.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;ofUhXvK.png</a><p>In essence this chart is really showing only about 4 months of pandemic influence, and at a time when Sweden was doing pretty well.  But in those last 4 months there is a clear accelerating trend in relation to the previous years.  I won&#x27;t say this was cherry picked to be misleading, but at the least it is an incomplete representation of what is happening now.')
