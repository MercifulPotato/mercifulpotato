One could attribute our <i>current</i> outlying behavior to the strange debate of &quot;living vs static document&quot; that is being had (weird because we literally have the federalist papers and notes on what the founders wanted so it doesn&#x27;t make sense to argue &quot;what the founders thought&quot; without looking at said documents).<p>The point here is that your comment implies that that amendments are few and far between and you used an outlier to make that point. That statement was woefully misleading. Which frankly isn&#x27;t going to fly on HN.')
