A Tesla wouldn’t have been able to pull that off. Particularly in cold weather in the hills. But even assuming there was a charging station at work (enabling the round trip) - I also regularly drove to other cities(weekends and such) that would be 300-400 miles away. There are no charging stations anywhere in between.<p>This was &#x2F; is common in my area. My point is that a Tesla works well in many cases, particularly in densely populated regions. They work less well if you have to drive distances, carry a heavy load, and especially not if it’s more rugged. All the more true if you have kids, particularly young ones where a 20 min charging break is rough. Or running out of charge could be a problem.<p>Hybrids are really much better suited to these scenarios. I think EVs will get there, they’re always closing gaps, just right now less densely populated areas make less sense.')
