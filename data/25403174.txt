Item(by='yjftsjthsd-h', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607819629, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25401858, text='&gt; CentOS will no longer be downstream of RHEL as it was previously. CentOS will now be upstream of the next RHEL minor release. This is NOT a “RHEL Beta”<p>That&#x27;s... what beta means.<p>EDIT: Let me reframe it this way: If CentOS Stream is just becoming RHEL, then why does RHEL exist? If it&#x27;s truly just as good as the old RHEL was, then explicitly merge them - either give RHEL away 100% freely like CentOS and charge for support, or discontinue the RHEL brand and sell support for CentOS. The fact that you have a downstream RHEL says that <i>that</i> is more stable, because <i>that</i> is what you&#x27;re willing to sell for money.<p>EDIT2: Actually, thinking it over more and trying to be charitable, I can see a way for that to make sense: If you believe that CentOS is moving to RHEL&#x27;s spot and RHEL is getting <i>even more</i> stable&#x2F;slow&#x2F;tested, then you can say that CentOS isn&#x27;t getting any worse and ... <i>sort of</i> object to calling it RHEL beta. Except that it still is RHEL-beta, just moved up the scale of stablity.')
