There&#x27;s a lot that&#x27;s barely above an essay, it&#x27;ll stick for a few years and then get retracted (gender pay gap anyone?) The cultish behavior surrounding it (&quot;I&#x27;m a sinner, even though I never know when I&#x27;m sinning, I&#x27;m worthless, oh please, Lord, forgive me, I submit myself before your will&quot;) makes it look like a replacement for religion, not anything stemming from science.<p>I don&#x27;t believe the similarity to Maoist struggle sessions is an accident, it&#x27;s born from the same general school of thought.')
