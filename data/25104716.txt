If job is more focused on programming then the candidate must be at least proficient in coding. Otherwise if you need a mathematical modelling person then you need to look into relevant training background (undergrad degree etc). A lot of my colleagues in my research institute are from a physics background. Because molecular biology require a lot of statistics. They are ok coders but what they really contribute is the modelling part.')
