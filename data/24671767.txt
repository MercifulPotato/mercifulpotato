This is if you want to get your stuff back. \n- send an invoice for the missing luggage (itemized even). This is for the case where you don’t care about the stuff and just want to be compensated.<p>If I screwed over a company, they wouldn’t hesitate to bill me. I wish we as consumers would do the same instead of freely spending our time.')
