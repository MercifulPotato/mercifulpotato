More powerful than mid &#x27;90s top-end PCs.  Add some external SDRAM and storage, and they have more and faster memory and storage as well.  C++ is perfectly good.  Better than all the nasty C macros in the vendor HALs, if you replace that nastiness with some type-safe enums and inline functions.  There&#x27;s plenty of capacity for running Python or Lua as embedded scripting languages even on smaller variants, both of which wrap C++ nicely.  I&#x27;m fairly new to the embedded world, but so far it&#x27;s been mostly a pleasure to write code for a variety of TI, ST and Nordic MCUs; some with C, some with C++.<p>I do see why people like C for embedded use; when it comes to hardware interaction you have complete visibility into all of the interactions with special registers.  Looking through the disassembly when debugging is nice and straightforward.  But C++ does this and more, so long as you don&#x27;t go overboard with unnecessary complexity.  It&#x27;s fine with a bit of self-discipline, and all that extra bounds checking and such is of value.')
