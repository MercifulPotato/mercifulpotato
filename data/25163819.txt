Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=[25164014], score=None, time=1605899762, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25162712, text='I think it&#x27;s a hubris thing now, but it was clear that the &quot;DevOps&quot; movement&#x2F;hype started as a cost-cutting measure masquerading as innovation. Who needs classic Ops&#x2F;IT&#x2F;sysadmins when developers can just automate all that in their spare time between working on other systems? It shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise that once the cost-cutting is done you realize too late after the fact that you lost a whole bunch of institutional knowledge and have simply created a new version of your old workforce in their place. The hubris of course comes in accepting the masquerade that everything was really about innovation in the first place, rather than cost-cutting, and rather than rehiring for the old institutional knowledge, just reinventing all the wheels in the new situation with the hubris that it is vastly different than what came before (even though it isn&#x27;t) because it is far more innovative (even though that is unlikely, because the businesses are still the same, the red tape the same, the expectations set by people still real familiar with the old predecessors, etc).')
