I remember seeing on their website that they made control panels and the external GPU and thinking &quot;it&#x27;s nice they found a way to support their software.&quot; I had no idea they made cameras and all this other stuff! Their cameras are really cheap too. This is a game changer if they&#x27;re any good. How have I not heard of them? Haven&#x27;t paid much attention to cameras for a decade but surely they&#x27;ve been around.')
