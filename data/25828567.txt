I tried virtualbox and VMware and a few different ways of installing macOS on both. In some cases MacOS would install and run ok, but I could <i>never</i> connect to the iphone over usb and actually build to it.\nI ended up buying a 2nd hand mac mini. I still feel dirty paying Â£300 for such a low spec machine. it runs like absolute garbage. But it has Catalina and I can actually finally build to iOS.. very very <i>very</i> slowly.<p>[Updating xcode today took 6 hours]<p>I wonder if I should try this? Do ye think theres any chance of it working on the same hardware that failed to work in virtualbox and VMware on Windows?')
