With over 150M votes, that would be over a million fraudulent votes.<p>Even the most generous numbers would still have it in the hundreds, which wouldn&#x27;t even be 1% of the number of votes it takes to flip a single state, let alone the entire election.<p>So yes, a small handful of cases within 150M+ votes (0.0001% or less as I said) is indeed insignificant, as it couldn&#x27;t flip a single state.')
