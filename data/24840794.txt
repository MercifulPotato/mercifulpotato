If you think about the way VHS works, it&#x27;s not possible for it to have audio-video sync drift. Reasons your audio was ahead&#x2F;behind include that your capture device was recording the audio on a device with a free-running clock without reference to the video clock, or that the video capture device was dropping frames.<p>Timebase correction just fixes up the sync pulses so they arrive in an orderly fashion, which improves the picture quality.')
