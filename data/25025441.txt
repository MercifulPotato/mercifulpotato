Twitter didn&#x27;t hide tweets they disagreed with, they hid tweets from a public official who cast doubt on the election process with no shred of evidence and acted in a responsible manner. With additional security on his account, there&#x27;s are also additional responsibilities and since he didn&#x27;t care, they had to interfere. They didn&#x27;t delete anything, they didn&#x27;t remove anything, they just made it perfectly clear that there&#x27;s no proof to his allegations. That&#x27;s responsible behavior and something that should have come way sooner.')
