First is that dirty money is effectively worthless until it&#x27;s cleaned, and launderers recognize that it will take some percentage to clean the money.  In other words, they&#x27;re willing to take a loss on an asset, as that&#x27;s their fee for getting clean cash.<p>&gt; The only reason money launderers can have an outsized effect on the real estate market is because they generate more demand. Period. But that demand is no different from legitimate buyers. Demand is demand. That&#x27;s the entire story.<p>You&#x27;re not seeing the full story, and it&#x27;s a point that&#x27;s touched on in the article.  These transactions don&#x27;t happen in a vacuum, and the market doesn&#x27;t know that the buyer was legit or a launderer.  The transaction sets a comp, which then gets used by everyone to set their prices.  Enough transactions from launderers, and you can effectively reset what the market value for a property is.  There&#x27;s also impact on supply as many who are deciding on when might be a good time to sell now see the market 10% higher than expected.  Suddenly you can get an increase in supply, higher market values, and transactions that make it more favorable for launderers.<p>&gt;A launderer will always prefer to buy 2 properties at a market value of $1 million each, over buying one of those at an inflated $2 million. Always. The laws of supply and demand don&#x27;t disappear just because you&#x27;re laundering money.<p>A launderer prefers transactions that are least likely to generate attention from the authorities.  Depending on the legal legwork, the &quot;suspiciousness&quot; of a given transaction, and other factors it&#x27;s tough to say what they&#x27;d prefer.')
