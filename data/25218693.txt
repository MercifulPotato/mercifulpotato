They can target the Pi however they want to meet that mission.<p>I don&#x27;t say they can&#x27;t, I say that doesn&#x27;t really reflect the actual reality. Many people buy it just because it&#x27;s THE thing and a somewhat uniform standard so it&#x27;s easier to target and to benefit from the existing ecosystem around it.<p>This also is a real role among those Raspbery PI plays in the real world. This is a fact the vendor marketing seemingly ignores - such is the meaning of my statement.<p>I don&#x27;t judge them or demand anything.')
