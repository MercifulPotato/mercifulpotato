No shame in that but if you want to ask why people use Ruby, I&#x27;d say you answered your own question, it&#x27;s due to inertia, and if you actually want to compare these other languages, you have to actually use them to some non-trivial extent.<p>And I&#x27;d also say a big one is Rails, I&#x27;m not sure of many people who use Ruby outside of Rails. But that is because they&#x27;re using Rails despite it being in Ruby, not necessarily because of it, because again, they&#x27;re more interested in the features that Rails provides rather than being enamored with any language feature per se.')
