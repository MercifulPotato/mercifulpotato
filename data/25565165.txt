You&#x27;d be in a shared chatroom with others, where you&#x27;d all see the same DAW view, and could play all the tracks. You&#x27;d record a new track locally, and then upload it. It was a cool compromise - in most use cases, you didn&#x27;t necessarily need to <i>record</i> live, you just wanted to work on the shared project at the same time. I haven&#x27;t seen that nice of a UX since.')
