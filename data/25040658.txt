Then when I ordered a second one, the box came with one of these cards inside. I guess Amazon is making a token effort to fight these, but it&#x27;s clearly not working in the slightest.<p>Many other scams are also alive and well there. The shipping and return policy are what keep me there; the store is crap.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s an opportunity to make an alternative storefront for Amazon with its own reviews and decent search. Probably would violate the ToS or some other lame thing.')
