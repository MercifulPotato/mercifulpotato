I said yes, he could do valuable things like invest in electric vehicles and solar power to reduce carbon emissions, and make long term investments in making human life multi planetary. The point is his wealth exists in the value of the things he is doing. It’s not a separate thing.<p>You’re making the same point, most wealth isn’t tied up in piles of money that are depreciating away due to inflation, they’re invested in jobs, goods and services that benefit all of us. That’s what our economy is.<p>All the other points about the long term good charities can do are also on point for sure, so it’s not either&#x2F;or, both very much have their place.')
