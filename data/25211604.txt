He was very responsive to projects I worked on and added characters into the private use areas whene Unicode hadn&#x27;t defined characters yet. This allowed school children as well as researchers to use orthographies they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be able to use electronically. Many language documentation projects have relied on his work.<p>The Noto fonts are nice but kind of late comers. Google has a history of making a brief noise about endangered language projects before abandoning them. This site was originally a Google project that was abandoned for years:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.endangeredlanguages.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.endangeredlanguages.com&#x2F;</a><p>The characterization on the site is that Google always intended to hand it off but the reality is that there was a big noise made by the company and then nothing more than an essentially empty web site sitting there for years until it was taken over by other groups.<p>Fonts don&#x27;t go away but I would be very weary of trusting Google with data as important as endangered language documentation. You never know when they&#x27;ll turn out the lights. They&#x27;d do a lot more good by helping to fund and support existing projects that have demonstrated long term commitments.')
