The &#x27;risk&#x27; is to their own creations - they have been threatened with cancellation time and time again, probably more so than any show in history.<p>Do you wonder why people on talk shows, on the news in interviews, never say anything bad about anyone, never have an opinion, never critique - unless it&#x27;s political? - because they risk being ignored, losing out on the next deal, upsetting a director&#x2F;producer&#x2F;exec&#x2F;casting agent on the creative side, or advertisers (very powerful) on the business side.<p>Count how many people will mock Tom Cruise, Scientology, China, Hollywood - or more poignantly almost corporate brand etc. - none really - it&#x27;s to expensive to one&#x27;s career.<p>How often has SNL mocked Google, Apple, Tesla, Ford or any major corporations (or their products) in an edgy, satirical way? Never. It doesn&#x27;t happen because it&#x27;s censored for obvious business reasons.<p>How many SNL or other comedy skits have you seen over all the massive rape allegations concerning Hollywood figures? Nobody is going to touch that because they&#x27;re all in the &#x27;same industry&#x27; - it&#x27;s socially toxic.<p>There are zero shows on Television today which aggressively take risks for the sake of &#x27;comedy&#x27; - it&#x27;s almost sad that it&#x27;s getting kind of old and there&#x27;s nobody to hand the torch too.<p>Parker and Stone have carved out for themselves an amazing &#x27;safe bubble&#x27; years ago - they basically took a stand and said &#x27;we will say anything&#x27; and didn&#x27;t care which bridges they burned. Weirdly it became &#x27;accepted&#x27; for them to court controversy within the walls of their show.<p>Sacha Cohen does some really outrageous stuff, but it&#x27;s politically very safe.<p>South Park as a vehicle is stale, it was 10 years ago, but that it&#x27;s legit satire, and one of the only sources of it, is why it&#x27;s still around.')
