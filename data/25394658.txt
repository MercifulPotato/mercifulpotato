To add to &quot;don&#x27;t wear masks&quot; though - WHO, CDC, Fauci all had poor and inaccurate guidance as well. It&#x27;s like none of these experts have sane defaults when they don&#x27;t know about something. Kind of hard to believe, really.<p>Then when they&#x27;re wrong - they say &quot;oh yeah we lied, we didn&#x27;t want a run on masks for health workers&quot;. Such BS. They didn&#x27;t know non-surgical&#x2F;non-(k)n95 masks could be useful.<p>It&#x27;s ok to admit when you&#x27;re wrong. Better than saying you lied. Especially when there&#x27;s enough distrust of government.<p>The US administration is culpable. But so are the experts. People need to be able to trust their experts.<p>Separately - I find it ridiculous we have people that are all about science, except when their agenda conflicts.<p>We end up with exceptions for religion. Exceptions for protests. Exceptions for filming movies. Whatever. If you have enough influence or can cause enough outrage about something you can get your way.<p>Nobody has the balls to take hard stances. They create these illogical plans based on who is influencing them.<p>Is there any official who was consistent and pragmatic with their pandemic plan?')
