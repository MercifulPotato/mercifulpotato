Is there an alternative from Microsoft? My impression was that COM died off after Microsoft went all in on .NET, but now C++ seems to be having a resurgence within Microsoft. But whenever I look up a COM guide, it&#x27;s from at least a decade ago. Does Microsoft recommend we use COM, Modern C++, or a mix of the two when developing on Windows, and do they have a guide somewhere?')
