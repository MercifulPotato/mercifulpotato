It shouldn&#x27;t matter how long it takes you to multiply A with itself because you shouldn&#x27;t actually be doing that. Even if one insists on getting a numerical answer for say a word problem, you can use a calculator.<p>If knowing your times tables provides any benefit to learning higher level math, it&#x27;s merely in mitigating the inefficiency of bad instruction.')
