Even without habitat fragmentation, or the other pressures humans exert on the biosphere, the rate of climate change is such that it alone could potentially induce a mass extinction.<p>I do agree that the biosphere as a whole should be the primary concern and the focus on only one component, namely climate change, is incredibly short sighted.')
