The parent comment touches on the statistical folly of overgeneralizing from small sample sizes, as well as points out a potential confounding factor to the death rate, which is implicitly considering Sweden&#x27;s covid strategy. The parent doesn&#x27;t attempt to judge the merit of their minimalist approach to covid response. So you&#x27;re shoehorning the comment into a debate it wasn&#x27;t trying to be in, it was merely attempting to contextualize the clickbait headline.')
