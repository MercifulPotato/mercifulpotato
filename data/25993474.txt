An honest analysis would acknowledge the drawbacks of legalization too. It&#x27;s difficult to tell exactly what the long term consequences of complete drug legalization are, and I guarantee there are some negative consequences.<p>For example, legalization might <i>reduce the scale</i> of drug trafficking, but I doubt it would eliminate it completely. Tobacco is completely legal yet due to high taxes there is still a large multi-billion dollar bootlegging business to smuggle cigarettes across tax gradients. Also, highly taxed drugs will likely result in an increase in related crimes like theft. I had a friend from high school who was addicted to heroin. When he ran out of money he was willing to mug old ladies to come up with the cash for more. If heroin were instead legal... why wouldn&#x27;t he just steal directly from the legal distribution source now that the threat of violence is no longer there? You don&#x27;t steal from the dealer because you might be killed, but stealing from Walmart or CVS or whoever is carrying it? Why not? Corporate policy probably says not to do anything.<p>Lastly, unless marketing is <i>highly</i> restricted, legalization of drugs will absolutely lead to an increase in usage across all demographics. And a net increase in usage will cause some % increase in DWI rates, overdose rates, health care impact, etc.<p>We will pay some price for legalization as well, it&#x27;s just TBD and nebulous at this point.')
