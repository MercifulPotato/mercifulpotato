Punch yourself in the face, get real.<p>&gt; But there&#x27;s bad blood and BS decisions already, so can this still happen? The Han Chinese need to overcome their distrust of non-Han for this to be a possibility.<p>Do you think that Xi, and Co. give any real f..k for feeling of Han Chinese? Get real. One phone call, and he can have any &quot;rightist element&quot; dead and burred the same day.<p>Now, if the sense have not come to you yet, and the motivations for Xi&#x27;s actions are not yet crystal clear to you. Please, please read a very well researched topic historically &quot;Why did Hitler commit genocide?&quot; And there is a much more recent refresher, much more approachable, and illustrative for a Western reader &quot;Why Rwandan genocide happened?&quot;<p>Read <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ushmm.org&#x2F;teach&#x2F;teaching-materials&#x2F;roles-of-individuals&#x2F;ethical-leaders&#x2F;background&#x2F;causes-and-motivations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ushmm.org&#x2F;teach&#x2F;teaching-materials&#x2F;roles-of-indi...</a><p>Then read <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;41479554" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;41479554</a><p>Hitler&#x27;s &quot;hate&quot; for Jews was far from some compulsive paranoia. Besides sharing some generic Austrian antisemitic tropes, in his head he was far from his self-depiction in &quot;My struggle.&quot; He had few Jewish acquaintances, and even shielded some from his own prosecution campaign.<p>What he did was not something new, he simply did the same what hundreds of European politicians did over the course of two previous centuries of early (in-)civil politics: get a convenient scapegoat, get a convenient political punchbag, and punch, punch punch.<p>Even a kindergarten bully, when he comes to a new class will not punch somebody second, or third to him, he will pick out the easiest punchbag in the class, and use violence against him to terrorise, and get the class in line.')
