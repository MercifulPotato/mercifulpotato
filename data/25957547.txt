We&#x27;re both using Signal now.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;</a><p>Disclosure: Not affiliated with Signal, but I donated $20 to them to support their mission. And since this is on a post about GME, I am a GameStop customer, but I do not own nor have I ever owned GME stocks. I am a WSB and GME supporter. I purchased $2000 in Bitcoin last night for the first time ever after the GME trading shutdowns on Robinhood and others yesterday.<p>EDIT: had the wrong link for Signal.')
