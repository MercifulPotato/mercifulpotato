And there is no such thing as a &quot;free market&quot;. Not in currency, international trade, etc. All markets are controlled and manipulated. It&#x27;s like every parrots what they hear.<p>Edit:<p>Oh god. Here comes the &quot;CCP&quot; nonsense. All countries have tight capital controls. And the tight capital control was part of the bargain for trade between china and the US. It&#x27;s not like they did it secretly. They did it openly for decades as it was their stated goal and provided benchmarks and press releases. It&#x27;s like the Fed openly advocating for inflation of 3% for decades and you claiming that they are &quot;tampering&quot;. It isn&#x27;t &quot;tampering&quot;. It is the goal&#x2F;agreement&#x2F;system&#x2F;etc. Now whether that capital control regime should continue is another debate. Just like whether 3% inflation is a worthy target. But to claim otherwise is just peter navarro style nonsense. It&#x27;s just parroting.<p>Edit1:<p>&gt; The Euro is the &#x27;least tampered&#x27; big currency arguably because they have 25 nations each of whom would scream if the other tampered, meaning almost by definition it has to have integrity.<p>Hard to imagine such nonsense on HN. One of the problems in the EU is that some countries, like greece&#x2F;italy&#x2F;etc, feel that the value of the euro is being too greatly manipulated by germany. It&#x27;s why britain was part of the EU but kept their currency. It&#x27;s why every few years you hear about greece or italy leaving the EU&#x2F;euro. The idea that the euro isn&#x27;t manipulated is nonsense. All currencies are manipulated to achieve the goals of the nation&#x2F;region&#x2F;business community&#x2F;banks&#x2F;etc. And all currencies are political instruments as well as financial ones.')
