I think it is safe to say that Amazon, Facebook, and google each have data centers big enough that IPv4 address management is a headache. I believe Facebook is internally IPv6 (that is server to server communications - their public space obviously has IPv4, and their desktop space can get by with NAT and IPv4 if they want to).  Google has done enough promoting of IPv6 that I think they are the same.  I&#x27;m not sure what AWS is - they sell server time so they have more need for IPv4 to the servers (google cloud has the same concerns)')
