Item(by='klyrs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608581737, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25498589, text='&gt;  I have unfortunately seen a pedestrian get hit by crossing on a red walk sign, luckily they survived.<p>These stats are not an apples-to-apples comparison.  You need to compare injuries per incident: number of vehicle-caused pedestrian injuries per pedestrian crossing vs. number of police-caused injuries per police interaction.<p>I have seen countless pedestrians walking at their top speed, the moment the walk sign turns green, only to have it turn red before they&#x27;ve cleared the intersection.  In many of those situations where I&#x27;ve been driving, I&#x27;ve been honked at for not carelessly running down the elderly or disabled.  If every crossing was long enough to permit those folks to cross in time, cities would be deluged with complaints.  How many pedestrians in your statistics were physically incapable of crossing in time?<p>I&#x27;ve been nearly run over by probably a dozen cars in my life, while I&#x27;ve had the right of way in a crossing (my favorite being the time that a cop was looking one way and turning the other, and my timely shout saved my legs).  How many pedestrians in your statistics had the right of way?')
