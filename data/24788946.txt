I tend to only report the ones I consider serious, but I find it a bit depressing that so many of them seem to remain untouched.<p>That&#x27;s because Apple assumes that I have a much higher tolerance for bugs than the vast majority of their users.<p>They&#x27;re right. I keep using Xcode, despite the bugs. I&#x27;m not a fan of other IDEs, and my experience with them, is that they are every bit as buggy as Xcode, except that they also run slower.<p>But user interface (and security) bugs in the general operating systems get high priority.<p>I suspect the same goes for Facebook. They know that they are the only game in town, and that marketers will tolerate a much buggier experience than users.<p>I would like to see software quality rise all over. Speaking only for myself, I spend a great deal of time refining the interface for administrative functionality, and have a standard policy of &quot;Don&#x27;t move on to the next item until you believe this one is 100% bug-free, and completely usable.&quot;, even if it means delaying, or even reversing, progress of the project.<p>That&#x27;s not a popular stance, but it does tend to result in pretty high-quality software. I&#x27;m writing a social media app, right now, and this philosophy has paid off in a big way. It does mean that the team needs to wait longer for some functionality, but the app is constantly in a state, where they can simply hand it to potential investors, and not worry about them encountering highly embarrassing bugs. I&#x27;m hoping that the end result will be a real joy to use.')
