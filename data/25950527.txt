Item(by='umvi', descendants=None, kids=[25950726], score=None, time=1611873619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25950272, text='&gt; Apologies if this is too tangential, but does anyone know where I can find a good explanation of why patent &quot;trolling&quot; is seen as worse than any other kind of IP enforcement?<p>- IP enforcement<p>I invent a new drug. I spent a lot of money to develop it, so I want to be able to exclusively sell it to recoup my investment. If someone reverse-engineers my drug and tries to undercut me before the patent expires, I enforce my IP.<p>- IP trolling<p>I invent nothing, I manufacture nothing. Instead, I have legal expertise and I plan to make money 100% through the legal system. So, I buy tons of IP from companies and individuals willing to sell them - the more generic, the better. I then troll around looking for companies that make products that might fit some of the patents I just bought. I legally shake down the companies for violating my patents and settle for a fat sum before resuming trolling for more victims.')
