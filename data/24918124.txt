Even 1s is acceptable in most cases. There’s a HCI study from the late 60’s that defines this.<p>WRT losing data by filling out a form, that hasn’t been an issue for years now (except when the “smart client renderer” decides that it is). Most browsers will not lose data in an interrupted form transmission.<p>Plus, most browsers (especially mobile ones) handle interruptions like a tunnel fairly well, waiting for the connection to return without losing data. And without having to think about that usecase as a web developer.<p>It’s funny to me that you mentioned slack above; some of my favorite old-school chat experiences were server-side rendered pages. They worked remarkably well for the limitations they faced.<p>All this said, the proper compromise is probably doing both client and server-side rendering. I’m reflexively against client side rendering, because of how they’re typically implemented: slow to download up front, each SPA creates its own interaction primitives, and finally the interactivity of an SPA is only rarely required and yet they’re used everywhere (read-only SPAs are the worst).<p>Javascript - and client-side rendering - is the power hammer of the frontend development world.')
