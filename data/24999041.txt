TSMC has had a significant, steady cashflow from far more than just Apple over the years. Nvidia would if anything be the more likely one pushing TSMC&#x27;s top end, as Nvidia makes by far the largest, highest performance dies out of anyone on TSMC. Apple&#x27;s latest &amp; greatest A14 only just hits the transistor count on TSMC&#x27;s 5nm that Nvidia was pushing 4 years ago on TSMC&#x27;s 16nm.<p>Apple&#x27;s extra cash certainly didn&#x27;t <i>hurt</i>, but TSMC wasn&#x27;t struggling before Apple came along, either.<p>And prior to 7nm the other major fab, Global Foundries, as perfectly competitive with TSMC despite not having any Apple money.')
