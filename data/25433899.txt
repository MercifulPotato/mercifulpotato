I have an older box, about 10-years old :-) I see noticable speed improvement on linux. I only use few extensions with dark theme, like uBlock&#x2F;uMatrix&#x2F;Dark-Reader. I&#x27;ve been using &quot;Ungoogled-Chromium&quot; for the past few years. Its nice to see Firefox improving things on linux. Will definantly use it more now.')
