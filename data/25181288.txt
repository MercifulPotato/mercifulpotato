It is nice to have &quot;total&quot; functions, but &quot;pure&quot; (exceptions+divergence) is still a good thing (and what Haskell gives you). And like you say, in practice we can easily have functions that just take a long long time to compute.<p>Still, it is a good extra check and I can see more use for the `div` effect for future verification tools where total functions can be used as a predicates (but non-terminating ones cannot).')
