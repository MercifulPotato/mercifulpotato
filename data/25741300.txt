I will admit that I wouldn&#x27;t rate most journalists as among the experts in the fields that they report on, and I&#x27;m not sure they would either. But the good ones know a <i>lot</i> more about those fields than the average reader&#x2F;listener&#x2F;viewer.<p>If you&#x27;re hosting a discussion or even just interviewing, I find it entirely legitimate to interject and say &quot;wait, wait, you just made a claim that nobody in your field agrees with, how do you justify that?&quot; or something equivalent.<p>Until very, very recently, it has been extremely hard to find US journalists that will behave this way. A few have done it with respect to election claims and COVID19 related issues. It is the exception rather than the rule.<p>Treating interviewees with respect does not preclude treating the audience with respect, and if the interviewee says something the interviewer knows to be nonsense, or at least questionable, it is out of respect for the audience that they should &quot;participate&quot;.')
