You can configure Screen Time on an iPhone. There you can limit the total time the device can be used each day. It&#x27;s also possible to limit usage to certain apps, or block access to certain categories of apps, and allowing only certain people (e.g. family members) to be contacted or messaged.<p>If your child has their own Apple ID, Screen Time works across any other Apple devices linked to that Apple ID.')
