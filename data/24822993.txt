There will some days where I make some pretty widespread refactoring changes over files or the yanking&#x2F;register stuff can be quite useful, but in general, every day programming, I don&#x27;t see the efficiency gains.<p>I have another theory for why people like Vim so much.<p>Using vim makes you feel like the old-school, crazy powerful, very smart programmers shown in Hollywood. It makes you realize the dream that the little child had when he saw programmers on TV. ( at least for me ) and honestly, its more fun to be doing that so I do it. :)<p>Maybe I am not that good at vim. But at my level, i don&#x27;t see great efficiency gains. I simply see more fun gains, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.')
