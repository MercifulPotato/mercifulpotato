What I meant was more like, you don’t need to fully understand rigid body mechanics to build a table, but if you build enough tables, you might win some knowledge on rigid body mechanics that you may have missed in class.<p>Of course, this is not always true, but a concrete example that comes to mind is integration. It’s very hard conceptually, but not so in technique. If you learn how to do it, for the most part you can skip the concept (to some degree, obviously). I didn’t understood Riemann integral until I learned Lebesque.')
