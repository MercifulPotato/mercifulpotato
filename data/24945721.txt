I actually think Kickstarter <i>could</i> be great, if backers really treated it as a way to fund projects they like, instead of a pre-order of a final product with an early-bird discount. That is, if you&#x27;re building hardware with a target price of $100, early backers should be paying $300+ for that product (or $x no-string attached donation + small $ amount for the right to be first to pre-order to be used against the final price of the product) because otherwise, yeah, like you said, you&#x27;re going to use the Kickstarter capital to finish development and have no money left over to fulfil orders.')
