If you stop and get to a period of a 1-2 years without funding, it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to ever get funding again, because when your applications get assessed you get judged on your track record (previous publications) and often reviewers want to see some preliminary results to show your proposal is feasible (the irony is that on the other hand proposals should be &quot;high-risk, high-gain&quot;. I&#x27;m not kidding, I&#x27;ve had proposal reviews were I was criticised by one reviewer that there was not enough preliminary work to show the project is feasible, and another reviewer said that my I essentially had already done everything on the project and so there was not gain left).<p>The result is that when you start a project you already need to write your next proposal, leaving you no time to actually do technical work.')
