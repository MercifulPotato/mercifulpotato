I do not believe stimulant medications affect people with ADHD and without ADHD differently.<p>I&#x27;m sorry but you clearly haven&#x27;t even tried to research the subject, so I&#x27;m not surprised you don&#x27;t believe it. People with ADHD have been scientifically proven to have deficiencies in specific neurotransmitters, namely norepinephrine and dopamine. There&#x27;s multiple studies on ADHD and reward pathways you could find with a simple google search.<p>If you understand how amphetamine based stimulants such as adderall work, you&#x27;ll know these are 2 of the major neurotransmitters that they target along with serotonin.<p>The entire reason for using these types of medications is to improve availability of neurotransmitters to those with abnormal production that impedes cognitive function. Sure people with normal levels can take stimulants and see effects, since these drugs don&#x27;t balance levels, they just increase them. In a person with normal dopamine production it&#x27;s just going to lead to an imbalance, and result in the euphoria  feeling they&#x27;re seeking, whether they want to admit it or not.<p>Edit: the article you posted doesn&#x27;t even support your argument. It seems in people without ADHD, the medication resulted in increased impulsivity and distractibility.Most likely as a result of abnormal levels of norepinephrine. This is evidence of the drug having literally the opposite of it&#x27;s intended effect when taken by people without ADHD.')
