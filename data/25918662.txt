Because some corporations will sell out their employees and customers under specific circumstances must mean that all of them are doing it all the time, right?<p>Robbery and murder have no upsides to a society. Organized labor to create something bigger than a single person can build is foundation of society. You can argue which system of organization is better (government owns and dictates everything like communism, corporations and government own and some specific categories of things and dictate what’s in their purview like capitalism, the royalty and nobility own and dictate everything like monarchy, or no organized labor exists like anarchy). But the reality is that we as a species tend to organize into tribes and work in groups and whether you call those tribes&#x2F;groups corporations, government work forces, peasantry, guilds is just about what trade offs you want to make.<p>I will be really impressed if you can show a proof that a corporation is like murder.')
