An example would be causing the death of another human being. Would you want all four of these incidents to be treated the same from a legal perspective?<p>- A surgery, which is known to have a 50&#x2F;50 chance of success even at the hands of an excellent surgeon, goes poorly and the patient dies.<p>- A serial killer spends six months plotting the murder of his victim before executing them.<p>- A shoving match breaks out at a bar. Somebody slips, falls, hits their head on the ground, and dies.<p>- You accidentally frighten somebody by sneezing in a quiet library. They have a heart attack and die.<p>From a purely logical perspective, these are literally the same thing. A person dies! Realistically speaking, any legal system needs to consider intent.')
