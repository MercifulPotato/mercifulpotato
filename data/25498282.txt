The example code makes heavy use of traits for example, which are very ergonomic and provide a dynamic feel.<p>The context is a rewrite AKA runtime optimization. So the result is already understood. A great use-case for Rust is top-down implementation.<p>Also the code doesn&#x27;t show any of the more painful cases. From the article:<p>&gt; There are some inefficiencies visible here, and they&#x27;re probably the most important spots for performance improvements. But they&#x27;re still there as fixing them was too hard and&#x2F;or time-consuming for me.<p>Resolving these &quot;inefficiencies&quot; is where Rust really shines. Because it _can_ resolve them and does it internally consistent on top of it. But at the same time, this is where  you really _slow down_ in development and need to think about the more complex and intricate concepts such as lifetimes and borrow semantics.')
