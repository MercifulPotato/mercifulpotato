I will say that I’m really pushing to change the perception that all anti-cheats are bad and are user-hostile. I’m trying to build a product that shows that anti-cheats can actually respect user privacy and provide a positive player experience. And I’m trying to do it by better engineering.<p>Vanguard I believe would intentionally bluescreen you if it detected you’ve disabled PatchGuard. They had very good reasoning to do so, but I wouldn’t do something like that since I believe it’s user-hostile. Battleye I believe actually doesn’t use TLS last time I checked, using some sort of home brewed XOR cipher which is a bit scary. And of course remoting into computers is unacceptable under any circumstance.')
