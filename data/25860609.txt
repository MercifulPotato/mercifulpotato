Even bacteria &quot;want&quot; to explore, find new territories where there might be undiscovered resources, etc. Exploration is what helps a species survive long-term. We&#x27;re smart, but the things we instinctively want are still a reflection of the basic things that any life form wants and needs.<p>I don&#x27;t think you could have a super-advanced species that didn&#x27;t want to explore, reproduce, wasn&#x27;t curious. You couldn&#x27;t have an advanced species that just went about doing the same thing forever. They wouldn&#x27;t be an advanced species. They&#x27;d be some dead branch of the evolutionary tree that got pruned long ago, in all likelihood. Intelligence is fundamentally curious, just like lifeforms, even bacteria, if you squint hard enough, are &quot;curious&quot;.')
