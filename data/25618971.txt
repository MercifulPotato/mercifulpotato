No matter how well-intentioned and talented that person is, it always leads to a toxic environment. It&#x27;s an instant red flag that the person is incapable of delegating responsibilities. Separation of duties at the C-level is important. There needs to be some amount of healthy friction in the leadership team to make appropriate compromises. Hope you are able to get out of this situation soon.')
