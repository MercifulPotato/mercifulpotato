Item(by='xelxebar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603629279, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24885142, text='&quot;Understanding the Linux Kernel&quot;, by Bovet and Cesati, has a pretty nice section at the beginning that discusses bootup. Of course, the discussion of the Linux kernel boot sequence is extremely nice and detailed, but there is also a nice appendix that gives a pretty decent overview of the pre-kernel stuff, too.<p>Crucially, for x86, you will need to understand segmentation and paging, which Bovet and Cesati discuss at length. Highly recommended.<p>It&#x27;s quite fun to download the 2.6 sources yourself and dig in the code along as you read. The book makes it quite easy to find the relevant files.')
