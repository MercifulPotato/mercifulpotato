Vocally side with the popular issues, or try to stay completely out of them, to try to avoid becoming a target (e.g., social media presence)?<p>For now, don&#x27;t attempt to overturn a fair democratic election and install an illegitimate government. Seems like a pretty easy thing to stay clear of.<p>I get the concern you&#x27;re expressing, but not everything is a slippery slope. This went so far beyond a &quot;popular social issue of the day&quot;, as you admitted in your comment. IMO it&#x27;s worth saving this outrage &amp; concern for if and when something that is more genuinely a popular social issue causes AWS to take down sites. There were surely lots candidates for that earlier this year with a lot of the other protests that went on, were there any instances of sites taken down then? (I&#x27;m genuinely asking btw, I didn&#x27;t hear of any but if there were then I think that is a much more appropriate place to start this conversation from. Certainly people have been fired from their jobs due to cancel culture but I don&#x27;t know of anyone being shut off of all tech platforms).')
