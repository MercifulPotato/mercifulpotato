An open back pair of headphones will work anywhere as long as the environment isn&#x27;t too loud. Another reason could be if you are living in an apartment with neighbors who won&#x27;t be very happy with your speaker setup blasting sound through the walls into their apartment. Open back headphones do leak sound but in a much more localized area. Also, you can get a great pair of open back headphones for $200 or less and then with a $50-$100 amp have amazing sound. I haven&#x27;t looked closely into speaker setups but I feel like a good speaker setup is going to cost more than that.')
