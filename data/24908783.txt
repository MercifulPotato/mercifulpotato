What was the need?</i><p>Yeah, <i>this</i> is the right question. All these proposition like &quot;consciousness is an alpha-rhythm&quot;, or &quot;consciousness is a EM waves&quot; are just an destructive reductionism, trying to get rid of something too difficult to understand and to replace it with something of much easier nature. It is like attempts to reduce the problem of &quot;free will&quot; to a physical determinism. Free will is a psychological or social phenomena, it couldn&#x27;t be equivalent to a physical phenomenon. It could be explained in terms of a physical phenomena. Maybe. (In this particular case I believe it is pointless.). But if proposition draws an equal sign between phenomena from completely different levels of abstraction, we must be suspicious.<p>But, ranting away, what is a consciousness? I like the most this explanation[1]. Consciousness is a tool to communicate with others and nothing more. All the thinking, decision making are done without help of consciousness, somehow the process is reflected in the consciousness, which allow to communicate the decision itself, motives behind the decision, and so on. Does explanation in terms of EM waves adds something to it? After this EM waves doesn&#x27;t seem as an explanation at all. It is like ask what is async&#x2F;await and to answer that it is all about transistors switching states.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.frontiersin.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.3389&#x2F;fpsyg.2017.01924&#x2F;full" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.frontiersin.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.3389&#x2F;fpsyg.2017.0192...</a>')
