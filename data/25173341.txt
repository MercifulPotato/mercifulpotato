Typical negative work activities include injecting that new shiny tool into everything because its new and shiny, refactors that require refactors for a single line change that never happens, writing buggy tests and pushing then writing a follow up task to fix your buggy tests that are blocking the pipeline then not doing that task, only doing &#x27;manual&#x27; testing, telling the team a tool doesn&#x27;t work only to realise the dev didn&#x27;t know how to use it, endless wiki page re-writes, using stand-up meetings as a bitchfest etc.  Fortunately, I&#x27;ve become better at recognizing negative work patterns and removing those dev&#x27;s from my team.  Your team will die from attrition if you don&#x27;t.')
