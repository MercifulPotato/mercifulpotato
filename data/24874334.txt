It&#x27;s called a conspiracy theory for a reason - there&#x27;s conspiring going on. The CEO of the Ritz knows that his hotels offer underage prostitutes. The personal concierge directs the CEO to club which is known to be &quot;good for rich people.&quot; The club owner knows that the company they outsource to for renting table dancers on the weekends also has dancers doing some prostituting on the side. The other rich attendees of the club (who are not purchasing) can see that that girl is clearly not 21. There&#x27;s more than just pedophilia going on here - a system of winks and nods whereby powerful people are offered the opportunity to engage in illegal behavior and make no moves against the powerful people who facilitate these opportunities.<p>And? Is the claim made more meaningful by these specifics?<p>&gt; The second thing is that you&#x27;re missing the point around alignment. These people DON&#x27;T align themselves with each other. They frequent the same forums as each other (e.g. 8chan) and disagree with each other on those forums. It&#x27;s only in the eyes of the media and in people influenced by the media that the various flavors of conspiracy people are actually aligned.<p>People who regularly meet and discuss things are aligned on the part that counts. They might not be organized, but they&#x27;re definitely aligned')
