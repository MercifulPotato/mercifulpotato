(Sorry.) I had learned how to read PowerPC assembly but the Ambrosia registration application was obfuscated and had very long functions I couldn&#x27;t follow, I suspect compiled from machine-generated C.<p>Andrew dropped an enigmatic hint once that it involved &quot;polynomials&quot; and when I eventually learned about these in school I spent a lot of time wondering how you could turn one into a serial number.<p>Maybe @khalwat can finally reveal the answer to a question I&#x27;ve had for at least 20 years?')
