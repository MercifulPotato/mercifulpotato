This is not ideal, since it may not be obvious to consumers how long the device will last.<p>That seems entirely orthogonal to me, and market forces would presumably be able to handle consumer preference for longer-lasting products (barring other market failures, like monopolies, but that&#x27;s also orthogonal to the externalities of using certain materials).<p>The device that gets thrown away in 10 years still imposes the same externality as the one that gets thrown away after one year [0], and thus I don&#x27;t see any reason for changing a fee based on that. Note that the person who buys the 1-year devices every year pays 10x the &quot;externality fees&quot; as the person who buys the 10-year device.<p>[0] Of course, the externalities themselves can change over time, e.g. new better recycling methods, so the externalities would have to be appraised periodically.')
