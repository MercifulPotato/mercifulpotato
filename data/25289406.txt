Never mind things like souls, nativity myths, etc.<p>The Catholic Church does indeed oppose genetic engineering human beings and the like for very well-developed ethical reasons. However, I&#x27;m not sure where you get the idea that &quot;religious people&quot; find it offensive _that_ human beings can be cloned. Which &quot;religious people&quot;? Certainly, many people find the act of human cloning, among others, offensive, but _that_ a human beings can be cloned? FWIW, the term &quot;religious people&quot; is rather meaningless. It&#x27;s not a meaningful category in the way it is used here and just used as a vague insinuation that people of a certain stripe (typically Christians) are superstitious people with arbitrary hangups and irrational beliefs (your choice of words says as much: nativity &quot;myths&quot;, souls). Religion is just what someone holds to be ultimate reality, the highest good, and aim of life. In that sense, everyone is religious, so it&#x27;s not a question of _whether_ you&#x27;re religious, but how, and whether your religion is correct (I know, an unpopular thing to say today, but that&#x27;s just a feature of tacit modern liberal sentiments and not the product of reason).<p>&gt; Mostly the technical issues that make stuff like this unethical have to do with short term technical challenges [...] Abortions are illegal in a lot of places that euthanize pets and cattle routinely.<p>Why do you think that is? Why do we think that euthanizing non-human animals is morally licit while doing that to a human being isn&#x27;t? I leave that as an exercise.<p>&gt; We&#x27;re kind of ethically flexible.<p>Either actions are morally licit or they aren&#x27;t. To say you&#x27;re flexible is to say that either you&#x27;re an immoral person to the degree that you depart from the licit, or that there&#x27;s no ethical fact of the matter. If there&#x27;s no ethical fact of the matter, then ethical concerns are pure fiction. You can&#x27;t have it both ways. Either something is licit or it isn&#x27;t. It may be determined by circumstance (killing in self-defense), or it may be an absolute (murdering an innocent person), but each concrete action is as such either licit, illicit, or there is no fact of the matter because it is a meaningless category.')
