But they are plain awful on the pinned tabs. I&#x27;m not sure if only a small percentage of GSuite customers were using web apps for them to justify this.<p>Maybe they could have color coded these icons like Microsoft did for each product. I do like the shapes, I&#x27;m just having a hard time distinguishing them. So maybe they should have stuck with 100% red for mail and 100% green for google meet, and so on, with the new shapes. Or at least let the old color for the product be the dominant color of the icon.')
