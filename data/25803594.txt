Make it content-centric, i.e. distributed protocols with no central servers.  Support download-limited lightweight markdown sites for information sharing.<p>Then for applications and interactive content, add a canvas-light graphics system to web assembly.  Again, I suggest limiting download size to keep things snappy.  And make sure not to load any applications automatically or put them in the same process as the markdown browser.<p>If you do it right, you will have a common protocol that is straightforward enough that there can actually be several implementations.  And it won&#x27;t be controlled by one company.')
