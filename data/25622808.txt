Item(by='Jtsummers', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609692036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25621979, text='&gt; MATLAB is slow and Octave is even slower while working with matrices.<p>I&#x27;m curious what you mean with this. Matlab was always fast with matrices (but my experience is now from 2 decades ago). The thing that was slow was loops. That is:<p><pre><code>  for i = 1:100\n    c(i) = a(i) + b(i);\n  end\n</code></pre>\nwould always be slower than this:<p><pre><code>  c = a .+ b;\n</code></pre>\nThe trick in my work was to always find matrix&#x2F;vector operations that were equivalent to my desired loop and conditional structures. I could improve execution by 100x or more for many programs doing this.')
