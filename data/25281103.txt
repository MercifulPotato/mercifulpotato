Like, if you aren&#x27;t the suspect and are ordered to hand over all devices used to communicate to &lt;suspicious co-worker X&gt;, if you have a separate device you just hand the thing over. If you hand over a personal phone, they are presumably going to bump into your walled off section and have some questions. Plus, you don&#x27;t have a phone, while they are working on the thing, which seems like a pain.<p>This is assuming you aren&#x27;t in a &quot;hand over all electronic devices&quot; kind of situation.')
