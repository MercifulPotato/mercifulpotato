Donâ€˜t have young kids at home.<p>I disagree. I&#x27;ve got more kids than you do (edit: I misread your post, I&#x27;m not clear how many children you have. My apology for the mistake), all at difficult ages including a 1 year old. They are one of the few things making COVID seclusion tolerable for me.<p>The near constant interaction can be exhausting, but it has also been very rewarding. I know my kids better than ever and have gotten to participate in a lot of moments I would&#x27;ve missed.<p>I find that the narrative I give myself around things like this is very important. If I told myself I was barely surviving my kids I would probably feel that way. Instead I focus on how lucky I am to be surrounded by my family, and that it&#x27;s a wonderful thing to have unprecedented amounts of time with them. I&#x27;ve perhaps never been happier with my family than I have been during the pandemic.<p>None of that is a criticism of people who are struggling. Just looking to offer another point of view.')
