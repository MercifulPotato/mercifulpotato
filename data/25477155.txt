But this tricky, since it introduces a subtle dependency on the implementation of biasedcoin.<p>Another option is to split the function&#x2F;process into a stochastic and deterministic part. Test the deterministic part thoroughly. biasedcoin is too trivial for this, but it works nicely in more complicated setups.<p>For biasedcoin, I would probably go with a statistical approach. Given a certain bias, the expected value and distribution is known. I would simply test that several trials of the function lie within some bound.')
