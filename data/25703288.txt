I am posting this here in the hope a twitter employee will see this and lock the hacked accounts:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;toftforcongress&#x2F;with_replies<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;theroser&#x2F;with_replies<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;johnreporters&#x2F;with_replies<p>This has been going on too long, since 2018, tons of $ stolen.
