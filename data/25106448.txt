This is true, but its not really useful.<p>On your morality lines:  \nMorality is a personal concept in people, <i>but</i> it is influenced by society and the people they interact with. There doesn&#x27;t have to be some objective right&#x2F;wrong, and so people can say that the scientists were being immoral (according to the person&#x27;s own moral ideas).  \nThe scientists may very well believe they were being moral, or perhaps they didn&#x27;t think about it (people do that!)<p>&gt; that our nature-created brains have led us to create?   \nWell, as stated before, morality isn&#x27;t the same between humans. There&#x27;s no objective authority that decides X is right or Y is wrong, simply social&#x2F;cultural influences throughout the world.<p>You could view morality as a way that you think the world&#x2F;people should behave to maximize some value you hold. Perhaps you value sentient life, and so you hold self-sacrifice to save a dozen people to be a moral good as it continues more sentient life.')
