If you have an out of date cache, you&#x27;ll falsely approve a cert that should be revoked. I&#x27;m not defending the system as a whole, but if you care about revoking authentication  – which they clearly do – then a cache directly undermines that goal.<p>A malware hash doesn&#x27;t get revoked, new ones just get added.')
