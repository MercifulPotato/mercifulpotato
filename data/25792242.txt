If you&#x27;d shuffle over to Intel, you&#x27;d find RTX 2080, 500 nits, 32GB, 300Hz screens, and QHD&#x2F;4K.<p>Already in 2021 we&#x27;re seeing (announced) QHD screens, up to 360Hz, RTX 3080, 32GB.<p>(I&#x27;ve been looking for high refresh and prefer gaming laptops, so I&#x27;m less clear on what&#x27;s available in business laptops with 4K, etc.)')
