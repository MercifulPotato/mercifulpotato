(NOTE: their table is per axle, front tires wear twice as fast)<p>20,000 km would be 100-400g per tire.<p>EDIT: Sorry, the units in the table shift from km, mi, single tire, axle, whole car, and it took me several tries to get the right numbers.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cfpub.epa.gov&#x2F;si&#x2F;si_public_file_download.cfm?p_download_id=525701" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cfpub.epa.gov&#x2F;si&#x2F;si_public_file_download.cfm?p_downl...</a>')
