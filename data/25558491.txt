It is a tool that automatically highlights the important parts of any document. Most documents take about two to three seconds to process. It&#x27;s directed at students, researchers, or anyone with a reading list and little time for that matter.<p>During my studies I had to go through a lot of literature, for example when I had to select relevant material for my thesis, or when I had to familiarize myself with a course&#x27;s reading list. Tuchu helped me to get up to speed in these cases. What started off as a command-line Python script is now a web application that does its analysis without any back-end. I don&#x27;t get to see your documents.<p>The underlying algorithm that selects what&#x27;s relevant is called TextRank, an unsupervised summarization method [1]. It models a document (or a collection thereof) as a fully connected graph. Its nodes are parts of the text — I use sentences — and the edges between them are weighted by a similarity measure, in my case simple word overlap. The subset of sentences with the highest PageRank are then highlighted. For good measure, I also highlight sentences that contain signal words that — in my academic experience — signify importance.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that Tuchu is not a substitute for doing your own reading. It could make you a faster reader by directing your attention to the important parts, but you&#x27;ll still have to ponder about the true essence of a document yourself.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclweb.org&#x2F;anthology&#x2F;W04-3252&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclweb.org&#x2F;anthology&#x2F;W04-3252&#x2F;</a>')
