Take, I dunno, video recommendation.<p>Sure, YouTube itself proably built insane stuff in their engine you could never replicate with classic methods (ignoring whether the YT algo is any good).<p>However, if we are just talking about the Vlog of your real estate company, you should probably A&#x2F;B-test whether your viewers prefer order by time or clicks and implement a decent title search bar.
