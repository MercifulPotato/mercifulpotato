I can tap share, and send them to WhatsApp &#x2F; Telegram &#x2F; Email.<p>This somewhat unifies the &quot;photo selection and sharing&quot; interface of all applications in one place. It&#x27;s also good for security since I can deny all these apps access to my library.<p>Also, on any app when saving an image, it also goes into photos. There&#x27;s no filesystem, it goes into a dedicated &quot;photos&quot; storage, and I can later find it there to use it for whatever (also, copy-pasting images in modern OS&#x27;s is fabulous).<p>It&#x27;s quite clear that he proposal from the article aligns well with slowly shifting away from a &quot;files&quot; mentality. Honestly, I&#x27;d love to see a &quot;Photos&quot; app on Linux that handles all my images files, and stop using the cli &#x2F; file manager to treat them as files (e.g.: drop one level of abstraction).')
