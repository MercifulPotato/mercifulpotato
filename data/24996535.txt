Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604564627, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24994160, text='I believe the GP was attempting to draw attention to the fact that the majority of Ross&#x27;s sentence was based on mere allegation of a crime.  (Granted, with good evidence, but without due process.)  The probable reason charges were dropped on the conspiracy to commit murder charge was it probably would have fallen to an entrapment defence.  Hiring a hitman was suggested and pushed by someone acting on behalf of the government at the time.<p>Ross is no hero, but also, let&#x27;s not pretend the court system acted reasonably here.  If they had even a 50&#x2F;50 chance of getting him on conspiracy to commit murder, they would have brought the charge to trial.  The prosecutor didn&#x27;t drop the charge to be nice.  The evidence of entrapment probably would have hurt the case as a whole, so they dropped the conspiracy to commit murder charge.  Yet, it appears this strong suggestion that he committed a serious crime played the majority role in his sentencing.<p>This should scare anyone around the world, given the long reach of US law enforcement.  The prosecutor kept embarrassing entrapment details out of the trial and still got a heavy sentence for just the allegation of a crime. The prosecutor got to have their cake and eat it too.')
