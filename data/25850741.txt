What would you like to take photos of? What do you think is deficient in the photos you currently take that you&#x27;d like to improve upon with a dedicated camera?<p>To answer your actual question, I have a Nikon D810 with a 1.4f 50mm lens that I adore, but it&#x27;s expensive and overkill for most purposes.<p>It&#x27;s amazing for taking pictures of dancers in poorly lit rooms without being forced to use a flash.<p>95%+ of the time I use my phone just because it&#x27;s a camera I always have with me though.')
