Not at all, I do it for fun. On windows it&#x27;s all you have because adding anything to the entropy pool BCryptGenRandom draws from is a no go, it was possible ten years ago, a simpler time. Now you have to do it yourself and xor different sources at the application layer if so concerned. On Linux it&#x27;s trivial.<p>Cloudflare? Well, besides their obvious immediate needs, they are openly positioning themselves as an entropy provider for high security purposes, which requires good sources and throughput. What Intel or AMD is offering out of the box is not going to cut it by itself.<p>Not saying they&#x27;re broken, they work fine for nearly all purposes, instead here positing that if your entire existence and everything you owned depended on it would you truly just use the inbuilt CPU RNG on your computer and call it day? It&#x27;s a small amount of time to add additional sources and not lose your shirt&#x2F;dignity.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudflare.com&#x2F;en-gb&#x2F;leagueofentropy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudflare.com&#x2F;en-gb&#x2F;leagueofentropy&#x2F;</a>')
