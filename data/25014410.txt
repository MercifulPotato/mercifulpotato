All of the concerns that have been pointed out have good, testing and rock solid implementations available that you can just drop in, with mix and match from different authors and frameworks. All because they use the same interface.<p>This isn&#x27;t even a new idea. Many Ruby on Rails plugins are actually Rack plugins (even to the point of Rails itself being implemented as a collection of Rack middleware). Rack is the interface that defines how a request is to handled, similar to the Go stdlib interface.<p>It&#x27;s definitely true that idiomatic Go tends towards copying being better than dependencies, but the standard interfaces make it much easier to use and swap tried and tested dependencies because they all share the same interface.')
