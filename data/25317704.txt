Amazon runs Kindle Unlimited which is spotify but with text. And then there&#x27;s Audible Plus which comes with some selection of books.<p>And companies like O&#x27;Reilly have been running services like Safari since before Apple named their browser Safari.<p>But piracy apologists continue to claim that the publishers aren&#x27;t tech savvy enough or business savvy enough. The services are there. I can only presume that readers prefer to buy their books one at a time, often printed on paper. That&#x27;s the only reason the services haven&#x27;t become household names like Spotify or Netflix.')
