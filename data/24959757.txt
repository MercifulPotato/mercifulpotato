For instance, it&#x27;s possible to control for confounding factors by keeping a factor constant and varying others, in a regression model. I believe this was for example done in studies that showed the correlation between smoking and lung cancer, or high blood pressure and heart disease and so on.<p>In any case, when faced with a large body of literature with some conflicting results the thing to do is to look at reviews or meta-analyses. From my reading there is no argument that the majority of meta-analyses show a strong correlation between high levels of saturated fats in the diet and high incidence of cardiovascular disease- and if I remember correctly, even the so-called &quot;French paradox&quot; is not observed in high-quality reviews and meta-analyses, but only in smaller studies.<p>Note also (from the linked paper):<p>&gt;&gt; The French paradox concept was formulated by French epidemiologists3 in the 1980s.<p>In a similar manner, you can find many studies showing benefits from the consumption of olive oil, but the majority of them are from Spanish, Greek and Italian research teams (I&#x27;m Greek. Perhaps not everyone has the same context as me but the number of times I&#x27;ve heard Greeks say how healthy olive oil is... And how red wine is good for the heart. Greece, of course, produces both).')
