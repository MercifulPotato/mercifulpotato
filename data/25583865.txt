Imagine paying 10 years worth of mortgage in a place turned bad (NY in 80s, Detroit recently, Greece even more recently) and finding out that you&#x27;re <i>still</i> in very negative equity. All your payments have been for nothing, and the most reasonable course of action is to go bankrupt and have the house foreclosed.<p>Also, US mortgages are on central government balance sheet, not bank balance sheet, so it&#x27;s the taxpayer that suffers.')
