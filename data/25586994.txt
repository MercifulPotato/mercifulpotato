It&#x27;s no more a chat protocol than HTTP really when you&#x27;re doing that kind of programming with it, just has some nifty tricks for getting around routers and making a direct connection where it can.<p>That said, it was better than NAT punch-through and&#x2F;or UPNP which are not very reliable these days.')
