Acer, Asus, Toshiba, HP, Lenovo.<p>Toshiba were my preference for a long time (mid-90s to about 2010), but lately (the last 12 years) I&#x27;ve been happiest with Lenovo.<p>Having said that, the quest for ever lighter and thinner laptops means that compromises are necessary. My last Lenovo laptop&#x27;s keyboard is not as pleasant as my 12 year-old Lenovo laptop&#x27;s, but the screen is phenomenal.<p>I had nothing but grief with several HP laptops. So much so that I put HP laptops on my &#x27;never buy again&#x27; list.<p>Acer and Asus were laptops that I quite liked to use, but they weren&#x27;t as long-lived as the Lenovo.<p>I&#x27;ve probably confused you further with the above comments. Good luck with your choice.<p>My latest Lenovo laptop is the P53 with 32 GB of RAM and a 4K screen. I bought it with a 1GB SSD and I have added a 4GB SSD. I run Linux Mint on it. This laptop is bigger (15-inch) than what I usually buy (14-inch), but it&#x27;s smaller than one of my HP laptops (17-inch).<p>AFTERTHOUGHT: In many cases, Lenovo allow you to &#x27;customise&#x27; your selection, with different screens, different disk sizes, different RAM sizes, etc. That can make a big difference to the amount you spend. I tend to get lots of RAM, and smallish disks which I can upgrade later. I also tend to get high-res screens. I believe there is a 14-inch version of the P53 (maybe a P43 ???).')
