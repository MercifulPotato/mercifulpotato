If you look around and read actual studies, not demand other people to do it for you and not cherry pick garbage studies, you&#x27;ll find even real life &quot;experiments&quot; of healthcare workers in the US during COVID-19 not wearing masks with rapidly rising number of COVID-19 cases then mandated to wear masks with subsequent rapid drop of cases.<p>What you won&#x27;t find though is studies supporting the assertion that sick person wearing a mask protects others, not the wearer. Those are the studies that show little to no benefit and always did actually. You protect others with a mask by not catching the virus yourself, it&#x27;s a second order effect.')
