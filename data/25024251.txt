Their autoplay feature often changes the piece in between movements, which is a torture.\nSome database for navigating through all the works of a composer, sorted by significance would also be very helpful to discover new pieces.<p>I would also love to see more innovation in score management&#x2F;recognition etc. Like seeing the score while you listen to a recording or being able to compare different recordings at a given bar. You could even teach music lessons if you can use it to easily compare home made recordings with professional ones.')
