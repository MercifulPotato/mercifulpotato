Although this depends on the exact pay distribution of your company, you&#x27;d expect getting rid of people from the bottom to change the median person but not typically change the median value.<p>(This is also a mature enough problem that I&#x27;d expect other provision in the law to prevent this - are we sure it doesn&#x27;t include outsourced workforce pay?)')
