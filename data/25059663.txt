There are a couple of low hanging fruits that they avoid to pick for some reason that would vastly improve the performance. For example they could enable wrapping the VST plugins in their own separate processes. That means the operating system scheduler would be able to distribute the load on available cores in a more efficient way than Ableton currently does. Another is that when you have two tracks using the same send, then all paths that lead to the send with the send included work on the same core that means you can easily run into issues if you use more demanding plugins. Here the solution would be processing the tracks in parallel up to the point where it goes to the send - this could actually be solved by running plugins in separate processes. \nOne more feature related to performance improvements would be ability to freeze tracks just partially and freeze entire groups.\nI think other features added are great, but they are kind of useless if you can&#x27;t play anything because the audio engine can&#x27;t keep up.')
