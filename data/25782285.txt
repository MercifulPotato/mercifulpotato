I once attended a Communist rally by accident (I had a crush on the math teacher&#x27;s daughter, no one told me the overnight field trip was to a Commie rally until we were already on the freeway.)  Even as a kid I could tell that they were just a pathetic &quot;religion&quot;-without-God, I would say the lot of them (American Communists) are card-carrying loonies.<p>But (and you can see it coming can&#x27;t you?)<p>But they never stormed the capitol.<p>Two questions for you:<p>1) What were they trying to do?  (If they are not weird cultists?)<p>2) Can you think of a group on the Left like Qanon on the Right?<p>I&#x27;m sincere, I&#x27;m not trying to troll you or talk shit.  What do you think?')
