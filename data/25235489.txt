Were you trying to &quot;Run&quot; just to see if &quot;Run&quot; works, or were you interested in executing a specific repository?<p>Basically we allow users to make their own personal editable copies of the Cloudbook. When you &quot;Run&quot;, it is first replicating the Cloudbook into your account and then running. You can edit the code in your copy without affecting the main Cloudbook. Free unlimited CPU, RAM &amp; Storage gets included with every Cloudbook for you to make continuous edits and perform repeat runs, including long running run operations.<p>Not sure how we can achieve this without a registration. Do you have something in mind?')
