So, I have a few questions do ask.<p>1. Do you miss these conversations? Back to the in-office time, when do you usually have a spontaneous chat that is interesting and also meaningful to your work? (eg. After a conference)<p>2. In remote work, have you tried to restore these moments? What did you do? Is it working well?')
