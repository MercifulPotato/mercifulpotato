TLA+ has a very formal definition of state and time that can be model checked or used for proofs. I think the reason that this is such a common statement is exactly because people don’t even know that state can be reasoned about mathematically, they just assume that it can’t be.<p>The biggest thing that TLA+ showed me is that there’s no difference between functional and imperative programming from an algorithm standpoint. You can implement the exact same algorithm in both paradigms, and while the functional one has no explicit state, it can have a tremendous amount of implicit state. Recursion where a new state parameter is passed as argument to the next call is just as difficult to reason about as mutable state, it’s just less efficient from a processor standpoint.')
