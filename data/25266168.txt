So it isn&#x27;t exactly a taxation-without-representation situation, but they are obviously at the mercy of the US in many ways and don&#x27;t have access to all of the levers of power that are available to others.<p>Witness the suffering at our delay in suspending the Jones Act (requiring two days of debate) during the Hurricane Maria relief campaign.<p>I doubt that Puerto Rico&#x27;s lot would fundamentally change if they were a separate country though, they would still be largely at the mercy of their main trading partner and dominant regional power (the US).<p>I was also thinking of felons in my earlier comment, but it didn&#x27;t quite fit my narrative. I don&#x27;t find the rationale that they would just vote for there to be no laws particularly compelling.')
