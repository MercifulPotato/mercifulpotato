Item(by='simonh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607861062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25402701, text='Corporate personhood is a very long established legal concept. It even pre-dates the foundation of the USA, with the principle found in India well over 2000 years ago and in the legal status of Medieval guilds. There is nothing novel about it. The very word corporation derives from the Latin &quot;corpus&quot; or body.<p>I&#x27;m a Brit so have not particular standing in this. If I were a US citizen I would deplore the Citizen&#x27;s United decision, but not on the grounds of corporate personhood (which as I understand it was never mentioned in the ruling), but rather on the grounds that religious freedom should not grant special rights and privileges not available otherwise. It should be a freedom of belief, not a freedom of action.')
