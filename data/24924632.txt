I don&#x27;t know how much this is true for everyone else, but I have found plenty of desktop applications that do exactly what I want and little else (shells, browsers, websites, Discord, Steam, Spotify, work software, etc.). And I sit at the desk for most of the day.<p>My phone is at my desk. I turn off all notifications and sounds, and only allow it to ring from people on my contacts, and I otherwise don&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s basically a chat computer that sits on my desk. I&#x27;ll take it with me on any major trip anywhere, but otherwise when I leave, I try to not bring my phone.<p>I don&#x27;t know how people stand to live with these devices and the irritating software that runs on them.
