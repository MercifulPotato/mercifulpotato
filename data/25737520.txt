Mikrotik all the way down - text config files (version control), ssh-like remote terminals on all endpoints, full feature-set on even the most basic hardware. I&#x27;ve taken them into other jobs and other engineers have been happy with them.<p>The cons are that everything has one or more &quot;mikrotik&quot; way of doing things, and it may not be intuitive to the new user. Also, although everything is included, you have to set it all up yourself.')
