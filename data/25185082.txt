If I was you I would ask them about this, it may reduce time wasted (if the candidate have non-compete then she&#x2F;he won&#x27;t be able to start in next X months).<p>Do I read you correctly that you are afraid of candidate learning something from you and instead of joining bringing this back to their company? You normally assume good will.. What would stop this candidate from joining you, staying with you for a few months and then joining their company back?')
