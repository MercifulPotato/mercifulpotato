In this same video he reaffirmed his contention that the election was fraudulent, and said that the protesters were loved. Whether he did this sincerely or as a ploy to increase the likelihood of being obeyed, nobody can say without mind reading powers.<p>One camp will say this video can be interpreted as harmful because it contains the claim that the election was fraudulent<p>Another camp will say you are allowed to hold the position that the election was fraudulent and at the same time condemn violence.<p>Twitter has chosen to interpret the video to say that there is a risk of violence despite a plain spoken appeal against violence. They are essentially interpreting the meaning of the message in a way that is contrary to the plain language used in the video.<p>In such a scenario I would probably not treat it as a rule, since this kind of rule can be made up spontaneously and can be used to stop anyone from saying anything really.<p>I think it should not be celebrated when a corporation decides to enforce arbitrary rules based on its own interpretations of someone else&#x27;s plain words.')
