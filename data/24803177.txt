I probably should have softened that sentence. And it&#x27;s not really that Haskell is missing some sort of optimization here, it&#x27;s that these things all tie together: Rust tends to monomorphize a <i>lot</i>, which produces more code in general, including stuff to get inlined. It&#x27;s one of the big challenges to get things to compile quickly; they&#x27;re sort of inherently in tension with one another.')
