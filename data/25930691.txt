These guys are losing BILLIONS of dollars.  Billions.  Can they spend $1B to prevent the loss of $2B?  (Is reddit worth more than $1B?)<p>Other stuff I won&#x27;t be surprised if we see:<p>* Massive astroturf campaigns (the WSB mods are claiming that this is already happening.<p>* DDOS attacks on reddit<p>* Attacks against the mods of WSB<p>* &quot;Institutional&quot; attacks like SEC involvement<p>It&#x27;s just sortof crazy to think what it looks like when there is this much money on the line.  Everything goes out the window.')
