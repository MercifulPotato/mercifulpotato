The registration fee (annual renewal, not initial registration) in the US is based on vehicle value in 8 states by my count.<p>On a personal note, me and most of the people I know think more in terms of miles than years.  I figure every car I buy is good for 200,000 miles and most of the brands I favor have another 100,000 miles of life beyond that before repairs exceed some loosely calculated rate of return.')
