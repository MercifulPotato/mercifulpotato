I worked in an area that was billed out by the hour, it was just complicated enough to require developers to do the work, but the work pieces were very quantifiable (add text to say xyz based on a business rule, show different images based on a rule, etc). It meant graduate programmers, immigrants with limited English skills, or others without much talent or drive would end up there.
