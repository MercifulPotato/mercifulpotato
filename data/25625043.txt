It describes a bunch of seemingly disparate world events that eventually appear integrated. No one comes out a hero. It subtly reminded me to not take &#x27;positive change&#x27; for granted. And that there is no final victory, no final defeat. The same arguments must continue to be put forward to each generation.')
