All I could find was <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.policemag.com&#x2F;342098&#x2F;the-2016-police-presidential-poll" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.policemag.com&#x2F;342098&#x2F;the-2016-police-presidentia...</a><p>It says that 84% of responding email-registered readers of POLICE MAGAZINE indicated that that they would vote for Trump. That&#x27;s not the same as what you said at all.<p>This magazine &quot;emailed 59,238 readers&quot;. There are more than 10x that many full-time police officers in the US. Can one conclude that the responding fraction of this tiny-circulation magazine&#x27;s readership is statistically representative of all police officers in the country?')
