Sure, if doctors want to compete on giving me a low price for vaccines and office visits, etc., I can see that working.<p>However, any emergency service essentially has a captive audience. Most people who need an appendectomy or are having a heart attack are not in a position to price-shop. They need close, immediate care. Hell, quality probably doesn&#x27;t even matter in these situations... not dying is the goal. This is where the free market doesn&#x27;t work because there&#x27;s no true consumer choice.')
