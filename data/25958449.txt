One? Five? In logcal terms, one ought to do it.<p>Now how many people would it take to invalidate &quot;I, along with a number of other leftwing organizers?&quot; I actually don&#x27;t think that can be invalidated. It&#x27;s much more specific than &quot;the left&quot; or &quot;the right.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s what I meant by an incredibly wide brush.<p>The article seems thoughtful and goes into quite a bit of detail on why the author claims that &quot;far-left activists&quot; and &quot;far-right activists&quot; are not the same, with examples. One can agree or disagree with the author&#x27;s conclusions, but they&#x27;re making a case with evidence, not just slapping a too-wide label out there.')
