It should work, but note that you really want a GPU that supports DSC (RTX 20-series or newer)<p>The two paths for 10bit 6k60 are either HBR2 + DSC, or 2x HBR3 streams. The 2x HBR3 streams have several gotchas - not daisy-chainable, limits the XDR USB-C ports to 2.0 speeds, requires a TB3 controller with 2 displayport inputs, and I&#x27;m not certain it even works with non-Apple TB3 firmware.')
