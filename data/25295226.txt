If I touch anyone&#x27;s dog, I have to wash my hands, because one absentminded rub of my face is all it takes to go full allergy misery. Sitting on any furniture that a dog has been on for a length of time (say, your couch)? Also going to cause me problems.<p>Pets shed, airplanes have carpeted floors and airplanes aren&#x27;t exactly deep cleaned between flights, at least in non-COVID times.<p>If your dog was in that seat or on the floor of that row on the <i>last</i> flight, and I&#x27;m in it on <i>this</i> flight, I&#x27;m likely going to be both personally miserable and making everyone else around me miserable for my entire flight.')
