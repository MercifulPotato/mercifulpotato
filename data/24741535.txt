The ability to use any system you happen to be in front of without issue is a huge boon in and of itself.  I have friends who spend hours customizing every little keybind, using uncommon peripherals, etc.<p>Does it make them more productive?  I honestly have my doubts.  The number of times I&#x27;ve had to wait during a group project because a software update broke their keybinds, they&#x27;re at another desk and are now slow because they don&#x27;t have the muscle memory for &#x27;standard&#x27; layouts, etc is not even close to zero.
