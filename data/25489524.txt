I will, as someone new and lurking around contributing, speak about something that make me hesitant to try and&#x2F;or turn me off or away. This is only my two-cents as an outsider.<p>I think some of the issues[1] that matter to people have seen no traction over long periods of time and the answer is &quot;it&#x27;s hard; we&#x27;ll get to it, leave us alone.&quot; And of course, if you look up who these people are, telling you to leave them alone, they are absolutely fucking brilliant people... they certainly know the scope and difficulty. The thing is, these folks are very likely, insanely busy and the longer their lives&#x2F;careers go on; the less time they&#x27;ll likely have to devote to seemingly unimportant, to them, but difficult issues.<p>That&#x27;s life. Zero hate and only thanks to the kind brilliant folks who have spent countless hours donating that brilliance to the world... But then, this poses the big question of: what am <i>I</i>, the less brilliant, to do? What can I do? What other problems require your brilliance or expertise? Lurking through other issues gives me a sense of &quot;not qualified&quot; and I eventually stroll away. Maybe folks, who are qualified and don&#x27;t realize it, also walk away.<p>I&#x27;ll very likely contribute to apps using GTK since it&#x27;s a really nice experience and other parts of the Gnome ecosystem; but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever contribute to Gnome proper.<p>[1] I don&#x27;t particularly want to identify specific issues because I don&#x27;t think the nice folks who maintain it deserve to be inundated with noise like &quot;fix plz 10yers.&quot;')
