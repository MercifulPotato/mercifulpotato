To point out this fact - that all biological life is doomed to die - was the purpose of my original post. We can talk about nuclear war, climate change, hostile aliens, and other short term threats to human survival. We will survive these short term threats or we won&#x27;t. But in the long term it is 100% certain we don&#x27;t survive. We only survive the Heat Death if it turns out we are living in a Matrix of sorts and the computers of the Matrix are hosted in a datacenter universe that is truly eternal, unlike our universe which will die the Heat Death. Or we survive the Heat Death if there is an eternal God who gives us a post-biological existence after the Death of our universe. My point is that present humans and far-future humans are in the same boat as prehistoric humans: we all must learn to face death bravely. Future humans will never have permanent biological immortality, because our universe does not allow it. Neither does Penrose&#x27;s universe. Furthermore, Penrose&#x27;s only testable prediction (CMB concentric rings caused by past reboot of universe) proved unable to be replicated by three independent attempts. Einstein&#x27;s theory in contrast said the orbit of the planet Mercury should have an observable precession if true: so we pointed our telescopes at Mercury and lo, Mercury did indeed precess just as his set of equations said it would.')
