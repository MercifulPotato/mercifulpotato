All things considered, it&#x27;s not an important feature, <i>especially</i> considering it has a work-around. They have have the ticket for the issue and it&#x27;s on a backlog. As with all software projects, they have to triage bugs, prioritize their work and allocate resources. The awesome thing about open source is that anyone can create a patch for the fix, and resolve it for everyone.<p>Compare this to some Apple Radar bugs that are old enough to vote, but only Apple employees can fix.')
