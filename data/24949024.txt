One thing that I noticed was that when I was in Phoenix, there were lots of people...most of the people in Arizona, actually. My hope in matching up those statistics was that they did most of the driving too, so it wasn&#x27;t too apples-to-oranges, but of course I did bring up this factor that made my comparison suck. I would have loved to find the right statistic to compare to--did you have any luck finding it?')
