It is easy to site a lot of people parroting the idea that it came from Russia, but aside from some vague connections, there is 0 hard evidence.  If you were an Israeli, Iranian, Chinese, etc... hacker, you would obviously tunnel through servers in foreign countries that were easy scapegoats.  So even if there was actual evidence (which there isn&#x27;t) it still wouldn&#x27;t mean anything unless it could be tracked back to an originating IP and connected to an individual with a motive and without an alibi.<p>The benefits of blaming things on Russia for certain political parties are obvious, but those politicians and media members continue to make claims while never presenting any evidence, so you really have to ask yourself what is more likely to be true; A bunch of vapid politicians self benefitting claims without evidence, or the far more obvious possibility that a group of techie people from some random country hacked an easy target for money.<p>Occam&#x27;s razor say it is the later.')
