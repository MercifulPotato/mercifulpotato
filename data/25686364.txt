I don&#x27;t get why I got downvoted just trying to answer someone&#x27;s questions about features in a software product and explaining how I use them.<p>If this is what works for you then great. You&#x27;ve convinced me that home&#x2F;car repairs in particular should rollover, I&#x27;m going to start doing that in my budget. All I was saying is that by default I don&#x27;t want things like food or shopping budgets to roll over, since I don&#x27;t want to spend money I don&#x27;t need to just because it was in the budget. It&#x27;s just what works for me.')
