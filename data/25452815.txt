My cofounder was Rocky McGaugh.

The Name has a meaning. As shown in the quote above. And it is tribute &#x2F; honour to a founder, from a previously well known project ( CentOS )<p>2. That meaning and the linkage in itself is extremely marketable. Especially to the target audience which are using CentOS.<p>3. This message explaining its meaning has been there since Day 1 according to Github history.<p>4. But more than half of the comments ( 150 ) are pissing on its name.<p>5. Which suggest that either a) They didn&#x27;t actually click on the link and read anything or b) They dont like name for whatever reason.<p>6. I will be judgemental, and I am willing to bet those who are complaining about the name has never done any professional marketing or sales for any decent period of time.<p>Having said all that, they are still entitled to their opinion. But it also shows why product development and marketing based on surveying doesn&#x27;t really work.')
