Item(by='imron', descendants=None, kids=[25451474], score=None, time=1608164116, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25446016, text='&gt; You think there&#x27;d be ...some? people talking about how they decided not to have a child because she&#x2F;he wouldn&#x27;t fit in the car if it&#x27;s going to have a measurable effect on birth rates but at least personally I have never, ever heard this one.<p>We have 3 kids.  When talking to friends with only 2 kids, this comes up all the time and is a non-trivial concern in having a third child.<p>You need a bigger car, a bigger house and bigger everything, and many things are not geared towards families of 5 - family passes at museums&#x2F;zoos are often 2 adults + 2 children etc.<p>When we had our third we upgraded our car (from 5 seats to 8 seats) and our house.  If we had a fourth we&#x27;d need to upgrade the house in a few years again.  It&#x27;s definitely a concern and is definitely talked about by people who are affected by it.')
