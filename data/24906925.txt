I actually was using 10mb per connection as the overhead which creates a decently expensive server for not a lot of throughput.<p>By pipelining what I mean is allowing multiple requests to be in flight on the connection, each tagged with an ID that gets queued on the server. When a worker process gets around to processing it, it&#x27;ll send back a response with the same ID. This increases driver complexity but also makes it so you need very few connections per client.')
