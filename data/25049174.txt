This suggests that free speech is merely about being able to speak and that advocates would be happy for their speech to be stymied in other ways - and, in fact, pleased when all their speech has mandatory notices about its invalidity. Clearly this is not what free-speech advocates believe, so it certainly is straw-manning or as another put &quot;<i>some</i> gymnastics&quot;.<p>Apart from that, the rest of what you said is relatively coherent and you did at least try to unpack the platform as-is.<p>It is true that the President of the United States is also an authority. However, are they an authority of Twitter? Well, they can&#x27;t ban people or add editorial notes below the tweets of their opponents so perhaps not.<p>You also mention that &quot;Trump is given special privileges on Twitter, and is exempt from virtually all the normal TOS&quot;, so shouldn&#x27;t he be held to the same standard as everyone else? Well, yes. Why not?<p>As for whether new ways of adding editorial comment below people&#x27;s tweets are &quot;special abilities&quot; I think so (because normal users can&#x27;t do this).<p>However, I agree that Twitter was never &quot;a free speech platform&quot; and that by design it always amplified particular voices via crowd-sourcing. But, there is a difference between crowd-sourced amplification and centralised editorial oversight&#x2F;amplification. While Twitter has &quot;never been even remotely about [free speech]&quot; the new features are clearly changing <i>what it is</i> from a crowd-sourced amplification platform to a platform with significant editorial oversight.<p>Is it better for there to be a centralised bias for or against different messages or identities or is it better for the bias to be crowd-sourced? Is the editorial oversight US-centric only? Who gets this power (e.g. governments, institutions, HR, etc)? When should there be limits to free speech? When some speech needs to be inhibited should this be done <i>in the open</i> or behind closed doors? Should infractions be explained? Does anybody get to break the rules?<p>I and many others would like if these questions could be answered by the big social networks. It&#x27;s annoying when people simplify all of this into some primitive desire for everybody to be able to say whatever and have their voice amplified by a platform, since that is not what I am saying.')
