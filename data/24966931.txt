It just took about six weeks more restrictions, and actually aiming at winning.<p>Most of the west adopted a “just prevent the hospitals from collapsing” goal, which is a stupid goal if your only tool to do so is heavy handed lockdowns. You’re guaranteed to have yo-yo lockdowns.<p>The only coherent strategies are developing an effective test&#x2F;trace&#x2F;isolate system or local elimination. The west doesn’t seem institutionally capable of the former.')
