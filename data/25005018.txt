Escaping in batch files is slightly different from interactive commands, each utility may have its own escaping conventions on top of those the shell has, etc. Linux and the like have a far more predictable and consistent experience, since argument splitting and globbing is always done once by the shell, and each process gets the already-split and expanded argument list.')
