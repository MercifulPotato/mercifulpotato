I&#x27;ve had it for 3-4 years now.<p>Every morning I get an email from logwatch showing me activity on the server, particularly failed http requests and &quot;attempts to use known hacks&quot; (which are just pattern matches on URL requests).<p>I used to get hundreds of lines of logs PER DAY of this stuff..<p>Then about a year ago I found a list of IP subnets for China and Russia, and blocked all of it at the OS level with the firewall, and now I get almost nothing in my logs anymore (every so often I add a new subnet to the blocklist, usually from eastern Europe).<p>I can&#x27;t see any reason why my server that hosts personal stuff would need to see traffic from those countries (and I&#x27;m fine with blocking false positives - YMMV).<p>I know it&#x27;s not a foolproof security measure and if anyone was specifically targeting me this would not stop them, but it helps with all the drive-by scanning.<p>There is a TON of automated scan traffic coming out of China and Russia specifically that is constantly scanning IP blocks known to belong to hosting providers.')
