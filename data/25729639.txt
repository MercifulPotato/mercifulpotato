The underlying problem is that it is more profitable&#x2F;cheaper to just give you a new product (if something breaks while under warrantee) and then just throw away the old instead of repairing it. I don&#x27;t know if it is because the externalities of waste are not taxed properly or if it is because manufacturing products that are hard to repair gives more robust products and less waste in the end.')
