But UI that <i>generates</i> code is a pretty cool paradigm.  For most common patterns, end users don&#x27;t need to know that there&#x27;s a bunch of boilerplate code under the hood, but if that isn&#x27;t sufficient, that remaining 5% can be reached by just jumping into some auto-generated code that&#x27;s readable and well-commented.  Mere mortals can do the 95% themselves and then call in a wizard for the hard parts, or try to figure it out on their own.  Plus, any non-generated solutions can be highlighted, so it builds up a record of the places where the UI fell short.')
