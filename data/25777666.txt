My Charge 2 died and I wanted something with GPS and decent battery life. I charge my watch every 10ish days (I pair it with my phone only after an activity to see the details, not otherwise).\nI personally find it great that it has a rugged screen with buttons instead of fancier things like a touchscreen, payment options etc.')
