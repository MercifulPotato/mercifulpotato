Having done some work in computational GR, I haven&#x27;t seen anyone mention it and none of the texts I have read do.  I think for people advanced enough in their field they are already past any pain points that this solves, so they don&#x27;t learn it and don&#x27;t teach it to their students.<p>Two I think that the people who this is most useful for, students just starting out in physics, aren&#x27;t really in a position to go out and learn a new representation for doing their problems in.  Especially when they are struggling enough with the basic concepts and their instructor is highly unlikely to be familiar with it.<p>Because of those two things and the cycles they mutually perpetuate, without a huge PR campaign or some well known teacher using it at a big name school for an introductory class I don&#x27;t think we will ever see this become popular')
