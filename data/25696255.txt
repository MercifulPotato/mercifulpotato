No, I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t know anything about that.<p>The latest video that Trump posted there was that the protestors will be prosecuted and that he basically concedes and will transition power over to Biden. At no point, including his latest tweets on the @POTUS account that were deleted within minutes, have I seen anything that would suggest that he&#x27;s planning any kind of &quot;attack&quot;. And in fact, I see it the opposite way. If my reading of the situation is correct, he&#x27;s trying to control the damage and calm down his base precisely so nothing like this will happen, because he believes that there is still future for him, as the tweet in question suggest. It could very well be that he was the only person that was keeping his supporters from starting the actual uprising and not whatever the Capitol thing was. And now it might be gone.<p>Obviously that&#x27;s my opinion, but if you actually don&#x27;t want any violence to happen, you better hope that I&#x27;m wrong about this.')
