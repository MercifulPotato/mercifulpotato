Unless you’re saying we went wrong with the kids and now we should not do the same for adults. In which case I would say that letting kids play unsupervised is an individual risk but speech and organizations have large and exponentially spreading emergent effects, so if you have the profit motive you’re going to end up with certain, shall we say, exacerbated divisions in this country.')
