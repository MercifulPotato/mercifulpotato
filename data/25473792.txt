There are times where it starts to feel like a bait and switch<p>For example, without spoilers:<p>There&#x27;s a point where you&#x27;re speaking to a friendly character, and a mutual contact is possibly hurt.<p>Your options are essentially to blame your friend for what happened or to remind them that your mutual friend might be hurt (the idea being you can&#x27;t afford to give up now)<p>By choosing to remind your friend of this mutual contact... you berate your friend! Eventually... blaming them for what happened!<p>I mean it&#x27;s so painfully transparent that you can literally <i>hear the switch up in intonation</i> where your &quot;fake choice&quot; meets up with the real choice the game wants to go with.')
