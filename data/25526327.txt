Guidelines for the WebPKI are, of course, very web-centric. E.g. short lifetimes may be acceptable there. Automated frequent reissuance may be an option. But if you e.g. look at email and auth certs, possibly stored on a smartcard, things are quite different. Lifetime should be long and can be long, because the key is used rarely (compared to webservers) and maybe stored in dedicated smartcards. Verification is another thing thats totally different for an email address or a person&#x27;s name.')
