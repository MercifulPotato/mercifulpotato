We&#x27;re going after google for search? Which has literally the lowest switching costs out there and is offered for free - and this is what the govt is calling consumer harm?<p>Meanwhile, I can think of a BUNCH of things that result in actual consumer harm by google - this included. And no, I don&#x27;t give to craps about other businesses making money or not - so that whole part of the anti-trust thing seems dumb to me - yes, spammers and auto-review websites are downranked I&#x27;m sure, and I don&#x27;t care.<p>How is stuff like this at least a bit higher on the things to think about from a govt regulation standpoint.')
