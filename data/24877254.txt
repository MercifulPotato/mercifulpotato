Those huge cement walls and vassals require huge investments of money, energy, and materials. Just as much, that is energy invested in a particular location and assuming that location will continue to require energy. That&#x27;s energy that&#x27;s wasted if something goes wrong the construction or operation of the plant and that&#x27;s energy that&#x27;s gone at the end of life of the plant.<p>If you just require energy storage, it may be expensive but there are a number of flexible methods, some of which scale very easily (and others are cheaper but only at large scale, etc).')
