Cigarettes are a great example here -- they can be <i>really expensive</i> and people who are already smokers will still buy them.<p>But there&#x27;s still a limit to just how heavily you can tax cigarettes, because the higher the taxes are, the more profit smugglers can receive. They&#x27;ll go out there to bring the price down even if smokers were willing to pay the higher prices, as long as their smuggling costs are covered.')
