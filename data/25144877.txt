They will forget to sleep. They will ignore requests to hang out with friends. I don&#x27;t know if they have <i>ever</i> willingly got off their tablets of their own volition, except sometimes to eat.<p>Now that the kids are schooling virtually, they spend their day staring at a laptop. When they get a break or schools over, what do they want? To stare at their tablets.<p>I try to regulate it. I&#x27;ll tell them to get off and do something else. Twenty minutes later, they&#x27;re back on. &quot;Didn&#x27;t I tell you to get off?&quot; &quot;Mom, said we could.&quot; &quot;Did you tell her I told you to get off screen?&quot; &quot;No...&quot; They are like junkies, pitting us against each other.<p>But it&#x27;s not like I can just kick them off. Because some fraction of the time, they&#x27;re playing Minecraft which I think is pretty creative, and they&#x27;re playing with their friends. Given how little social interaction they can get right now, I&#x27;m loathe to minimize that. But as soon as their friends sign off, they switch to YouTube without saying anything. &quot;Weren&#x27;t you playing Minecraft with Alice?&quot; &quot;Oh, that was hours ago.&quot;.<p>Sure, if my wife and I were better more disciplined parents maybe this would be less of a problem. But it really sucks having to essentially live in a house that has a big bag of candy-coated heroin right next to the breakfast cereal and have to <i>constantly</i> be vigilant about not letting them have it. And then when someone points out &quot;Hey, maybe we businesses shouldn&#x27;t be able to leave bags of heroin candy in our houses,&quot; all you get is comments like the ones here judging people for letting their kids have it.<p>And, no, this isn&#x27;t the same as when we played with our computers as kids any more than caffeine is the same as heroin. A difference in degree is still a difference, especially at this magnitude.<p>Parenting is hard enough as it is without having to fight a personal uphill battle against the trillion-dollar capitalist attention acquisition industry.')
