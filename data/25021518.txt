This is because class-D amps are extremely convenient, they are small, cheap, power efficient and they require little consideration for cooling - audio quality is an area of debate, there are certainly lots of very poor quality class-D amps our there with absurdly high THDs, but there are probably lots of good ones too.<p>AB would be more likely than A, but I can&#x27;t imagine finding them even in a large flat screen TV since they are inherently less efficient and require larger power transformers which make them fairly heavy and bulky. You only really find non switching amps these days when people want to sacrifice some of that convenience for some nicer sound.')
