Unless you are literally wheelchair bound, most people can walk.<p>Most of us don&#x27;t do enough of it and it&#x27;s one of the safest forms of exercise. We really should be designing our cities and built environments to be more walkable so more people get in 30 minutes of brisk walking daily just from running errands without really trying to exercise per se.<p>People would be healthier. Pollution levels would be lower. Studies show that walkable, mixed use neighborhoods foster higher sales for local businesses and are thus typically more prosperous. &quot;Eyes on the street&quot; is a known antidote to crime and you get that primarily by having a pedestrian-friendly built environment.<p>And I don&#x27;t believe walking has any track record of fostering heart attacks.')
