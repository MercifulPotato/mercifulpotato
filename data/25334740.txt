Our team was overpaying by thousands of dollars per month on AWS, and I found out that other teams within the company were overspending by a similar amount. I then dug deeper and after some time, set up budgeting controls and saved our teams thousands of dollars per month. We had an AWS optimization company that wasn&#x27;t able to find these savings and AWS&#x27;s trusted advisor only found marginal savings.<p>So I decided to start a new kind of optimization platform. We&#x27;re driven by data (we ingest hundreds of thousands of data points from CloudWatch) and our dashboards are completely automated. We support optimization for EC2 and RDS. We do our optimization in two main ways: we search for the best combination of RIs and Savings Plans, then we bundle our RIs with guaranteed buyback so you can sell your RI early. All the savings with nearly none of the risk. Next, we found that many of our customers have non-prod EC2s and RDS instances that sit idle on weekends. We automatically create policies to shut them down to save you money.<p>Every Friday, we send an email with the savings our system found and all you need to do is hit accept or reject.<p>We just helped a company save 30% ($8.5k&#x2F;year) in less than 30 minutes (the time to register for an account + action savings).<p>What do you think HN community?<p>URL: www.usage.ai<p>p.s. we have an upcoming AWS Cost Optimization Immersion Day coming up next Friday, December 18th from 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm EST. Here&#x27;s an invite!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;1FAIpQLSdhELeO1VS42hLXri0OqqsDCm_lyRPoJh_Co3WxljmLQeRm_A&#x2F;viewform')
