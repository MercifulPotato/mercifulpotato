If you build a successful company, your gain is proportional to <i>logarithm</i> of its profit. But your investor&#x27;s gain is directly proportional to the profit.<p>So the investor will try to convince you to aim for 300% profit with 50% probability (compared to your original plan), because for the investor this simply means +50%. For you, it mostly means -50% probability, because the difference between having e.g. $10M or $30M is negligible compared to the difference between having $10M or nothing.')
