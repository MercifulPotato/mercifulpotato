I upvoted your comment because it is mostly factual, and correct!<p>I agree that Rust is still early for most adopters.<p>There are a subset of people who need to solve problems that would normally be solved in C or C++, but they don&#x27;t know or don&#x27;t want to use those languages. Those people generally love Rust (I am in this camp).<p>Then there is everyone else, who either like Rust because it&#x27;s a cool language, or don&#x27;t for any number of reasons all of which are fine!')
