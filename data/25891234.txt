That changed through the political green movement and the institutionalization of their ideas. Now you can bath again in those rivers, and drink water from a tap without being afraid - unfortunately, a lot of producing industries have moved on to greener, cheaper pastures, where ecologic and environmental, let alone human protection is not really at a high standard.<p>The approach to deal with the &quot;Après moi, le déluge&quot; and conspiracy people is a tricky one. Only partly in can be covered with an economic (private jet tax, rejection of clinic entry&#x2F;travel to people who are not vaccinated) and educational approach - but we are far from being close to an optimum here. Democracies need educated and politically mature people in order to be stable in the long term, and strong institutions that can bring forward a healthy discourse.')
