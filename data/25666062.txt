Item(by='Igelau', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609983222, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25662823, text='&gt; to claim that religion, generally speaking, is all about manipulation through misinformation is wrong<p>This claim only holds water because -- in theory -- there is no precise definition of what &quot;religion&quot; is. In practice, it&#x27;s a set of rules and rituals to follow (literal manipulation) on penalty of an unprovable&#x2F;unfalsifiable entity or system punishing you (misinformation).<p>So, okay, &quot;generally speaking&quot; it&#x27;s not about that. Now show me that the majority of religions don&#x27;t boil down to manipulation and misinformation.')
