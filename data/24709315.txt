Cast iron even better.<p>Plain bicycle without electric parts easier to recycle metal.<p>Durable quality Screens drivers.<p>Non electric espresso maker. Bailetto.<p>Corded headphones no batteries that wear out. Changable parts. No wireless protocol that go obsolete.<p>LifePo4 lithium iron batteries instead of lithium cobalt chemistry. Cobalt is a conflict mineral mining that puts out dangerous pollutants. Lifepo4 can take more recharge cycles than cobalt chemistry and are safer.<p>Reasoning is if the product last for life itâ€™s more environmentally sustainable.<p>Cell phones are on the opposite end of the last for life spectrum.')
