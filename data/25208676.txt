Trump is openly trying to overturn the popular vote in PA, GA, MI, etc. That is how electoral votes are decided. He has openly called for the legislature to overturn the popular vote in these states based on nothing.<p>Yes, he’s trying to overturn illegal votes, he’s well within his right. Had Trump won and Biden lost you wouldn’t be angry. You’re only angry now because there’s a chance, however small, that Trump can still win and this upsets you. Calm down, turn off CNN, this is not what a coup look like.<p>Republicans tried to secure the vote with national voting IDs, people are too poor the democrats said. India uses electronic voting to secure the vote, yet we’re too poor. So this mistrust in the voting system is again the fault of the democrats. The truth is there’s fraud in every election, it’s just usually not enough to swing the vote. Did you not read of all the problems with non residents and non citizens getting ballots anyway?<p>&gt; This has been a growing problem, and it is now at the point where it is threatening our democracy.<p>Agreed, so let’s go for voter IDs so this question never comes up again?')
