The hardware investment can be sold off, used for other chains (with ETH1 gone, another chain will take its place as the dominant GPU chain), there is also all the upcoming fields of ai&#x2F;ml&#x2F;rendering&#x2F;gaming and other computationally intensive workloads.<p>This is really the beauty of ethash being asic resistant and gpu friendly. I have so much computational power built up, that someone will always be available to buy it. It isn&#x27;t e-waste. We already run on older generation GPU&#x27;s because they are higher ROI, which proves that they have useful life, even as they age.')
