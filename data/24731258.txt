To me the real miracle of DNS is the way it&#x27;s scaled from its original design to handle, what, a million times as much data and traffic as anyone would have reasonably assumed when it was deployed? More? I don&#x27;t even know how to estimate it. The core idea of a hierarchy of caches has proven remarkably effective.<p>There are very few Internet protocols this old and widely used that haven&#x27;t seen significant changes in design or at least implementation. BGP is the other one but it&#x27;s not clear that it&#x27;s a success story. NTP, sorta, but its current deployment is very different from the original design.')
