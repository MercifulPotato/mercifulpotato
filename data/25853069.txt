Then my produce is <i>STILL</i> optimized for transport and storage over taste and freshness.<p>&gt; The entire premise of this is &#x27;hipster tech&#x27;<p>I agree.  It annoys me when they tout this as &quot;volume&quot; or &quot;scale&quot;.  However, you can&#x27;t get VC funding unless you promise that so that&#x27;s the price of your marketing.  Shrug.<p>Nevertheless, I do hope one of these catches on somehow.  Several of my favorite restaurants had their own gardens.  However, they are limited by the weather and season to certain crops.<p>If someone can slap a steel container down and use these technologies to grow out of area&#x2F;out of season vegetables and fruits I&#x27;m all for it.
