I feel like this is key to avoiding the chicken-and-egg effect.<p>My understanding is a major contributing factor is that Apple added Intel&#x27;s memory-ordering to their Arm chips, which allows Rosetta 2 to perform so well. Being Apple, they could drop this in 2-3 years if they wanted to drop Rosetta 2 support.<p>That&#x27;s something vertical integration (and not caring so much about long-term compatibility) will get you that would be much more difficult otherwise.')
