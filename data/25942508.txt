I like Rust and I think the team put a lot of effort into programmer ergonomics.<p>It&#x27;s just that the language is focused on performance a lot and compete with C++. And so they sometimes make tradeoffs in favor of performance instead of expressiveness or simplicity.<p>That is understandable - but 95% of the projects I(!) have worked on don&#x27;t need this - I can just give it a GB more RAM and a bit more CPU and write software quicker because I don&#x27;t have to care about certain details.<p>&gt; At least that&#x27;s happened to me, maybe I am just dumb and mediocre though.<p>The fact that you used Rust probably puts you in the upper 10% - rough gestimation. I&#x27;m not telling you which 10% though. :P')
