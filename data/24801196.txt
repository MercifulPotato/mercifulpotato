If they wanted to do it, they would have done it. But that would nuke Google, Facebook, and Twitter, all at once. (I personally don&#x27;t think that would be all that bad for the internet or society in general, but I digress.) But they (meaning the swamp creatures, Trump included) realize now how much power they hold over Big Tech via this law, and how much influence they can exert over the world with this power. And they realize how bad it would be for the US stock market (which all of Washington worships as their god) if the tech giants failed all at once.<p>I believe Techlash will either kill these companies or transform them, and I think that much is inevitable. That is why Zuckerberg straight up asked for regulation. He wants the government to save his company. We will probably see a series of regulations that places these giants under the control of Washington. Maybe it&#x27;s time to put forward some kind of tech Bill of Rights now to limit what the government can do with our data beyond what&#x27;s already prohibited in the actual Bill of Rights. Things like &quot;No about queries.&quot; &quot;No recording conversations in the home.&quot; etc.')
