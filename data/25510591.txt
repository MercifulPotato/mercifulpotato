Console gets stolen (more likely than its competitors, since it&#x27;s a portable system) or you have a hardware failure? Everything&#x27;s gone.<p>I have a Switch, but the only games I&#x27;ll buy for it are ones where I wouldn&#x27;t particularly care if it destroyed all my save files. Had that experience after a Wii hardware failure and I never went back and finished any of the games I was partway through because I didn&#x27;t want to replay the first 3&#x2F;4 of them just to get to the last bit.')
