I take my dog for walks on a path between orange tree fields, so at night is pretty dark. I look at the sky and I see this thing moving and I think, maybe it&#x27;s a plane but it doesn&#x27;t have any blinking light. It&#x27;s not a planet&#x2F;star because it&#x27;s moving. Is it an alien? Nevermin, it&#x27;s probably a plane.<p>I keep walking and I look up again. Now I see like 3 or 4 of them. One after another with the same space between them. And as they move, another one appears. And then another one, and another one.<p>I saw a total of two dozens or so. As soon I got some I told it to a friend who didn&#x27;t know what it was either. I googled it and the next day I found a video in a news website where they asked about some &quot;dots&quot; that were seen above Barcelona which is not very far away from where I am.
