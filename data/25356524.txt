GPLv3 changes the wording in Section 3(a) to &quot;durable physical medium&quot;, but at the same time it gives other possibility including &quot;Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge&quot;.<p>Everyone was doing network distribution of GPL software long before GPLv3 came out, effectively treating a download as a medium customarily used for software interchange. Not a physical one, but GPLv2 does not say anything about that.')
