I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time getting good at what I do, and I am actually happy to show those skills off to potential employers.<p>But hackerrank&#x2F;leetcode don&#x27;t test for those skills. They test your ability to memorize solutions to trivia questions, typically things you&#x27;d never be asked to do in the workplace.<p>There&#x27;s enough to learn to be good at software without having to also memorize arbitrary trivia.')
