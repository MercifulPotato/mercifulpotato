We have priors from other vaccines and vaccine candidates, and the data from these trials. All data about the first dose suggests strongly that 1 dose provides very strong protection against severe disease, and solid protection against mild disease.<p>Most vaccines have increased efficacy when spreading out the doses, so the same is likely true here, which means this is most likely to increase efficacy.<p>We don&#x27;t have data on lots of things, like what if we vaccinated people in cars instead of indoors? We can&#x27;t run RCTs for everything in this world.<p>People are also not advocating for 1 dose only, rather spreading the doses out more to get more people vaccinated faster.<p>1 dose first, followed by another 12 weeks later is almost certainly going to be highly effective and it&#x27;s almost certainly going to be safe.<p>This is also not a binary decision. To let you to 10M people try this regime while watching the data has as close to &quot;only upside&quot; as you can get in medicine.<p>If the FDA approved Astrazeneca now, and the states focused on getting first doses, we could be done with this pandemic in like 45 days. It&#x27;s worth taking a tiny amount of risk that this group of 10M might not have effective immunity and need to be revaccinated.')
