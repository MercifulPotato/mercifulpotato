I have an item which I didn&#x27;t see directly stated on here.<p>According to Mirriam-Webster [1], definitions of &quot;stupid&quot; include:<p>-slow of mind<p>-given to unintelligent decisions or acts<p>-dulled in feeling or sensation<p>-marked by or resulting from unreasoned thinking or acting<p>So, from this, we would the population to make slow, unintelligent decisions. However, the Flynn effect indicates that average intelligence of the world&#x27;s population is increasing [2]. To me, stating stupidity is increasing while intelligence is increasing is a contradiction, so I feel something else is at play, particularly with decision making.<p>Historically, the information a person could access was quite limited. Information was largely passed down orally, especially if you lived in a poor society. This information was hard-won and passed down over generations. Then technology allowed information to disseminate though alternative mediums (paper, radio, television, Internet, etc.). The primary benefit of these new mediums was their accessibility, and that feature--like it or not--is a double-edged sword.<p>To explore this, let&#x27;s consider three scenarios:<p>1) A person only receives information that is true 10% of the time: this person will likely not survive into adulthood. If they do, they will likely cause harm to others.<p>2) A person only receives information that is true 50% of the time: would this person be able to make snap decisions? Likely not, as they would need to analyze every aspect of a situation. On a long-enough timescale, they might be able to figure out specific situations, but it&#x27;s unlikely they will do a good job.<p>3) A person only receives information that is true 90% of the time: this person should do reasonably well. Their fast decision-making processes are well-tuned and reinforced by feeding in information known to be of very high quality.<p>To draw the (inevitable) connection to machine learning: would you train a reinforcement learning model with training data where 50% of the labels are wrong? Of course not!<p>My theory is that today, much of the information people receive by default is low quality; it doesn&#x27;t generalize well. Novel situations are difficult to assess because people didn&#x27;t develop good heuristics for analyzing it. For example, sometimes the best decision is to just say &quot;no&quot; and move on (for example, cutting out negative people from your life). But if a person is perpetually in a zone of undecidability, decisions becomes far harder to make. As a result, more situations pile up, creating additional decisions, creating additional problems, ad infinitum.<p>Just my two cents here. And please do not overlook the irony inherent in this post. :)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;stupid" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;stupid</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flynn_effect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flynn_effect</a>')
