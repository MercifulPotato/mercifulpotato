Do you understand why someone might find that worrisome?<p>Again, I am attempting to engage in good faith. Do you not think this is a valid question that <i>someone</i> has the right to ask and receive an answer to?<p>&gt; You&#x27;re supposed to challenge them in state courts, which did hear some of the complaints and ultimately disagreed with those cases on the merits.<p>How is it not a federal question as to how states choose presidential electors? The electors are chosen by the legislature.<p>The constitution says (Article II, Section 1, Clause 2):<p>&gt; Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.<p>If  the mayor of Portland chose electors for Oregon and the governor allowed that (using my state as an example here), you don&#x27;t think <i>anyone</i> has the right to ask federal courts to answer the question of whether or not electors must be chosen by the legislature (as the constitution demands), and asking them to decertify the ones chosen by someone other than the legislature?<p>Do you honestly, in good faith, believe that the governors changing the rules for electors is not a question that ought to be addressed by courts given what I just cited above? I agree that federal courts cannot answer questions on how states elect Senators, but electors are clearly different.<p>I am not asking you to agree with my interpretation of the law, but rather asking you if you really believe this is not a federal issue. Can Oregon simply decide tomorrow to simply not hold elections for President tomorrow?')
