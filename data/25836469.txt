I don&#x27;t think wanting to protect a brand they&#x27;ve been investing in for years is unreasonable.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. It would be great if Elastic, Redis and co didn&#x27;t have to do this (change license) but AWS does pose an existential threat to their business models long term. I&#x27;d rather a standardised, so there&#x27;s less fear around interpretations, more restrictive license than the businesses and _future_ ones becoming unviable.')
