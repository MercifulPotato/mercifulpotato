The problem is that the Republicans in America is exactly as misogynistic and anti-abortion as Law and Justice in Poland. It is quite likely that Roe v Wade will be turned over in America in 2021. These things are not static and can change dramatically in a decade. Trying to make this about national attitudes is a mistake that only leads to confusion and misunderstanding.<p>And with Poland and Hungary especially, the government has become strongly anti-LGBT <i>in response</i> to increased public support for LGBT rights, as part of a general authoritarian far-right ideology. This complicated political development with a homogenous expression of Hungarian&#x2F;Polish society.<p>And in the case of CD Projekt Red in particular: for starters, you can’t claim “golly, those humble Poles just have different views than you American folk” when your game is set in America, is clearly about American culture, was heavily marketed towards Americans, and prominently features major American actors. And CD Projekt Red has repeatedly apologized for their transphobic GOG ad campaign. They are not hicks who are unaware of some Ivory Tower concern by elite American liberals. They are in fact fully aware of what they are doing and they made a moral choice.')
