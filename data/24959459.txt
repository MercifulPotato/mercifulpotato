The PII was released around 1998 and you basically just asserted that <i>everybody</i> buys the latest CPU as soon as its released.<p>The reality is that most PC users <i>never</i> upgrade their machine and buy a new one instead. The average age of a PC is about 5 years and no, aside from enthusiasts nobody buys the latest and greatest as soon as gets released.<p>Businesses in particular hold on to their assets for some years due to depreciation (which incidentally is 5 years for PC class devices).<p>So in 2000, the <i>average</i> PC was 1995-level hardware.')
