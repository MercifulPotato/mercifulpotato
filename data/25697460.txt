Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25698758, 25697555], score=None, time=1610169567, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25691957, text='&quot;I find it somewhat implausible that half the population is dumb, racist and all those other labels. &quot;<p>No - they aren&#x27;t.<p>The answer is very easy: <i>They believe Donald Trump</i>.<p>Trump has credibility in their minds, and when he repeats the lie, over and over - that &#x27;the election was stolen&#x27; - they believe it.<p>On election night - he literally came out and said &#x27;If you count the fake votes, Biden won&#x27; - declaring mass fraud, without any evidence.<p><i>His followers believe him</i>.<p>Contemplate the implications of that.<p>These people do not watch CNN, they watch Fox, OAN, Breitbart etc. where the falsehoods are propagated, or at least never debunked.<p>They are simply misinformed.<p>On CNN they were interviewing quite a number of protesters and unanimously &#x27;they believed the election was stolen&#x27;.<p>A close observer will have noticed that the court cases were thrown out, that Homeland Security and the DoJ cleared it etc. - but that truthful information is not passed on to people in the Trump Bubble.<p>Trump&#x27;s base don&#x27;t get their news from sources that will explicitly and clearly debunk the conspiracies.<p>It&#x27;s important to contemplate what this means: it&#x27;s almost entirely not a political divide - it&#x27;s mostly a divide based on what the facts are.<p>Consider the corollary: Trump won the election, but there was point-blank, irrefutable evidence that he rigged it. The DoJ, Homeland Security - everyone - points out his fraud.<p>Trump could merely deny the allegations, declare that he is &#x27;under attack&#x27; and rally people to his cause on Twitter and Facebook.<p><i>His followers would believe him</i>.<p>Meanwhile - how would you feel? Literally the election was stolen by Trump. Point-blank evidence.<p>Would you hit the streets in protest?<p>Would you &#x27;occupy DC&#x27;?<p>Millions would be enraged, we&#x27;d see protests like we&#x27;ve never seen before.<p>So just contemplate that a considerable number of Americans are completely misinformed and <i>deeply believe the election was stolen and that the Republic is being usurped</i>.<p>From that perspective, their actions seem more rational.<p>I&#x27;ve been watching the right-wing media carefully - and while Fox mostly doesn&#x27;t openly support Trump&#x27;s claims, they don&#x27;t spend a lot of time debunking, and they &#x27;go along with it&#x27; in a sneaky way by saying &#x27;Millions feel there was fraud and their voices must be heard&#x27; - essentially avoiding taking the position that Fox agrees there was fraud, but rather sympathizing with the angry masses who they darn well know are misinformed.<p>FYI it&#x27;s actually considerably easier to &#x27;cast doubt&#x27; on elections where there is always some small degree of fraud whereupon the tiniest case can be used as &#x27;evidence&#x27;.<p>This insurrection is not about racism or any of that (these things overlap obviously) it&#x27;s an election based on Fake News.<p>I know that HN is pretty serious about &#x27;Free Speech&#x27; - but folks - Twitter is Trump&#x27;s primary tool of misinformation - it&#x27;s his daily dose of koolaid and falsehoods to quite a few million who absolutely take his word for it.<p>And finally - the opposite is also true: these followers assume that CNN, NBC, NPR etc. are entirely made up of lies. Nothing on those channels has any credibility in their eyes.<p>This is a revolution based on Fake Information.')
