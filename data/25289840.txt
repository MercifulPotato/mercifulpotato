I think it&#x27;s far more common to just do DisplayPort on USB-C alternate mode, or for slightly more specialized screens, the USB-C ones with power delivery. Thunderbolt screens are really unusual in my experience.<p>It&#x27;s an understandable restriction if you already bought a Thunderbolt screen and need a new computer that&#x27;s compatible with it, but requiring Thunderbolt case I might get a screen that needs it later is <i>very</i> far down my priority list of computer features.')
