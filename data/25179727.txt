Inequalities of income and wealth have deepened since the 1940s and 1950s, and the social mobility that Conant saw as the remedy for a stratified society has not come about. The haves and have-nots have not been trading places from one generation to the next.<p>This is demonstrably untrue. First, the article’s use of a family making $200,000 is telling. If you look around that people who are billionaires today, most did come from upper middle class families, but not necessarily wealthy ones. Mark Zuckerberg’s parents are a psychiatrist and a dentist. Opening wide the class of the most elite to the children of upper middle class professionals is in fact a huge societal achievement. Few societies have that kind of mobility.<p>Another example is the economic mobility of Asians raised in the bottom 20% of income. These people lack both financial resources and social connections. But they have a 27% chance of ending up in the top 20% of income as adults. Test-based meritocracy like the SAT is a huge enabler of that.')
