There was a noticable difference: Firefox did have a noticable larger amount of users if read from the logs than from GA. If you think about it, it is not <i>that</i> strange either.<p>Similar: according to GA we had 0 people using Brave, Opera Mini or Icecat, yet the logs did show a (statistically insignificant) handfull of users using that.<p>So, while there is no <i>technical</i> reason why firefox <i>might</i> be underrepresented, there is a practical and explainable difference in some cases.<p>Edit: when I say &quot;noticable&quot;, I mean that it could be percieved, not that it orders of magnitude or even significan enough to matter for the business or our choices.')
