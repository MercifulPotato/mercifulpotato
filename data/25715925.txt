Govt really shouldn&#x27;t have a heavy influence on what is a family decision.<p>While I&#x27;m all for educating poor areas in order to increase quality of life... if one of the stated goals of that education is to reduce the number of that populations offspring, then there are some tough ethical questions about such a program that need to be answered.<p>And that&#x27;s before you even get into the &quot;targeted minority&quot; aspects.<p>And yes, I get that one easy way to &quot;improve quality of life&quot; is to have fewer kids (I personally disagree), and I get that educated couples often have fewer kids...<p>but if that&#x27;s where the bulk of the QoL bump is coming from... Then that&#x27;s just straight up population control going by an alias with better branding.')
