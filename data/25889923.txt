Widely used, now it&#x27;s know to be an endocrine disrupter, now that there&#x27;s a public outcry they&#x27;ve switched to some other undisclosed chemical that probably does the same thing (as a chemical analogue) or some other bad thing that will take 50 years to figure out.<p>It&#x27;s gonna keep happening until we flip the regulatory model on its head and require companies to <i>prove the chemicals they&#x27;re using are safe</i>, which will never happen, because god forbid we don&#x27;t let capitalism poison us all so we can have non-stick pans.<p>The weird thing is that this explosion of new chemical compounds has really only happened in the last 120 years or so.  It never used to be a given that we had to do things this way.')
