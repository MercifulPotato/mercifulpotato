I average about 30 sales per month including the holiday season and about $10&#x2F;order profit.<p>Dividend stocks currently pay around $50&#x2F;mo, which buys more stock every time (DRIP), so that should increase nicely over the next 30-40 years. I also buy more on a regular basis, but that does take some effort&#x2F;research on my part.<p>I’ll leave out stock, bond and mutual fund growth on its own since that’s not really income per se.<p>I’m also working on a YouTube channel that I just started last month. It doesn’t even have 10 subscribers but I do point people to product recommendations, which has already gotten me a $45 referral payout. Could be a fluke, but I’m in it for the long term, so we shall see.')
