Not cheap ($1000) but I think you can find similar options for half of that. I mostly wanted to try it but I am happy with it now. Important, I just use it for Chrome and VS Code, nothing else! Battery life is decent, you can run linux apps, it has touchscreen and is light. I personally don&#x27;t care about the screen now, I actually prefer small laptops to carry them and I have two 27&quot; screens on my desk<p>- I run the IDE on the laptop and lxc containers in the workstation for different projects')
