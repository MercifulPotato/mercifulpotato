Item(by='bb88', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607156833, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25310225, text='&gt;  My point is that I do not know whether this situation could have been handled better.<p>Let&#x27;s follow the timeline and discover a root cause:<p><pre><code>    1.  Anonymous feedback being given through HR about a \n        research paper in AI Ethics to be published in an \n        academic forum.\n\n    2.  Manager schedules a meeting where: â€œit has been \n        decided that you need to retract this paper by next week...&quot;\n        without context and without a chance to confront others.\n\n    3.  She puts an ultimatum to her boss that she can&#x27;t  \n        continue to work there with conditions like that limit her\n        freedom to speak and research.  Google decides to accept \n        her resignation.\n</code></pre>\nThis suggests that:<p><pre><code>    A.  People can just go to HR with criticisms of a research paper \n        apparently with the intent to sabotage authors, and HR is \n        apparently fine with being used like this.  Or possibly a manager\n        convinced HR that OKR&#x27;s trump AI Ethics.\n\n    B.  They wanted her to say certain things in an academic forum -- \n        which didn&#x27;t appear to be IP&#x2F;Trade Secret related, but for \n        some other reason, which they refused to disclose.  This is \n        in an environment of ethics where papers might become guidelines\n        for legislation.\n  \n    C.  They&#x27;re not interested in fixing the issues she brought up, \n        because they allowed #1 and #2 to happen above.\n</code></pre>\nIt looks like the root cause was A above.  Everything after that cascaded from there.<p>Should HR be involved in &quot;fixing&quot; a paper in AI ethics?  Probably not.  Just like you wouldn&#x27;t take your car to HR to get it repaired.  They simply don&#x27;t have the knowledge to do so.<p>Then Jeff Dean probably has $20 to $30 million wrapped up in Google, so he&#x27;s going to take their side on the matter publically, unfortunately.  Privately he may have been cussing out HR because of forcing him into the situation.  We don&#x27;t know.')
