Item(by='CarelessExpert', descendants=None, kids=[25202189], score=None, time=1606228168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25198407, text='&gt; Some of the most scientifically illiterate people I&#x27;ve encountered are the people who say things like, &quot;We listen to the science when it comes to COVID-19&quot;. Let us be perfectly real. When it comes to political decisions based on forecasts, you are not &quot;listening to science&quot;.<p>This feels like a straw man to me.<p>First, let&#x27;s be <i>very</i> clear:  There is absolutely a cohort of people out there who are objectively denying the scientific reality of covid.  Those denials ranges from the absurd (e.g. covid doesn&#x27;t exist, it&#x27;s a conspiracy, it&#x27;s going away), to the distorted (e.g. covid is no worse than the flu), to the simply wrong (e.g. masks don&#x27;t protect you, they actually make you sick).<p>I think the refrain &quot;we listen to the science when it comes to COVID-19&quot; is short hand for distinguishing oneself from folks in the groups above.<p>Let&#x27;s also be clear that statistics and modelling <i>are</i> scientific methods.  I&#x27;m frankly a little baffled that you&#x27;ve attempted to draw a line between these two things.  Science can <i>absolutely</i> help you assess questions like &quot;How long should we quarantine to minimize health impact, and maximize economic recovery?&quot;  Will the answers be probabilistic?  Yes, absolutely.  That doesn&#x27;t make them any less scientific, and to suggest they are suggests its own form of &quot;scientific illiteracy&quot;.<p>Further, &quot;the science&quot; is very clear: lockdowns are effective, masks help, social distancing helps, contact tracing helps, and so on.  &quot;The science&quot; is also clear that none of these are quick fixes or panaceas.  They&#x27;re all part of a web of interventions that each provide some small measure of protection that, taken together, can help keep the pandemic under control.  This is the &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; metaphor in action.<p>Science can also be used to assess the effectiveness of these methods versus their tradeoffs by, again, employing statistical approaches.  Are those methods foolproof?  No.  But they&#x27;re far from guesswork.  I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s this basic misunderstanding that leads people to, for example, dismiss climate modelling...<p>Now, ultimately, the <i>decision</i> as to what to do is a political one, not because statistical models and methods are flawed or inaccurate, but rather because there&#x27;s always going to be a range of trade-offs, and the trade-offs we make are ultimately a political decision.<p>But the least we can do is expect our politicians--not to mention the people around us--to assess those trade-offs based on rigorous facts and statistical methods.  That&#x27;s what &quot;listening to science&quot; means.')
