Item(by='smt88', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609190333, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25563124, text='I understand these abstract cases, because crypto enthusiasts bring them up in every conversation about &quot;dApps&quot; or whatever term they&#x27;re called now.<p>I&#x27;m looking for specifics, though. As a typical person, what problem do I have that these solve? And why is that problem large enough that I will go out of my way to find a dApp to solve it?<p>&gt; <i>There&#x27;s no place to say &quot;I did X&quot; with my item in a way every other app agrees happened, without relying on a central party, and this is really what Bitcoin solves.</i><p>That doesn&#x27;t prove that anything happened with X at all, though. It just proves that someone logged it to a blockchain as such. There is no actual evidence that it&#x27;s true, only that it&#x27;s being retold to you as it was originally told to the blockchain.<p>Worse, there&#x27;s no proof that any app is exclusively storing&#x2F;retrieving data on a blockchain. As a user, I&#x27;d need a second app to verify that the first app actually did what it claimed -- logged my data to a public chain.')
