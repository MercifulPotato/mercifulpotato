I&#x27;ve had friends I met at Google Mountain View move to Ann Arbor, Boulder, Toronto, Tel Aviv, Boston, Seattle, etc, usually to be close to family when they&#x27;re having kids.  You do get CoL-adjusted but 90% of SV salary is pretty typical.  Only restrictions are that you have to be a solid performer beforehand, and you have to find a team that&#x27;s either in that location or that&#x27;s willing to have you work remotely (many teams are happy to have remote workers, particularly ones who are high performers).<p>&gt; If Stripe IPOs - they could use that stock they earned for 2 years while working remotely to buy a house almost anywhere besides NY&#x2F;SF. (Effectively meaning they don&#x27;t need SF&#x2F;NY income anymore because they have paid the most expensive part of housing off)<p>That&#x27;s the case for most people who have worked for ~5-10 years at a Silicon Valley company.  When 2009 hit I had a bunch of coworkers who joked about buying up whole city blocks in Detroit and plopping down a Google office and an intentional-living commune there.  A lot of mid-career engineers at a FAANG could buy a house for cash in most parts of the U.S. and then have enough left over to retire, but choose not to because at that point they&#x27;ve put down roots in the Bay Area (and gotten addicted to the weather and culture).')
