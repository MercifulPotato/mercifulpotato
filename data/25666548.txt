Along this argument it sounds like Facebook is responsible because it&#x27;s big, lightly moderated, and easy to use -- none of which I find particularly egregious. (Should we expect every website to fail at least one of those three conditions?)<p>- I <i>think</i> that leaves the &quot;news feed algorithm&quot; argument. That the content (news, ads, friends&#x27; posts) you see is tailored for engagement. I think this argument is the one most commonly held. I disagree with it, but it&#x27;s the one I&#x27;m most partial to.<p>Are there other parts of social media that deserve the blame?')
