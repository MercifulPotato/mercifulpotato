He&#x27;s used all his power to try to falsely prove that the election was a fraud (while building up for it all summer), and failing miserably at it. He would definitely try any other viable means if could.<p>I don&#x27;t even know what his actual &quot;policies&quot; are (who actually knows, he just leans wherever the wind blows) but I&#x27;m hard-pressed to find a more ungenuine person (maybe because the ones beating him are actually not outright idiots).<p>My view has nothing to do with policy&#x2F;politics. The guy is just a fucking disaster - whatever text-to-speech puppet making public announcements would sound smarter and more knowledgeable.')
