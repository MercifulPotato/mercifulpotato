However, people can reliably prevent the problem from happening to themselves by not using Gmail. (If you want a recommendation for an e-mail provider, I can recommend Fastmail - I&#x27;ve been using them for years and they&#x27;ve been very reliable. They also have customer support. Their service is not free, however.)')
