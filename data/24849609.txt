I&#x27;m saying this claim is false:<p>&gt; The initial claim was that Facebook is currently acting to suppress one political view. This claim is false, based on that political view being the dominant view on Facebook.<p>I&#x27;m saying that both can be true at the same time, independently of each other. Try this example:<p>- Quadrant 8 of the city has the most incidents of graffiti<p>- The police spend the most time preventing graffiti in Quadrant 8 of the city<p>Both of those could be true independently of each other. Neither proves the other true or false. One could surmise that the reason police spend so much time preventing graffiti in that part of the city is because it has the highest rate of incidents of graffiti, just like maybe Facebook censors so many conservative news stories because they are so prevalent, but that is not necessarily the case.')
