They remove large old trees that are full of rot, dead wood, and parasites. Those old giants aren&#x27;t using the sun&#x27;s light and other resources efficiently, but they block too much light for smaller trees in the understory to grow tall enough to compete. A forest fire clears those out, returns the nutrients in them to the soil, and provides a level playing field for smaller trees to grow and compete.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t go full Fight Club Project Mayhem, but I&#x27;d love something like a cleansing fire that periodically breaks up or disbands all corporations above a certain size.')
