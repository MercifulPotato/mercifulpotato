You have doors A, B, A&#x27; &amp; B&#x27;. This of course assumes all doors are revealed simultaenously; i.e. no player gets to see the result of the other&#x27;s choice beforehand.<p>You don&#x27;t have probabilities &quot;behind doors&quot;, you have probabilities of &quot;chose right the first time&quot;. The probabilities of players #1 and #2 choosing right are clearly independent.<p>But don&#x27;t trust me: try it!')
