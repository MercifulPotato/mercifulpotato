Item(by='cbaines', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606429461, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25223008, text='&gt; I’ve seen Guix pop up a few times and I’m intrigued ... ostensibly a package manager but this article says it can work as an operating system in its own right. Can somebody explain this to me?<p>Guix as a package manager knows how to build software, and how to manage all the files. If you build the right software, plus a few more things with some files, then you end up with something that&#x27;ll boot.<p>One really neat thing about this is that this is set out in one Git repository, making it pretty easy to reason about.<p>&gt; Is this HURD? Or does it have a kernel? Is it some sort of hypervisor or application container? I always found HURD to be exciting in a sci-fi kind of way but from what I’ve heard this sounds like it’s actually something that could be practically useful. Where would I start? Does it make any sense running in VirtualBox let’s say?<p>Guix by default uses Linux-libre, but you can run it with the Hurd.<p>You can start by using Guix as a package manager, it&#x27;ll fit alongside your existing operating system (providing it&#x27;s something using Linux). There&#x27;s also a VM image you can download from the website if that&#x27;s of interest.')
