Prudery in my understand mostly refers to a person &#x27;being more uncomfortable than most with sexuality or nudity.&#x27;. Maybe it is used in a different sense here, but the Pippi book do not take any position on sexuality or nudity (like Disney in movies, parents are absent (father later joins in)).')
