Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=[25118999, 25118343], score=None, time=1605567611, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25117865, text='&gt;But a new kind of &quot;hotel&quot; that consists of one person running a handful to a couple dozen apartments.<p>The most important part of Airbnb is creating a hotel &quot;chain&quot; or &quot;brand&quot; without having to deal with things like zoning or licensing or insurance for hotels.<p>While Hilton&#x2F;Marriott&#x2F;IHG&#x2F;Hyatt&#x2F;Accor&#x2F;Choice&#x2F;Wyndham&#x2F;etc collect 10% to 20% in exchange for putting their brand on the line, Airbnb also was able to create a business where they can take 18% without putting their brand on the line, and keeping the ability to dump all the liability on the hosts.   However, I think this is a weakness for Airbnb long term, but they may be able to take advantage in the short term.<p>Quality control for real world products, especially volatile ones such as abodes rented night after night, are costly and I&#x27;m willing to pay a premium to make sure there are some double or triple checks going on.')
