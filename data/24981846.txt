I want my vim keybindings because even with prose, editing is a big part of writing, but I want sane formatting -- margins, soft line breaks at reasonable text width, that sort of thing. I have not been able to get my vim configuration to a satisfying place for this use case; it seems hopelessly tailored to the code editing use case. Does anybody have something that works really well for this for them?')
