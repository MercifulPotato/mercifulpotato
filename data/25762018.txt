Item(by='gitgud', descendants=None, kids=[25762238], score=None, time=1610546446, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25760943, text='Bots are good in moderation, but in some cases bots can annoy everyone involved...<p>For example; the Angular repository has a &quot;stale bot&quot;, which closes and locks the issue after a certain amount of time of inactivity.<p>This sounds great on the surface, however it&#x27;s insane in practice. The users constantly need to recreate duplicate issues, as the original issue is locked. Most of the duplicates are not linked, so maintainers can&#x27;t determine which issues are duplicates. And it also increases the friction of users notifying that the issue is still occurring.<p>Basically the result of &quot;stale bots&quot; is more duplicate issues and  less engagement on old issues (as they&#x27;re locked)<p>Moral of the story, use bots in moderation')
