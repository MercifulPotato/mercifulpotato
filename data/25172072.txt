Anyone can create wealth, but it&#x27;s not so simple to convince someone to give you money for it. A lot of value is generated and given away for free (Open source is perfect example. Other people might point to the work involved in raising children or running a home), and plenty of people manage to gain control of bootloads of money without providing any value (or even negative value).<p>A free market is an approximation of value at the best of times: at best it represents people&#x27;s estimation of that value given the information available to them. But in real societies it&#x27;s not even that good, it&#x27;s distorted by power differentials. One of the most significant being wealth disparities. In a hypothetical society where everyone had equal wealth then a market <i>does</i> distribute wealth to at those people who others think are providing value. But as soon as there&#x27;s a wealth disparity then people with more wealth have proportionally say over where money gets distributed and thus money accrues to what <i>those people</i> consider valuable. The greater the wealth disparities that exist the further away this gets from distributing money to those who truly create wealth.')
