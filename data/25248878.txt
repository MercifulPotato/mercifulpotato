He&#x27;s a still-enthused expert.<p>However, he didn&#x27;t seem as passionate on the second part, decision languages. It&#x27;s also a lot harder, yet is squeezed into even less time.<p>To help you assess my observation: I scored in the highest segment (IIRC 95%)... After taking the course, I would say I understand the regular expressions material fully, but not decision languages. I&#x27;m still confused about showing what complexity class something is in. e.g. the complexity class of determinng two polynomials are equivalent (PIT), like <i>x(1 + y) + y</i> and <i>x + (x + 1)y</i>.')
