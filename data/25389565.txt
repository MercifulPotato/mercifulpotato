Workers could be required to have some type of security clearance and each company could have its own building(s) to avoid &quot;mistakes&quot; at one company from effecting other companies people and worksites. OSHA rules could be relaxed to allow quicker development, as everyone working there will be well informed of the radiation risks. The former nuclear test site in Nevada would seem to be a great location for this.')
