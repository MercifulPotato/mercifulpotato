Many people point out that Twitter, Facebook, and other social networks have the same TOS violating content that Parler does but I wonder if this will come down to a &quot;reasonable attempt&quot; situation like Youtube copyright.<p>Youtube and later on Twitch got into trouble with the RIAA and other major media groups because Youtube allows users to upload copyrighted material. I believe the result of the lawsuit vs Viacom was that Google has to make a reasonable attempt to keep copyright material off Youtube which brought about the ContentID system.<p>Circling this back to Parler, Twitter and Facebook both have the same type of &quot;hate speech&quot; that Parler does that would violate Google&#x27;s, Apple&#x27;s, and AWS ToS but the difference is they can make the claim they make a &quot;reasonable attempt&quot; to keep those comments off while Parler does not.<p>There&#x27;s also the argument that now that the Democrats are in charge, the heads at FAANG is increasingly worried about regulation and getting broken up so it&#x27;s in their best interest to take a harder stance on this. I think the coming months will be very interesting.')
