The version in stable was 0.31 or so, while the version in snap and unstable&#x2F;sid is 1.11. The specific incompatibility I faced was for the CloudFlare DNS plugin, which added support for API Tokens that had granular permissions somewhere between the 0.23 version in stable and the current version of the plugin at 1.11. Current Certbot docs and CloudFlare docs both encourage you to use API tokens instead of account-wide API secrets and the previous install instructions for wildcard DNS support suggested installing the CloudFlare DNS plugin by default on the Certbot site.')
