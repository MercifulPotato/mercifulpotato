Animals can spend large amounts of time together doing nothing, and only have sex a few times a year. Also, most mammals have extremely short (by human standards) sexual acts, with little or no variation, and they often lose interest immediatelyaafter it&#x27;s over, possibly for a few months.<p>All of this to me suggests strongly that their sexual drive is extremely different from our own, for most mammals. My guess is that they probably only feel sexual desire at all during heat&#x2F;rutting, and that even then, it feels more like hunger to them than pleasure - something to be sated when it happens, not a pleasurable act to enjoy as often as possible. Of course, I&#x27;m not claiming this is some deep insight I&#x27;m privy to, just some speculation.')
