Item(by='sellyme', descendants=None, kids=[25491464], score=None, time=1608515090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25491135, text='&gt; Why punish Israel?<p>The whole &quot;assist[ing] in getting journalists arrested&#x2F;murdered&#x2F;dismembered&quot; thing still seems like pretty good justification to me. I&#x27;m not sure &quot;but everyone else is doing it!&quot; makes that acceptable. Requiring that we deal with every single one of those problems simultaneously else we shouldn&#x27;t bother with any of them doesn&#x27;t seem productive.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure I&#x27;d describe the refusal to actively fund that behaviour as punishment, but I suppose that&#x27;s somewhat beside the point.')
