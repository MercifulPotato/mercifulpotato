Especially as people move to options that are believed to have better user-privacy, the idea that they do not sell&#x2F;monetize collected user data today does not indicate what they will do tomorrow.<p>Unless users have strong evidence that companies are not collecting and&#x2F;or monetizing this information (which as the OP pointed out, there is for Signal as found in a subpoena), the &quot;billboard&quot; approach towards promising user privacy via marketing and PR is a shallow one at best for non-profits as well as for-profit companies.')
