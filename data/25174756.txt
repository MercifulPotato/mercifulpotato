Not just super rich that you hear about on the news, but tons of millionaires. The software salaries at FAANG are true, but basically every industry has a cream at the top that makes absurd money compared to what they would make in other countries. Doctors, dentists, lawyers, military contractors, salesmen, stock traders, fast food franchisees - every state in the US has a sizable pool of millionaires. And while the tax rates that someone making $800k salary vs. $80k salary aren’t hugely different, 37% of $800k is a hell of a lot more total than 30% of $80k. And that’s where the bulk of the taxes are made - not from the poor, or the middle class, or even the super rich that often game everything, but the upper middle class &#x2F; “normal” rich.')
