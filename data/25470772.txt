And then look at OpenCourseware for the syllabi. Of course you can look at other schools as well--though I don&#x27;t know of other resources as comprehensive as OpenCourseware. That should give you a fairly good idea of at least what MIT requires that you may not be familiar with.<p>MIT is probably also a good start if you an EE given that the degrees are in the same school vs. places where CS is closer to the Math department.')
