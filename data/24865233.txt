I&#x27;ve planned and deployed master setups in two separate 10^4 node count companies now.  In my experience the number of hosts doesn&#x27;t really matter (figuring out an architecture that will work with availability zones etc only takes a couple weeks).  The real work is figuring out how to normalize and govern the repos.  I haven&#x27;t seen any sane ansible repo once it&#x27;s beyond a few senior contributors because it&#x27;s so easy to do whatever you want.  Ansible is the ultimate small business tool, but it works very poorly in large companies.')
