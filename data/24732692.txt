Have the farmers ever even been to the same town as where the bomb was detonated? Were they there that day? Do they have any apparent motive? What&#x27;s their alibi? You still have to prove a criminal case beyond a reasonable doubt, so all the points you&#x27;re raising about alternative explanations for such searches are exactly the things the defense would raise, and why police don&#x27;t use this data collection as evidence, but to focus the search from 100,000 people to 1,000 people.<p>It&#x27;s probably worth thinking about it that way: absent this data, police have to assume everyone at the mall might be a suspect, so the pool is 100,000 potential bombers, not 1,000. What&#x27;s the success rate on guessing 1&#x2F;100000?')
