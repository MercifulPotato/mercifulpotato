(I speak for myself and not them, of course).<p>Sounds like Parler, fearing that their OTP provider might go down, decided to fail-open, ie: if the dependency throws an exception, presume there&#x27;s something wrong with the dependency and that the code provided is acceptable. It never occurred to them that the dependency could be down permanently, or that malicious actors[0] would be able to realize it and exploit to quickly.<p>Lesson learned: do not fail open where security matters, where authentication matters. Failing closed prevents new users&#x2F;customers from signing up, but it protects your existing users&#x2F;customers.<p>[0]From a security standpoint, these are malicious actors. I would also probably buy said malicious actors a beer if I met them, accompanied by a high five.<p>Edit: this is a hypothesis of course. Maybe the bug was somewhere else in the system- it could be in Twilio&#x27;s provided integration library where the fail-open occurred.')
