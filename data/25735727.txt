Item(by='jakewins', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610395786, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25729132, text='&gt; A naive observer, reading the reports of falling prices for photovoltaic cells and wind turbines, might conclude that the rising shares of solar and wind power will bring a new era of falling electricity prices.  Just the opposite has been true.<p>This is utter nonsense. The first sentence is about the <i>future</i> cost of power, and the argument is specifically about how the price is <i>changing</i> such that the future cost will be lower. The second sentence then argues that the <i>past</i> deployments have led to higher prices.<p>Even the most uninformed observer of global energy markets can pull up 2020 PPA auctions and see the staggering void that has emerged between bids from gas, coal and nuclear vendors vs bids from solar+storage and wind+storage.<p>As a random example, here is the draft plan Siemens is drawing up for my hometown, it includes PPA estimates for gas turbines, wind and solar+storage, current as of a few weeks ago. The recommendation from Siemens is to immediately stop all construction of anything other than solar+storage, a complete reversal from prior plans for my utility in bright-red Missouri.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1e8NCSh6VNJVpiUVyw5-XVCo-o1hojO6B&#x2F;view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1e8NCSh6VNJVpiUVyw5-XVCo-o1h...</a> (see page 7)')
