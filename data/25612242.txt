Imagine if you could program by rough drafting how your function works on paper. Like with arrows and all sorts of messy things connecting the structure of your code, but entirely understandable to another human what your function was to do without needing to understand a lick of code.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in a company where programs were originally written with Max&#x2F;MSP which is exactly that.\nIt was muuuch harder to decipher for other humans than normal C++ &amp; Javascript code.<p>Everyone I know using patcher tools end up switching to real programming after some years, and being much more happy like that.')
