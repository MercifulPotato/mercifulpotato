(For example: a &quot;Dark Forest&quot; scenario, where a hostile alien intelligence would destroy all life in Earth if we&#x27;re discovered, and therefore worldwide surveillance is required to prevent anyone emitting an interstellar signal.)<p>I never thought that terrorism was an existential threat that necessitated the Patriot Act or the GWOT, but one could imagine a scenario in which it was. What makes a worldwide epidemic so comparatively unique, is that it&#x27;s quantifiable, and imagining alternative scenarios involves a smooth probability distribution. Those against lockdowns: would you change your mind if the fatality rate or R-number was 10% higher? Those for: same question, 10% lower? 50%? 1000%?<p>Indeed, those making (specious) comparisons of COVID to flu season, have instead prompted me to wonder if we should have seasonal mask mandates to reduce flu deaths also. I&#x27;m a pretty fervent civil libertarian, with a healthy distrust of the state, but it&#x27;s not clear where that line should be drawn.')
