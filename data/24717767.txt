All you need is proof that you are great at programming, doesn&#x27;t have to know anyone or have any kind of prestigious background to do it.<p>That is what I did. I studied programming for a bit, started getting among the top in online programming competitions, applied to Google and got a really high salary. Anyone who is intelligent enough can do it if they have a computer with internet access.<p>People sometimes counter with something along the lines of:<p>&gt; Just because you could do it doesn&#x27;t mean others can do it, you are just an exception!<p>Yeah, exactly, other people are dumb so they can&#x27;t become among the best of the world in these competitions within a year. If they could they would easily get similar jobs as I did though, there was no luck or privilege in what I did just talent. So the problem isn&#x27;t that meritocracy doesn&#x27;t work but that merit for these tech jobs is so unevenly distributed.')
