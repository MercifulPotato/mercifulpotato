This has varying performance implications. Turbo will do repeat work server side and payloads will typically be bigger, however development may be simpler due  to lack of state and memory usage server side may be lower.<p>Turbo also has the possibility to gracefully degrade when js is not available (although I doubt this will be taken advantage of much in practice).')
