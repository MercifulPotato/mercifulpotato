Or trying to save time with clever prime genetation algorithms.  The safest way to generate primes is also the easiest, just generate random numbers of appropriate size until you get one that is prime. Its not blazing fast but it&#x27;s plenty usable.<p>Lots of security problems seem to stem from trying to be clever or optimize something that really doesn&#x27;t need optimization.')
