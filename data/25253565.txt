Item(by='jasode', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606743722, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25252575, text='<i>&gt;Founders have less work&#x2F;life balance than regular workers,</i><p>If you&#x27;re applying the <i>&quot;work&#x2F;life balance&quot;</i> to founders that are <i>doing what they prefer to do</i>, it means my previous comment didn&#x27;t do a good job explaining the flaw with that distorted lens.<p>Imagine a retired person spending all day in her garden... planting flowers, trimming hedges into pleasing shapes, etc.  When not outside in her garden, she&#x27;s still reading about gardening in magazines and surfing website discussion forums related to gardening.  When doing neither of those tasks, she still <i>thinks about gardening</i> while laying in bed and anticipates the tasks she wants to do the following day and the future plans for the next week&#x2F;month&#x2F;year.  The sum of all of her gardening effort adds up to more than 40+ hours per week.  However, most outsiders would not say the retired gardener is having a <i>&quot;work&#x2F;life balance&quot;</i> problem or that she&#x27;s a <i>&quot;workaholic&quot;</i>.  Instead, we give her a charitable label such as, <i>&quot;she&#x27;s enjoying life&quot;</i>.<p>For many startup founders, building the business is the &quot;garden&quot; or &quot;creative canvas&quot; to express themselves.<p>For others where the activities at the job are <i>not</i> the most fulfilling form of living, we then have to construct this mathematical ratio of &quot;work:life&quot; because the <i>work is undesirable</i> and it&#x27;s the <i>life that is desirable</i>. (E.g. sayings such as <i>&quot;work to live instead of live to work&quot;</i>  or <i>&quot;working for the weekend&quot;</i>.)  Therefore, &quot;work-vs-life balance&quot; is indirect code speak for &quot;undesirable-vs-desirable balance&quot;.<p>The founders that are doing what they truly want to do (even if it&#x27;s 60+ hours a week) don&#x27;t have this giant misalignment of desirable-vs-undesirable activity and therefore, the whole &quot;work&#x2F;life balance&quot; is meaningless to them.  Their work _is_ the passionate life.  You can&#x27;t apply &quot;work-life balance&quot; to Warren Buffett.  He&#x27;s been fascinated by business financial numbers since he was a little boy.  Thus, forcing Warren Buffett go on a whale watching expedition to fulfill our expectations of &quot;life&quot; in the work&#x2F;life balance equation is actually cruel torture to him.')
