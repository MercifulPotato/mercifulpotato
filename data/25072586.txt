If I steal a physical item from you, you no longer have that item.  If I download a copyrighted item that I never would have purchased, and you are entitled to royalties from then you lose nothing.  If I download 100 items and I otherwise would have bought 5% of them, then you lose 5% of it.<p>Note also that libraries work similarly.  I have checked out many hundreds of books out from the public library and read them.  That also cost authors money, but we do not equate that to stealing.  I have bought 100s of used CDs.  I saved a lot of money and the record companies and artists collected no money for that either.<p>I also object to the concept that a creator has any moral right to monopolize their creations.  There is no such moral right.  The US provides for granting such a monopoly for a limited time in order to encourage people to create things.  This has somehow morphed into the belief that someone creating something intangible has an indefinite monopoly on its use.<p>Such policy is actively harmful to the arts to the point of being detrimental to creators!  Disney&#x27;s <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> was a delightful film, if not a box office hit, but it would never had happened if the copyright laws (that Disney lobbied for!) we have today existed then, because Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet would still have been under copyright.')
