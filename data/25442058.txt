Then there&#x27;s the other kind that has enough money and uses it to amass power in domains outside of their core business. Think Koch brothers, George Soros, Rupert Murdoch. Think large donors and Super-PACs. Think politicians that, despite financial security, wield their power not for the masses but for the handful of people that will finance their next campaign instead. This is all enabled by money but going well past pure profit.<p>Even where only profit is concerned, there are downsides to concentrating the power in the 1%. Tax laws getting optimized for growth of capital over redistribution, loopholes large enough to allow for intergenerational dynasties over equal opportunity, copyright getting extended to a hundred years with free-use exceptions getting killed left and right.<p>I see your point and the likes of Gates (post-Microsoft) would make a positive difference. On the other hand, I&#x27;d prefer Joe Biden over Peter Thiel. It&#x27;s very much a case-by-case kind of thing.')
