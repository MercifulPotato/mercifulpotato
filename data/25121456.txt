(Not move them into management, promote them to your equivalent of senior engineer.)<p>I think this is controversial. If you have a software engineer being promoted to senior software engineer (1 -&gt; 2) without at least intermediate knowledge of the codebase, that&#x27;ll make other seniors suspicious&#x2F;wary.<p>Personally speaking, if you hire a <i>software engineer</i> that does mainly&#x2F;only glue work, you mis-hired. What you meant to hire was a technical project manager. Move that person to a TPM if they want to (and are great at what they do) instead of having a <i>senior software engineer</i> who hasn&#x27;t really shipped anything noteworthy.')
