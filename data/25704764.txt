They are deliberate political acts explicitly stated to have the goal of wiping out the police and local government authority - how is it possible an actual &quot;autonomous zone&quot; was created in a major US city? And how was that not insurrection? It sure looked like it from abroad, yet local leaders rolled over and even encouraged it.<p>Today I read the mayor of Portland was attacked whilst he was dining. The &quot;mostly peaceful protesters&quot; have burned his apartment building, attempted to take over police stations and court houses, and decapitated models of the mayor. He supports them anyway - it&#x27;s so crazy it&#x27;s impossible to believe, really. What is going on in the USA?<p>If FB&#x2F;Twitter had cracked down on the BLM organisers putting together nightly attacks on the police, at least nobody could say they were being inconsistent now. Instead they put banners up on random developer docs sites saying they support BLM. Blatant double standards.')
