While there may be <i>some</i> hard-won progress in the &quot;right to repair&quot; fights recently, the needs of hobbyist electronics people aren&#x27;t on any politician&#x27;s radar and I doubt that will change soon (even if easier access to high quality electronics could unleash so much potential for innovation!).<p>Market pressure is out of the question too, simply because the volumes that us hobbyists order are too small. For what it&#x27;s worth I&#x27;d pay a couple hundred bucks for an 1:1 q&amp;a&#x2F;consulting session with an expert from a semiconductor or other company for my hobby projects and I&#x27;d also accept a reasonable &quot;small volume handling&#x2F;shipping fee&quot; for getting my hands on ten chips... but I&#x27;m the utter minority of hobbyists who can actually afford that for a project that won&#x27;t bring any profit. Corporate entities however who are going to sell thousands or orders of magnitude more units of some random gizmo can afford putting up six figures upfront anyway... so they have no incentive either to pressure vendors into providing better service.')
