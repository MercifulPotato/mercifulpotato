Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=[25177594], score=None, time=1606052694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25176398, text='&gt; <i>she says the files are stored in real clouds</i><p>I have fond memories of a visit to a children’s hostel in Hyderabad, India in 2006, and a rote answer they were taught in their textbooks:<p>“Why is a computer called a number cruncher?”<p>“A computer is called a number cruncher because it crunches numbers with its teeth.”<p>Dad took the children to the office where there was a computer and showed them that it had no teeth.<p>I’m glad to say that the children don’t go to that school any more, and that I haven’t found such egregious errors in textbooks for <i>any</i> subject more recently (I’m over there again at present), and there is less rote in their education than there was, though still more than is ideal as it’s hard when the teachers and students are all used to that method.')
