Learn kids critical thinking, rather than raise another obedient generation who doesn&#x27;t think for themselves and picks up a narrative from some place and then just sticks with it. Learning more soft skills at school (at which most teachers suck, but that&#x27;s another topic), psychology, why people behave as they do, biases, how our childhood affects us all etc. I think generally our schooling systems globally need big rehaul, but for topic discussed, I can&#x27;t imagine what I mention it wouldn&#x27;t bring some improvement.<p>Teaching with current level of science as hard baseline is already a place where some western countries like US fail (ie evolution vs creationism topic).<p>I don&#x27;t think the change I mention is in direct interest of many governments, so its more like a pipe dream and an additional burden on parents to drill this into their kids.')
