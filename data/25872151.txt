A lot of them have variations\nof one click installs of various kinds.<p>You pay the monthly fee and do not have to know about \nLinux, PHP or MySql.<p>If you are familiar with PHP, MySql finding\na place to host it is still really cheap and available.<p>A common argument would be that you can get a VPS for $5\nmaybe even less.   Then you have to know about what\na database is, what version of PHP, when to do upgrades \nof all of them.   Managed VPS solutions are usually fairly\npricy.<p>With the new version of ownCloud, based on Go and micrnosercivices the barrier of entry is much higher.<p>The best bet will be to buy managed nextCloud hosting from\nsomeone.<p>While PHP is often scoffed at, the ecosystem that is ready\nand waiting to help host it for each is amazing.\nIt enables a lot more people to be able to get involved and \nget inspired and maybe learn more and get start contributing.<p>If you are writing software that needs hosting but want as many people as possible to be able to use it then PHP is still the best bet, even if not the sexy bet')
