Item(by='pedalpete', descendants=None, kids=[25181712], score=None, time=1606079757, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25178383, text='I just bought a Boox Nova 3 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boox.com&#x2F;nova3&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boox.com&#x2F;nova3&#x2F;</a> after having a Boox Note Air which arrived with a cracked screen. I LOVE my kindle, but wanted to be able to take notes as well, and I don&#x27;t want the glare from an iPad screen.<p>Honestly, if somebody made an e-ink cover for an iPad that would turn off the main LCD screen, I&#x27;d have probably gone for that. I was considering making one myself, but I&#x27;ve got too many projects on the go already.<p>If I could take notes on a kindle (which I&#x27;m sure is coming soon), I&#x27;d do that in a second!')
