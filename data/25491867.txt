But I don&#x27;t see him present any evidence.  He starts by hand-waving away people who believe the opposite of what he believes, and then just basically says &quot;only about 1000 people in total are killed by cops in the US every year, so this is a non-problem&quot;.  Which... no, sorry, that&#x27;s not how it works.  And the thing he links to literally has a section heading titled &quot;Black Americans are killed at a much higher rate than White Americans&quot;.<p>... and then he goes on for many paragraphs about several police shootings of black men, and how awful and unjustified they are, so... he seems to agree after all that this is a problem?  Finally, he tries to muddy the waters by essentially claiming black people seem to &quot;deserve it&quot; more, because apparently black people are involved in more crime than white people?  Which, again, doesn&#x27;t seem to be very well supported by data.<p>So... I don&#x27;t really get why you&#x27;re using this link to try to refute what I said, because it does not do that, at least not in a logically consistent, evidence-based manner.<p>&gt; <i>But your claims arenâ€™t back by data either.</i><p>I believe they are.  Let&#x27;s look at some actual data that we can easily read, rather than attempting to extract something useful from a meandering 15,000 word podcast transcript that rambles on forever.<p>This[0] shows that out of all US police shooting deaths from 2107 through now, 27% were of black people, and 49% were of white people.  But black people only make up only 13% of the US population, while white people make up 60%, so that sounds pretty disproportionate against black people to me.<p>But this data is only for <i>shooting</i> deaths; likely someone like George Floyd, for example, wouldn&#x27;t be counted in that data as he wasn&#x27;t shot.<p>So let&#x27;s take a look at this study[1] from last year (reported on here[2]) that suggests blacks are 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than whites.<p>I could go on, but I&#x27;ll let you educate yourself further if you&#x27;re so inclined; &quot;police killings statistics by race&quot; is the search I used.<p>&gt; <i>people echoing talking points completely divorced from the data, as you have done.</i><p>I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done; Harris&#x27; own views seem completely divorced even from what little data he presents, if one can be expected to actually find data in that nightmare of a transcript.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;585152&#x2F;people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-race&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;585152&#x2F;people-shot-to-de...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;116&#x2F;34&#x2F;16793" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;116&#x2F;34&#x2F;16793</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019-08-06&#x2F;race-and-police-shootings-what-new-research-says" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019-08-06&#x2F;race-and-...</a>')
