Item(by='smcl', descendants=None, kids=[25505074], score=None, time=1608627659, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25503979, text='I&#x27;m a bit relieved that it&#x27;s not just me and that you&#x27;ve described nearly to a T some of the more annoying ongoing things - missing glaring errors and omissions in emails&#x2F;text (or just leaving completely unfinished sentences that I started and told myself &quot;I&#x27;ll get back to this one after the next bit&quot;) is painful and I&#x27;ve also found that I&#x27;ve kept a LOT of notes and manage a lot of my time through bullet-pointed TODO lists.<p>You&#x27;re right that this is anecdotal and as the saying goes the plural of anecdote is not data ... but in my case the change was pretty stark - I was ok, then I was ill, then I recovered and was no longer ill but I felt like my brain was half-asleep most of the time. It sounds like you were the same.<p>One <i>possible</i> thing is that I&#x27;ve in the past felt a bit mentally dull during times where I haven&#x27;t done much intensive physical activity. And obviously with gyms being closed and amateur sport cancelled I&#x27;ve only really been able to go for hikes which isn&#x27;t quite the same. So my one remaining hope is that things snap back into place a bit once this is over - but who knows.<p>In any case I hope for both our sakes we can figure out what&#x27;s going on and how it can be alleviated (if not fixed entirely)')
