You look at the person and you see if they&#x27;ve changed for the better.<p>I would much rather hire someone who grew up poor and fell in with gangs and felt pressured to join in an armed robbery 10 years ago and understands that it&#x27;s wrong than someone who had a demonstrated bias against some minority 10 years ago and still does today. This isn&#x27;t about whether they&#x27;re a &quot;good person&quot; or anything, this is a mercenary calculation based on business value. I don&#x27;t expect the former gang member is going to engage in similar violent crimes if I employ them. I <i>do</i> expect the biased person is going to have trouble working productively with people in my company who are part of that minority or is going to negatively impact those folks&#x27; productivity.<p>I&#x27;m not in the business of determining the magnitude of your moral transgressions. That stays in the confessional. I&#x27;m in the business of hiring folks who will deliver business value.')
