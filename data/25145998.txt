I’ve been using it since early on and bought tailwind UI the instant it came out. I love it.<p>But now that’s it’s super popular I can’t help but wish it was still a quite little secret. Every other product hunt or show hn seems to be using tailwind with all the default configurations so they all have the tailwind look, just as every new startup used to have the bootstrap look.<p>And there are so many tailwind UI knockoffs and tailwind tutorials out there it is insane.<p>I’m super happy for Adam and all the success he and the team are having. Tailwind is a truly great library and now ecosystem.')
