Moving to a city and then asking your neighbors to be quiet is like moving next to a farm and then asking them to stop making smells. There is much more quiet real estate in America than noisy real estate — don’t go to New York City and then ask your neighbors to tread lightly after 8pm on weekends because your baby is sleeping.<p>Thankfully despite your opinion New York does a good job of putting these noise complainers in their place. Unless the noise is beyond the pale or at hours between 10pm and 7am, complainers are told to GTFO most of the time. Somehow the city still remains a highly sought after place to live, half of it because all the whiners who need silence for realigning their chakras have decamped to Hastings-on-Hudson.')
