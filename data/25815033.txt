The far more interesting question is what to do about it. The OP has some suggestions, but I have some more radical ones:<p>- put carbon taxes on BTC&#x2F;fiat exchanges<p>- outlaw mining<p>- outlaw BTC transactions<p>- put economic pressure on other countries to do the same<p>Basically, there is no benefit to the world that cannot be done with far more energy-efficient means, e.g centralized currency or proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies.
