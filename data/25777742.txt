It is much much more than that.<p>What are they doing that makes them so much more? Are they really that different than Toyota,GM,Ford,VW? I&#x27;m sure they have some differences but at the end of the day there is no wide moat that any of these other manufacturers can&#x27;t cross.<p>They all make vehicles and Tesla certainly got a jump on the others with EV&#x27;s. With that said, I hope they keep innovating and are super successful and drag the rest of the Industry forward.')
