Long history of significant contributions to projects that are household names at major tech companies, I know my stuff, and I can talk a pretty good game if do I say so myself.  I am also so utterly burnt out that I can barely put two lines of code together.  Your system would fail to avoid hiring me.<p>Always do the coding test.  Even the FAANGs have hiring mistakes, people who get locked in a niche and let their skills rust, and just plain burnouts that you don&#x27;t want joining your company.')
