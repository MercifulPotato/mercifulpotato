Though if we did have 1000 plants it would make a lot of sense haha.<p>But besides that there is always waste. The key part is understanding what level of waste. There&#x27;s a fair amount of low level waste (low radiation levels). In fact, this is like 90% of total waste (even more if you count my volume). But this type of waste is not the kind people are typically concerned with because it isn&#x27;t radioactive for long nor is it producing dangerous levels. These types are not really recyclable though (concrete, steel beams, etc).<p>I do suggest reading up on our own AcidburnNSA&#x27;s post about waste[0]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatisnuclear.com&#x2F;waste.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatisnuclear.com&#x2F;waste.html</a>')
