I am not asking about &quot;how to install apt package&quot;, but how to provide a universal recipe to provide 3rd-party software as handy installation script. What you suggest is how to download and install few debs from a website. When I writing such script, I don&#x27;t trust the host name &quot;just like that&quot; as you suggest. It can be malformed or point totally to different host that we would expect.')
