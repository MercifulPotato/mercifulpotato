Item(by='jelliclesfarm', descendants=None, kids=[25009286], score=None, time=1604680327, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25007763, text='Definition of homelessness in California: \nCalifornia defines homelessness if you come out of an institution(jail in this case..but also includes substance abuse rehab, mental institution etc) after a 90 day stay and don’t have a place to stay. If you don’t have a utility bill in your name, then you can be called homeless.<p>Because he was in jail twice consecutively and was out on bail, if he could claim mental disability he doesn’t have to go back. But if he can claim mental disability and homelessness..citing them as a reason not to work, he could get benefits for life.<p>He skipped something legal and was at risk for going back to jail. So he just claimed that he was sleeping on the streets and didn’t have an address.<p>Look..he was really smart. At that point, I really wanted to help him and I can even appreciate some lateral thinking for problem solving. I didn’t mind that he was using a break to get back on his feet. If someone says they are mentally disabled, I am going to believe them and not question it.<p>But he was doing things that made me feel unsafe because he was setting up the stage for me vouching for his mental instability if I were questioned. Like fire. He would get the blow torch for everything..wasp, weeds, gophers. I have worked previously with the homeless and previously incarcerated. And the most harrowing, addicts. With the former, it’s easy to integrate them back into society. A lot of times you know when you are being lied to and that’s ok too.<p>But our loopholes are so gaping in CA that people who need help are not getting the right kind of help. And it’s nuts to keep doing the same thing again and again ..and keep expecting the same results. And just throwing more money at it is not doing it differently.  A lot of organizations, non profits and sub contractors who win bids are making more money than what actually goes to the homeless people. Homelessness alleviation is an industry of its own. Without the homeless, there would be a lot of jobs that do homelessness outreach. Which by itself could be a way to prevent future homelessness. But that’s just creating jobs to give people money..those needing other kinds of help are not getting it. Because at the end of the day, money doesn’t solve the problem entirely.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.provost.usc.edu&#x2F;initiatives&#x2F;wicked-problems&#x2F;homelessness&#x2F;definition-of-homelessness&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.provost.usc.edu&#x2F;initiatives&#x2F;wicked-problems&#x2F;home...</a>')
