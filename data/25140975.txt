For instance, Apple charges the same for a MacBook Pro delivered to Iowa as San Francisco, so if your Iowa rate is half that of San Francisco&#x27;s, that new laptop takes you twice as many hours to buy. And for what? Also, someone&#x27;s student loans don&#x27;t change when they move from a more expensive place to a cheaper one, so in absolute terms anyone making fixed payment stands to take a massive pay cut if they move to a place with COL-based salary changes.<p>My company is remote-only for now. Without asking them, I have no idea whether my coworkers are in Berkeley or Des Moines. Why should the one living in a cheaper please make less than the one next door? Yes, I completely understand why an employer would <i>like</i> to pay less salary to the latter, but I can&#x27;t think of any defensible reason that would make the person in Iowa OK with this.')
