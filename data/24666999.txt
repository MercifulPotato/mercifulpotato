Is it something like:<p>- User configures an ordering key<p>- Application sends a message w&#x2F; ordering key &quot;4&quot;<p>- Pub&#x2F;Sub gets message w&#x2F; ordering key &quot;4&quot;<p>- Pub&#x2F;Sub buffers &quot;4&quot; until it gets a message &gt; &quot;4&quot;<p>- Application sends a message w&#x2F; ordering key &quot;13&quot;<p>- Pub&#x2F;Sub sends &quot;4&quot;<p>- Pub&#x2F;Sub buffers &quot;13&quot; until it gets a message &gt; &quot;13&quot;<p>I just thought that the lack of order was in inherent tension with performance because you need a buffer to order things. Am I wrong about that (probably)?')
