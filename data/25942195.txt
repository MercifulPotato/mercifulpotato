Not yet, at least.<p>Furthermore, this comment is offensive. Let&#x27;s please not pretend that Facebook and Twitter were &quot;looking for an excuse&quot; before deplatforming Trump. They were entirely justified and would have been justified in doing so many years before they eventually did so.<p>Let&#x27;s also not put the word &quot;incite&quot; in dick quotes barely three weeks after an insurrection and attempted coup. There was <i>actual</i> incitement of violence in that case.')
