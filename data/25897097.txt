If you did it unconvincingly you would be struck down.<p>This seemed to be a widely held worldview and therefore more or less the social reality in the non software parts of the business. I was free to do &#x27;honest talk&#x27; because as a software person, I was clearly to the side of the game, it wasn&#x27;t really possible for me to fall or climb too far.')
