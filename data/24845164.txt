I was a happy customer and would recommend them to almost anyone, up until a few minutes ago.<p>There was always a nagging voice in the back of my head - &quot;their backup encryption can&#x27;t possibly be good&quot; - but I wanted to believe it since their deal is so good, in terms of storage per dollar, and it&#x27;s hard for me to afford otherwise right now. I did a bit of digging not too far back and their help pages go into a small amount of detail but ultimately just say &quot;trust us&quot;. I trusted them to throw away my encryption password after a session, which is terrible, of course. After reading all of your work, I cannot even countenance trusting them anymore.<p>Ironically the first thing that comes to my mind for offsite backup is Backblaze B2... if you do all the encryption before it leaves your machine, then it doesn&#x27;t matter what they do, and their storage is cheap. Rclone or similar means that their client software need not be trusted. It&#x27;s up to whether you tolerate their business practices.<p>You mentioned in another comment that you are still looking for cloud backup software which ticks all the boxes - why did you not go with Rclone? On the surface it looks great but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.')
