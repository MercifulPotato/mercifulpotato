That is a valid lament.<p>But, this is the definition (or at least a very common result) of innovation&#x2F;progress.<p>Tech&#x2F;automation advances to the point that non-artists, non-experts can do a thing competently or even expertly. Photography use to require expensive equipment, skill, and knowledge. Modern advances in digital sensors&#x2F;lenses&#x2F;flashes&#x2F;post-processing makes everyone able to take professional quality photos. There is, of course still masters and talented artists that surpass. But the floor for everyone has been brought up to expert level at least.<p>Same for film&#x2F;video, driving, complex maths, and many more.')
