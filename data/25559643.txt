But the statement is factually correct.<p>It assumes that everyone is lazying around basically.<p>Because of people are not lazying around, no, you can not just work twice as hard. Because you are already working hard, exactly as your competitors do. No people can&#x27;t double their hard work every time they are treated unfairly. Not if they were actually working in the first place.<p>That goes for ageism, sexism, racism, whatever-ism we talk about.')
