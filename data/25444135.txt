Also, if “Linux kills hardware” do you really think the cloud providers like AWS would be running Linux on all of their hardware? The only hardware failures I’ve ever had to deal with were when running Windows.<p>Sounds like you have a computer repair guy who doesn’t know anything about Linux and is bullshitting you.<p>I also don’t understand how your installation process was painful. Installing Ubuntu or Manjaro (the two I’ve installed most recently and most frequently over the past few years) is simply a few clicks for me and everything’s done. It really wasn’t any harder than the last time I installed OSX or windows.')
