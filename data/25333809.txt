Look, unless you do css as your primary skill or really passionate about the more visual side of things (the &quot;front of the frontend&quot;) then you don?t magically have the skills to use all kind of css layout te hniques to do precise and elegant UI, given the sketch &#x2F; figma files. Heck most JS devs I’ve worked with barely understand how flex works. Best scenario they make somthing <i>close</i> to provided design, but not quite ... and crucially the finishing touches , the consistency , understanding of design principles that inform every layout you make is missing, so the end result is never quit3 what the designer provided with all kind of small but noticable imperfections like incorrect font sizes, une en spaces, missing white spaces, inconsistent vertical rhythm, relative sizes between icons and text etc etc.<p>Yes, tailwind is good. As a standard utility framework it?s awesome but please stop prentending it turns JS devs magically into css&#x2F;html experts.')
