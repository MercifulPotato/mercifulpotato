Item(by='simonh', descendants=None, kids=[24856018, 24857001], score=None, time=1603354060, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24855257, text='I don&#x27;t really mind the Epstein Drive and really appreciate the effort to portray a decent stab at realism. It&#x27;s very refreshing.<p>The one thing that bugs me a bit is the way they conceptually represent the solar system in the show. If you follow the way the situation is represented you essentially have Earth on one side of the solar system, Mars in the middle and the asteroid field on the other side. That seems to be how the strategic situation is presented. To get from the asteroid field you essentially have to go past Mars, which is closer to the asteroids. If you think about the actual layout of the solar system this makes no sense, in reality Earth is about in the middle and any given asteroid is closer to the Earth at any given time than it is to half the rest of the belt.<p>Again, it&#x27;s fine. There&#x27;s no way to capture the real dynamics of the solar system in the story without hopelessly bogging everything down, and for the purposes of the show the simplified model works fine. I suppose you could argue that during the period of the show by chance most of the main asteroids and Mars happen to be lined up on roughly the same side of the solar system as Jupiter, and then it basically works. It&#x27;s just a bit of a fudge.')
