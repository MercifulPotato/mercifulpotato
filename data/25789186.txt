I can&#x27;t imagine a day when it will be cheaper to use this tech than to just let the eggs hatch and throw the males in the grinder.<p>As another user alluded to, the &quot;layers&quot; (egg-laying hens) also have a productivity drop very early in their possible lifespans, and are then killed as well.<p>There are no industrial egg production facilities which feed and give chickens and roosters a place to live out the natural duration of their lives in humane conditions (not cramped in battery cages where they frequently die of infection from pecking each other to death). I did the calculation a while back and found that doing so would result in eggs that cost over $10 <i>each</i>. The reason eggs are so cheap is because male chicks and hens that have passed their productive years are killed, and while alive, the layers are confined to an neverending nightmare of cramped conditions.')
