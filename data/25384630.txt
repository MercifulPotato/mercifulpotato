Keystore uses an HSM if available. Decrypting FDE and having root gets you nowhere if the keys are in an HSM.<p>The only way to secrets on a device with an HSM is to get past FDE, get root, and disable the HSM BEFORE the keys are created&#x2F;stored.<p>Disabling the HSM after the keys have been stored simply wipes the keys and makes them unrecoverable forever.')
