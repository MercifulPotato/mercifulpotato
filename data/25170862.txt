Most of this related to their Bootstrapping Remote Secure Keys Infrastructure (BRSKI) work[2]. I&#x27;ll let BRSKI descibe itself in it&#x27;s own words, with the start of their abstract:<p>&gt; This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic  Control Plane.  To do this a Secure Key Infrastructure is bootstrapped.  This is done using manufacturer-installed X.509 certificates, in combination with a manufacturer&#x27;s authorizing service, both online and offline.  We call this process the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol. Bootstrapping a new device can occur using a routable address and a cloud service, or using only link-local connectivity, or on limited&#x2F; disconnected networks.<p>The BRSKI document does quite an robust imo job outlaying the environments &amp; challenges &amp; constraints folks like OpenWRT face in trying to set up devices.<p>BRSKI presents a specific approach, which no, does not immediately seem super useful&#x2F;simple enough for openwrt. A devices (Pledge) contact a Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA) Service. The MASA returns a Voucher that points it to a Join Registrar (&amp; Coordinator), which the device uses for Enrollmemt to the domain &amp; Imprinting of the Domain&#x27;s material &amp; exchange of Local Identity. The standard also includes ways for the MASA to collect Domain information (so you can register your registrar) and to provide optional Ownership Tracking of devices.<p>Openwrt could become a MASA, users could host Join Registrar&#x27;s for their Domains, &amp; nodes could securely go get the root trust key they ought to from that Join Registrar. Since the Domain generated that key, if the device were to present it&#x27;s https interface with that key or one derived from it, HTTPS ought work.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;group&#x2F;anima&#x2F;documents&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;group&#x2F;anima&#x2F;documents&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;draft-ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;draft-ietf-anima-bootstrapp...</a>')
