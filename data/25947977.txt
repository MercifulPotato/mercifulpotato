Plus, it&#x27;s the other way around, interest rates cause more inflation (how else is the government going to pay its debts?). It&#x27;s a cyclic phenomenon. Without interest, inflation would be a much less problem.<p>Secondly, freeing currencies from gold is another mistake because it allows the government to devalue its currency at will, we&#x27;ve see the chaos that comes out of it. Hopefully bitcoin and gang will fix that mistake, but we&#x27;re already seeing the big banks not liking it because it will take away their power to control the people.<p>&gt;  We found that the Great Moderation promoted speculation in real estate, causing the GFC,<p>Which would have never happened if we were following proper economic laws which we&#x27;ve literally known about for over 1400 years. Mortages and selling debt for debt are both prohibited Islamically. We already know it&#x27;s wrong, yet people keep engaging it it because a few rich and powerful will benefit at the expense of everyone else.<p>The solution is to go back to a sound economic system, not to anticipate the next crash because it&#x27;s built in to how the modern system works.')
