The concept of &quot;gaming the system&quot; is extremely frowned upon, and everyone should strive to be the morally best person they can be.<p>But if you&#x27;re financially or materialistically motivated, there are some drawbacks with this, though.<p>- Higher taxes<p>- More compressed wages (an Engineer with a Master&#x27;s Degree will for example &quot;only&quot; earn around 1.5-3 times what low-skill minimum wage workers earn - compared to other countries where this multiple could be 5-10)<p>- A bit less entrepreneurial spirit<p>With that said, I enjoy living here. Life is comfortable, and there&#x27;s no endless pursuit of getting richer, just for the sake of becoming rich. Retirement is not the be-all and end-all goal of life here.')
