I am going through a phase of listening to audiobooks on this topic. I can recommend both &quot;Other Minds&quot; by Peter Godfrey-Smith and &quot;The Genius of Birds&quot; by Jennifer Ackerman if you want good audiobooks that give a whirlwind tour through animal intelligence research into cephalopods and birds, respectively.')
