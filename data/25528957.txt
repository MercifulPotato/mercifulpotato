Of course there are stupid people, almost regardless of the definition of stupidity. Not enough to explain the outcome, though.<p>Stupid != ignorant<p>Many folks who don&#x27;t know math often have a significant level of skill in other areas.<p>There are many folks who just didn&#x27;t bother to learn math, and either just regurgitated the material to pass tests and promptly forgot it, or flat out cheated.<p>It&#x27;s sad, as math is <i>extremely</i> useful in many situations.  I&#x27;m not even talking about algebra, trig or calculus.  Just basic arithmetic, fractions and exponents.<p>Algebra <i>can</i> also be quite useful in everyday life too, and not just WRT numerical problems.<p>Algebra uses clearly defined rules to perform operations.  If you can master that, more general problem solving becomes <i>much</i> easier.<p>That many people don&#x27;t have such skills is sad.  But our education system seems to favor moving people up and out rather than ensuring competency in the elements of the curriculum.  And more&#x27;s the pity.')
