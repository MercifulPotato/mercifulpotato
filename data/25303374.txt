On a CO2 per mile bases cars emit less than non-vegan humans, because it takes a lot of energy to grow food. If you put 2 people in the car it&#x27;s not even close.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carboncommentary.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;22&#x2F;walking-can-be-more-carbon-intensive-than-driving" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carboncommentary.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;22&#x2F;walking-can...</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.mit.edu&#x2F;2.813&#x2F;www&#x2F;readings&#x2F;DrivingVsWalking.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.mit.edu&#x2F;2.813&#x2F;www&#x2F;readings&#x2F;DrivingVsWalking.pdf</a><p>&gt; but after it takes place everyone agrees things are much much better with less cars and no one wants to go back.<p>Speak for yourself.

What ends up happening is the city and the surrounding area mentally split into two, and they fight politically.')
