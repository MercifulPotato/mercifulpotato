Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609649238, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25619140, text='If you can find me a new EV for â‚¬6k that goes up to 90km&#x2F;h with 150km range (any weather, reliably, and for at least ~5 years), please let me know I&#x27;ll come pick it up today and pay cash.<p>Last I checked, everything is north of twice that amount unless you omit the battery. I&#x27;d be willing to pay more for something amazing like an Aptera, though not super much because I&#x27;d simply not get enough use out of it: it won&#x27;t ever beat taking mass transport to work, also because on mass transport I can relax before&#x2F;after work instead of driving, so it will only ever be for weekend trips to my (girlfriend&#x27;s) parents, grocery trips, etc. That&#x27;s also why 45km&#x2F;h electric cars or scooters are not worth it, they&#x27;d just replace local trips which I mostly do by bus anyway.<p>I&#x27;d also be happy with second-hand, but I have no idea about maintenance costs as I never owned any vehicle other than bikes. (I do have a driver&#x27;s license and regular driving experience, it&#x27;s just that I borrow what I&#x27;m driving.)')
