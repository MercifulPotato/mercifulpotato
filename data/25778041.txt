I worked on the Itanium (Madison and McKinley), and the VLIW architecture was brilliant. This was during the time of the Power4 and the DEC ALPHA, two non-x86 competing architectures that were dominating the &quot;Workstation&quot; market (remember that term?). It looked like the server world was going to have three architectural options (Sun was dying, and Motorola&#x27;s 68000 line wasn&#x27;t up to the task.)<p>Microsoft even had a version of NT3.5 for The Itanic. It seemed we were just about to achieve critical mass in the server world to switch to a new architecture with huge address space, ECC up the wazoo and massive integer performance.<p>Then the PC revolution took off with Win95, and the second war with AMD happened (and NexGen sorta). This couldn&#x27;t be solved with legal battles. This put all hands on deck because there was SO much money to be made with x86 compatibility. The presence of x86 &quot;up and down&quot; AMD &amp; Intel&#x27;s roadmap took over the server market as well: it was x86 all over the place.<p>And that, chil&#x27;ren, is why x86 was reborn in the 90&#x27;s just as it was close to being wiped out.<p>Now Apple has proven you can you seamless sneak in a brand-new architecture, get hyooj gainz, and we are none the wiser. This is fantastic news. I think we are truly on the cusp of x86 losing its dominance in the consumer space after almost 35 years of dominance.')
