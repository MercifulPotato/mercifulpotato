There&#x27;s a tendency in my circles to talk about temperate forests (with fungally dominated soils) as if they&#x27;re the most important. It&#x27;s what we see, and it&#x27;s what most 1st world people who need to hear about environmental policy see, and it&#x27;s where the most space for improvement exists, both in terms of restoration and carbon sunk per acre. Tropical rainforests are something else entirely.<p>In fungal soil, nutrient availability is a bit fuzzy, because if you&#x27;re not in a symbiotic relationship with the soil fungi, or root fused to a sibling that is, you have a lot less access to minerals. Some people prefer to think of this as a benevolent relationship, but what&#x27;s the line between exchange and extortion, especially when you can&#x27;t ask either party how they feel about it? &#x27;Codependent&#x27; might be the correct word.<p>I don&#x27;t know if he still feels this way, but Paul Stamets has on at least one occasion accused the fungi of farming the forest and not the other way around. If the fungi maintain a situation that is unfavorable to a particular tree, then they are not interested in having that tree around (whether that ultimately proves to be self-inflicted harm is sorted out by natural selection).')
