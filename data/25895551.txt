It is also very important for the public to call them out when reality and truth does not match the promises given in political speech.<p>When the Swedish government shut down a nuclear reaction the political promise were a greener power grid that polluted less. What we instead got was a oil power plant in the southern part of Sweden that previous only operated as a backup in case of harsh cold winters. Now it is operating all year because it suddenly became commercial viable to do so.<p>For long I have advocated that the solution to this disconnect between what is being said and what actually happens is laws. No new fossil fueled power plants, and no extended capacity by fossil fueled power plants. One do not need to be pro-nuclear, nor pro-solar or pro-wind. All that is needed is an expanding energy demand, a aging nuclear power plants, and a law that forbid people to use the easy but environmentally damaging alternative. Smart people in the energy industry can figure out what is the cheapest alternative that does not warm up the planet, and politician can stop trying to sell an untruth.')
