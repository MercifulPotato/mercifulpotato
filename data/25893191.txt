Banners are absolutely annoying by design because owners <i>want</i> people to be annoyed and click &quot;I accept everything&quot; to not be annoyed anymore. Owners could very well make those banners disappear with one simple trick: just don&#x27;t collect any information.<p>The &quot;golden past&quot; isn&#x27;t one where they used to care about users&#x27; experience, it&#x27;s one where they didn&#x27;t have to care about users&#x27; privacy. I personally highly welcome the change and try to websites that don&#x27;t care about my privacy by default.')
