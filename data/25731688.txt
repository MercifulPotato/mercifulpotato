The potential &quot;dumps&quot; current into the load proportional to its voltage. (A constant current supply would raise the voltage to achieve the requested current but the USB bus is not a constant current supply. There are multiple ways your yes-but is annoying and unhelpful.)<p>The main concern behind negotiation seems to be safety of the user and safety of the power supply. Detecting a safe load means detecting a not-short.<p>The basis for the 5V power negotiation on USB is extremely silly. The power supply is already current limited, protecting you from shorts, and the supply voltage is ~5V, quite far from anything dangerous.')
