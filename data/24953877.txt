But the trade-off comes in the next version, when you get customer feedback, and the devs start saying things like, &quot;No, we can&#x27;t do it that way because that isn&#x27;t how the technology works.&quot;<p>That doesn&#x27;t make it the wrong answer for a MVP or a V1... but this is an academic course. I&#x27;m hoping they cover the longer-term consequences of early choices in software development. Because that is what is really hard - not getting a first working version, but maintaining delivery speed over the long haul as you realize the limits of your choices.')
