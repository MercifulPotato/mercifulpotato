And, your assertion doesn&#x27;t even seem to be correct. I re-read the bug and it&#x27;s one GNOME developer suggesting for changes to be made only in GNOME 3, because support for a particular feature was deprecated upstream. The developer is apologetic and later goes on to make suggestions about what can be done in Ubuntu and XFCE. I see nothing there about &quot;GNOME devs requesting that Transmission break itself.&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trac.transmissionbt.com&#x2F;ticket&#x2F;3685" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trac.transmissionbt.com&#x2F;ticket&#x2F;3685</a><p>I&#x27;m not trying to dispel any perceptions either, if you have a deep seated belief that GNOME (or XFCE, or anything really) are &quot;not playing nice&quot; because they removed features from upstream, there&#x27;s nothing I can really say to you to change that view. If you want to challenge your own perceptions, I&#x27;d suggest you start developing a new open source desktop and application platform yourself over a period of many years just to see how much work it is, and how it&#x27;s practically impossible to support everything that every app developer asks for when none of them are paying you a cent.')
