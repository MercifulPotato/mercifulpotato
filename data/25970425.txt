Shit like this: a linguist who was tasked with helping a Northern California tribe fill in the blanks in the documentation of their dead language so they could revive it. If your curiosity isn&#x27;t peaked by that concept and it&#x27;s associated practical challenges and sets of choices, I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re doing on HN.<p>Definition #2 is like HN&#x27;s version of cheating celebrity stories in the Enquirer. If you wanted to spend the rest of your life enumerating each case, you certainly wouldn&#x27;t run out of bona fide material. But if <i>all</i> you talk about 99% of the time is that-- to the extent that you forget definition #1 even exists-- you have to admit at least <i>part</i> of your outrage is due not to your own free will but due to people clicking upvote buttons as if nudging trays of junk food close to where you&#x27;re sitting.<p>Edit: typo')
