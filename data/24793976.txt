Well not expanding , but that intelligence is regressing  to the mean which is equally bad. People thrive under constraints and struggle. It&#x27;s what makes games fun to play. Maybe the ease of modern life makes humans complacent. I mean i can&#x27;t explain why i see so many people struggle when they use an old computer program  which used to be commonplace in its day&#x2F; observing them shows a clear laziness to do deep-thinking. I m afraid i m becoming one of them too -- the horror!<p>I can&#x27;t help but think that we &#x27;re lacking the genius giants for which the last century is notorious. Where are the kolmogorovs, the von neumanns, the einsteins, the fred sangers of the past ~40 years? Is there a big gap in the higher end of intelligence? What about the lower end of intelligence? If both are lacking that means we are indeed regressing to become average idiots.<p>I like to think we already live in idiocracy. People forget however that in that movie, the biggest idiot wasnt President Camacho, it was the people, the way-below-average joes, who are evenly distributed across the political spectrum. (In fact the blind belief that politics alone can bring progress is kind of dumb in itself). Could it be something in the way we eat? There is a well established and colossal drop in testosterone levels in the past ~50 years. After all we are just neurochemical intelligence generators.<p>(Also why is everyone focusing on social media? That&#x27;s just a symptom)')
