I never give its address to anyone and all incoming mail is forwarded from other addresses.  I don&#x27;t send any mail from that account either.<p>I am somewhat worried that their great algorithms will one day decide it&#x27;s there is some violation of their ToS and close the account. I had that issue even with a paid (well, voucher that came with a PC, but still) Microsoft Drive account, I used in an atypical way (no sharing, all contents encrypted).<p>In the past I used IMAP for backing up my messages, but over time my scripts to do so have fallen into disrepair... Whether takeout would be a way to do somewhat regular backups? Or might that trigger their algorithms, that you are not a good customer? Has anybody read the ToS whether anything is mentioned about takeout?')
