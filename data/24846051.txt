Of course, if Apple really wanted, they could maintain a DB of hashed contents of every possible version of youtube-dl script, and do their best to match it up with what users execute. However, even that far-fetched scenario falls apart the moment you wrap youtube-dl invocation in a convenience script—as only the hashed content of the script you invoke is submitted for notarization check, not every binary or script further launched by it.')
