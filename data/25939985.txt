Melvin had to take investment in what I can only imagine were very unfavorable terms from Citadel because they were bleeding money so badly. Then they were fools and didn&#x27;t close their short position immediately, and lost even more massive amounts of money. As a sidenote, I doubt Citadel&#x27;s investment in Melvin is looking very good right now. (Since somehow Melvin seems to have not been bankrupted, maybe it will look better in a few years if Melvin recovers.)<p>I would also be fairly surprised if Citadel made, say, 1000% ROI on their total GME trades this week. Giant bull runs are fine for HFT, sure; everyone wins when stonks go up (except for shorts, who lose big time). But giant bull runs are generally better for buy-and-hold investors than for HFT, because the buy-and-hold investors weren&#x27;t doing all the useless intermediate buying and selling that the HFTs were. If a stock goes up and to the right, the best (retrospective) move is to have invested all of your position early, not to have constantly invested a bit of it over time as it went up like HFTs do. Basically: GME&#x27;s performance favored avid WSB investors who got in early, much more than it favored HFTs front-running Robinhood for pennies on every trade. To quote Matt Levine, &quot;you don&#x27;t need special evil HFT powers to see&quot; GME going up, it was happening for weeks [1]. You didn&#x27;t need HFT powers to see WSB posts about the squeeze, or about short interest being 130% of the float. If you were an avid WSB user, and you got in early, you really did take Melvin for a ride. Sure, Citadel did well too — but your returns would still probably blow theirs out of the water.<p>IMO, WSB won the biggest.<p>(I do worry about the retail traders who bought in late due to the hype; this rally doesn&#x27;t seem sustainable.)<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;matt_levine&#x2F;status&#x2F;1354131836323196928" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;matt_levine&#x2F;status&#x2F;1354131836323196928</a>')
