Item(by='eddieplan9', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610568961, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25762804, text='&gt; In the US, they created this backdoor &quot;Opt&quot; work visa (which they&#x27;re desperately trying to expand) that allows hundreds of thousands of foreign students to stay in the US once studies are finished and compete for jobs. Oh, and they don&#x27;t pay various retirement taxes, so companies get an immediate 15% incentive to hire them over American students.<p>First, OPT is not a visa. Optional Practical Training participants are mostly F-1 visa holders. Per IRS rules[1], the social security tax exemption &quot;does not apply to F-1,J-1,M-1, or Q-1&#x2F;Q-2 nonimmigrants who become resident aliens.&quot; And per IRS rules [2], you are considered a resident aliens if you pass the Substantial Presence Test [3], which states, &quot;31 days during the current year, and 183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that.&quot; Now how many students can get an OPT job and still fail this test?<p>The US immigration policy is not perfect and has holes. But attracting foreign talents to stay and work in the US is the baby, not the bath water.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;individuals&#x2F;international-taxpayers&#x2F;foreign-student-liability-for-social-security-and-medicare-taxes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;individuals&#x2F;international-taxpayers&#x2F;fore...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;individuals&#x2F;international-taxpayers&#x2F;determining-alien-tax-status" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;individuals&#x2F;international-taxpayers&#x2F;dete...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;individuals&#x2F;international-taxpayers&#x2F;substantial-presence-test" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;individuals&#x2F;international-taxpayers&#x2F;subs...</a>')
