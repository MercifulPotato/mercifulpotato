It won&#x27;t help, IMO, when 49% of Candian adults cannot disregard irrelevant  information to complete a task (as referenced in the article). These are skills that won&#x27;t be practiced, and therefore will be lost.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;radio&#x2F;costofliving&#x2F;let-s-get-digital-from-bitcoin-to-stocktok-plus-what-low-literacy-means-for-canada-s-economy-1.5873703&#x2F;nearly-half-of-adult-canadians-struggle-with-literacy-and-that-s-bad-for-the-economy-1.5873757" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;radio&#x2F;costofliving&#x2F;let-s-get-digital-from...</a>')
