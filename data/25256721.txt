In a sense, it&#x27;s definitely overkill, but it allows the following functionality:<p>When you create an expression, you have the ability to print it out in a nice readable format to verify it is correct and then without really ever altering that expression object, you can simultaneously perform simplifications and calculate final results.<p>IMO there&#x27;s less opportunity for errors like omitting an asterisk on a term meant to be an exponent, or incorrectly simplifying.<p>Critically though, it allows me to hand my work over to someone who doesn&#x27;t know python to check my work.<p>I definitely can replicate a lot of that same functionality without sympy, but I have to perform the substitutions and simplifications by hand, and the printing of the expression by rendering in LaTex is always different from the calculation, so I have to hand verify that I calculated what I said I was going to.')
