By all means, be the first to spill your guts and call for a violent military overthrow because radical violence is the answer to the culture-war not going your way. I&#x27;m sure the Nazis will be far less willing than the Paris Commune to hijack Zoom, Netflix, Uber Eats and future products of Big Data and AI to keep you singing the party&#x27;s tune. The only kind of people who look romantically at that kind of violence are the ones who feel it will never touch them, who are so safe they can&#x27;t imagine the suffering. I&#x27;m sure the author feels happy giving Nouveau-Mishima the thumbs up because he tacitly thinks he&#x27;ll be on the last flight out to watch the fireworks from the safety of a Paris cafe.<p>Lets say the &#x27;shock&#x27; against this &#x27;Last Man&#x27; isn&#x27;t a call from the author for violence and political revolution because the Culture War isn&#x27;t breaking his way. What&#x27;s the Nouveau-Mishima supposed to do here? Besides some old man grumbling about &quot;them d*mn kids and their nebulous and scary AI&quot; it&#x27;s not really identified what exactly we&#x27;re being complacent in. I&#x27;m afraid this feels like more angry impotent pot-stirring mixed with a bit of rehabilitation.<p>The conservative&#x27;s &quot;Last Man&quot; seems to come and go every century unabated, and with it the reactionary conservative backlash that oddly only ever seems to seek to turn back the clock a decade or two. We&#x27;re always so arrogant in thinking that the present is so different than the past.<p>The sentiment that the world will ever be devoid of struggle to me is naive. The fear of the &quot;fall of struggle&quot; is like fear of the &quot;rise of productivity&quot;. We all thought that the rise in productivity would mean less work and thus laziness; instead productivity is sky-high and we&#x27;re all working ourselves to death. More productivity just means more opportunity for work. Likewise, People are naturally tuned to find struggle and risk, and they will redefine their selves and situations until they have it. Free of our old burdens, we&#x27;ll just find new vaster ones. If you need the Noble Savage stuff to create art, wisdom, or whatever other product your spoiled mind think society has to produce to have &#x27;worth&#x27;, it&#x27;s gonna be there, I promise.')
