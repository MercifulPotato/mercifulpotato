I can give you a long list of reasons of why that makes sense from a supply chain&#x2F;logistics standpoint, but the short answer is this too will eventually happen to you car.<p>I worked for BMW before, and its EV program was at best a plaything, but given the amount of progress made by Tesla and now Toyota I fear you may be in a situation where they simply stop producing parts and you&#x27;ll have to buy broken chassis to just be able to maintain one.<p>In other words, have your fun and keep it as a relic of the 20th Century, or sell it now and get some of you investment back. Get an LFA and keep low miles on it if you want to buy a Toyota that will rise in value if you want something other than a MK4 Supra, I think that will be worth way more in the future and probably sought out by Saudi Shieks as a plaything where gas will still be pennies.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autoblog.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;03&#x2F;japan-considers-ban-on-internal-combustion-cars&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autoblog.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;03&#x2F;japan-considers-ban-on-i...</a>')
