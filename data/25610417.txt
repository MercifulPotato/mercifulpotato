This doesn&#x27;t mean that state space blow-up won&#x27;t happen but that there isn&#x27;t any inherent overhead (after minimization) compared to writing an equivalent regular expression by hand without using the product&#x2F;complement constructions. But minimization interacts poorly with some practical features like capture groups, so you could probably only use the minimized automaton for matching and you&#x27;d have to compute the captures after a match some other way.')
