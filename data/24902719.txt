The device needs to meet a certain defined state of patch level&#x2F;servicepack&#x2F;antivirus scan&#x2F;other things (like GPO registry settings on a windows machine) before allowed to sign on.<p>it&#x27;s all good to theoretically say that smaller companies should adopt a &#x27;beyondcorp&#x27; type approach. but at a certain point of threat model on the client device (keystroke loggers + tools that send screenshots somewhere else, as is found on black hat remote access tools&#x2F;botnet tools), you need to have specialists in endpoint&#x2F;workstation device security keeping on top of threats, and defining the security policy.<p>what sketches me out about this particular article is that they&#x27;re essentially trusting any client endpoint device that has the 2FA hardware token, and has a working browser. you could have a totally screwed up windows 10 laptop riddled with some very nasty RATs that would work fine to use the 2FA authentication tool, and sign in to their service with chrome in a browser. there&#x27;s nothing about verifying the state of the software and trustworthiness of the operating system of the client device which might be potentially accessing very sensitive internal information.<p>i see literally nothing in that article about inspecting or trusting the state of the operating system or software on the client device. does it have a bunch of malicious browser plugins? who knows. is it running a remote desktop tool that&#x27;s linked to somewhere else? who knows. is it infected with an advanced remote access tool? who knows. is it six months out of date on windows updates? who knows...<p>the article&#x27;s assertion that a vpn based approach is like an eggshell is false in my opinion. you should not have an environment where simple vpn auth allows you in to the squishy inner center of private data. a belt and suspenders approach is needed.')
