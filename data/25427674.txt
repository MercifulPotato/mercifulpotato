WikiLeaks did great things in the early days, and I was half convinced the affair in Sweden was a set-up. If it was not, Sweden would have been the place to put him on trial. And <i>not</i> to use it as am excuse to arrest in Britain to have him extradited to the US.<p>That being said, it seems WikiLeaks was at least complicit in Russia propaganda operations. And we have no way to tell whether that would have happened without the arrest. Complicated story. And still a trial I hate to see, if Assange gets convicted, there is no way to be sure that doesn&#x27;t happen to other journalists as well.')
