I’ve used CS3, CS4, CS6, and more recently CC. I only used CC because CS6 no longer worked on macOS, and I only used CS6 because I couldn’t get a legit older version (also student discount).<p>I found it to be a treadmill - the prices went up until Adobe decided that you could no longer purchase anything outright and now had to rent it. Newer versions looked prettier, but the performance and stability dropped.<p>I’d reckon that the vast majority of people using CC would be happy with an older version and just as productive. CC6 and later are resource hogs that are constantly calling home. Today, I’d be hard pressed to choose CC over a pirated copy or other alternative, and I’ve known a few designers that stuck with cracked copies of CS.')
