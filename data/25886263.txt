Item(by='wott', descendants=None, kids=[25886484], score=None, time=1611437195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25885705, text='I add another examples about changes.<p>I grew up in the early 80s in a very small village, in a very rural area: the parents of all pupils were farmers, except mine. Cereals production was dominant, with a part of cattle and poultry.<p>Nowadays there are problems between farmers and non-farmers. Non-farmers will complain about farmers. Farmers will complain about the complaints from non-farmers. Which is right?<p>Farmers will tell that those assholes from the cities do not understand their work, that they must adapt to traditions if they come settle there, and so on. For examples, that harvesting at 2 AM is normal because it is cooler. I am sorry but this is somewhat bullshit. Or complete bullshit. When I was a kid, they would never work at night, except for a real emergency (and they didn&#x27;t have air-conditioning). The truth is, that those farmers have bought a lot more land, that the surface of each farm  has tripled or quadrupled, and therefore they have to harvest 3 or 4 times more in the same time period or even in less time because they have specialised in a single activity (giving up on cattle for example) and must do all their surface at the same moment instead of just a part. There is no tradition in that, it is brand new.<p>Also, nobody had breathing troubles because of harvesting when I was a kid. But now the harvesters are larger, faster, and they make clouds of fine dust which spread far. I am not normally asthmatic, but last times I visited there at harvest period, I had breathing problem because of that dust. Again, zero tradition there. Even with mechanised agriculture of WW2- 1980s, it was not a thing.<p>So the recent changes are creating true problems, and complaining about does not always mean being an intolerant entitled asshole. Those problems cannot be swept away in the name of tradition. If farmer had remained traditional in their techniques, there wouldn&#x27;t be such problems and people wouldn&#x27;t complain about them.')
