So the first thing I do is get a feel for where the audience is right now (by asking directly if possible, or making a best guess if not). Then I place myself in their shoes, and work backwards asking myself &quot;why doesn&#x27;t X makes sense yet?&quot; to figure out which gaps need to be filled in.<p>To get more concrete: leveraging metaphors and bridging existing knowledge is a powerful explanation tool. If you&#x27;re trying to explain X, and the audience already has a mental framework for Y which has some things in common with X, it can be much easier for both parties if you bridge from Y to X instead of constructing X from first principles.<p>Beyond just effectiveness of communication, this approach helps with the &quot;condescension&quot; factor too. One of the main things that makes someone feel stupid or belittled is when you explain something that they already know as if they didn&#x27;t. So doing the up-front step of getting a good grasp on their starting point helps ensure that you&#x27;re only telling them things they don&#x27;t know already.')
