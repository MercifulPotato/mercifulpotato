It&#x27;s a market determined price.<p>Steam, which operates on completely open desktop platforms charges 30%. Even Humble Bundle charges 25%, operates on open platforms and the only thing they do is marketing. Another 5% for running a store client and associated services hardly seems excessive. So nether arguing that open platforms would push down prices, or that app store competition would push them down has actually happened in the real world. 30% is very much validated as a competitive price. If the big stores did cut prices, this would arguably squeeze out the smaller stores and operators like Humble Bundle, reducing choice even more.<p>That 30% is charged to developers, not consumers so in this case it&#x27;s developers that are the market.')
