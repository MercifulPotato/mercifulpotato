It&#x27;s now well established that Russia did interfere in the elections with the goal to promote a Trump victory. The only thing not conclusive was active and intentful collaboration with Russia from Trump. But it&#x27;s very normal to want to open an investigation into Russia&#x27;s meddling.<p>&gt; Mueller concluded that Russian interference was &quot;sweeping and systematic&quot; and &quot;violated U.S. criminal law&quot;, and he indicted twenty-six Russian citizens and three Russian organizations. The investigation also led to indictments and convictions of Trump campaign officials and associated Americans<p>&gt; The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee submitted the first in their five-volume 1,313-page report in July 2019 in which they concluded that the January 2017 intelligence community assessment alleging Russian interference was &quot;coherent and well-constructed&quot;.<p>&gt; The Russian government interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election with the goals of harming the campaign of Hillary Clinton, boosting the candidacy of Donald Trump, and increasing political and social discord in the United States. According to U.S. intelligence agencies, the operation was ordered directly by Russian President Vladimir Putin<p>&gt; Several individuals connected to Russia contacted various Trump campaign associates, offering business opportunities to the Trump Organization and proferring damaging information on Clinton.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing, I don&#x27;t even know what to make of it. Sure, Trump didn&#x27;t seek.out Russian help actively or ask them to do any of this, but Russia still interfered in a way to promote his election. Now hard to say how much that helped him win, but it&#x27;s hard to standby and think... Ya I guess this is fine? Shouldn&#x27;t we do something to stop this from happening again? And why didn&#x27;t Trump do anything about it? Shouldn&#x27;t he say something like ... Well I believe I would have won even without their help, but this is unacceptable and we need to put in place measures to make sure Russia and other foreign powers can no longer meddle in US elections?')
