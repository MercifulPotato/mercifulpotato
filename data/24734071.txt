For one, the quote from Ibn Khaldun (the only reputable individual mentioned, albeit briefly in this piece) is taken out of context and mistranslated.[1] Evidence suggests that what Ibn Khaldun was in fact making reference to (the concept of the celestial spheres&#x2F;emanation) is antithetical to the theory of evolution or anything of its ilk. In fact, the passages that precede the quote that is referenced in this piece and others establish this evidence as clear. [2, pg. 137]<p>In investigating the remaining invididuals mentioned in this piece, it appears that not one of them is of a doctrinal pedigree similar to that of Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s (who is what the general public would refer to as a Sunni Muslim). To juxtapose the label of &quot;Islamic&quot; next to the opinions of Mu&#x27;tazilites, &quot;Neoplatonist&quot; and Shiites in regard to the theories of evolution, natural selection, et cetera, does not spell for a valid argument from a purely traditional point of view. The likes of those mentioned in this article would be deemed heretic at the least and out of the fold of Islam entirely at the most.<p>This article is a product of the misappropriation and degradation of Islamic scholarship and history in academia and abroad for the sake of &quot;pluralism&quot; and &quot;inclusiveness&quot;. It is unfortunate that Ibn Khaldun has to be shoehorned into these arguments. Anyone involved in these sort of studies would pain themselves to find reputable scholars of Sunni Islam propogating or inclining toward Darwinist thought to the degree of the aforementioned groups that are traditionally established to be deviated from the main stream.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.islamicboard.com&#x2F;health-amp-science&#x2F;134349270-ibn-khaldun-evolution-theory.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.islamicboard.com&#x2F;health-amp-science&#x2F;134349270-ib...</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;ibn_khaldun-al_muqaddimah_201611" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;ibn_khaldun-al_muqaddimah_201611</a>')
