All those YC companies are super young, and are incentived to go into technical debt in the interest of first becoming profitable. They do all sorts of things the industry has decided are bad ideas in general, in the important (but short lived) interest of speed. They are in the experimentation phase, trying to figure out what will work long term while also not being held back by history with a working product.<p>Matlab SimuLink is a no code solution that works well. It does so because its users, mostly academics, fit a similar profile to YC startups: both are in the business of making stuff that doesn&#x27;t need to last long&#x2F;&quot;writing throwaway code&quot;. In both cases, experimentation is important. After all, the YC startups don&#x27;t know what is profitable yet.<p>Once profitable, they will want to make much more minor changes. After all, why change something that makes money?<p>It is this field of fine grained changes where code thrives.<p>I&#x27;ll be convinced of no code when banks start using it.')
