I’ve been saying this for about 10 months now. If you didn’t listen to my (and many others) entreaties before, I don’t think you’ll likely change your behavior based on a new order.<p>I disagree with this wholeheartedly.<p>People are getting a <i>LOT</i> of pressure to see family right now.  Strong messages from people in authority absolutely <i>will</i> cause some people to think more about this.  It also gives them an external authority to appeal to when resisting peer pressure.<p>Yes, you&#x27;re not going to get the dipshits.<p>However, being able to tell family, that you maybe didn&#x27;t even want to see all that much <i>anyway</i> (a lot of people only do the extended family thing out of obligation at the holidays), that there is an &quot;Official Order(tm)&quot; to &quot;Don&#x27;t gather&quot; helps.<p>This is similar to official &quot;mask mandates&quot;.  This helps because a store can now say &quot;Sir, the city&#x2F;county&#x2F;state has issued official orders to wear masks and we will have to ask you to leave if you don&#x27;t wear it.&quot;  An official mandate gives the store political cover.  It also gives the average citizen the ability to ask the store to kick someone out who is non-compliant.<p>The &quot;Bully Pulpit&quot; is a real thing.')
