Item(by='hpoe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607624480, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376030, text='Honestly I feel that those that are desirous for knowledge and want to become a well-rounded and get a liberal education are the ones that are going to go out and learn and gather knowledge regardless of whether or not they went to school.<p>Whereas those that view college as a tool of securing employment complain about the classes and feel they are a waste of time, resulting in them not getting much out of it anyway.<p>I agree teachers are important, but does a teacher have to be someone that sits and lectures in a classroom? If I am interested in OS theory I can join the Linux mailing list, ask questions on Linux development forums, heck if I ask a good question I may even have Linus himself take a minute to respond to my question.<p>Beyond that from my understanding many of the &quot;teachers&quot; at the college level are Grad students assigned to teach a class and that professors view it as a chore.<p>Not that I am totally against teachers or traditional education, I just think that one can acquire all of the benefits of a liberal education without ever needing to set foot in a classroom in this day and age.')
