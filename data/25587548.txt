If you’ve got nothing better to do than hang out at the office and take it easy on casual Fridays, then you might as well get paid for it.<p>If, on the other hand, you’d rather go home and put your 3 day weekends to better use taking care of your household, spending time with family, engaging in a hobby, travelling, or relaxing at the cottage (if you don’t own one, you might try renting one), then your Friday is more valuable to you than the money you lose from taking the day off.')
