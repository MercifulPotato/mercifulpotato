I read Taleb&#x27;s critique, who comes off as a raving lunatic in this context, and Gladwell who must have some axe to grind since he doesn&#x27;t actually address the concrete metrics that Pinker brings up.<p>Lower childhood mortality, less poverty, longer life expectancy, less violent crime, less disease, more equality, less war. Things are getting better, along almost every metric we can think of. It&#x27;s  not just &quot;different&quot;. It&#x27;s also not just Pinker&#x27;s work confirming that, OurWorldInData is good on this topic too.<p>The only sensible argument I&#x27;ve heard to the contrary is that our systemic tail risks have gotten bigger. Which is accurate but doesn&#x27;t change the fact that things are much better for almost everyone presuming that such risks can be mitigated.')
