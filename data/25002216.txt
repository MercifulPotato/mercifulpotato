It takes tools and a specialist<p>2. they want to compare with lots of different databases. Most GEDMatch data comes from genotyping arrays, that look at ~500k variants on the genome. However, different companies use different sets of single-nucleotide variants. Meanwhile, law enforcement databases look at microsatellites, which can&#x27;t be assayed easily with an array. Sequencing someone to be able to use all the different databases would be on the order of a thousand dollars<p>3. The genetic testing companies do things in bulk. Your cousin&#x27;s spit was run though the various steps (like PCR) with 100s of other samples. Doing it for a single sample is going to be more expensive')
