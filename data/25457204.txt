It isn&#x27;t actually seeing inside the building, just 3D rendered to look transparent.<p>10Ghz has (optimistically) a building penetration loss of 25dB [1], with any reflections back also seeing 25dB loss.  I don&#x27;t think this is workable with current satellite power flux density regulations. At least not at 10Ghz.<p>[1] ITU-R P.2346-1 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itu.int&#x2F;dms_pub&#x2F;itu-r&#x2F;opb&#x2F;rep&#x2F;R-REP-P.2346-1-2016-PDF-E.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itu.int&#x2F;dms_pub&#x2F;itu-r&#x2F;opb&#x2F;rep&#x2F;R-REP-P.2346-1-201...</a><p>Edit: the claims to seeing &#x27;individual rooms&#x27; are not backed by any examples, but maybe natural corner reflectors could rarely give a return. Still wouldn&#x27;t be able to see anything <i>within</i> the room.')
