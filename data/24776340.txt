The fact that the federal government, according to the information it gave on 19 June 2019, has not issued an export licence for intrusion software requiring a licence since January 2015 additionally either suggests that the export of such software is not routine business, which would support all the more that the CEOs knew about it, or that numerous additional exports violating the export provisions have taken place in recent years, above and beyond the business deals with Turkey.&quot;<p>Interesting read.')
