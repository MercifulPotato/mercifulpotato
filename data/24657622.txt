They do not care if phone SIM have your ID associated. That ID is built from traffic.<p>If they see DNS requests to real state sites, they may put you in a bucket that says &quot;high income&quot;, if they see searches (via DNS hijack to when you search by your addressbar like tmo does) for things like fastfood breakfast delivery, up in the &quot;low income&quot; bucket you go. Also, it will always have your Phone number.<p>Then those Advertising companies &quot;enrich&quot; this data with data from google or others, and can pin point you by email plus all the correlated data. Happy that you have facebook two factor auth to your SMS now?<p>It shocks me that people in this forum are completely oblivious to Tracking and think that the aborted &quot;think of the children&quot; law that requires you present an ID to buy a phone line has any importance...<p>So, to conclude, the traffic here is observed by the proxing entity, by the tel co, etc.')
