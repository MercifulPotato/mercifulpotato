This of course is <i>very</i> far from perfect, but it takes a good stab at it and I&#x27;ve sometimes found the results to be usable (often with some manual cleanup.)<p>Another example where Caliber compliments Pandoc well is when generating ebooks for sideloading onto kindles.  Pandoc can create epubs which Calibre can in turn convert to mobi.')
