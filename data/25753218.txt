Item(by='snakeboy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610483836, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25752836, text='My experience flying from the US to France through Portugal was that an agent at the gate looks over whatever paper you give them and highlights &quot;PCR&quot;, &quot;NEGATIVE&quot; and the date and then hands it back. \n Then in Portugal they asked for the paper and waved me through, and the same at the French border.<p>So logistically, pretty easy to fake (unless you&#x27;re stupid enough to be trying to buy the fakes <i>in the airport</i> like some guys who got caught in Paris a few months ago) but I agree with other commenters it&#x27;s better than nothing and will almost surely improve the rates of testing&#x2F;precaution around travel.')
