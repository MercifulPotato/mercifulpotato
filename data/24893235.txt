These companies might reserve limited rights to reshare or redisplay your content at their discretion, but it is 100% wrong to say they have &quot;unlimited IP rights&quot; to anything posted by users.<p>&gt; <i>We wouldn&#x27;t stand for this with the phone companies and we shouldn&#x27;t for any other oligarch-controlled monopoly entities.</i><p>Websites are not phone companies. The reason why phone companies are different is because they control finite physical resources which are fundamentally essential to the logistics of communication. If the 3 most popular phone companies collude to exclude you from the network, communication becomes nearly impossible. This is not true of websites which sit at a higher level of abstraction, if the 3 most popular websites banned you there would still be many millions of alternative websites and communication platforms available to you or you could create your own venue or platform which is just as capable (if not nearly as popular) as any of the alternatives.<p>&gt; <i>The larger a share of the world audience a platform owns, the less it should be able to censor.</i><p>Why? Why should the owners of an arbitrarily popular website lose their 1st amendment rights? Should the same rules apply to arbitrarily popular books, movies, tv, or radio? What is it about a website that makes you believe the creative control of a popular website&#x27;s content and behavior should be abdicated to the government?<p>&gt; <i>I don&#x27;t like the proverbial nazis on the front lawn, but when your &#x27;front lawn&#x27; is the entire country, and it&#x27;s less literal nazis and more &#x27;people who get accused of being witches&#x27;, it&#x27;s harder to support.</i><p>I don&#x27;t care about &quot;nazis on the front lawn&quot;, I simply reject the idea that someone other than the owner of a website should be dictating what appears on a website, <i>especially</i> based on an arbitrary metric like popularity.<p>&gt; <i>I don&#x27;t think we should hand over control of everyone&#x27;s speech to a cartel of billionaires.</i><p>This characterization is just wrong. If you don&#x27;t want your speech controlled by a cartel of billionaires then stop posting your speech to websites literally controlled by billionaires. It&#x27;s <i>very</i> easy and <i>very</i> cheap to do and many people have been doing it for many years.')
