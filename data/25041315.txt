There is no rush to get vaccinated.<p>Personally, I doubt I will get it at all. The authorities have a very long way to go to win back my trust, after the chain of screwups over the last year.<p>We&#x27;ve seen that they will lie to us, we&#x27;ve seen that they apply rules to us that they themselves don&#x27;t follow, and we&#x27;ve seen them take advantage of the situation for their own benefit.<p>It is a huge shame that so many people are not going to take it solely because they&#x27;ve betrayed our trust so many times that now that they might be doing something good, we won&#x27;t cooperate.')
