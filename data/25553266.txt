Each year trillions of Euro flow in the shadow market unregulated and untaxed, leading to long term deficits. Traceability of electronic payments is much better than with cash, leading to more information on the flow of money. This information can be used to reduce tax evasion and make regulation easier, in turn reducing the shadow economy&quot;<p>That is an observation, not a policy thought up by politicians working at the Parliment.<p>&gt;This &quot;third-party document&quot; shit is a really embarrassing excuse. Can&#x27;t the EU apologists think of something better?<p>It is a study for politicians to take better decicions not policies to be implemented, for that you want to read the things like the meeting minutes not supporting analysis.<p>&gt;Anyways, this document is one of many, it&#x27;s just the first I had a link to. The same points (and other, even more concerning ones) are made in many more.<p>I would welcome linking to more, as long as they are not just studies, although interesting reading they do not dictate the policy.<p>&gt;Sure, just like the encryption backdoors are for the children, for the democracy and especially for transparency. Take these democratic values with you, I am not interested. The EU is really efficient in showing us why is democracy wrong.<p>Well I am also welcoming more information about this as it sounds like something I want to read up on. The EU may be inefficient, and it could be a lot better, which is why I would welcome a discussion about it instead of making accusations without providing any sources to base your claims on.')
