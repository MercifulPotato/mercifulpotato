The car should be used as means to more distant travel. Fuel can be stored in far away placess and gas stations refueled intermittently and dynamically per season. Expanding the electricity grid capacity to far away places or countries seems impossible considering current world grid status.\nSo for a few years after the compulsory usage of EVs socioeconomically non urban centers will probably have a hard time.')
