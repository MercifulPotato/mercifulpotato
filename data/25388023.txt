I updated it a few months back to use `mongodb-memory-server` to spin up a dynamic `mongod` instance solely for the test sequence.<p>When I set up Cypress, I was also able to use `mongodb-memory-server`.  I configured the app to check for an environment variable indicating an E2E test environment, had it connect to the in-memory `mongod` instance, and used a Cypress task to seed the DB before every test.  Seemed fairly straightforward, and is working pretty well.')
