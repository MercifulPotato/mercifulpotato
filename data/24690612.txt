Even if it isn&#x27;t playing.<p>- Skype sets 1ms, if started at Startup (which it defaults to), even though I am logged out and it just has a tray icon.  But when I manually start it, it doesn&#x27;t (always) set it to 1ms.<p>- VSCode will set it to 1ms when you are interacting with it, but will eventually revert to 15.6ms if left alone (even if it is still in foreground).<p>- Firefox doesn&#x27;t appear to set it (on its own; I presume that if I opened a tab that was using a low setTimeout or requestAnimFrame it might).<p>Spotify is interesting.  A lot of people probably have that app, and since it sets 1ms unconditionally, it would have been setting fast-timer mode prior to the 2004 update, which could inadvertently &quot;speed up&quot; whatever games people were running.<p>That includes my own game, which uses a foreground sleep of as low as 1ms to try to hit its time target, and I don&#x27;t call timeBeginPeriod.  I guess I&#x27;ll find out when I get the 2004 update.')
