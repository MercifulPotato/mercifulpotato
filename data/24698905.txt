It seems there is a new one popping up every week. This is not criticism, but I&#x27;m wondering why there are so many people developing their own alternative product.<p>For me an attractive GA alternative has to be:<p>- 100% self hosted via Docker containers in Kubernetes\n- Able to configure a connection string to a datastore outside my kubes cluster\n- One deployment for the data gathering service\n- Second deployment for an Admin tool&#x2F;dashboard\n- Provide at least basic metrics around acquisition, user device and location data<p>Nice to have:<p>- Open source so people can scrutinise the code before deploying and feed back bug fixes&#x2F;feature requests, etc.<p>Can anyone recommend a GA alternative which ticks these boxes?')
