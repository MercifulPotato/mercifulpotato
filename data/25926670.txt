Especially if you want to do work with that expands on findings on other papers that roughly look good &quot;trust but verify&quot; seems to be the way to go.</i><p>Yeah, but I meant that in general case, you no longer &quot;trust but verify&quot;, but &quot;assume bullshit and hope there&#x27;s a nugget of truth in the paper&quot;.<p>This has interesting implications for consuming science for non-academic use, too. I&#x27;ve been accused of being &quot;anti-science&quot; when I said this before, but I no longer trust arguments backed by citations around soft-ish fields like social sciences, dietetics or medicine. Even if the person posting a claim does good work of selecting citations (so they&#x27;re not all saying something tangentially related, or much more specific, or &quot;in mice!&quot;), if the claim is counterintuitive and papers seem complex enough, I mentally code this as <i>very weak evidence</i> - i.e. most likely bullshit, but there were some papers claiming it, so if that comes up again, many times in different contexts, I may be willing to entertain the claim being true.<p>And stories like this make me extend this principle to biology and chemistry in general as well. I&#x27;ve burned myself enough times, getting excited about some result, only to later learn it was bunk.<p>The same pattern of course repeats outside academia, but more overtly - you can hardly trust any commercial communication either. At this point, I&#x27;m wondering how are we even managing to keep a society running? It&#x27;s <i>very hard work</i> to make progress and contribute, if you have to assume everyone is either bullshitting, or repeating bullshit they&#x27;ve heard elsewhere.')
