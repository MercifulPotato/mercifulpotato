What won me over was renting a Model 3 for a weekend, and concluding that it was a _fantastic car_.<p>The Prius is a miserable little piece of shit for people who hate driving. The Model 3 is a superior driving experience to pretty much every other midsize sedan on the market, including BMW, Mercedes, etc.<p>The fact that it&#x27;s &quot;green&quot; is just a bonus for me. I love the convenience of charging at home and never stopping for gas, the smoothness, the quiet, the linearity and directness of the power delivery, the clean and minimalist interior, and the precise and responsive handling.<p>The reason no other electric car is yet selling in volume the US is that Tesla has for a long time been the only one that doesn&#x27;t suck. The Porsche Taycan is the first credible competitor, and I understand Porsche is already selling more of those than they do 911s.')
