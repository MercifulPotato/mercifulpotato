And in particular, my book contracts stipulate in mind-numbing detail precisely how sales will be accounted for (what percentage of net receipts go to me, or to the publisher, depending on volume and&#x2F;or discount rates). The contracts make hard-coded assumptions about <i>how</i> books are sold that can&#x27;t readily be rewritten. Also, contracts for different books by the same author may have different T&amp;Cs, never mind contracts issued in different years (occasionally publishers try to &quot;fix&quot; things by turning Legal loose on their inherited contract boilerplate, usually with questionable results because they invariably make a massive land-grab and then the bigger literary agents all lawyer up and arm-wrestle for a better deal for their clients).<p>It&#x27;s bad enough that at least one of the Big Five (to my definite knowledge, as I work with them) has fired up an internal start-up publisher, mostly using the same editorial team and production facilities, but where the distinguishing characteristic is that (a) they totally rewrote their book contracts to make it <i>possible</i> to do new and exciting stuff, and (b) target ebook sales as a primary channel. (Disclaimer: this is my primary publisher in the US market right now and I&#x27;m very happy with the way things are going.)<p>But when you&#x27;re dealing with multinational publishing corporations you&#x27;ve got to bear in mind they have tens of thousands of book contracts going back decades which can&#x27;t easily be dragged around onto a new business model, <i>and</i> they suffer from activist shareholders and an ever-constant threat of hostile takeover (see the ongoing Simon and Schuster takeover by Penguin Random House).')
