I&#x27;m well versed in coroutines and &quot;fibers&quot; and all of the theory surrounding it but haven&#x27;t come across the formalized terminology (m:n, n:1, etc.).<p>I&#x27;ll give you another example: ropes are string classes with more complex data storage, useful for optimizing mutations and cutting down copies. The concept is easy to understand, and personally I&#x27;ve implemented them a number of times, but didn&#x27;t know about the formalized term until the last year or so.<p>The last sentence is a bit unfair and presumptuous, I think.')
