Also, QUIC is not just about the performance improvements offered today.<p>Existing protocols like TCP and TLS are not really simpler than QUIC, you just don&#x27;t think about them because we have implementations of them already. However, _changing_ TCP and TLS is extremely difficult to impossible because middleboxes snoop on traffic and mess it up in various ways. As an example, multipath TCP has been engineered to look like regular TCP and automatically downgrade to regular TCP if middleboxes can&#x27;t handle it. Making this work is hard and 100% a waste of time just to work around the fact that people deploy these boxes. I believe TLS 1.3 also had deployment challenges due to middleboxes.<p>QUIC encrypts ~everything so that middleboxes can&#x27;t make broken assumptions and manipulate traffic. Adopting it is a one time pain that enable later improvements to be possible.')
