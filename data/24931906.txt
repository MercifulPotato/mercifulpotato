Rather than hire an expert in new technology X who knows nothing about your business and existing tech&#x2F;infrastructure, you can throw Mr. 3 at it.<p>The only time I don&#x27;t think that type of candidate would be useful is if the company is competing on technology, and they need someone who has dedicated their career to being an expert and&#x2F;or researcher in that single specialty (example: machine learning). But even then, most companies don&#x27;t need someone like that, and those that do could probably benefit from having some 3s on the team in addition to the specialists.')
