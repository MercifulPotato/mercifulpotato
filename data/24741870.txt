In fact, it feels to me as if you are softening things up quite a bit: sure, glorifying the military is something that every country (read as &quot;government&quot;) <i>tries</i> to do, but I don&#x27;t really know any modern example other than USA, where people actually buy this bullshit. Which is kinda surreal, because, let&#x27;s be honest: there is absolutely nothing honourable about [strike]serving[&#x2F;strike] working in the military. It&#x27;s not even about being a murderer (which everyone working in the military definitely is), it&#x27;s about signing up (explicitly giving the oath) to follow the orders of other murderers. So it&#x27;s literally just selling any your moral principles for a quite handsome compensation (in the case of USA, anyway).<p>No, I&#x27;m not judging, maybe I would do it myself. I&#x27;m just refusing to pretend there&#x27;s is anything honourable about that.')
