It should be done on a voluntary basis. My understanding is that approaches like this work with acceptable levels of risk in other countries, so hopefully it will be likewise successful here. That being said, my gut reaction is that I would not want to be the person called upon to do this job, and I could understand any other person who felt likewise. I would want to be armed when dealing with people who are operating outside the ordinary human envelope of behavior. Maybe that&#x27;s my Americanness talking.')
