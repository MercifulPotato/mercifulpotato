Incidentally, that&#x27;s why the &#x27;instant restart&#x27; option got put in.  Had my alpha tester growl at me over it.<p>Thanks, that&#x27;s already in the works and I&#x27;ll put in an option for a safe first click.  Wrote more about this to another person here, but suffice it to say I&#x27;m trying to shift the entire board&#x27;s biggest randomly generated hole to your first click instead of (re)generating the board with an artificial hole.  Because I don&#x27;t want to tamper with RNG, and I&#x27;m a fool.  This is the harder overcomplicated way of doing it, so it&#x27;s taking some time, but it&#x27;ll be in the next update.')
