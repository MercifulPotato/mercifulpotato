How about stability of the system? It turns out it&#x27;s predicated on your current- and future- (especially future) citizens&#x27; productiveness and willingness to cope with ever growing appetites of the state government. It&#x27;s been accumulating debt since 1990s, and all the growth that you attribute with a &quot;success&quot; tag is predicated on the expectation that the future generations will figure the solution to the ever growing debt problem. What happens in fact is that the government is stealing the future from the generations to come - it&#x27;s they who will have to pay for the debt of the current government. And they may just rightfully refuse to do it by moving elsewhere.')
