I was really disapointed by it&#x27;s lack of more flexible layout semantics (like flexbox or display: grid), and instead offloading that all into writing custom C# code to lay things out at pixel locations.<p>What was just a single line in css - grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr)) - ended up being many lines of custom layout code to achieve something much less performant.<p>I find the codegen&#x2F;bindings situation to be really weird and XAML as well. Making custom XAML components&#x2F;reusing code is trickier than it should be. React really got it right with JSX being just a thin layer of syntactic sugar on regular JS (I&#x27;m unsure how this would work for a static language like C#)')
