I agree with this.<p>I eat specifically to get strong in the gym.<p>A bit of a sticking point with me and my partner is I refused to go eat at a cafe with my partners sister&#x2F;husband for brunch as it was a vegan cafe. My reasoning was it was junk food, heavily processed food made to taste like meat. Nutritionaly there was nothing on the menu that suited my macros as I was training for a competition on a strict diet.<p>I did explain I&#x27;d happily eat somewhere that served real, whole food that was vegan, the issue wasn&#x27;t about it being a vegan cafe, the issue was the food was nutritionally junk.<p>Whole based plant foods can be extremely tasty, healthy and simple. I quite happily eat these types of vegan meals. I actively avoid beyond meat burgers but will quite happily eat lentil burgers.<p>Still on the topic of McDonalds, people want beyond meat style burgers so it&#x27;s good they are providing them as an option.')
