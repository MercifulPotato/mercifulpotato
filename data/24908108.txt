We called I-5 the 5. Same for the 405, the 101, the 15, the 10, the 99. Also, we called State Route 1 (aka Highway 1) PCH no matter where it was located in the state, even though SR1 only has the Pacific Coast Highway designation between Oxnard and Dana Point.<p>I moved to Northern California (Santa Clara County) in the late 80s and I still use the same monikers. If I take a trip to Big Sur, I tell folks I am going to take the 17 to PCH and drive down. Old habits die hard.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kcet.org&#x2F;shows&#x2F;lost-la&#x2F;the-5-the-101-the-405-why-southern-californians-love-saying-the-before-freeway-numbers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kcet.org&#x2F;shows&#x2F;lost-la&#x2F;the-5-the-101-the-405-why...</a>')
