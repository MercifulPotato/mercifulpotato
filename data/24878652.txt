If most returns were on the same day then they just didn&#x27;t like your reading style or voice, versus a week later. Seems like a critical piece of info you&#x27;d want.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve returned only a book or two simply because I couldn&#x27;t listen to the narrator; usually you can tell if you&#x27;ll like the voice from the sample, but reading style can vary greatly outside the 30 second sample; I also never finished the first chapter.')
