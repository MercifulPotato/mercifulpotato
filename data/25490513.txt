But my point is that Wayland+OBS working together is a litmus test. The fact that the two are just beginning to play well is a big red light to me switching away from X11 any time soon.<p>Anyway, that &quot;done and ready&quot; quote is really the source of my frustration. If I have to set an arbitrary timeout after a &quot;loaded&quot; event to get it to work properly, &quot;loaded&quot; is a probably misnomer.')
