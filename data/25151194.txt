Rats.<p>OsmAnd+ (or the free OsmAnd~ version available on FDroid) is definitely the primo consumer-facing OSM-powered map. I haven&#x27;t tried getting it running on desktop via Android emulation but that might be workable.<p>Another desktop app worth mentioning is Garmin&#x27;s Basecamp, a free download (Windows and Mac) for managing Garmin GPS units. It also functions as a desktop map viewer that supports search and routing, though the interface is a little awkward. You can buy maps from Garmin, but you can also convert OSM data into a Basecamp-compatible format. This is <i>very</i> offline -- for any updates you&#x27;ll have to pull fresh data, reconvert, reinstall. Or you can find someone else who&#x27;s done the work for you.
