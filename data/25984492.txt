I&#x27;ve done this myself; my friend group was on XMPP for a while, then we moved to Matrix, but there was never a point when we all switched at once. It was a gradual process, with us bridging our group chats between the two, and slowly people started moving over (and in fact some of us still use both). I have never had a transition that successful between proprietary chat platforms.<p>To quote a recently-posted piece by Cory Doctorow:<p>&gt; Interoperability lowers “switching costs” – the cost of leaving behind whatever you’re using now in favor of something you think will suit you better. When my grandparents emigrated to Canada from the Soviet Union on a displaced persons ship, they incurred a high switching cost: for more than a decade, they had no contact with their family in Leningrad except through unreliable, slow word-of-mouth with the rare person who got a visa to travel there.<p>&gt; Contrast this with my move from the UK to Los Angeles in 2015: we are in routine contact with my in-laws in London and Wales, as well as my family in Toronto. My laptop and books came with me, as did our other personal effects. We left most of our appliances behind because they ran on a different voltage, but there were a few things we loved that we brought with and either changed the plugs on or connected to our house’s electrical outlets via transformer or adapters.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;locusmag.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;cory-doctorow-ip&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;locusmag.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;cory-doctorow-ip&#x2F;</a>')
