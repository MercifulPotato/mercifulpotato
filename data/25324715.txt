(They also don&#x27;t process payments for digital-only sexual content, likely because of high fraud and chargeback rates.) But I haven&#x27;t seen PayPal fall down the slippery slope of banning kinky&#x2F;less mainstream sexual content.<p>Right now, these payment processors are deplatforming racists and neo-Nazis who openly advocate for the creation of a white ethnostate. To assume that eventually these payment processors will be successfully pressured into deplatforming moderately-right publications like the WSJ is classic slippery-slope fallacy. There is a huge difference between believing conservative ideas and advocating for violence against ethnic minorities.<p>&gt; social network Gab, which describes itself as pro-free speech but has high concentrations of toxicity.<p>Give me a break. Gab is a haven for white-supremacists and neo-Nazis. PayPal deplatformed Gab after a verified neo-Nazi user posted anti-semitism on the site, then shot up a synagogue killing 11 and injuring 6 [0]. &quot;Toxicity&quot; is terribly bad faith argument.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gab_(social_network)#2018_Pittsburgh_synagogue_shooting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gab_(social_network)#2018_Pitt...</a>')
