Most consumers will not notice a difference.<p>You can&#x27;t just ignore that and then make the disingenuous claim that it&#x27;s anything like the Windows ARM situation, especially given the fact that Apple is throwing their entire weight behind the transition which will (eventually) result in most major applications being natively compatible. I&#x27;d be curious if anyone thinks that this transition is going to fail somehow')
