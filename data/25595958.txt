Where do I go from here?", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;m employee #4 at a pre-seed startup. Their main offering is a digital continous improvement solution targeting large corps. Employees #1-3 are all app developers. Significant projected revenue for the company revolves around the mass collection, processing, and analytics of data from their application.<p>I joined after dropping out from my PhD as the only ML-data engineer and to own the development of that product space. I&#x27;ve completed a large (~0.7M) govt. grant in the first few months of working here to support development of my product with collaboration from academics from my alma-mater, and began hiring engineers for this project.<p>I&#x27;m currently earning ~Â£22k (UK, non-London) and they&#x27;ve just offered me 0.1% in options (EMI scheme). They (founders) specifically advised against sharing details of options with other employees but I&#x27;ve discovered they&#x27;ve lowballed the lead frontend engineer also (&lt;0.5%). They further advised that I can ask for excess of 1% in 12 months if I can take on tech lead responsibilities, but this isn&#x27;t in writing and the process for this is completely opaque to me.<p>Is it worth sticking around here? How can I negotiate a (much) higher total compensation for myself?')
