Even if the mob itself was disavowed, simply getting a presiding officer more that would be more sympathetic to the President’s interests int he circumstances (which probably would have taken at least one more removal than “Hang Mike Pence”, but may not have been impractical) would potentially have provided a sufficient pretext for a process in which the Congress would have ended up declaring Trump the winner.<p>But even if it was “obviously going to fail”, that doesn’t make it not-dangerous (even if the intended violence <i>didn’t</i> have the intended political effects, it <i>still</i> would have been horrific) or not-insurrection.<p>&gt; If some foreign intelligence unit tries and fails to overthrow your country’s government, that’s insurrection.<p>No, its a (covert) invasion.<p>&gt; If it’s the doofus who stole the podium or the guy with face paint and a horned fur hat, not so much.<p>How about if it is the retired Air Force Lt. Col. with zip ties who was directing action, including efforts at intelligence gathering on members, in the Senate chamber?<p>Just because the unusual outfits get disproportionate media attention doesn’t mean they were the dominant factor in the insurrection.')
