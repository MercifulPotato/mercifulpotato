It provides good context on what led the country to civil war in 1936, and many of the problems unfortunately prevail nowadays.<p>EDIT: I see I&#x27;m being downvoted, but I stand by my words. I&#x27;ll provide more context though. The Spanish Civil War is the pivotal moment in Spanish history in the 20th century and explains a lot of what Spain is nowadays - from the state of autonom√≠as (autonomous regions), to the bitter divide between Left and Right, or the total inability to reach national agreements on education and other strategic matters. Aside from that it&#x27;s an authoritative and engrossing read.')
