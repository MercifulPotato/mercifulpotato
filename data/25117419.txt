It also had escape hatches for things like context and precedence calculations.<p>In terms of GUI and clicking, I think it might need to be more sophisticated than that.<p>What does clicking mean when you are a clicking on a sum type?  Is it just that variant of the ADT, the entire type?<p>What about for complex expressions?  Are you selecting just a term in that complex expression or the entire expression?<p>I suppose if you were looking at a tree visually then you could select a lot easier.<p>Seeing how other languages do &quot;destructuring&quot; or &quot;pattern matching&quot; might provide other possible alternatives.')
