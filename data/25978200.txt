The port was completely worn out and probably close to completely failing and the battery was noticably degraded after 4 years of heavy use. On top of that the alert slider started acting up on it&#x27;s own.<p>Ofc you could try to replace those parts but I decided it&#x27;s not worth it. It&#x27;s pretty difficult to find a replacement battery that both doesn&#x27;t explode and actually has as much capacity as advertised.')
