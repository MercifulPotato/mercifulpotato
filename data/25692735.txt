You get fired thats for sure, then Chase your bank de-platforms you, you can no longer use their banking services(they have a right to remove you as customer like you said right?) or Verizon says they can no longer have you as customer as well? So you no longer can communicate electronically, or do banking. Lets go further, say Google shuts off your gmail account, you are basically put into the stone age for exercising a right guaranteed to you by the 1st amendment. Scary stuff and we are heading towards this dystopia sooner than you think.')
