I have a genetic disease (no specifics to remain somewhat anonymous) that generally causes me to be in pain 24&#x2F;7. Sometimes it&#x27;s worse, sometimes it&#x27;s better - but it&#x27;s always there. As such I&#x27;ve learned to live with it the best that I can.<p>The last time I went to the ER (a few years ago now) for something unrelated, I was in extreme pain. I&#x27;m used to pain. I can tolerate constant pain pretty well. This pain was way above what I could tolerate.<p>Instead of help from the nurse I got a lecture about lying about drug use and lying about pain. Eventually I got the help I needed but the whole experience was just so degrading at a time I would have preferred to die rather than continue the pain I felt.')
