I think &quot;quietly&quot; is the key:<p>He quietly rewrites it and quietly gets his buddy to accept it.<p>My guess is he scared away a new hire recently by some comment on their PR and is doing his best to avoid doing that mistake again.<p>Again, quietly is key here.<p>I&#x27;ve dealt with some people I&#x27;d consider brilliant a$$holes and this - as far as I can read - is quite far from it.<p>(I&#x27;m not judging on if it is a good or a bad idea, only that I&#x27;d surely take it as a sign that he wants you to stay and want to avoid embarrassing you.)<p>Edit:<p>Re-reading it this caught my eye:<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t want this to be about the fact that I am a minority in tech<p>This makes me even more sure about my conclusion.
