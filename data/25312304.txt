Or at least, it <i>seems</i> the experience of homelessness in the US is worse than in other countries.<p>I wonder how much culture also plays a part in that. In Romania for example, the idea of becoming homeless in the same way as in the US seems so remote and unlikely that most people don&#x27;t ever think about it and I&#x27;m sure you would have a hard time finding people who ever think they would get into that situation. Is the government just doing a great job at hiding these people or exporting them? Is the culture of having a close family saving people from ever hitting rock bottom?<p>I have a lot of questions with few answers and I&#x27;m curious if anyone has any thoughts on the culture&#x2F;US-centric view on this type of homeless.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25312081" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25312081</a>')
