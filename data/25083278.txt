Today, with adequate hobbyist-grade instruments and dev boards available in the $100-200 range pretty much anywhere you look, really, the situation for low level engineers and developers is better than it&#x27;s been for years and, in some ways, even better than the &#x27;70s heyday of homebrew computers.<p>The problem is more the lack of interest.  Low level systems development is hard, a computer engineering degree is hella hard, and all the hype and easy money was in following the webdev career path starting from the late &#x27;90s dotcom boom.')
