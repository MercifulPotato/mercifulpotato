TS is awesome but if I know TS I know how to add types and if I don&#x27;t know TS the examples become hard to follow (remembering from when I didn&#x27;t know TS). I guess it comes down to your target audience but my assumption is Forgo is targeted more towards people who prefer &quot;traditional&quot; for lack of a better word JS concepts.<p>The biggest red flag I noticed was the use of the &quot;rerender&quot; function. It reminds me a bit of writing code in jQuery and manually having to keep track of when the DOM needs updating. Obviously not a huge burden for something small but would be very interested in how it effected larger apps. Seems like a big tradeoff to have to take on that responsibility again.<p>Saying that, the general API of the library is easy to understand and I could imagine being productive with it very quickly.')
