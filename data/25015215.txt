Last 2 seasons of SG-1 was just garbage, Stargate Atlantis was about as cheesy as the 80s Buck Rogers series. But to me Universe stood out as kind of the anti-Star Trek -- instead of the magical space ship that can go anywhere and do anything the plot requires, you&#x27;ve got the dodgy rust bucket that just goes one direction and you can&#x27;t really do much other then be along for the ride. Kind of like the way James Bond was more or less limited to the gadgets that Q gave him at the start of the movie vs cartoon character that can produce any object from its pocket at will.')
