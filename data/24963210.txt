I’d say they’re roughly comparable to mechanical keyboards in this respect.<p>No one at any level of school is required to use fountain pens; typically, students use a mix of graphite pencils, ballpoint pens, and rollerballs.<p>I would expect a large fraction of Americans, maybe even the majority, to be surprised to learn that fountain pens are still in common use anywhere in the world.')
