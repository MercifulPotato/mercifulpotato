Are there financial literacy courses in the US? I know in Canada they reintroduced them a few years ago because banks would push credits card on anyone older than 18 years old and that caused financial problems down the line.<p>I guess what I struggle with when shaping my opinion on this issue is to balance accountability and empathy. I absolutely understand that an 18 years old might not do the math at all  and I find it difficult to support having them struggle for multiple decades because of it. On the other hand, they are adults and by definition they did borrow that money, the lender is &quot;right&quot; to expect to see that money back.')
