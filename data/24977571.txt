What crime, or even what ethical problem do you see with it? Just don&#x27;t buy it if you think it&#x27;s too expensive. It would be one thing if it was a big company that was ordered by the government to give masks to hospitals, but the listings you talk about were likely from individuals who had small stocks that were free to do with those stocks as they pleased.<p>It sounds like you didn&#x27;t want to pay the price that the seller wanted, but instead of simply refusing to buy you tried to go around and try to abuse the reporting system to force them to sell cheaper in a new listing.')
