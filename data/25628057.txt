There are already NICs that have FPGA and a whole set of linux&#x27;s kernel features. You wouldn&#x27;t want that to be that far away from the NIC itself.<p>PTP works just like that - timestamps incoming and outgoing packets right after&#x2F;before packet hit the wire. There is eXpress Data Path that can offload eBPF programs to NICs and deal with packets without them even coming into even kernel at all.<p>High Frequency Traders do exactly that IIRC today.<p>As for video processing codecs today are way too complex to be run there. Well, no one will stop you from running  something like an integer DCT part on FPGA.<p>VR thing... Generally, aside from Nvidia companies don&#x27;t want to ship entire FPGA to end customers (guess why Nvidia G-Sync monitors used to be so expensive). Something like Snapdragon XR2 &quot;solves&quot; VR. Also, in order to render a picture you need to know headset position early, not at the last moment. How would you know what to render?<p>How useful is the subject depends entirely on FPGA capability, and it&#x27;s size. I bet it will be more useful for things like implementing some hash function there or something like that.<p>IMO this will be a very niche product inside already niche market.')
