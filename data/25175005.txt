I think that the world is still somewhat disconnected. How do you find prior research that happened on the other side of the world? There might not be good tools to do so, if we&#x27;re stuck with simple keyword searching or something like that.<p>I think it&#x27;s likely that ancient (or not-so-ancient but far from the roots of European civilization) scholars invented a lot of things before the so-called inventors. Many more than we&#x27;ll ever know about.<p>I usually say something like &quot;It&#x27;s really dumb that we recognize the inventors of things, because if not for that person, someone else would have discovered it in a year, or a decade, or a hundred years, and those potential inventors get no credit&quot; but in this case it might sound like a Westerner trying to downplay the accomplishments of non-Western scholars.')
