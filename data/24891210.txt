On the other hand, these parking tickets are clearly a huge source of money if one bad corner can generate $100,000 per year in tickets (based on a 50% reduction being a $60,000 reduction).<p>Parking tickets aren&#x27;t meant to be an income stream, they&#x27;re meant to be a disincentive program to ensure certain goals are met.<p>Imagine if each major city had a small department consisting of a couple of data engineers, a UX designer, and a sociologist, all working together on programs like preventing parking tickets. I wonder what other avenues such a team could attack to help citizens.')
