I decided pretty early on that I wanted to be an algebraist, but would have to build some mathematical maturity before I could get there, so I had a rather shallow goal in the beginning: to be able to solve the previous years&#x27; math GRE papers. Off the top of my head, these were some of the books that I worked through:<p>1. Spivak&#x27;s Calculus.<p>2. Johnstone&#x27;s Notes on Set Theory and Logic.<p>3. Gamelin&#x27;s Complex Analysis.<p>4. Hoffman &amp; Kunz&#x27; Linear Algebra.<p>5. Dummit &amp; Foote&#x27;s Abstract Algebra; just the group theory.<p>6. Munkres&#x27; Topology; just the general topology.<p>Once I was happy with my preparation, I strived for a deeper understanding of Group Theory. I bumbled through Herstein, but didn&#x27;t understand it very well. Then, I stumbled upon Artin&#x27;s book, and worked through it using the outline provided on the MIT OCW course page, and I could confidently solve most of the exercises.<p>For category theory, the top resources that I would recommend are:<p>1. Mileweski&#x27;s Category Theory for Programmers, the video lecture series. As is always the case with video lectures, this one can help motivate a Haskell programmer uninitiated in category theory.<p>2. Goldblatt&#x27;s Topoi. It&#x27;s fairly dated, but teaches category theory well, via its application to topoi.<p>3. MacLane&#x27;s CatWork. I&#x27;m not especially fond of this one, but it&#x27;s necessary to work through it.<p>The most important thing to understand when learning category theory is that it cannot be learnt in a vacuum: the subject is entirely vacuous, and you need to use it in other mathematical disciplines to give it meaning.<p>Good luck.')
