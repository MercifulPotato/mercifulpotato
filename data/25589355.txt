In this small trivial case, yes that works. But what happens when something in the logic changes?<p>You wind up needing to know the order of calculations since things are no longer lazily evaluated via recursion.  This is a problem when you have dozens of &quot;columns&quot; (i.e. recursive functions or arrays as you are suggesting).  Often times, the value in the array is NULL (or worse, leftover from a previous calculation).  You are left to manually try and re-order the calculations, which is not trivial when there are hundreds of functions.<p>Excel takes care of these details for you automatically.  Users program functionally and recursively (fill-down) without even thinking about it.  Excel reactively updates when dependent values change (re-evaluates as necessary).<p>If power, speed, and scale are necessary, there are purpose-built systems (with Domain Specific Languages) which specifically solve this problem in the insurance domain (e.g. FIS Prophet, Risk Agility, AXIS, etc).')
