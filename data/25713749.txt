They are used in advertisements and as &quot;booth babes&quot;. If the image wasn&#x27;t sexist, then there should have been a 50&#x2F;50 chance of the standard image we use for images being a clipping of a naked man -- but I believe that would never have become a standard image used in CS. I can&#x27;t prove that, but I strongly believe it.')
