Yeah, I&#x27;d agree with you.<p>For desktops &#x2F; laptops, I think either approach can work, depending on your personal preferences.<p>If you prefer a big update that you can schedule, and are okay with setting aside a few days every year or two, and are okay with a repository that gives you &quot;stable&quot; application software that may be quite old, then a release-based distribution might work better for you.<p>If you&#x27;d rather deal with smaller updates, and if you like having a repository that delivers application software updates closer to when they&#x27;re released upstream, then a rolling release might work better for you.')
