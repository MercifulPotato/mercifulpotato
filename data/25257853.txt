More akin to applied sciences than medicine or health.  This, for example, seems to be very important but it still leaves us with a jello jigsaw puzzle with 200 million pieces and probably far removed from immediate utility in health outcomes.<p>Then there’s the more clinically oriented approaches of looking at effects, trying to find associated genes&#x2F;mutations whatever mechanisms exist in between to cause a desirable or undesirable outcome. I’d call that ‘top down’.<p>I’m sure the lines get blurred more every day, but is there a meaningful distinction into these and&#x2F;or more categories that are working the problem from both ends?  If so, are there associated terms of art for them?')
