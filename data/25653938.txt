Quick way to a nice putrid hair conditioning!<p>And let&#x27;s not talk about the condition of the tracks and how much electricity is being wasted by the poorly lubricated trains and tracks. Those thunderous sounds when the subway passes? That is the sound of energy being wasted, being converted to sound energy instead of locomotion.<p>I hate everything about NYC except the melting pot of intellectual diversity that it is.<p>P.S. I still live here, so don&#x27;t tell me that my perspective is an outsider&#x27;s one.')
