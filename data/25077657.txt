This is even where you can find great product ideas to solve problems for other companies while getting paid to build a solution.  So I wouldn&#x27;t say just because they can afford it they will bring it in house, generally I found that not to be true. Of course there are exceptions, one is large tech companies which have a tendency to bring lots of stuff in house even if they really shouldn&#x27;t.<p>As for finding my first clients, I turned to companies I had worked for prior, turned to friends who still worked at other companies to get my foot in the door.  I started meeting as many people as possible and started speaking at local and regional events as often as I could.  I&#x27;d sign up at the chamber of commerce and see what new companies were coming in, opening facilities, plants etc and see if there was a vendor list I could get on etc.  A hint I learned, being on the vendor list for a large company even if you have never delivered anything to them can give you assumed credibility.  When I couldn&#x27;t afford trade shows I&#x27;d volunteer for companies and go work their booth, do setup or whatever I could in exchange for getting me through the door and allowing me time to explore and network.<p>Also, networking outside your defined niche is still good as you build your network.  I used to joke it was like the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon, I didn&#x27;t have to meet my exact client but I needed to meet someone who could introduce me to another company and keep that going.  Along the way you pay the kindness back with your own referrals, help etc.  It is way easier to type this out than to do it, but the only way to do it is just to do it.')
