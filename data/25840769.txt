If I don&#x27;t run out of steam, I&#x27;ll port the features from the extension next (yes, there&#x27;s also a browser extension :)), mainly the ability to click and scrape dynamic javascript pages.<p>What functionality would you like to see in such a project? More built-in plugins covering a wider range of scraping scenarios? More storage options? Additional browser support?<p>Any feedback is appreciated. Thank you :)')
