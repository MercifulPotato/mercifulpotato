If you&#x27;re desperate and say &quot;Okay, we are hiring the smartest guy we can find to build our new CPU, and give everything he needs to make it happen&quot;, then perhaps you get the AMD64, Zen or the A4 and A5. If you try to just dump a smart guy into a team as just another engineer, maybe you get nothing, like Intel.<p>Perhaps AMD, who already knew him, just gave Keller everything he need to build a team that can deliver on a new architecture, even when he&#x27;s no longer there. Same with Apple. Intel on the other hand may have been unwilling to grant Keller the same level of autonomy and control. Then it also makes sense that he would leave Intel, for personal reasons, those being: &quot;I can&#x27;t work here, they won&#x27;t let me do my job&quot;.')
