I do not use the browser itself to try to control the browser&#x27;s activity.  I do not use browser settings, dev tools, extensions, etc., which seem to be the more popular choice.<p>As I mentioned in the original comment, some websites, like banks for example, will log the user out after a period of insactivity.  Whereas tech companies, always trying to collect more data, may encourage users to &quot;stay logged in&quot;, ideally forever.<p>Having session cookies expire could be an option that users could control.  The user could choose to have the site log her out after x minutes of inactivity, or some such.  The site could agree to &quot;expire&quot; the session cookie on the server side such that it could not be used again.  How would the user signal her chosen option to the site.  I leave that to the reader.  Perhaps an HTTP header sent with the initial log in request: Session-Cookie-Max-Age: [seconds]')
