With Resolve (which I far prefer in terms of UI), it&#x27;s <i>tragic</i> how slow it is - about 2 minutes to render a 30 second HD clip that has stereo audio and nothing else on it.  That&#x27;s 15 seconds in Premiere. So I&#x27;m hoping that a future upgrade to a RTX30 series GPU will turn the tables and I&#x27;ll be able to use Resolve seriously..')
