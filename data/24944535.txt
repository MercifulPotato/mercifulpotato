Aren&#x27;t you actually spouting hate speech right now? You were so quick to virtue signal that you resorted &quot;hate speech&quot;.<p>&gt; is not the same as denying someone a place to email unproven allegations about the son of a politician with an eye to unduly influence an election.<p>You are right. Cake is superficial nonsense. Free speech is actually important. Imagine if the story about being denied the cake was censored. Imagine if the cake story was censored for being disinformation - which it turned out it was.<p>I&#x27;d rather be denied a cake than to be denied the ability to speak about being denied the cake.
