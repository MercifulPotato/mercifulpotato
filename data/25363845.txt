That would be a good start. Fascism has basically begun to mean &quot;anything outside of the far left orthodoxy.&quot; People were calling Trump a fascist for his entire presidency, when the main thing that characterized his presidency was irresponsible ANTI-authoritarianism. His administration deregulated and defunded public institutions. Lowering taxes, pulling back business regulations, pulling out of climate agreements and pulling back restrictions on energy production. I&#x27;m not saying these things are good or bad, they&#x27;re just explicitly anti-authoritarian, and the precise opposite of fascism. Questioning the election results were the first fascist-adjacent action taken that weren&#x27;t policies shared by the left, such as trade regulations.')
