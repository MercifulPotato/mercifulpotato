After she was up to it, I took her out to a movie.  Got her out of the van, into a wheelchair, into the theater.  We sat through the trailers, and were just about to get to the movie that we actually wanted to see...<p>... when our oldest called, saying that our youngest was throwing up, and we needed to come home now.  All that work (<i>way</i> more work than usual), and we never got to see the movie.  If we had been watching it at home, we would have just paused it.<p>On the other hand, if we had been watching it at home, we would have been watching it with the kids, not just with each other.  That&#x27;s fine, if that&#x27;s what you want.  But if you want some time together as adults, it doesn&#x27;t work.')
