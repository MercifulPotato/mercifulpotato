Nowadays, with your main concern being service throughput, the bigger concern is your architecture, not your implementation.<p>Which is where the confusion is, possibly. Architectures you can&#x27;t easily undo; that loop or choice of data structure you can. So it&#x27;s generally worth giving careful consideration towards your architecture (it&#x27;s not premature to ask &quot;What happens when this one thing becomes two?&quot;)); it&#x27;s generally not worth giving the thought towards your implementation.')
