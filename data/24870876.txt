You can&#x27;t do much with it before you have to start paying them (a lot).<p>In the early days of the Facebook API, I made a cool little MacOS screen saver &#x2F; visualizer with its data (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5ZnB14BVjlE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5ZnB14BVjlE</a>). I&#x27;d love to build some similar tech experiments with Twitter, but their API &quot;Sandbox&quot; allows only 250 API requests  per month before you have to start paying them hundreds to thousands of dollars for just a few hundred more. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.twitter.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;search-30day" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.twitter.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;search-30day</a><p>I feel this seriously limits what developers can do with Twitter. It&#x27;s such a rich source of data that could be explored in so many interesting ways, but it&#x27;s all locked away. It&#x27;s not worth even building a cool little thing to share <i>on Twitter</i> as just showing it on the Internet anywhere will use up all the API requests immediately. Hurts potential innovations built off the platform.')
