The AWS networking section is particularly problematic and in need of extensive disclaimers or changes to the test methodology.<p>On the throughput side, all this test does is demonstrate the documented[1] throughput limit for a <i>single</i> TCP connection. 10 Gbps if the two instances are in the same placement group and 5 Gbps otherwise. The reason some of the network-optimized instances were &quot;slower&quot; than the non-optimized ones was because it was simply a random draw of whether both instances in the test were physically close to each other.<p>If they wanted to do a proper throughput test they would have used placement groups and multiple connections&#x2F;flows. If they felt like the single flow test case was important they should have mentioned that AWS has a specific limitation around this. Personally I don&#x27;t think a single flow test case is particularly realistic.<p>The fact that the obvious discrepancy between their results and the documented (multi-flow) limits didn&#x27;t cause them to dig deeper is enough to make me very skeptical of the purpose of this paper.<p>The latency results are also basically a random spread. It is essentially distribution of all the different latencies you might randomly get between two instances if you <i>don&#x27;t</i> use placement groups. It says absolutely nothing about the networking capabilities of different instances used in each test.<p>1. &quot;Single TCP flow is limited to 10 Gbps for instances in the same placement group and 5 Gbps between instances anywhere else.&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;whitepapers&#x2F;latest&#x2F;ec2-networking-for-telecom&#x2F;overall-instance-bandwidth-limitations.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;whitepapers&#x2F;latest&#x2F;ec2-networkin...</a>')
