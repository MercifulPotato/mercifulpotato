The bonus is that they are free (subsidized by Santa Fe Institute). It&#x27;s definitely a niche audience, but what they are teaching is very current.<p>I occasionally see links to some of the instructors&#x27; other works here on HN, so it is probably a good fit.<p>Also, there is Lynda.com. Where I live, you get free access to Lynda courses with your library card. Pretty amazing deal. I don&#x27;t know how wide spread that is, though. I&#x27;ve taken some of their coding courses years ago and they were pretty good. They&#x27;re constantly updated, so sometimes the search function is a bit hairy though.')
