Electoral votes per state are based on population not population density, but with an additional 2 each.  That tips the scale in favor of states with smaller populations.<p>E.g. Rhode Island and Idaho both have 4 electoral votes, but Rhode Island is certainly not rural.<p>Idaho also has a population of 1.8 million compared to 1.0 million in Rhode Island, so technically Rhode Island voters have more voting power than their rural counterparts in Idaho.<p>Anyways these are just cherry picked states; my point is that the Electoral College is designed to give a disproportionate vote to smaller states, not rural states.')
