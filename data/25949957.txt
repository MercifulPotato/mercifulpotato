Some great improvements but there are other issues at hand than just personal identity of the users and remaining anonymous to the system so that advertisers subject them to their propaganda.<p>People have weaknesses. Being targeted  can be abusive to them even if they are adults and anonymous to the system.<p>An example would be a person  with say  body dysmorphia and where the advertisers  would target the person to have plastic surgeries. That adds fuel to the fire and I have witnessed something to that effect with a person I know. Insecurities that are being harvested for cash and it is not helping anyone.<p>People can search for what they need themselves.  Why do they need to be bombarded with this stuff. Make better visual search engines so people can find what they need when they need it and not before or after.<p>Unless the advertiser are prevented from using targeting doctrine, it will not stop.')
