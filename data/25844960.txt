But in practical terms it would just limit 32 bit systems to 31 bits of adressable memory, or make pointer arithmetics wierd. The latter isnt that much of a problem, as its only when pointers are basic types it matters, and free pointer arithmetics is a mistake whose only advantage is compiler speed, not even application speed.<p>For instance, even in slicing, [start:end) eliminates this issue. Though there is something to be said for verbosity.<p>I think this becomes an argument for 0 based indexing, but a case could be made to the opposite.<p>That said, consistency is what is valuable, so the only truly wrong answer would be the one we use in real life.')
