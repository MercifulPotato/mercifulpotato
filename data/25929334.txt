While at the hospital, my wife and I noticed that no questions at all were addressed to me (the husband), particularly questions that I could have answered while she was in pain during delivery.<p>Afterward, we were provided with a form to fill out for the birth certificate, which required a parental signature.  I filled the form out and returned it to the office, at which point I noticed that the clerk <i>changed the signature</i> to state my wife&#x27;s name when inputting it into the system.<p>Later in the day, a social worker came by and began to ask questions about my income (when I told her I worked for one of the large tech companies, she immediately left and stopped questioning me).  She independently took my wife aside to ask questions, and my wife later told me that she did not ask about her income, but did ask to make sure she was not being abused, a question I was never asked.<p>All in all, we felt it was a very poor experience (not to mention multiple mistakes were made during delivery because the anesthesiologist was distracted by the television), and we were surprised by the degree of sexism in what we thought was one of the more progressive cities in the U.S.')
