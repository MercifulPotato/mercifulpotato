Item(by='uberman', descendants=None, kids=[25339539], score=None, time=1607371819, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25335807, text='I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I actually prefer tacos and burritos made from &quot;Grillers Prime Crumble&quot; but I think that has more to do with not having to deal with the extra grease in my already sufficiently moist &quot;texmex&quot;. So, I am empathetic to the &quot;why not just use soy and flour argument&quot; (as far as taco filling goes) but don&#x27;t image I will ever be pleased to eat petri-meat. The thing I can&#x27;t get passed is (for me anyways) &quot;lab grown&quot; meat is just gross, no matter how it is reconstituted.<p>I&#x27;ll never mentally separate &quot;lab-grown beef&quot; from &quot;soylent green&quot; or whatever the human goo was called in Cloud Atlas. I would gladly eat the garbage parts that end up in a &quot;Ball Park Frank&quot; than any petri-dish cow. Even if they call it wagyu and massage it in sake, I&#x27;m not going to eat it and I can&#x27;t imagine how anyone else would.<p>Part is parts (as they say) and if surplus parts end up making my hot dogs tasty then I&#x27;m glad to do my share to make sure as much of the <i>&quot;real&quot;</i> cow is used as possible.')
