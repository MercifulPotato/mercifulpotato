They especially liked the one with maze solving: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.code.org&#x2F;hoc&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.code.org&#x2F;hoc&#x2F;1</a> of course we tried others later.Then we tried some ScrachJr - they really like creating short clips with all family members as  characters. ScratchJr makes it easy to use face photographs on animated characters. They could easily spend  3 hours doing just that which proves that they must really like it (it&#x27;s  hard for my 6 year old son to concentrate on one thing only for that long). Now we are trying a programmable robot from Lego Boost (set 17101). They like to play with it for sure but we have it only since Christmas so that&#x27;s not that long.')
