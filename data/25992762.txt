I&#x27;m currently writing the build system I&#x27;ve wanted for 16 years: no change to your workflow, cooperates with existing build systems, handles multi-stage builds, works with any language, and the first version will support offloading builds to fast cloud systems to compile 12-120x faster than a developer laptop. I&#x27;m seeking sponsors to continue working on Rust and build systems full-time.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sponsors&#x2F;joshtriplett&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sponsors&#x2F;joshtriplett&#x2F;</a>')
