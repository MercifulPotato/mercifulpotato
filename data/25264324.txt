It&#x27;s a disguised Trump apologist piece.<p>Look near the end where he describes Trump helping a dictator as a good thing because &quot;it brings the corruption out in the open&quot;. Laughably stupid defence unless you believe the deep state pizza place pedo conspiracies, then it&#x27;s 4D chess.<p>He goes on to explain that Trump has publicly done many corrupt and terrible things that you normally don&#x27;t see because &quot;they&#x27;re in the shadows&quot;. This is just the 4chan deep state crap that&#x27;s been pushed by crazies ever since it turned out Obama was actually a US citizen, to everyone&#x27;s surprise. It&#x27;s far more likely that Trump is just corrupt and doing terrible things because that&#x27;s what he does.')
