Defenders here are quoting <i>Tucker Carlson</i> for God&#x27;s sake -- whose defense team in court persuasively argued that no reasonable person should expect to hear the truth from his show. Comments are barely falling short of singing &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; while breathlessly decrying the existential threat this tempest in a teacup poses to our nation.<p>We in the US are not voting for Hunter Biden and no business meetings in the Ukraine or China took place. Hence, attempting to legitimize this nothingburger <i>is</i> disinformation when it is perpetrated in the closing weeks of a US Presidential election. Fear, uncertainty, doubt all wrapped up in a puff of smoke.  Something something before the truth has a chance to lace up its boots, and all that.<p>The cynical streak in me has to wonder if this isn&#x27;t simply some kind of clickbait market-share grab by The Intercept.')
