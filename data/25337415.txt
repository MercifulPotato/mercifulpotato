It was a key drive behind &quot;mobile first&quot; efforts back when Microsoft worked hard on Windows Phone. It&#x27;s been diminished since, but the effort hasn&#x27;t disappeared. Most recently the Surface Pro X has been a return to Windows on ARM. The Surface Pro X is useful to mention for several reasons including things like Electron on M1 wouldn&#x27;t have happened so fast if Microsoft hadn&#x27;t put so much work into Chromium on ARM for Surface Pro X, and also that the Pro X was the first device to ship Microsoft&#x27;s x86 (32-bit) emulation for traditional Win32 applications. (Microsoft also has in the beta pipeline x64 emulation for Windows on ARM.) Microsoft isn&#x27;t necessarily in danger of losing their &quot;moat&quot; in any switch&#x2F;focus to ARM at this point, given the wide variety of applications known to work out of the box on the Surface Pro X today (with more support&#x2F;compatibility again already in the beta pipeline).')
