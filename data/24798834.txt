You say, if I wanted to write good HTTP client I should decide not to use TCP because TCP is meant to relieve the user from managing datagrams?<p>The reality is, when you design a client library you work with what you have and in case when you are writing HTTP client what you have is TCP on one side and a user application on the other side that expects maximum performance and minimum latency possible (just look at the benchmarks on the net that compare tens of frameworks in competition for who can produces largest TPS of hello world with lowest latency).')
