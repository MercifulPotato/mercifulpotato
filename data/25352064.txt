Basically don&#x27;t take my opinion for it and just look at how the corporate world has responded to licenses:<p>1) GPLv2: a legacy license still dominating e.g. Linux and other projects that simply never switched and leaves enough legal loop holes to not block commercial usage. Huge commercial success and arguably what bootstrapped the OSS world.<p>2) Apache 2.0. Huge commercial success and together with the MIT &amp; BSD style licenses the no brainer go to license for anyone wanting to release some software under reasonable terms. These licenses dominate the vast majority of Github projects.<p>3) GPLv3 &amp; AGPL v3. Only used by 1) people with outlier opinions on freedom related topics (trying to be diplomatic here). 2) companies looking to dual license their software under a highly restrictive commercial license or a highly restrictive OSS licenses. Technically free but limiting in practice in what you are actually allowed to do to the point where you probably need to worry about signing a proper deal for a proprietary license. Which is a different way of saying that it is not free at all You are not free to do what you want and you are certainly not free to build a business on top of the software; that requires a non free closed source license. The OSS limitations with respect to any form of commercial applications are kind of the whole point for the companies choosing this license: it practically leaves their users no other choice than their commercial license. Whatever your opinion on this, these licenses are considered problematic by most corporate legal departments and simply not widely used by companies with such departments for this reason.')
