However, it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how well new competitors can fair in an industry like social media where the product (i.e. us) is already near monopolized on a few large platforms.<p>Personally, I like Parler&#x27;s interface, and don&#x27;t mind that it&#x27;s kind of a conservative bent, but I&#x27;ve heard from other conservatives that the interface isn&#x27;t as good as Twitters. And it&#x27;s smaller audience is already keeping some big-names away from it, even people who would theoretically really like the platform, like Ben Shapiro or Scott Adams.
