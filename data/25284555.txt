Item(by='gfody', descendants=None, kids=[25284692], score=None, time=1606962584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25284451, text='sorry you missed my ninja-edit - it sounds like SOME lateral join queries CAN be efficiently maintained but not ALL (not the ones that are surprisingly expensive for whatever reason) that&#x27;s where the promise of &quot;we can materialize any query!&quot; starts to fall apart for me. presumably the surprisingly expensive cases are the ones where some rewrite rules can&#x27;t guarantee correctness without hiding indexes or predicate pushdowns or whatever - the doc says review the explain plan first but what precisely about the explain plan would tell me that the materialized view won&#x27;t be efficiently maintained? ideally these cases can be known ahead of time so I can come up with a conformant query rather than trying variations to see what works.<p>..and more to the point, there are obviously limits to what can be efficiently maintained. I would love to see that list as this is what would give me a good idea of how Materialize compares to my daily driver RDBMS which happens to be SQL Server and whose limits I&#x27;m unfortunately intimately familiar.')
