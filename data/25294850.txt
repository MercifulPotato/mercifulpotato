The fact that they are hiring other people for other spots in the org chart (and they might be able to swap people) does not change that they are positions.<p>&gt;You have to answer questions like “why are you unable to hire an American” and it’s like... well we are. We’re hiring many many Americans.<p>Saying no to this question means you are not hiring a US resident <i>for this position.</i> You&#x27;re hiring many US residents for other positions. That seems...accurate?<p>Are you thinking that, if a company hires X number of US residents, that should entitle them to hire Y non-US residents? I&#x27;m not trying to be obtuse - I want to understand what a non &quot;incoherent&quot; policy would look like for you.')
