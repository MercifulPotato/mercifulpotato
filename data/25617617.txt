His schizophrenia made him think that he was married to a Youtuber, that Larry Page was watching his videos, and that he had a telepathic connection to Elon Musk. There&#x27;s a good video about him and TempleOS by Fredrick Knudsen. [1]<p>&gt; Instead of being elitist and shooting down his contributions, the computer science crowd could have focused on getting this member of the community the help he would have needed concerning other parts of life.<p>I think a lot of the CS community enjoyed seeing his contributions, especially here on Hacker News in the later days of his life. I know that people wanted to help him, but I&#x27;m not sure how much could&#x27;ve been done beyond what his family was doing, honestly. Some people tried to help and ended up making things worse.<p>&gt; I would love to look at its source code though!<p>I want to make some more videos about just that, but in the meantime, the source code is included in the operating system (since everything except the boot code is JIT), and if you ever want to develop inside TempleOS, you&#x27;ll be referring to it a whole lot I can tell you that :D<p>(Terry Davis mirrored the OS online with a DolDoc -&gt; HTML tool, you can browse the source code &#x2F; system files on the archived site [2])<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;UCgoxQCf5Jg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;UCgoxQCf5Jg</a>\n2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;templeos.holyc.xyz&#x2F;Wb&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;templeos.holyc.xyz&#x2F;Wb&#x2F;</a>')
