Wordpress is a great content management system. From a content writer&#x27;s perspective, it is perhaps the best way to write and publish content. And it does offer a simple, integrated solution.<p>But Biilmann is also right. The Javascript world (React, Vue, the npm ecosystem, ES6&#x2F;7+), modularized services like Stripe, Algolia, etc, plus eg Git, have passed the Wordpress development ecosystem by.<p>Wordpress needs a bridge to modern development, so people can get the best of both worlds. That&#x27;s how we see Gatsby, so we built a source plugin to import content, built Gatsby Cloud to do live content previews, created incremental builds to match the instant content go-live experience.<p>There&#x27;s a great quote from Jason Bahl, the maintainer of WPGraphQL, on this: &quot;I don’t see Jamstack competing against WordPress. This isn’t a zero sum game. If the Gatsby + WordPress experience can allow users to use the best CMS in the world while using modern dev tooling, it’s a win all around.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wptavern.com&#x2F;matt-mullenweg-and-jamstack-community-square-off-making-long-term-bets-on-the-predominant-architecture-for-the-web" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wptavern.com&#x2F;matt-mullenweg-and-jamstack-community-s...</a>')
