The brain is lazy and doesn&#x27;t process it as 7 whereas the relevant part (7) is left out to deceive the customer into buying the product (marketing trick is probably straight out of book of Edward Bernays).<p>Instead, the product should be good on its own merit; so for me its an orange flag (or rather: proper, informative rounding is a green flag).<p>We see it elsewhere too. 199 instead of 200. 999 instead of 1000.
