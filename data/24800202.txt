I don&#x27;t want people to do same builds again and again especially for Rust it&#x27;s painful.<p>I want to install binaries with cargo instead of doing the same build again and again.

Or perhaps it can&#x27;t do guarantees like the ones Nix gives to allow binaries being shared of builds.<p>This is the main reason that makes interfacing with Rust as a plain user a pain.')
