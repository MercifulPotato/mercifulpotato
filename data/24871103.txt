Many things have sublinear utility (Money is often assumed to have a log or square-root utility).<p><i>speed</i> often has this effect magnified because what people actually care about is <i>time</i> and time is the inverse of speed.  Lets say that doing task Z takes X + Y time.  At some point increasing the performance of Y has no measurable gain in utility because X dominates.')
