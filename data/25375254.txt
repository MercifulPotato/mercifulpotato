They were as free as I am today to move from one place to another, settle and make a life for themselves. And they were not privileged at all. My other worked hard as a nurse, working  more hours than the average person works today and my father was a waiter in a restaurant, always struggling, yet they had freedom to move to Belgium first and then they had the freedom to move to Austria to work and live there too, before the EU decided to give us &quot;freedoms&quot;. I was born as a free human being and refuse to accept that the only reason why I was able to move to the UK is because the EU was so graceful to give me the freedom of movement. If I wanted to I could move to any other country in the world which isn&#x27;t part of the EU as well, so clearly my freedom has nothing to do with the current 4 &quot;freedoms&quot;.')
