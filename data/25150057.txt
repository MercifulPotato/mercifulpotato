I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an exaggeration to say that this redefines how we think about a laptop. Whereas previously a laptop was something that spent the bulk of its time plugged in, and only capable of short bursts of number-crunching&#x2F;gaming due to thermal and battery limitations, I can literally get a good few hours of gaming untethered on this machine. And this is a base-level MacBook Air, I imagine the Pros are even better.<p>I&#x27;ve owned a few &quot;gaming&quot; laptops, but until the M1 MBA I haven&#x27;t had one that run games for more than an hour while on battery power, and even then it sounded like a jet taking off.<p>Software support is another, though Rosetta works surprisingly well, the general lack of Mac support in games combined with the removal of 32-bit support in Catalina mean, you&#x27;re not exactly spoiled for choice.')
