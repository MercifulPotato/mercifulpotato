I am willing to bet that, as part of a plea deal, all past logs they keep (which is likely all of them to day one) will be provided to FinCEN, which may or may not make it public at some point.<p>FinCEN is a few notches below the NSA.

And the history is immutable - it&#x27;s possible, even likely, that 20 years from now, many mixer logs will have become public enough. Anything on the blockchain stays there for posterity.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fincen.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;first-bitcoin-mixer-penalized-fincen-violating-anti-money-laundering-laws" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fincen.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;first-bitcoin-mixe...</a>')
