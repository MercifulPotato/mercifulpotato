In a way he&#x27;s already doing what he wants for a living.<p>If he had a bajillion dollars, might he be doing other things? Sure. But that doesn&#x27;t mean his only interest is money, it&#x27;s uncertain whether he&#x27;d be doing a variation of the same things. Seems plausible he&#x27;d do a video about what it&#x27;s like to be mega rich.<p>People who are only in it for money are often doing quite mundane things. Would I have stopped my paperroute if I had loads of money as a kid? Yes. Would I stop coding altogether? Probably not, I like it.')
