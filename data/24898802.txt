It&#x27;s not Corporate that&#x27;s the real problem, it&#x27;s the fact that what you&#x27;re working on is probably just not that interesting. Plus the fact that you have to keep slugging away with it whether you like it or not. No-one gets excited about writing accounts packages.<p>It reminds me of an anecdote a pro photographer gave to someone thinking of entering the field: if you love photography, really love it, then don&#x27;t do it professionally.<p>Be an amateur. Fun fact: the word &quot;amateur&quot; derives from Latin &quot;amatorem&quot;, meaning &quot;lover, friend&quot;.')
