It will be like wanting to redistribute oxygen or dirt -- two resources so abundant they are essentially free.<p>This is hopeless naive. There are more houses than there are homeless people, and yet the prices of houses continues to rise. Dirt and oxygen are not hoarded because they are impossible to hoard, anything that can be hoarded will be hoarded.')
