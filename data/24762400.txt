This ensures that we are able to maintain a cohesive view of the entire &quot;user&quot; across all their devices, browsers etc (so long as the Heap customer has a method for identifying their end user).<p>A classic example is pre- and post- signup behavior for a single user. When a user first lands on a page, they will be anonymous and lack a canonical identity. They may come from specific referrers (search, ad, social media, direct), land on a specific page, or engage with certain parts of the site. All of these actions are tracked and stored using an anonymous id. After the user creates an account and is assigned a canonical id (via the `identify` API call), we still want to associate all the previously tracked data with the canonical identity. This allows our users to perform analyses using events and data points from before and after identification.<p>&gt; merge the entire set of anonymous ids<p>In the previous example the &quot;set of anonymous ids&quot; is just a single ID. There are use cases were a user may already have a canonical identity but we want to change&#x2F;update that canonical id. In this case, we are merging all the data associated with both canonical identities (set of anonymous id&#x27;s associated with the canonical user and the set of ids associated with the new canonical identity) and creating a single combined user with a cohesive view of all actions on our customer&#x27;s site&#x2F;app etc.')
