I have at least 4 messaging apps on my phone and I still prefer that over debugging a proxy. A missed message causes real-world problems, so it&#x27;s important not to mess with the delicate balance that IM already carries.<p>If the benefit is easier archival and search, give me a solution to that that works in the background rather than a real-time proxy.')
