Personally, I didn&#x27;t see any. They pretty much kept to themselves, at least for the last year or so. That doesn&#x27;t mean there wasn&#x27;t any, but they had a far higher bar to clear than other subs. It also seemed like quite a coincidence that they were banned just before the crucial period leading up to the election.<p>You say &quot;issuing death threats&quot; like it was mandated by the mods. As far as I could tell, the mods were doing what they could to keep everybody contained within their zone. And the premise of Reddit is that anybody can create their zone; if you don&#x27;t like it, you don&#x27;t have to view it.<p>My point is, the counterargument that they were banned due to bad behavior seems to be slightly misleading. Every sub has bad behavior, and I know for a fact (because I saw it!) that the mods were clamping down hard on anything remotely like what you mention. The community was downvoting such comments too.<p><i>along with the left leaning subreddit chapotraphouse which engaged in similar behaviour</i><p>Can you be more specific? &#x2F;r&#x2F;LateStageCapitalism is still up, and they seem to &quot;issue death threats&quot; just as frequently. For example, they frequently reference guillotines while gesturing towards the rich.')
