To executives focused on customers, sales, product - this is an even more interesting issue because it has really nothing to do directly with the company itself.<p>Most customer segmentation problems can be solved with an optional feature or a new product line -  make both chunky marinara sauce and a smooth variety.<p>Most employee problems can be solved similarly  - optional programs, different roles for different folks, etc.<p>But this problem is unique because a certain segment of the employee+customer base is asking the complete company to take their side in certain matters. Of course the company taking that stand alienates the other segment of the population.<p>However, rationally, it becomes much easier to deal with this than what Coinbase did.<p>It seems though that the vocal side (liberal) is vocal because they care about companies stances on these matters, while the silent (conservatives) are silent because they don&#x27;t seem to care as much.<p>Therefore, rationally, companies generally take the liberal position or no position at all.<p>When conservatives listen to politically-left company seminars, see liberal company statements, etc - they mostly just ignore and move on with their day. I don&#x27;t think many conservatives would be motivated to quit or boycott a company due to a liberal company seminar that they disagree with. I get the feeling (due to the walkouts, etc) that liberals are much more likely to sever relationships due to differences in political beliefs.')
