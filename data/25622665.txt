The &quot;compression&quot; (whatever that is) described in the article with the neuron analogy isn&#x27;t limited to humans. Then I don&#x27;t even understand how a psychologists can misrepresent neuronal communication in such a terrible way.<p>&gt; Your brain compresses away the physical differences of these objects and in the process, you understand that they have a similar function.<p>That&#x27;s abstraction again. In many animals the compression is probably even stronger, the tiger looks on the elephant with a human riding on top and still approximates it to a somewhat strange looking elephant, because it&#x27;s good enough, for a tiger it&#x27;s better to focus all the attention on gazelles instead  and succeed in hunting.')
