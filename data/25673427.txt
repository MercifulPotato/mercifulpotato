Item(by='jacurtis', descendants=None, kids=[25675363, 25676016], score=None, time=1610038174, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25670626, text='&gt; a couple thousand lost per month isn&#x27;t an unreasonable estimate.<p>This was the mid-to-late 80&#x27;s... it wasn&#x27;t THAT long ago. The majority of people reading this were alive back then. Yes interest rates were higher in the 80s and 90s, but not as high as you are insinuating. At this time (from my memory) you could expect about 1% per year in interest. Maybe upwards of 2% annual interest if you had a very generous deal with a bank, but even that is unlikely.<p>At 1% a year, his $100,000 is generating ~$83 per month in interest.<p>Granted he could do other things with his money to appreciate it. Which would increase his time value of money. But the opportunity cost of checking&#x2F;savings account interest was pretty small.<p>Granted the guy was stupid to begin with for even thinking he could win this contest and for putting $100k in cash in his house in case... I don&#x27;t know, someone broke in or something... wait, that&#x27;s what happened.')
