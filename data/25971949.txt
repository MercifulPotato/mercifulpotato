You might simply be moving some write amplification out of the SSD and into the filesystem, while losing some performance in the process. Which is why it really depends on your workload, and to some extent on the specific SSD in question. I&#x27;m not convinced that ashift=14 is a sensible one size fits all recommendation, even if we&#x27;re talking only about recent-model consumer-grade NAND SSDs.')
