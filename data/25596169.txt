Solar obviously cannot fulfill that demand. Wind also can&#x27;t because it is too unreliable. So we do need some storage technology, and hydrogen is one of the options. It seems way cheaper than using Lithium-Ion batteries, but might be still more expensive than, say, pumping water uphill and using that to power a hydroelectric plant.<p>Energy transmission can be some solution here, but we might be forced to transmit energy across the continents (so, for example solar plant in Sahara delivers power to New York City at night) which probably is too costly.')
