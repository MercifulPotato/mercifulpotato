You’ll get a prison sentence if you’re convicted of carrying a knife more than once.<p>This blows my mind a little bit. I have a Swiss Army knife (among a ton of other things) in a waistbag that I carry most places I go. It proved very useful a few times, but other than &quot;in case I need it&quot; I don&#x27;t have a particular reason I carry it. It seems really dystopian to me that in the UK, I could get 4 years in prison for that.')
