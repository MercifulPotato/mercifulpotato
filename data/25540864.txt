The baby will take up your life. You might even resent the child at first. This is only for the first 2 years though. Just slog through it and don&#x27;t take too many risks in life. The next child gets easier as you get more experience. There&#x27;s an awful lot to learn, but you&#x27;ll learn fine.<p>I also recommend spending a little time with them, a minimum of 10 minutes. Listen to them, observe them, and let them figure things on their own. Babies know how to communicate at 2 months. By 6 months, they usually know how to say no or yes, in their own way (nodding, grouchy faces, and so on).<p>Every child is different too. Entirely different behaviors, and much of it is nature. They&#x27;ll act very different to what&#x27;s normally documented, and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to know the effects of your parenting.<p>The biggest mistake people do with newborns is not giving them enough sleep. Newborns have trouble sleeping when they&#x27;re tired, and are tired because they don&#x27;t have enough sleep. They tire out after about 5 min of playing. Don&#x27;t go out at night with the baby, let them sleep at 7 PM.')
