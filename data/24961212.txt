Item(by='mlthoughts2018', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604253596, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24960215, text='&gt; “ Your first comment is a personal attack, and so is this one. You continue calling the first commenter you replied to a &quot;thug&quot;.”<p>No, you are wrong. The parent commenter expressed thuggish ideas - <i>they</i> did that and it is critical to hold them to account for it.<p>I didn’t make them state awful thuggish repressive comments like completely voiding out core personal identities of coworkers. I am not putting any spin or embellishment on their comment - they chose to write it. Calling it thuggish or arrogant is not unfair or insulting whatsoever - that is unequivocally what <i>they</i> chose to express.<p>It deserves to be called out and for people to stand against that type of repressive attitude. It is absolutely not insulting or personally attacking to do so. The commenter’s words simply have these consequences, regardless of you using completely unsubstantiated gainsaying to reply to me.<p>The original comment is deeply uncivil, and it highlights extremely broken community norms if you or others think that a reply which calls out that lack of civility (where calling it <i>thuggish</i> or <i>arrogant</i> is absolutely <i>fair</i> and <i>not an insult at all</i> based on the comment’s own terms) is somehow itself uncivil.')
