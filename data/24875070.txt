Smart contracts are the most ethical contracts possible.\nThe DAO was just poorly coded, there is nothing wrong with Ethereum itself. It&#x27;s the smart contract developer&#x27;s fault if they can&#x27;t test their contracts properly. It doesn&#x27;t facilitate abuse of any kind, this is not a good argument. Ethereum is the second most valuable cryptocurrency for a good reason.<p>Also, your comment was heavily downvoted, thus proving by consensus that it is incorrect.')
