A starfish is not a fish, at least not in the &#x27;proper&#x27; sense, but since they&#x27;re star shaped animals that live in the water they are logically called &#x27;star<i>fish</i>.&#x27;  Jellyfish, cuttlefish, and shellfish are more examples.<p>You may find it interesting that Melville&#x2F;Ishmael uses walruses as an example of an animal that isn&#x27;t a fish, because they are amphibious.')
