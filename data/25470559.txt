I sometimes tell candidates straight out &quot;you can look at them like lottery tickets&quot;. I would absolutely not hire someone if they say something like &quot;The salary is too low, but that&#x27;s ok, the stock options will make up for it&quot; - I would immediately correct them and educate them on how stock options work and the inherent risk so they can make an informed decision.<p>There are definitely other founders who hype the value of stock options. When that happens, it&#x27;s not OK and I see where your frustration is coming from. But not all founders are evil people trying to spit in your face.')
