People who refuse to take basic precautions are externalizing the costs of their decisions onto the rest of society.  Litigation is one way society deals with that problem.<p>If someone went around having unprotected sex without telling their partners, then I don&#x27;t see a problem with a civil suit from anyone they infected to make them pay for the damages they inflicted.<p>If I were to distort your view like you did mine, I&#x27;d say that you&#x27;re arguing for the ability to go around punching anyone else in the face because to prevent you from doing so would be starting down a slippery slope that would lead to authoritarianism.')
