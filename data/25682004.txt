His podcast is one of the most insightful I&#x27;ve found, the questions are incredibly penetrating and detailed. He asks questions in a way that I have not really heard of before from other interviewers, ie &quot;Given circumstances A, and B, and that we could consider or discount C here as well, how would you do X?&quot;<p>I will also note that in 4HWW that he does tell you to delegate and automate only when you&#x27;ve fully understood what to do. And what&#x27;s wrong with such automation? That&#x27;s what we programmers do on a daily basis.')
