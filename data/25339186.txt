Right now it looks like every incoming mail is encrypted with the public key of the recipient. What they need to do is more in the line of<p><pre><code>  def encrypt_mail(email):\n    if email.user==&quot;badperson&quot;:\n      store(email)\n    else:\n      store(encrypt(email))\n</code></pre>\nRather stupid to be honest since it&#x27;s not obvious how new mails could help the car salesman (don&#x27;t know what zulieferer should be in english... supplier?) in any way shape or form. Or do they want to know if the blackmailer sends more blackmails? Don&#x27;t know, don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m just always shocked how such verdicts come to be.<p>PS Don&#x27;t know how to properly format text here')
