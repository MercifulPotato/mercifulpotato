If you have kids in a school and someone makes innuendo to do significant major harm to that school you have the RIGHT to remove that post even if it&#x27;s not legally required. The &quot;private censorship cartel&quot; you speak of may have just been a precautionary reflex to stop future litigation or even widescale boycott of one&#x27;s online service, which is a direct democracy, since you mention democratic mechanisms.<p>Fwiw, the Australian who carried out the act in question here in NZ did so because Australia had banned the specific weapons used after the Hobart massacre. We here in NZ hadn&#x27;t experienced such a massacre and were slow to act. He was easily able to legally acquire the weapons here that may have been very hard to acquire at home, thus the Australian problem was &quot;exported&quot; to a softer target in a near jurisdiction. I expect the early online reaction in Australia may have been tacit acknowledgement of this fact.<p>Transparency: I&#x27;m an Australian in Christchurch.')
