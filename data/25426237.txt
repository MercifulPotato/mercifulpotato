But let&#x27;s take a step back.<p>Whiteboard weeds out candidates that cannot code period. I wouldn&#x27;t believe the legend of the &quot;senior engineer&quot; who couldn&#x27;t FizzBuzz until I met him. I&#x27;ve personally conducted interview where a simply word count function (take a string, count the words) couldn&#x27;t be implemented in 30 minutes. And the resume listed proficiency in several programming languages.<p>Now this study tells us that competitive programmers aren&#x27;t that great among the candidates that were hired, not among the pool of candidates. That&#x27;s very different.')
