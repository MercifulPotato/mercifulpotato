I definitely don&#x27;t think &quot;don&#x27;t talk to cops&quot; is nuanced enough on it&#x27;s own, but the perhaps US-centric part of it isn&#x27;t the statement itself, but the context people will understand around it.<p>The core idea is that there are institutions in society (police being one of them) whose goals and incentives are contrary to your best interests.  It doesn&#x27;t matter that the people who work for them are &quot;nice&quot; or not, the act of performing their job can be very detrimental to you even if nobody involved actively wishes it.
