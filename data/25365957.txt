They filed an amici brief. And it&#x27;s actually 17. And reading the amici brief, they don&#x27;t even attempt to justify why Texas has standing in the case, which is the biggest reason to dismiss the case.<p>You are correct, they are not plaintiffs, but a third of U.S. states are now in support of this action.<p>I would argue that if a U.S. state has made unconstitutional election changes and thus has conducted an unconstitutional election then other U.S. states not in violation of the constitution have standing to dispute the election results with federal implications in accordance with the 12th Amendment.<p>This is not totally unprecedented, however, as the Election of 1824 resulted in a contingent election where the candidate with the popular vote lost.
