They&#x27;re pretty good at bringing the hammer down on representatives.<p>They were explicitly anti-Brexit, and arguably anti-Corbyn. They&#x27;re fairly anti-Boris. The common factor is bias against threats to the bureaucracy. It always puzzled me that they could get away with criticizing the people who held power over them, but I think it&#x27;s just that MPs don&#x27;t hold much power over them. They&#x27;re more worried about the branches of government that don&#x27;t change between elections.')
