Perhaps the author is so easily distracted that they spend too much time on Google and not enough time on authoritative sources in the first place (which usually can be found with Google).<p>For example, if I wanted to know about a NASA mission, I can go to their site directly and read far more information about that information than any library would have available (except, unironically, on the computers they let you use for this very purpose). Why would I go to Google first when I know the most authoritative source for info on a NASA mission is NASA&#x27;s website dedicated to it? Probably to find a link to that authoritative source of actual information.<p>Search engines have their place. Your inability to craft good search criteria, or differentiate good results from bad, doesn&#x27;t invalidate the wealth of information out there. And Google does make it easy to find. But you have to actually use some of your own intelligence to know what authoritative information looks like.<p>A website that is pretty much a drive-it-yourself worse-than-PowerPoint slide show that is highly reminiscent of a clickbait ad bomb is a perfect example of the rubbish that is out there, though. And I doubt it would show up in any of my Google searches.')
