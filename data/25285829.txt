They develop a language and interpreter for &quot;hoc(higher order calculator)&quot;. It is just about 40 pages which you can finish in a week and really understand the various pieces involved and how they fit together. I highly recommend not looking at anything else before finishing this.<p>Once the above is done, you can take a look at any of the popular Compiler construction books&#x2F;resources many of which would be recommended here. One less well-known but comprehensive work is <i>Project Oberon: The Design of an Operating System and Compiler by Niklaus Wirth</i>.')
