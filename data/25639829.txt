I’ve worked at places that don’t give a 401k</i><p>Oh wow, you’re right, that <i>is</i> abuse! You poor thing!<p>&gt; <i>I wanted to be civil, but I have to ask, are you fucking stupid or something?</i><p>I’m not offended, but it doesn’t look good when you completely fail to read the question, answer a different question, and then call the <i>other</i> person “fucking stupid.”<p>It sounds like the answer to the question that I actually asked you would be “No, absolutely not.” Otherwise, you wouldn’t make the laughable suggestion that lack of a 401k is in any way abusive.<p>And obviously the experience of blue collar workers is going to be different. This is a thread about tech companies like Google.')
