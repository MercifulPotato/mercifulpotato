If you decide it is not possible for you to spill on your laptop or the loss of your laptop is worth less than half a day of your time and keeping two bottles one of clean water and one of clean alcohol, then sure, just ignore this.<p>On the other hand if you own an expensive machine that can be reasonably disassembled (ie. almost anything else than a Mac) and you plan to use it for a long time and you don&#x27;t have any other insurance against spill, then you might be able to save a lot of money with a very small amount of effort.<p>My laptop was fully beefed up Lenovo T440s and I live in Poland. In Poland, this laptop represented about 3-4 average monthly salaries. Not much compared to half a day of effort to disassemble, clean and reassemble again.<p>Half a day assumes you have no idea what you are doing and you are need extra time to figure out what to do, find videos on Internet, figure out why you can&#x27;t pull a part and what still keeps it in place, etc.<p>For a person that knows what they are doing this is half an hour of effort.')
