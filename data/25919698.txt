The reason that the web is slow now is javascript. That is, treating a webpage like an application instead of a document. This analysis just assumes all websites are JS-application monsters and only differentiates between them. It misses the point.<p>A large part of the web are static documents and they should be developed as such.<p>But I 100% disagree that this is how every website should be. We&#x27;re given these amazing technologies, the internet, computers, libraries, tools and creativity and now we should just stick with sending and looking at formatted text?<p>I don&#x27;t think so!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ciechanow.ski&#x2F;gears&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ciechanow.ski&#x2F;gears&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maria.cloud&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maria.cloud&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextjournal.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextjournal.com&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; What makes it even slower is the practice of serially chain loading JS from multiple domains. Once you&#x27;re 3 deep in that it doesn&#x27;t matter how &#x27;fast&#x27; your webserver is or how fast and clean your JS code is, the serial loading will slow things to a crawl.<p>Bundling, code splitting, tree shaking and asynchronous loading, pre-optimizations help here too.')
