To be clear I&#x27;m not defending this stance as I think it is flawed. But I wanted you guys to know what Atlassians are told about it -<p>------------------------------------------------------<p>Section 3.3: Benchmarking\nCan you explain Atlassian&#x27;s stance on Benchmarking?<p>Like many other software companies, Atlassian has this language in its terms to protect users from flawed reviews and benchmarks. By requiring reviewers to obtain Atlassianâ€™s consent before publicly disseminating their results, Atlassian can confirm their methodology (i.e. latest release, type of web browser, etc.) and make sure they deliver verifiable performance results.  Atlassian is not trying to prevent any users from internally assessing the performance of our products.<p>The language related to the public distribution of performance information has been included in our customer agreement since 2012.<p>Customers can obtain Atlassian&#x27;s consent by filing a Support ticket. The Support engineer will then need to bring in a PMM for approval of the data&#x2F;report.<p>------------------------------------------------------')
