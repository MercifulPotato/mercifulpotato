But it seems ridiculous to choose &quot;unfck the internet&quot; as a slogan for a campaign targeted at the general public. Many people will find it offensive. Many people will find it unprofessional. Many people will find it childish. And no one will think it&#x27;s cool&#x2F;edgy. It&#x27;s 2020, saying &quot;fuck&quot; doesn&#x27;t impress anyone.')
