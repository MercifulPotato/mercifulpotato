Energy and process controls yield more and more uniform or tuned materials.  R&amp;D is a phenomenally expensive, but cumulative, process yielding large returns with time.<p>Precision measurement, coordination, communication, logistics, mamagement, modelling, quality control, and other advances are all based on that initial bolus of energy provided when we realised we could dig and pump up ancient burnable biomass.<p>Ancient technology was very often no less innovative, only vastly more constrained.')
