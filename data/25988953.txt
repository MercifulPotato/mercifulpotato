The next time someone e-mails you to sell SEO services, or outsourced IT or needs a way to transfer millions with you getting a cut, simple reply and say ‘awesome, can you contact bill@noprocurement.com and he will take care of it’<p>Bill has an OoO message (a long one) that explains how it will be great to do business together, but to email Helena, and she mails back with another person to include, and so on. It it a nice endless loop of people to include next, requests for attachments and form to fill out.<p>I take great joy in receiving spam now. It is a simple but creative way to distract spammers&#x2F;scammers and the more time they spent going down the rabbit hole, the less time they’ll have to scam&#x2F;spam other people.<p>It is all free and just something I built to use myself, but anyone can use it. To test it, send an email too Bill, and see what happens. :-)')
