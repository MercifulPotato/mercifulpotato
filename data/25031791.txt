App Review is _intentionally_ non-technical, as frustrating as that is for us developers. They enforce App Store policy from a non-technical standpoint<p>I produce an app which can download and run code, and was rejected many times through App Review. I was able to point to many other apps which _technically_ also downloaded and ran code â€” but the difference, to App Review, was entirely in the appearance (my code was text based, it &quot;looked like code&quot; and not like Scratch&#x27;s visual programming, or nodes, or whatever)<p>I disagree with the App Review decision in this instance, but I think they are enforcing policy consistently. It just looks random to those of us with enough technical experience to look past the visuals and to the implementation')
