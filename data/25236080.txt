I think part of it is the fact that k6 spins up a separate JS runtime for each VU. goja is a much, _much_, slower JS interpreter than V8, but load tests are IO-bound, so that&#x27;s usually not an issue. And you can spin up thousands of VUs in k6 (especially with --compatibility-mode=base), making full use of the load generator machine.<p>You can find some basic performance and other comparisons between load testing tools in this very long article of ours: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;k6.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;comparing-best-open-source-load-testing-tools" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;k6.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;comparing-best-open-source-load-testing-t...</a><p>And some advice for squeezing the maximum performance out of k6 in here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;k6.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;testing-guides&#x2F;running-large-tests" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;k6.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;testing-guides&#x2F;running-large-tests</a>')
