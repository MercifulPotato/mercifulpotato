The consistency of ZFC is a very useful theorem.<p>Perhaps less useful than one might think. Given that an inconsistent system can prove anything, if you weren&#x27;t convinced of ZFC&#x27;s consistency to begin with I hardly think you&#x27;d be convinced by a proof of its consistency in itself.<p>Godel&#x27;s Second Incompleteness Theorem is important &quot;in the other direction,&quot; that is its consequence for systems bigger than ZFC (or indeed PA)&#x2F;larger statements that imply the consistency of your formal system in question.<p>(A previous comment I made on this in greater detail <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25118038" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25118038</a>)')
