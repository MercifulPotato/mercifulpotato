In fact we&#x27;re advised to use speaker-phone or headsets if possible, as holding mobile phones to the left ear may disable the device.<p>I also have authority to bypass many security scanners as I&#x27;m disabled (as in my device is in &quot;stupid mode&quot; which means no cardioversion or defibrillation) whilst within them.<p>So this is old news, at least to those of us with ICDs.  There&#x27;s no way we put anything magnetic or that produces EM fields in a left hand shirt pocket.')
