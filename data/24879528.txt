Half the time I&#x27;m spending on my projects involves fixing bugs introduced by changing tools (e.g. the project no longer compiles because somebody changed the C compiler, or the Ubuntu linux libraries no longer match the RedHat ones).<p>Imagine how much grief was caused by the requirement to ASK people about cookies, which we see everywhere. Or the grief about http vs https, encryption, IP4 vs IP6, accessibility, host vs mobile page sizes, Apple developer fees, copyright and trademark issues, bandwidth requirements, timezone and country-specific issues, font issues (e.g. cyrillic), social grief (master vs main), etc. Note that almost none of these have anything to do with the application but require developer time and attention.<p>Oh, and don&#x27;t forget, if your project is used everywhere then people will develop attacks against it. If there is a security issue with your application you might get sued and lose everything. Legal issues alone are a nightmare. Do you know the copyright law differences between EU and US law?
