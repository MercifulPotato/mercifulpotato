Professionally, over two decades, I have seen several teams go through a technical evaluation and decide, in the end, that no open or closed source solution exactly fit their needs. So they coded it themselves.<p>Fast forward three to five years and everyone regretted the NIH approach. Those open or closed source solutions had matured and easily surpassed the home grown feature set, which still required a team of engineers to invest in.<p>There are exceptions, of course. Sometimes you have to build it yourself. But more often than not, it&#x27;s much, much more effective to let go of your ego and collaborate with others, particularly on open source solutions in which you always have the option to fork the codebase and bring it, effectively, in house.<p>Generally, I find those that strongly advocate for NIH overly discount the long term costs of maintaining software.')
