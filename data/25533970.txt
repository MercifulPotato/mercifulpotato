She said: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to type your term papers for you.&quot; Then I took a class in BASIC and fell in love with programming. By the time I got to college, I was a very fast typist.<p>I noticed that between my two kids, both graduated from high school now, the one who never learned to type had a hard time throughout school because of it. If there&#x27;s a physical obstacle to typing, it will translate into a difficulty learning to write. They did vastly more writing in school than I ever did.<p>In college, I preferentially chose courses where the grades were based on written work rather than exams, and I got to the point where I could sling text like nobody&#x27;s business. I was also the first student at the college to submit a word processed paper.<p>I don&#x27;t know if typing should necessarily affect coding. After all, you really shouldn&#x27;t be coding faster than you can think anyway. What matters is how much <i>good</i> code you can write, and that might include time spent away from the keyboard altogether.')
