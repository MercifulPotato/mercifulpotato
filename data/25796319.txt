They meet other people who feel the same way, and radicalize each other, making themselves less desirable as they do so.<p>Your post contains such nonsense, where you paint yourself as a victim of being &quot;devalued on dating sites&quot; which is nonsense.<p>My advice to you is to stop being a weak, whiny, worthless little loser.  Stop pretending you&#x27;re a victim.  Grow the fuck up.<p>Or don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t care if you die alone, hating women and society, and blaming everybody but your sad little self for your problems.  You pathetic fucking loser.')
