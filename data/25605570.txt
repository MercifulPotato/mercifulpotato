Party Foo wishes to release their own app using their trademark, as they&#x27;ve rescinded the permission of party Bar. Google makes this not possible.<p>How is that not a problem? Yes, parties Foo and Bar probably used the wrong procedure when releasing the app, but can&#x27;t fix that.<p>Google has no exception handling ability, and it&#x27;s awful. You can&#x27;t merge G suite organizations when there&#x27;s a corporate merger. Clearly, you should have known five years ago, that you were going to be purchased by X. Same story, no exception handling.')
