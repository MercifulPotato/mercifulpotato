If an application is operating at any scale such that there is a nonstop stream of requests, then it will be cheaper, faster, and more energy-efficient to run a hot server. This follows from thermodynamics. No matter how good the cloud vendor&#x27;s serverless is, it&#x27;s always going to be less efficient than a server, unless it doesn&#x27;t do any setup and teardown (i.e. no longer server<i></i>less<i></i>).<p>It is nuts to run <i></i>one<i></i> server. Then you&#x27;re wasting money with a server&#x2F;VM. That&#x27;s what serverless is ideal for: stuff no one uses. That&#x27;s a real niche. Who&#x27;s going to use that? Not profitable companies.<p>Often I think for most cases where you reach for serverless, you should reconsider the choice of a client-server architecture. An AWS Lambda isn&#x27;t a server anymore; it&#x27;s not &quot;listening&quot; to anything. Why can&#x27;t the &quot;client&quot; do whatever the Lambda&#x2F;RPC is doing?<p>Maybe what you want is just a convenient way to upload code and have it &quot;just work&quot; without thinking about system administration. The types of problems where you don&#x27;t care about the OS is once again a niche. You probably don&#x27;t even need new software for these kinds of things. You can just use SaaS products like Wordpress, Shopify, etc.<p>Serverless won&#x27;t be profitable because the people who need it don&#x27;t make money.')
