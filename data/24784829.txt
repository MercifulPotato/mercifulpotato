Item(by='Silhouette', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602734898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24781749, text='<i>But S1-S6 developed many good characters and plotlines, and it&#x27;s OK leave a world in progress.</i><p>Some people don&#x27;t mind that. Personally, I enjoy stories with closure. I find it a huge downer to know the canon ending sucks and will ruin the plot for many characters I have been following.<p>If nothing else, skipping the final episodes means I have to decide when to stop watching. In the case of GoT, the end of season 6 is one possibility, but arguably the worst shark-jumping happened after <i>The Long Night</i> in the middle of season 8 and watching that far does resolve some of the other plot lines.')
