Item(by='BrandoElFollito', descendants=None, kids=[25512087], score=None, time=1608651799, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25507079, text='&gt; When _some_ make this choice to be at the top, _all_ must make this choice to be at the top. At that point it&#x27;s a roulette of who will dare take the most drugs and live to win.<p>This is exactly what happens in sport today. Some made the choice to make it all of their life and train from dusk to dawn, eat some kind of protein powders that bring in the exact amount of nutriments etc.<p>The others must do the same to beat them.<p>I really see no difference between allowing to have a nutritionist, a personal coach, a bioengineer and access to all kind of legal substances that do not exist in nature and just let it go, grab some popcorn and see.<p>This is still a choice, a tough one, but a choice.<p>Then we will have these Roman-like competitions where some die and some survive (with the difference that they choose it knowingly) and the teams of people who instead of watching sport on TV will go to play an amateur match themselves.<p>I do not like competitive sport because it is made to look like something natural while it is not. The same way I do not care about boxers who get Parkinsons after repeated hits in their head or the ones who climb towers to make a selfie on the top and slip, I do not care about these who decided to modify their physiology to be the best at one specific precise action.<p>It ends with US universities &quot;graduating&quot; people who can barely write their name because they were good in basketball. The person who graduated in the same major as them and had to work (and get into the university in the first place) may not be happy. But there is money behind so who cares.')
