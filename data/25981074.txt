For example, years ago video game streamers were a thing, but a small niche was streaming &quot;irl&quot; - just walking down the street&#x2F;etc. Now this is a huge section on twitch.<p>A current example is vtubers (and hololive). Its just youtubers&#x2F;streamers, but their using very sophisticated live motion capture, so instead of a video of a person you&#x27;re watching a 3d real-time animated person. Body capture, face capture, advanced 3d modeling, etc. Take this niche and imagine it exists in the mainstream - does every person have a digital version of themselves? etc.')
