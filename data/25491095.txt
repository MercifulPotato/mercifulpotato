It was a pretty traditional accumulator design, with an instruction set which lacked most of the typical features of a RISC design like minimal addressing modes (6502 had plenty of weird modes, 65C02 added even more) or general-purpose registers (6502 had only A, X, and Y, all of which were special-purpose to some degree or another).<p>Plus, the 6502 was hardly unique on the market. It was nearly a clone of the Motorola 6800, and wasn&#x27;t all that far off from the Intel 8080 or its clone, the Z80.')
