While i am in favor of giving good forms of asylum and aid, i am not convinced about any extreme like having totally open borders with immediate citizenship. This should be a process of at least 8 or more years i think. A process i see that would take into account a problem such as the following for world as it is:<p>I am concerned that if people entering into the country do so with the mindset of overturning their laws, to the disfavor of current citizens in it.<p>So on one hand those who open borders could desire to have a set of laws that are selfish towards their party (and no human party is totally unselfish), and gain votes by doing so in order to pass laws that may not benefit the current majority and perhaps even what is truly morally beneficial.<p>Further concerning, when we have a nation that has traditionally been both Democratic and Judeo-Christian, receiving and sponsoring an influx of we could say Muslim people who may express desire to gain a majority and could vote to impose thing like Sharia law.<p>From my impression the treatment and persecution seen in countries where there is a Muslim or most other majority towards Christians (or even their own people) is worse in forcing them to behave contrary to their principles than the Christian majority nations to Muslims.<p>God is good, sorry, i was just attempting to write a short reply about it being an interesting comment and then found these issues to wrestle with.
