You prove that you&#x27;re human, and you <i>also</i> help transcribe books so that they&#x27;re more accessible&#x2F;searchable! Sure, it&#x27;s in Google&#x27;s interest in that it improves Google Books, but it at least seems like a symbiotic exchange (to, e.g. humanity in general.)<p>Contrast that with today&#x27;s form of reCaptcha where you identify stop signs&#x2F;crosswalks&#x2F;et c. for Google&#x27;s benefit, but at the same time you&#x27;re also improving...oh, wait, Google again. It <i>almost</i> seems like forced labor, in a sense.')
