Item(by='BeetleB', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610498002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25754702, text='&gt; I would still happily pay $3500 to not spend hours a year entering innocuous expenses into a fucking text editor.<p>Fair enough. If your expenses are at the level of mine, I&#x27;d gladly take your $3500&#x2F;year to do it for you. :-)<p>And given that several commenters have said they spend about an hour a month on it, after all automation is in place, I&#x27;m sure many would take that money from you. It comes to about $300&#x2F;hour. Certainly some people are earning a lot more than I am, and paying $300&#x2F;hour is worth it to them.<p>I&#x27;m not a hard core ledger user, but I have a simple solution: I don&#x27;t enter anything into a text editor. I enter it into a fairly nice money management SW (using a GUI), that autofills a lot of stuff for me, and lets me import from my bank&#x2F;CC. And then I simply run a script to convert its data format to ledger. I&#x27;m sure I spend more than an hour a month, though. I haven&#x27;t automated most of my data sources.')
