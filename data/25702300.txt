Many people view guns as inherently evil, view me as inherently evil for possessing them, and explicitly say they want to ban all firearms &#x2F; there is no legitimate use case for firearms full stop. It&#x27;s very difficult to take a moderate stance with such people when they are trying to shout me down and are demanding capitulation rather than moderation.<p>&gt; I know a bunch of gun owners too, and the overlap is very substantial. It&#x27;s all the same people, really. Obviously not every gun owner is a right wing terrorist, but they all subscribe to the same magazines and subreddits and all imagine the same euphemisms about freedom and protection and self-determinism.<p>QED, you make unfounded and sweeping generalizations and then are surprised when people get defensive. When you employ rhetoric such as this, opponents will fight you just to do it.')
