Item(by='koffiezet', descendants=None, kids=[24691451], score=None, time=1601903323, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24685248, text='&gt; and go for hydrogen fuel<p>There are almost fewer cars running on hydrogen on the road right now than there are F1 cars on the grid (only half joking), and while many mainstream manufacturers have made prototypes and concept cars even before they did anything pure electric, pretty much all of them have real full-electric products in their lineup, or at leat in the pipeline. There are some hydrogen pilot projects, sure, but I can&#x27;t go to a dealer right now and order one. So going for hydrogen would be a really bad move, also because its energy density is inferior. The current ICE units in F1 are already at the upper-limit of possible efficiency, so replacing it with a fuel with a lower energy-density will be a step back in performance, with little or no future path to real improvements they don&#x27;t have right now.<p>I&#x27;m an F1 fan, but I see that it is on a dead-end, one-way street. It&#x27;ll take a while to reach the end, and as long as there&#x27;s not a superior technology which can beat it on it&#x27;s own grounds, it&#x27;s not going away.<p>The &quot;only&quot; thing standing in the way of electric race-cars beating them is energy storage, which I expect to be improved at a break-neck speed in the coming years. FE has the advantage that this is the exact same problem affecting road-cars, which is why you see quite a few mainstream brands being attracted to it right now. But the energy density of oil-based fuels will be hard to beat, it will take a while before an FE car can beat an F1 car in every situation. But I&#x27;m excited for when this happens, since right now, FE fails to capture my interest for multiple reasons. There is no track-overview, all look pretty much the same to me, there are no iconic locations. Next year they&#x27;ll finally be using the full Monaco circuit, which is a good start, and currently one of the very few viable F1 tracks for FE, but they have a long way to go.')
