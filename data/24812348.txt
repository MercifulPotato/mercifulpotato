Yes you can write faster code in Ruby,Rust,Python etc but often times those languages hide soo much code, leaving you with a sparse understanding of the underlying concepts.<p>Language wars are not my forte but, I say use the language you are most comfortable with and become very good at using it. What takes you 30min in c++ may take me 5 min and vice versa. Happy coding!')
