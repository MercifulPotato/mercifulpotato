Item(by='brmgb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611353841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25870480, text='&gt; If they didn&#x27;t want their content to be indexed by search results, they could ask Google to remove it<p>No, they can&#x27;t. The first answer to the Google issue from the French press was sensible. Individualy they know their content is worth money but individualy they are weak so they try to form a syndicate to negociate with Google in a pay-or-nothing position. But Google argued the French equivalent of fair use allowed them to scrap titles for free.<p>The French competition regulator had to intervene to force Google to go negociate. You can&#x27;t negociate in good faith with a monopoly like Google. As the USA has apparently decided it won&#x27;t apply its antitrust law in order to protect the international competitiveness of its abusive companies, obviously Europe will have to rein them in.')
