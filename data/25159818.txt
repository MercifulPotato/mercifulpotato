Can&#x27;t wait to get the needle in the arm ASAP.<p>-Seems extremely effective at limiting covid disease.<p>-Very curious as to how long will the vaccine immunity will last?<p>-Seems with the second dose for 18-55 year olds, perhaps 75% will feel fatigue, 50% have chills and 20% will have a fever.[1] This hasn&#x27;t been widely shared yet and I&#x27;m a bit concerned how the public will react.<p>-Safety: Given the huge trial size, we can be pretty confident that there aren&#x27;t any significant negative short term effects. But yet the phase three trials will follow the participants for two years. Presumably, this is to find out about longer term safety+efficacy... but yet of course we will be vaccinating most of the world prior to the end of those two years.<p>How are we confident that these vaccines don&#x27;t cause any long term safety concerns? Other vaccines have been pulled from the market for safety reasons - what happened in those cases that we&#x27;re sure won&#x27;t happen in this case?<p>I think given the fact that &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; exist makes some people take the complete opposite position to distance themselves from the conspiracy theorists- &quot;anything a doctor injects in your arm is safe&quot;. Of course the truth is that injecting stuff in people&#x27;s arms is not always safe - which is why we have trials. Were these trials long enough to know with a high level of confidence if there are any long term effects of the vaccines?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;33053279&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;33053279&#x2F;</a>')
