It restricts others from operating Elasticsearch as a service <i>unless</i> they release any source code patches, improvements, and&#x2F;or functionality extensions they make to it.<p>To me, that&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;re saying you expected from liberal licenses, but it&#x27;s delivered by a restrictive license, using the restrictions popularized by GPL licenses. This makes ElasticSearch <i>more</i> open source, rather than less, because now anyone who uses it has to &quot;open&quot; their source code. That&#x27;s the premise of GPLv3 in a nutshell, and I&#x27;m hard-pressed to understand how it&#x27;s a drawback here.<p>Have I misunderstood and their new license somehow <i>reduces</i> the openness of their source code to the world?')
