If maintenance isn&#x27;t completed in a timely fashion the cost goes up, but also the risk of unexpected failure. In my experience, maintenance isn&#x27;t authorized because of two main reasons:ignoring the problem or management being afraid to spend the money for the jobs. The money is in the budget, they just don&#x27;t want to be seen as a &quot;spender&quot; to upper management.')
