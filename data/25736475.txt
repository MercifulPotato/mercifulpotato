I don&#x27;t mean to &quot;blame the victim&quot; here, but at the same time I read all of the hype machine prior to a release and am not surprised that people are disappointed. Based on the hype and the expectations, nothing but the best game ever made will satisfy the crowd. This is the same for anything that is overhyped. Game of Thrones comes to mind as well. Everyone hated on the last season, but literally no matter what they did, it would be hated on.<p>People just need to relax, accept that things are imperfect, and enjoy the game once it is patched.')
