Item(by='blunte', descendants=None, kids=[24809171], score=None, time=1602925746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24807980, text='Most users can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t be bothered to take hardly any steps to improve their security or privacy.<p>Only after they lose control of their email or bank account (or lose an entire physical device) do they confess to having followed none of the recommended prevention measures.<p>Granted, it really is a drag and a time cost to try to follow good practices. I hate the extra password manager and authy steps on my phone when I&#x27;m in a hurry. It can be a real challenge to juggle apps and find your way back to the app which you are logging in on (twice or three times! - copying username from bitwarden, switching back to paste it in the username only page of the app, then repeating to do the password, and then finally switching to authy for the 2fa and back). No typical user is going to suffer this in the name of security.<p>Some fundamental changes need to be made to devices, UIs, apps, and even legislation to improve this.  Cookie popups are not the answer (especially when the pop-up is so large that it doesn&#x27;t even fit entirely in the visible area of my giant phone).')
