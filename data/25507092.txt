Make the best webcam in existence and there just isn&#x27;t a robust, or honest, review community to let it shine.<p>Instead there are a billion &quot;here&#x27;s a list of things that we can get affiliate dollars for from Amazon, and we&#x27;ll pretend we reviewed them&quot; listings.<p>This problem has hit a lot of markets. Without a financial support for capable, credible, honest reviewers, the backbone of an industry falls apart. It becomes all about gimmicks.<p>So if you want a webcam the real options now are an SLR (many of them support that use) or even a video camera. In <i>those</i> markets there remains an extreme qualitative review system, so that new Nikon, Canon or Sony SLR or video camera <i>had</i> to shine.')
