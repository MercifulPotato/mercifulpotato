While some of the Microsoft iconography uses a vertical rectangle for phone (in the context of adding apps), the blob-ended wide U of the old fashioned telephone handset is still the predominate icon for a telephone. The follow on technologies were much simpler in form and thus make for shapes that are indistinguishable from any other box. An icon needs a high level of distinctiveness to be successful.<p>Likewise, the follow on technologies to small portable storage did not have distinctive and ubiquitous shapes. Maybe a long rectangle with a short end against a square would represent a flash drive? I think that a sibling comment about the 3.5” diskette being present at the birth of GUIs must be part of the answer too since the world didn’t immediately transition to flash drives and other media. All lived together for quite a while.<p>Looking at “floppy icon” search results leads me to believe that many icon designers have never seen an actual 3.5” diskette. On many the shutter is too wide and could not slide open, on others the rotor mating surface is classic iPod low.')
