If examples aren&#x27;t in the library itself, then you have to look for projects that use it, github is the best player in town.<p>It&#x27;s funny that we have different experiences - I guess I use more niche libraries than you (or am worse at understanding other people&#x27;s code)?  For more mainstream stuff (javascript questions) I can e.g. go straight to MDN.  For questions about the Unity game engine I&#x27;ll often find good examples in their documentation, but for weirdo game engines random projects on github can be a lifesaver.')
