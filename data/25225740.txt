And OSX is a unix, and windows is evolving towards unix for cloud compatibility.<p>And yet I remember a Plan9 designer casually drop 10 or 12 bullet points of critique on Linux&#x2F;UNIX that made me think &quot;oh yeah&quot;.<p>Fundamentally, I&#x27;d like an OS that could make the task of tracking programs running on multiple machines (and architectures&#x2F;OSs) more seamless. I would like something that would enable me to seamlessly run something on a raspberry Pi or raspberry VM, or a windows box, or OSX box, or a linux box. If my access key and username match.<p>More simply, I&#x27;d like a JSON output option for every unix command. The fact you STILL can&#x27;t parse ls -la is a crime.')
