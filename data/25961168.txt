The AR &quot;IKEA Place&quot; app [1] has existed since September 2017.<p>It&#x27;s very odd that the submission (dated October 2020) suggests that the app is something new.<p>It&#x27;s also a pretty bad app -- I tried using it a couple months ago. It failed to render anything on my brand-new iPad, though it worked on my iPhone. It also only has about ~half the current furniture IKEA sells, so I could only try out one of the three desks I was interested in, which made it entirely useless for comparison. Finally, you can&#x27;t even search for items by name -- you have to navigate a hierarchy of every model the app has.<p>In other words, it still needs a LOT of work. The app gets occasional maintenance updates but IKEA doesn&#x27;t seem to be seriously investing in it, unfortunately. The fact it&#x27;s missing half their furniture is pretty unforgiveable.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;ikea-place&#x2F;id1279244498" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;ikea-place&#x2F;id1279244498</a>')
