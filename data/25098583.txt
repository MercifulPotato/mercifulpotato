I&#x27;m sure that they do genuinely want a way to quickly quash malware, worms, etc...<p>But we&#x27;ve also seen that Apple is clearly <i>willing</i> to use security features to ban developers that stand against them, so I don&#x27;t understand how people can be so confident that they wouldn&#x27;t be willing to use this feature in the same way, even if they did internally think of it as primarily a security tool. It would be very consistent to how we&#x27;ve seen app signing evolve from a pure security feature into a contract-enforcement tool.')
