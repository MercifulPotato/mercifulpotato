If we took these products to be public infrastructure, like roads, would we consider them being owned by ad companies a good idea? I&#x27;m leaning towards maintainence schemes for these public infrastructure projects similar to what we have for physical public infrastructure, like roads, rail, bridges, etc. Them being international would be an interesting challenge of course, but I think it&#x27;s solvable.')
