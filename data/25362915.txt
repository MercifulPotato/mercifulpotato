Mirrors are fine if you have quick access to fix dead drives, but I like the idea of being able to lose <i>any</i> two drives vs. only one drive in a given mirror. And while I currently have a 4 drive RAIDz2 (same disk utilization as a mirror) I wish I had a 4+2 array, which I&#x27;ll probably build next year.')
