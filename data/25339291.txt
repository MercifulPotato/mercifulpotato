I am willing to accept a complete loss on these shares and offered to give them back to the company for $0.<p>However, the company wrote me back that &quot;the shares are not transferable to a third party without the prior consent of the Board of Directors and the Company cannot authorize or otherwise agree to your request to surrender them for zero value&quot;.<p>I contacted the portal where our shares are managed to ask if they can process an abandonment and they just said to talk to the company.<p>Any options for me here or am I hosed?')
