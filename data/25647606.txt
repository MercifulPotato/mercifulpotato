Item(by='ecesena', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609866091, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25644375, text='I almost always repost 1-2 times when I have something &quot;big&quot;, unless the 1st post hits the home page of course.<p>Most of the times I try a slightly different angle, maybe a variation in the title. It definitely works, in the sense that sometimes you&#x27;re just unlucky and maybe your post is hidden by big-Co news. I definitely recommend to not exaggerate though, if a post doesn&#x27;t work, it simply doesn&#x27;t.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about the algorithm, but I generally see some sort of correlation between me commenting around and my posts getting higher results. It might be that people look at my profile and&#x2F;or I&#x27;m more &quot;in the HN lingo&quot; and thus my posts resonate more. So my recommendation is to participate in the community, not just post + repost blindly.')
