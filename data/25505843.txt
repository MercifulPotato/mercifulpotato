Last I checked Magic Lantern had no webcam type functionality but that was ages ago. If it does that&#x27;s a pretty great webcam for like £100<p>RE those chinese knockoff dongles, I got one for £8 off ebay, use it for Pi Zero stuff occasionally and the lag isn&#x27;t bad at all tbh. I&#x27;d guess somewhere between 250ms and 500ms but it maybe gets worse at larger resolutions.')
