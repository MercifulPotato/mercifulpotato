Trump is <i>currently</i> doing everything he can to thwart a peaceful transition of power. The fact that he <i>is</i> such an ineffectual buffoon is the only reason he is not succeeding.<p>For me, Trump trying to use the Justice Dept to investigate his enemies and thwart investigations of his friends is so beyond the pale, way beyond what any president, Republican or Democrat, has ever done that I am shocked people can think this was not a big deal. I mean, that extreme abuse of power is banana republic, end of Rome-type shit.<p>Put it another way: I firmly believe if a time traveler from, say, 2010 just showed up to see Trump&#x27;s autocratic desires that they&#x27;d be horrified; we&#x27;ve just gotten used to Trump&#x27;s extreme abuses. Heck, it&#x27;s become something of a new favorite pastime of mine to look at Trump&#x27;s <i>own tweet storms</i> circa 2012 and see how 2012 Trump would be condemning 2020 Trump in the harshest possible terms.')
