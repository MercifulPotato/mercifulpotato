When my neck hurts I change the height of my monitors so the angle of my neck changes.  It&#x27;s not a cure, but it helps.<p>Also, shrugging my shoulders up to my ears periodically helps.  PT docs tell me it&#x27;s the wrong thing to do.  I think they figure I&#x27;m strengthening my traps, but really I think the movement just helps reset something in my neck.  YMMV.<p>If you&#x27;re twenty something and don&#x27;t have physical issues from sitting in front of a computer all day, just wait, you will.')
