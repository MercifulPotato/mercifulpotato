It didn&#x27;t really prevent it because they couldn&#x27;t constantly hall sweep all of the halls during the entire school day (and it increased the number of students entering other classrooms randomly to try to hide from the security guards) and it was also super racially biased in its enforcement.<p>&gt; It can&#x27;t be that many kids doing it every class and having teachers and staff monitor halls<p>No, it is quite a few students. You underestimate the dysfunction in the typical inner city school.<p>&gt;  Simple enough to take report that to whoever in the school handles discipline<p>And do what to discipline them? Kick them out of school?<p>&gt;  not worry so much about attendance so long as they hand in their work and get decent enough grades.<p>In an urban environment, &quot;not worrying about attendance&quot; translates to a. to very upset parents (esp. among working-class parents who are not at home and view education as a route to success), b. failing low-income students, c. more crime.<p>Urban schools are hard to fix!')
