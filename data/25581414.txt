I want to spin up an X stack in docker? Can&#x27;t do that, docker doesn&#x27;t work. There&#x27;s jails but without any image repositories I&#x27;m trading a lot of convenience for simplicity.<p>There&#x27;s also software like dotnetcore which will just not build. The situation in the desktop is even more problematic. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so, I like the separation of concerns quite a bit with FreeBSD but it&#x27;s not something that unfortunately fits my use cases.')
