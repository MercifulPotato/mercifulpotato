I remember AMA95&#x27;s first lecture where Prof Cohen said &quot;the course catalog describes this class as introductory. It is, but make no mistake, it is not elementary.&quot;<p>AMA95 had a reputation for being a trial by fire. Doing well in it meant you were going to graduate.<p>Tough as he was, I liked Prof Cohen.
