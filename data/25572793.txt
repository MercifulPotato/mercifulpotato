Doesn&#x27;t matter how shitty. That was the writers trying to pull a fast one. That is easily 150k-200k. If it&#x27;s a good neighborhood (meaning safe, homogenous cultural understanding), 200k is more spot on.<p>In my midwest town, unless that was built 100 years ago, no way it&#x27;s being less than that. Doesn&#x27;t even matter if it was lead paint or vinyl siding. That home homer lived in was the exception, by far the rule.')
