Equating real-life violence to fictional or simulated violence really stretches and dilutes its meaning. It also completely misunderstands the psychological motivations and incentives behind each one. One of these two activities leaves an &#x2F;actual&#x2F; person hurt (and then dead) and the other does not. One of these two activities is a safe way to explore your curiosity about very morbid and common human concerns (conflict and death) and of them is not. They couldn&#x27;t be less different.<p>Diluting that down to &quot;solving your problems via violence&quot; just completely misses that distinction in favor of a boogeyman.')
