I was completely wrong, and they fulfilled that arc in the first three episodes. I think the showrunner consciously avoided the sitcom trap of always maintaining the status quo which was satisfying because the situation kept constantly evolving. Which is important, because one of the themes of the entire show is that people can change.')
