When stock prices move down, correlations between stocks go up. If you look at the last couple downturns you can see that this correlation between assets and asset classes has increased. Stocks dropping leads to people selling their bitcoin and gold which causes those prices to drop. Falling prices make speculators get scared and sell to cut their losses which drives prices down further and the cycle continues. What you really want to find is an asset that is negatively correlated to the stock market while stocks are dropping.')
