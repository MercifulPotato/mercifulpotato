But I also want to restrict children as little as possible, so they can learn to deal with freedom and self responsibility as soon as possible.<p>See maturity is a vague term this is where the controversy lies because adults can be immature too. What is the logic that gives immature kids this &quot;privilege&quot; over an immature adult.<p>&gt;Because avaiability is very high today already with the illegal status. Take away the temptation of the taboo for rebelling teens and you get even lower numbers. And you can more easily help those who still fall for it.<p>This is not a fact either. In fact it&#x27;s very convoluted logic. Something that is illegal is used more over something that is legal because of rebellion? It&#x27;s so against common sense.<p>I decriminalize murder, murder goes down. \nI decriminalize theft, theft goes down. \nI decriminalize corruption, corruption goes down.<p>None of those statements make sense.<p>But suddenly this one does:<p>I decriminalize drugs, drug use goes down.<p>Seems not just illogical but delusional. A convenient excuse to promote a personal agenda.')
