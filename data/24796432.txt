You don&#x27;t need to include linux inside if you don&#x27;t want to. I&#x27;ve built containers with nothing more than a few native executables. It&#x27;s just a packaging format, but easier to build and deploy than other formats like tarballs.<p>If you don&#x27;t need K8S then don&#x27;t use it. What&#x27;s the problem? Run your app on your server and ignore everything else.<p>But most of these features have nothing to do with scale and are more about usability, reliability and consistency. Sure you can do it yourself but that&#x27;s less efficient than just letting K8S do it all in one standardized way and interface.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;I want my application to reliably and quickly serve my customers and be easy to maintain and debug.&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s what K8S helps with. I&#x27;ve spent 10 years running large distributed applications handling billions of requests per day in multiple regions. I don&#x27;t care about the ABI and don&#x27;t see why that&#x27;s relevant, but I do know that K8S has made many things easier in actually running these apps.')
