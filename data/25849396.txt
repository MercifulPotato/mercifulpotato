It&#x27;s so obvious that it was written by a programmer with commands like 5dd, 6gg etc. I find it so ridiculous that a computer program can be that much loved and yet it doesn&#x27;t even provide line numbers out of the box nor indentation. Does a person really need to spend half an hour googling just to tell vim to indent Java code as they type.')
