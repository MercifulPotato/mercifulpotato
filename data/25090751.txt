Some, however, do. Some are no longer profitable, more are replaced by capital investments. Economics denialism is quite strong in your circles, as I noted.<p>Ok, now we&#x27;re getting to the root of the problem.  This is argument is based off of your misunderstanding of economics.  What you&#x27;re missing here is this:<p>- Jobs are a function of demand.<p>- Demand is driven by consumers.<p>- Consumers need capital to drive demand<p>- The poor spend proportionately to their income much more than the wealthy.<p>That&#x27;s the circle you need to be thinking about when you&#x27;re asking yourself what the impact will be on jobs.  The more you drive down living standards of the poor and middle class, the fewer jobs you will have, not the other way around.')
