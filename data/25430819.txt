You can enable Security Hub and Guard Duty on AWS organization-wide in a few minutes and have a pretty solid baseline for hardening your infrastructure and flagging suspicious activity. Doing the same with on-premise infrastructure takes months and entails significant risk since things weren’t designed around APIs and low-privilege IAM.<p>(GCP is similar but SCC is earlier in the development cycle and their threat detection isn’t well designed.)')
