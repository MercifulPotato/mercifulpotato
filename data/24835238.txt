The outcome of the battle of Kursk did make a big difference.<p>&gt; &quot;Intelligence never wins a war on its own,&quot; says Prof Ferris.<p>Another event where spies&#x2F;code breakers made a major difference is the battle of Moscow;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Richard_Sorge#Wartime_intelligence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Richard_Sorge#Wartime_intellig...</a><p>&quot;Various writers have speculated that the information allowed the release of Siberian divisions for the Battle of Moscow, where the German Army suffered its first strategic defeat in the war.
