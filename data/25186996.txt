The reason being that if used\nproperly(laptop far back so you can rest the whole forearms and\nelbows on the table) the angles and positioning are supposed to\nbe pretty good.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert in this area myself, but some of my problems\nwere alleviated by following his advice and he only uses a\nlaptop himself, so I believe him on that one.<p>That said you&#x27;re right in that this flat design without a\nfoldable screen is not exactly made for long work hours. I&#x27;d\nsay for a session on the go with the device sitting on the lap\nit could be worse, though at least a detachable&#x2F;external\nkeyboard would help a lot.')
