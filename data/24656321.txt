Workers that are paid massive salaries in the likes of SF &amp; NYC is because the cost of living in those cities justify it.<p>So you&#x27;re on 150k in SF say, you move to, I don&#x27;t know some small city in Texas, you get 20k to move, you make 135k a year and your cost of living has probably dropped by 70%. That doesn&#x27;t sound like a &quot;scumbaggish&quot; move to me. That sounds like a company trying to entice it&#x27;s employees to get out of the crazy expensive cities.')
