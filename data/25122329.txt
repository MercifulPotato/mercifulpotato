But why should the restaurant care?<p>Many restaurants are small independent businesses having business owners taking a lot of financial risk and investing a ton of time to grow that business. They aren&#x27;t interested in becoming de facto subsidiaries to delivery services. They want to serve their patrons directly while making a living in a sustainable way.<p>&gt; Maybe. This has supposedly been the business model, but has anyone actually managed to execute on it?<p>Isn&#x27;t this how Amazon entered and acquired the book market, by positioning themselves as a book broker at first and then gradually outbidding book stores?<p>&gt; because I still like them and am still willing to pay a premium for them.<p>One swallow doesn&#x27;t make a summer.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s always had a reputation as a minimum-wage (or even below-minimum-wage) job, no?<p>Agreed. Is it to the benefit of society at large if an existing socio-economic circumstances turn more precarious for an increasing group of people?<p>&gt; Sounds like a self-correcting problem - as and when quality and diversity drop, an opportunity rises for anyone who can offer them.<p>Isn&#x27;t that contradictory if the opportunity doesn&#x27;t exist... because the expenses associated with investing in quality outstrip your competitive advantage with other low-cost competitors?<p>Sure, you could aim at a high-end niche of customers - e.g. four star restaurants - but those are small and the competition is murderous. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s, comparatively, only a handful of Michelin star restaurants with chefs with a reputation.<p>Granted, everyone needs to eat. It&#x27;s a vast market after all. I just do not see how this particular business model applied in the delivery business is a net positive for everyone involved in the long run... except for DoorDash and their ilk.')
