I have a git repo with one dir for everything that needs configuration. Whenever I spin up a vps&#x2F;vm or what have you, git clone dotfiles; cd dotfiles and stow what I&#x27;m using on that machine.<p>stow links based on the directory structure of the folder you&#x27;re calling, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about where things are, just stow fish; stow nvim<p>There&#x27;s no symlink script or adapter script to work with stow, everything &#x27;just works&#x27; for me.')
