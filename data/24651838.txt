The status program has <i>also</i> been devalued tremendously as load factors go up, since there&#x27;s no need to incentivize people to fly at all.<p>&gt; &quot;Even without being the very top tier of frequent flier, I am upgraded on around half of my domestic flights on our preferred carrier.&quot;<p>That depends <i>highly</i> on which routes, which time of day you fly, and which carrier. As a top-tier Executive Platinum on American, pre-pandemic I wouldn&#x27;t ever count on getting upgraded on SFO-DFW. That&#x27;s a hub-to-focus-city route with gobs of money on either side. I had like a 33% success rate. On the other hand, DFW-YUL, you can bet your life on it. An AA Silver wouldn&#x27;t clear an upgrade on either, though.')
