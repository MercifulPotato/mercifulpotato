Maybe the name of the data structure stinks.<p>Anyway I was confused by the comment about starvation. I thought a friendless element should always be making progress toward the front batch even if there&#x27;s regress in terms of how many items are in front of it. This is unlike a priority queue which can starve an element indefinitely by things coming in at the same rate they&#x27;re processed.<p>Then I realized the error in my thinking: new elements can be added to the front batch while it is currently being processed. So the front batch can starve all later batches indefinitely.<p>You could prohibit adding to the current batch I suppose, without complicating the data structure too much.')
