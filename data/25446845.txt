Basically, they were looking to trim their budgets and us contractors were the best paid. In addition we&#x27;d already got the job done, just waiting for term to end. I was so mind numbingly bored that I started doing Project Euler, first at home then eventually at work to fill the time. That was &#x27;just cause&#x27;.<p>I also suspect that one of my solutions wasn&#x27;t well appreciated. There was a job that analyzed historical data and generated a projected date (or risk I can&#x27;t exactly recall) that was very complicated and took way too long to run. I cooked it down to one database query where all the data was anyway to get an answer in a couple of minutes. It took a long time to make the query, needing multiple updates (PTFs) of IBM DB2 to extend limits I was bumping into and working around with guard condition heuristics to narrow the search space. The single query was about 3 pages long. There were timeline diagrams showing the areas that each heuristic was narrowing or excluding but not simply enough.<p>I remember when the guy who had to deliver the news, but obviously didn&#x27;t make the decision had the talk with me. My reaction was &quot;Fantastic!&quot; as it was such a relief to escape boredom early.')
