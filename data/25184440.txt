I could actually feel my blood pressure rising when watching the US channels, as if everyone on there was slightly panicky and had just jogged up a flight of stairs. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d see what type of tone on non-US channels unless WWIII was literally breaking out. I couldn&#x27;t imagine consuming that all the time, it must be horrendous for your mental health.')
