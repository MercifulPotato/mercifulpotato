Am I missing something, or is it just a question of the precautionary principle in this case being considered too costly?</i><p>FDA approvals aren&#x27;t a black and white affair. Some drugs are approved as orphan drugs through trials designed to be much cheaper than Phase 1-3 trials when they treat diseases that wouldn&#x27;t be profitable for pharma, for example, and there is a path for preliminary compassionate use approvals and accelerated development for stuff like chemo where the disease is terminal anyway. The FDA works with each company to tailor the process to their needs (although, obviously, they stick to a strict standard unless there&#x27;s good justification).<p>Likewise, the vaccine rollout won&#x27;t be all or nothing. We won&#x27;t even have a billion doses for a long while and the focus will (likely) be on vaccinating those for whom the benefits outweigh the extra risk like front line medical staff and the immunocompromised or elderly. I don&#x27;t expect the world to get vaccinated at gun point, although the rules for schools and other institutions will quickly accumulate to cover most of the population.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m not going to be taking the vaccine for a while since no one in my family is at risk and we&#x27;re (mentally) preparing for several years of varying levels of isolation and other precautions. I have faith in the system for the most part since I&#x27;ve worked on an FDA application before (clinical diagnostics, not therapeutics), but the kind of geopolitical and economic pressure its under right now is unprecedented and should keep epidemiologists up at night (hell, it probably does). It&#x27;s going to be up to each individual to balance their risks and obligations at least until we get more data.')
