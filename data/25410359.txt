When the far left, and corporations have both aligned on an issue, we&#x27;re going to get screwed. The center right, and center left will never agree, or unify to create a policy that decentralizes anything. This means, the far left, and corporations will win, a strange pair indeed.<p>The only counter is to centralize with opposing points of view, because nothing fractured ever is sustainable.')
