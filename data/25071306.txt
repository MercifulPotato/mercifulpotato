It was just about ok. Much, much better than AngularJS (Angular 1.x). But worse than React in pretty much every way. What other people have said about everything needing to be mediated by the framework was the worst bit. That and making the change detection work correctly required understanding the internals in quite a bit of detail. React&#x27;s approach is slightly slower but much simpler.')
