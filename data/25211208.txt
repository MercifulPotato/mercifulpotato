On the Zen1 Epyc&#x27;s for instance some software preferred a consistent latency from stripped memory over the NUMA aware latency with separate channels where the closer dimms have lower latency and the further dimms had higher.<p>I&#x27;ve seen similar on Intel servers, but not recently.  This isn&#x27;t however typically something you can do at runtime, just boottime, at least as far as I&#x27;ve seen.')
