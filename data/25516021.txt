What really resonated with me was the point about buying a comfortable mattress. It wasn&#x27;t the mattress in my case, but the bed I slept on. I bought it used 8 years ago. I fixed it twice. It was creaking again. It&#x27;s not that I couldn&#x27;t buy a new one, it&#x27;s just that I was used to not buying furniture. After all it&#x27;s only comfort.<p>Last year I bought a new bed and it improved a lot of things for me. It&#x27;s simple, but if you grow up thinking about every penny you spend you get weird habits.')
