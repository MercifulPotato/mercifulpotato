Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609956779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25658331, text='&gt;Could it be that you limit your perspective onto only the US at the current point in time? Otherwise what you say just doesn&#x27;t make any sense and your points can&#x27;t be generalized. And even in the US, health insurance is not mandatory (as you say yourself), hence I would still not call it a tax.<p>What I mean by insurable and uninsurable is that an entity can come in and sell insurance which can benefit the buyer alone, and is not an explicit subsidy to the other insureds in the risk pool.  However, for health, it&#x27;s a no brainer to opt out of health insurance between ages 20 and 40 (maybe not if you&#x27;re a woman that&#x27;s going to have kids).  This makes the risk pool completely full of people experiencing losses and that point, it&#x27;s just a cost sharing arrangement.<p>I.e. Auto insurance premiums reflect the loss the insurance company will experience from your driving.  Home insurance premiums reflect the loss the insurance company will experience from damage to your home.  Life insurance will reflect the loss the insurance company will experience from your death.  But health insurance (as implemented in the US) premiums explicitly reflect the loss the insurance companies experience from older, sicker people due to the various stipulations I listed in my posts above.<p>&gt;And to be honest, I think it&#x27;s not good that the taxpayers are paying here. The nice thing about insurance is that it gives incentives, such as &quot;don&#x27;t live somewhere if you can&#x27;t afford the dangers at this place&quot;.<p>I agree, and that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like using the word insurance when it&#x27;s not really insurance in the conventional sense.  It&#x27;s a tax, which I&#x27;m not opposed to, but I think there is value in recognizing that health insurance premiums are explicitly going to pay for healthcare for other people.<p>This manifests itself every time someone complains about ACA causing health insurance premiums to increase, as if the law or insurers caused the premiums to go up.<p>What really happened is the law allowed more healthcare to be provided to more people, and the way it funded it was by increasing health insurance premiums and having everyone pay (i.e. the mandate to purchase health insurance), and I think we&#x27;d be better off if we referred to this as a tax and recognize that the increase in insurance premiums is going towards benefiting others by giving them access to previously inaccessible healthcare.')
