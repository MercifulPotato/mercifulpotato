Making vaccines free, including for illegal immigrants (it&#x27;s incredibly stupid and self-defeating to deny it to them, as some places have purportedly done), and directing a lot of resources toward distribution and education are the only obvious things to me.<p>Like in an RPG, some countries put points into skill trees that lets them handle this kind of problem very well. If the U.S. has a weakness, culturally, legally, economically, and geographically, a pandemic is it; it&#x27;s just not the kind of thing it ever specced to handle.')
