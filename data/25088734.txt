How do you handle ruptures in the tube? How do you evacuate? and What do you do if your pod loses pressure? This isn&#x27;t like a 737 where you can give people oxygen while you drop to 10,000 feet when you lose pressure. That only works because at 35,000 ft the pressure is still high enough that you can breathe a higher concentration of oxygen for a short period of time, and not get hypoxia or decompression sickness.<p>Sure, you can add safety re-pressurization valves and escape hatches, but all of those seals are points of failure that need to be inspected and maintained across the entire length of the tube.')
