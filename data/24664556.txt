It&#x27;s not <i>literally</i> too expensive.<p>&gt; The best (only?) approach is to try to manage the negative externalities that the free flow of capital creates (rapidly accelerating wealth inequality, etc)<p>Nonsense. We already have laws on the books that would allow an enthusiastic regulator to break up the power of capital. What you are describing is a continuation of the liberal surrender to big money, with the hope that some kind of socialism takes form to offset it. Following the beaten path is much more likely to succeed.')
