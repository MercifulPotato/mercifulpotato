Like someone that shoots themselves (lethally, thorough and immediate) and then a month later they go out to lunch and eat a ham sandwich.<p>The ability to write out a scenario doesn&#x27;t mean the scenario is possible.<p>The theory is that &quot;I go back in time and kill myself&quot; is just as impossible as &quot;I kill myself then a month later eat a ham sandwich&quot;.  And for largely the same reason: both scenarios violate causality, so the universe can&#x27;t be shaped that way.')
