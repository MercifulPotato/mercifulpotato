(The &quot;poor who cannot take care of themselves&quot; are a minority who require different support)<p>One definition of poor is that people do not have access to enough money to meet their needs.<p>And, poor people cannot meet the needs of getting more money: tasks such as education, job search, etc, are limited by an immediate need to get rent, food, and warmth.<p>If the government &quot;gets out of the way&quot;, the safety net of being near-guaranteed to cover rent, food and warmth, will also quickly get out of the way, exacerbating poor peoples&#x27; problems.')
