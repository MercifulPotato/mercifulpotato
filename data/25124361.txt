I know I&#x27;m on the extreme theoretical edge, and so maybe your perspective is pragmatic enough to pass.  But even small images, javascripts, etc. should be protected by HTTPS, not just &quot;sensitive&quot; pages.<p>As an end user, I don&#x27;t want the possibility of anything being tampered with along the route.  As a content owner &#x2F; webmaster, I want the same.
