Anything you&#x27;d use C or C++ for today -- OS kernels, command-line applications, games, drivers, embedded software, signal processing, packet filtering, VMs, and applications that require precise control over resources. Zig brings a radical new approach to this niche that reconsiders how low-level programming <i>should</i> be done -- unlike, say, Rust which is an improved C++ -- and is one of the most interesting languages I&#x27;ve seen in a very long time.')
