Sometimes is even better work. For instance a bug report that is the fruit of a deep investigation is worth a lot more than a weak patch that is fixing the problem in the wrong way, often because of lack of understanding of the system. I don&#x27;t agree there is a clear distinction of patches and bug reports in which one is work donated to the project and the other is not.<p>Thanks for the report of the typo, I fixed it and appreciated it even if you didn&#x27;t send a patch to my post.')
