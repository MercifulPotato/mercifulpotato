User disables Javascript, CSS, does not send Cookies, does not send User-Agent.  User only sends a minumum number of headers needed to retrieve the page.  For example, Host: and Connection: only.<p>Putting aside arguments about whether or not this user is more or less &quot;unique&quot; than other users (the size of the group sending minimal data may be small), as well as any arguments about &quot;breaking websites&quot; (succesfull rendering via browser vs successful retrieval via HTTP), does the fingerprint itself contain any information that is valuable to advertisers.<p>For example, is the advertiser interested in guessing whether the user is using a Javascript and CSS-enabled browser that stores cookies, etc.  Will the advertiser perceive the user as a more or less worthy target than another user due to the specifics of the fingerprint.')
