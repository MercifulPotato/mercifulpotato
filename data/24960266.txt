Item(by='intrasight', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604246079, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24957200, text='I lived in Toronto for a couple of years in the early 90s. My apartment in a house had no off-street parking. No problem as all residents on street get a parking pass. But mine was never sent and so I got a ticket every day for many months. I ignored them.  My wife and I went out to dinner with some friends one weekend evening. Parked on a side street even though there were temporary &quot;no parking&quot; signs posted on lampposts.  Left restaurant to find a movie shoot in progress on that street. Someone gave me the name of the impound lot and our friends drove us there.<p>I had a sick feeling in my stomach because of those unpaid tickets. Certainly a much larger dollar amount than the value of my 15 year old Honda. Told my wife and friends that the best case was that they&#x27;d keep the car but that they may still come after us for the balance. But information flowed more slowly in 1991, and the tow lot had no knowledge yet of those unpaid tickets when I arrived to get my car, and I only had to pay $75 to get it back. If I&#x27;d waited, they perhaps would have accessed the ticket database.<p>Some time months later, we finally got our parking permit sticker. And somewhere in a file in the Toronto traffic department there&#x27;s probably a couple hundred tickets with my license plate.<p>As for the Accord. I had purchased used in Pittsburgh for $5000. Got married.  Drove to Toronto where I lived for 2 years during graduate school. Drove it to MA where I worked for 5 years.  Had a baby. Bought a 2nd car (also an Accord). Drove it to CT where I did consulting for a year. Then drove it back to Pittsburgh where I sold it for $500. Haven&#x27;t thought of that story for many years.')
