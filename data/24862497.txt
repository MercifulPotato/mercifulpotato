First of all, he&#x27;s not <i>ordering</i> anything. At best he is loading these items into a shopping cart, who knows, maybe that&#x27;s not even necessary depending on how the API is setup.<p>Second, it&#x27;s not $18K worth of product are <i>every</i> location. He is almost certainly adding one value menu ice cream cone (or maybe chocolate sundae) from, one from each location. These cost between $1-$1.50 depending on location. A quick search says there are probably just shy of 14K location in the USA, and based on these assumptions, the ~$18K &#x27;order&#x27; works based on these assumptions.<p>So, in essence he is filling the &#x27;basket&#x27; with one ice cream cone, one at every location, and checking the results of which locations are willing to fulfill the order. I don&#x27;t think this is malicious like some have imagined. It&#x27;s silly, and fun, and I was happy to come across it today!')
