If they did the same things Apple is doing in that way, the performance advantage of M1 shrinks. There&#x27;s no real &quot;magic&quot; in the M1 or Apple, it&#x27;s a reality distortion field that is hitting everyone right now. It&#x27;s entirely possible to outperform the M1, there just hasn&#x27;t been a need to do that until now - no major OS would have benefitted from an ARM on steroids before now so there wasn&#x27;t even a need for it.')
