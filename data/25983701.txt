EWM (or something like it) needs to be extended for scaling support. Applications could do the scaling themselves as they detect their toplevel windows be moved around, but i&#x27;m not aware of any application doing that and it&#x27;d be fighting the window manager so it isn&#x27;t a good idea anyway.<p>But the X server already provides all the necessary information and mechanism for implementing this, it is the clients that need to use it: the window managers need to implement some way to inform toplevel windows that they need to change scale (e.g. via a custom message), applications need to inform the window manager and the compositor that they support such scaling messages (e.g. via a window attribute) and compositors need to be able to scale windows that do not support this scaling (this will probably need a special window manager &lt;-&gt; compositor protocol for compositors that are independent from the window manager while still allowing the window manager to handle scaling without having to also be a compositor).')
