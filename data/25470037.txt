The problem is that there&#x27;s a sum of money for which I would have taken the risk and got a vaccine in January and had exposure to the disease in February.<p>Everyone in society would have been better off if I had been permitted that. America could have paid me and 49 others a million dollars each and come out wayyy ahead (since direct exposure tests will yield results way faster). Then a 3 month safety protocol and we&#x27;re off to the races.<p>But I can make that choice because I am comfortably above subsistence. If I do it, you know it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a combination of bravado, bragging rights, and this money I could survive without.<p>But if you actually allow the market to price this, the real price for the tester is approximately $10 in sub-Saharan Africa, and we know he&#x27;s on below subsistence and is really trading his body for another few days of life. We find that doing this is abhorrent.<p>An interesting effect that inequality prevents us from Pareto optimal actions and improving the human race as a whole.')
