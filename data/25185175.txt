They don&#x27;t prosecute speech which was specifically what I was responding to. \nNot prosecuting speech is not the same as supporting said speech.<p>Also I am not from the US. I am from the UK.<p>&gt; But exporting that terrorist thread to the European Union should ban Facebook in Europe.<p>You premise is faulty. The purpose of facebook is not to spread any sort of terrorism. It is a social network and communication tool. This would be like blaming the phone company for mafia organising a hit over a phone call.<p>In this specific example it does seem they were calling to violence which is not legal speech even in the US (IANAL though). So they should be removed.<p>&gt; USA here, USA there. There are more countries in the world, Facebook should take that into account or be banned.<p>I agree I am in the UK and I don&#x27;t like silicon valley trying to impose their set of values on the rest of the world either.<p>As for banning whole sites who purpose is not anything nefarious because some people do illegal acts on said platform is ridiculous.')
