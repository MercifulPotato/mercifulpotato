Item(by='throwawehh', descendants=None, kids=[25680673], score=None, time=1610051307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25676048, text='&gt; only a day after nationalists stormed the nation&#x27;s capitol with the intent to disrupt the democratic process in favor of an autocratic dictator.<p>I&#x27;m more curious to ask &quot;why&quot; people no longer trust the Government?<p>The real failure is that we&#x27;ve locked down society, destroyed the economy, and hastily thrown together an election so rife with problems that it&#x27;s led to an environment where millions of people do not trust the outcome. The same leaders implementing the lockdowns are meanwhile dictating orders from tropical resorts or caught breaking their own rules in blatant shows of hypocrisy.<p>The States have not done an adequate job quelling election fraud suspicions and as a result the President and his supporters no longer believe the result. Can you blame them? Is blaming them productive? It fails to address the problem and it won&#x27;t go away. Calling them white supremascists, nationalists, fasicsts, racists, and the other explicatives that have been used for the past four years is only going to further divide this nation and have the opposite intended outcome.<p>Did the media single out and target the people supporting, promoting, and engaging in the 3+ months of left-wing riots this past summer? Most of the media pundits now calling this latest event an insurrection, were previously condoning and explaining away &quot;mostly peaceful&quot; protests as multiple cities burned, as violent agitators stormed the Federal Courthouse in Portland for over 100 days, threw bombs, lit fires, burned cars, killed people (chop&#x2F;chaz&#x2F;portland), and more. And let&#x27;s not pretend that had Trump won the election, Antifa and other left-wing groups wouldn&#x27;t be over a month in of the same thing.<p>The level of hypocrisy and disconnect is so startling it&#x27;s scary. What I see is a total lack of understanding across the spectrum, a total failure to acknowledge both sides and apply standards consistently and unequivocally, a total failure of communication and decency. I&#x27;m not sure how the country moves in a positive direction.')
