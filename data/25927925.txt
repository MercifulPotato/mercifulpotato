It was written on the day of storming itself, and published at 5:54 PM, before the announced curfew had even started (and before some details about the government response were revealed[0]).<p>The Naval War College professor being interviewed in the article basically argues that unless the military is involved, it isn&#x27;t a &quot;coup&quot;, by definition.  That would make the phrase &quot;military coup&quot; redundant, and contradicts the Merriam-Webster definition[1] which characterizes it as:<p>&gt; a “sudden decisive exercise of force in politics,” but particularly the “violent overthrow or alteration of an existing government by a small group.”<p>By the professor&#x27;s logic, even if a president were to explicitly command his followers to storm the Capitol, eliminate his political opponents, and destroy the certifications of the electoral votes he had lost, allowing him to stay in power illegitimately, that still wouldn&#x27;t be a coup (or a self-coup, presumably).<p>In any case, another article[2] on the same site makes the opposing case:<p>&gt; It’s undeniable at this point. The United States is witnessing a coup attempt — a forceful effort to seize power against the legal framework.<p>Admittedly it was published even earlier than the other article, but it had been drafted in response to discussions which had begun before the protests had turned violent, vindicating the author&#x27;s position.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol#Law_enforcement_response" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2021_storming_of_the_United_St...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mercurynews.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;13&#x2F;insurrection-coup-and-sedition-heres-what-each-term-means&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mercurynews.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;13&#x2F;insurrection-coup-and...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foreignpolicy.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;coup-america-capitol-electoral-college-2020-election&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foreignpolicy.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;coup-america-capitol-el...</a>')
