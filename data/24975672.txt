To open up the joy of wine discovery for the novices through to the aficionados, by reimagining what the wine retail experience can be for one of the oldest consumer products on earth.<p>To give you an idea, one of our first products is something we like to call &quot;Spotify for Wine&quot;. We like to think of it as providing monthly wine adventures, customised to each member&#x27;s unique tastes, delivered to their door. Where they can learn as much (or as little) about their wines each month as they like.<p>Our open positions:<p>* Backend Engineer;<p>* Frontend Engineer;<p>* DevOps;<p>Stack: Python&#x2F;Django, React, React Native, Postgres, AWS, Netlify.<p>You can email me directly (&quot;beto&quot; at our domain name specified above and the subject line as &quot;From Hacker News&quot;).')
