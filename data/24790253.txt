Now, at the end of the transition, we can see how badly it was managed; Python 2 could have been retrofitted with nearly every breaking change and it would have been lower-friction.<p>This doesn&#x27;t make any logical sense. Your saying take the breaking changes in python 3 and put it into python 2? That&#x27;s just a version number. You can call it version 2.999999.8 and do all the changes in there and the outcome is identical.<p>No. Every breaking change must have a downstream change in every library that uses that breaking change. That&#x27;s the reality of breaking changes. No way around it.<p>Tell me of such a migration as huge as python 2-&gt;3 that was as successful. For sure there were huge problems along the way and it took forever. However I have heard of very very few migrations in the open source world that ended up with an outcome as successful as python.<p>&gt;First, the excellent readability leads directly into hard-to-read code structures.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with this either. You refer to fortran but most programmers here haven&#x27;t used it so you&#x27;ll have to provide an example for readers to see your point.')
