Iâ€™m 100% sure this was in fact because of technical debt, even though my team members would disagree.<p>I&#x27;ve also had this experience, where a product accumulated so much tech debt (in part, due to my decisions) that it was simpler for the business to outsource the functionality. That wasn&#x27;t the only reason, but it was a big one. When tech debt sand gets in the software delivery gears, the allure of vendors increases. Sure, the business won&#x27;t get things exactly like they want them, but they won&#x27;t have to deal with missed deadlines and degraded functionality either.')
