Is it mainly information in near recent experiences or observations, is it an aggregate that is somewhat in relative isolation to observable &#x27;reality&#x27; that develops over time and if so, are there objective types of experiences that promote mutation of the internal experience? Can some of those consist of more internal experiences, and if so, at what threshold does such an internal experience become a self-sustaining feed back loop?')
