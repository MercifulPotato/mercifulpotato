They&#x27;re saying exactly the same thing.<p>We&#x27;ve had sprawling suburbs in this country since at least the 50s.  In that time we haven&#x27;t really seen any municipality go bankrupt from infrastructure or have infrastructure costs come to dominate the budget.  And we continue to have roads and sewers and so forth.<p>The only conclusion from those set of facts is that Strongtown&#x27;s argument is fundamentally flawed.  And indeed it is.  For all their case studies and imaginative math they have one glaring and fatal flaw.  They can&#x27;t point to one city or town and say this city is no more because they couldn&#x27;t afford their infrastructure.')
