To me, the main value proposition of Rust is memory safety without GC pauses[1]. But the complexity tax you pay for the borrow checker is enormous. If pauseless GC is possible (and Azul seems to demonstrate that it is, or close enough) then I would much prefer to just use GC.<p>[1] I&#x27;m aware of many other benefits, but this is the one most unique to Rust and the one I care about most by far.')
