I&#x27;m not convinced the original hedge fund shorters have really closed out all their positions at a loss. Or maybe they&#x27;ve closed out some of their shorts at a loss, then entered the short again at a higher point and are now poised to make even more money on the (inevitable) way down.<p>Conversely, a few investors that bought cheap might have made huge returns - if they sold at inflated prices (passing the hot potato to the next greater fool). If they didn&#x27;t sell, then the paper gains will vanish.')
