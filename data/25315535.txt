I have at times experienced harsh criticism from members of the Wiki[pm]edia community, and rest assured that you&#x27;re criticism is by no means harsh, but is constructive in tone, even if I might disagree with some of it.<p>I probably bias myself by being too used to the status quo, and thinking its better than it really is. As a computer programmer, i probably underestimate the problems with the complexity of wikitext - since after all, a user facing markup language should not be anywhere near as complex as a programming language but there are times where it does feels like wikitext is basically spaghetti code.<p>Anyways, cheers.')
