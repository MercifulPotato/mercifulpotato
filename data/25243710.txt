This summer I was spending a lot of time at my parent&#x27;s and their land internet connection was spotty. At the same time, Bouygues ran a campaign where I could get an extra 20 GB for next to nothing, so I was considering that. Read the fine print which basically said &quot;the allowance doesn&#x27;t apply to tethered use&quot;. I didn&#x27;t care enough to challenge them on this so I passed.<p>Edit: Just checked the available options, this is still the case. Can&#x27;t give a direct link for some reason, so here&#x27;s a screenshot: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;rQgoz0m" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;rQgoz0m</a><p>Basically this is an option for &quot;unlimited internet on the weekends&quot;. The originally hidden disclaimer says, among other things, &quot;except for modem mode&quot;.')
