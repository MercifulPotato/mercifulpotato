There&#x27;s no need to tell people to be ashamed for disagreeing with you, or to make baseless ad hominem attacks such as &#x27;I bet none of you have ever written anything substantial.&#x27;<p>This is a discussion forum. FS&#x2F;OSS licensing is an extremely contentious subject as everyone in the OS community probably already knows. <i>People are going to disagree.</i> Let&#x27;s keep this a clean fight where we discuss the merits of different arguments and attack arguments rather than attacking people, shall we?<p>Trying to &quot;shame&quot; people who disagree with you or talk about how &quot;disappointed&quot; you are in them or maligning their professional work is not argumentation, it&#x27;s bullying.<p>EDIT: while writing this comment, someone called me &quot;autistic&quot; in another sub-thread here. Gave me a chuckle... anyway add that to the ad-hom pile.')
