Item(by='bryanrasmussen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612018593, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25968444, text='I think I use Stack Overflow once a month at the most, generally when I go there with a problem what happens is one of the following:<p>I have a problem I can&#x27;t fix, I start writing down the problem, I realize as I am writing it down that it cannot be what I thought was the issue. I try other avenues for a few more hours and solve the problem.<p>I have a problem that I can&#x27;t fix. I realize that I cannot reliably cut the problem down in minimal code to get a response on Stack Overflow because it is not a minimal problem. I try some other route to fix the problem.<p>I have a problem that as I am writing on StackOverflow I realize I have not tried a particular solution, I try it and solve my problem, I do not finish writing my problem.<p>I have a problem that seems like it is pretty esoteric, I ask a question, it never gets answered, I either manage to solve my problem, finding some github issue or similar suggesting the solution is a bunch of dependency updates or just not solvable. I either solve my issue or find some hacky workaround or do decide the requested functionality should be replaced by something else. No one ever answers my question, 6 months later someone says they have the same problem and did I solve it.<p>I have a problem that I actually finish writing and asking, someone responds and has misunderstood my question but their answer while wrong for what I&#x27;m answering gives me a clue on how to solve my problem.<p>I have something I want to do but I do not have workable code because I know absolutely no way about proceeding with the idea, so I do not ask StackOverflow because they just aren&#x27;t helpful for anything that isn&#x27;t simple.<p>I have a problem that is something like one of the previous situations, but I realize as I am writing it that it will get deleted or modded or something because it just won&#x27;t work for StackOverflow guidelines, luckily most of the time when this happens I realize it should really be asked on one of the other Stack exchange communities. If I have progressed far enough to actually go ask a question on some other Stack Exchange community it tends to be answered reasonably quickly.<p>I have a problem in some area I do not know much about, perhaps because I am just started using the framework or something, my problem is simple but it does not work as I thought, I ask, it is a simple misunderstanding of how I thought it would work, someone responds with a solution really quickly and I fix my problem.<p>on edit: fixed bad grammatical error<p>on further edit: if StackOverflow went away pretty much nothing would change for me.')
