The fundamental force being CO2 acting as a greenhouse gas.  This was well understood.  In school in the early 90s it was pretty common to see greenhouse gas demonstrations at science fairs.<p>The question wasn&#x27;t if it was warming&#x2F;cooling, but simply how much impact humans were having on the atmosphere.  There&#x27;s a whole lot of atmosphere and humans are very small so it wasn&#x27;t as clear how big of an impact we were having.  Even for people who knew the math there was uncertainty in the inputs.  Oil companies were best prepared to know how much CO2 were were releasing because they knew exactly how many barrels a day they were extracting from the ground.  Everybody else has to go on public figures that may or may not be accurate.')
