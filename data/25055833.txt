But we know that Biden has a much higher ratio of mail-in ballots than Trump, and maybe Jorgensen voters are closer to Trump than Biden, in their voting habits?<p>Just speculation. Same goes for Kanye West. Who knows how many of those votes were serious and planned, and how many were just for the &quot;lols&quot; at the polling station.<p>Points is - both Jorgensen and West are so few compared to the rest, that seeing just tens to a couple of hundred votes per TEN thousand doesn&#x27;t really seem out of place.')
