It would be very interesting to see yoga developed with a scientific approach.<p>Yoga is all about living in harmony. Some parts of it like Asanas, and Pranayama can be measured as it impacts the physical body. I have no problem with Wim taking a part of it and popularizing it but in not admitting to its sources he is preventing from others making further discoveries of the list of techniques available. What he is teaching is just one of paranayama technique from a list of many.<p>I do not doubt his achievements and commitment to excellence.')
