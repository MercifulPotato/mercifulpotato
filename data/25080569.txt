I haven&#x27;t seen a similar book before for software engineering, so I&#x27;m very intrigued and intend to read it.<p>I feel bad for asking something from a free resource, that took a long time to make and put together, so please ignore it if it&#x27;s a lot of trouble. Is it possible to publish epub or mobi formats of the book?<p>That would help ereaders format it better, pdf&#x27;s are inflexible. If it&#x27;s not easy, please ignore this request.<p>Thank you for writing the book.')
