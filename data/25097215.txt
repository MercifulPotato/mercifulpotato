Ryzen 5 2600 ($150) + RTX 3070 ($500) for $650<p>2. i5-10900k ($280) + RX 5700XT ($330) for $610<p>The first build with the RTX 3070 is far better. The RTX 3070 buys you into 1440p high&#x2F;ultra @ 90+ FPS, or 4k med&#x2F;high @ 60+ FPS. Will the 2600 bottleneck that GPU? Maybe, but you still get better performance for the price by investing in the GPU versus the CPU.')
