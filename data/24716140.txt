A better diet can cure depression. More exercise can cure depression<p>We are not talking about a mere feeling down here. Depression is a clinically defined term with specific criteria, and no nothing you can fix with a new hobby is clinical depression, and yes if you claim to be fixing it with any tool <i>which you make available to public</i> you need to be a licensed professional.<p>&gt; Nobody owns the intellectual property to &quot;the cure of depression&quot;.<p>Luckily intellectual property protection is not the only protection we have around medical interventions. No one has the intellectual property to tonsillectomy either, and you&#x27;re free to try operating on your own, but you will get into trouble real fast if you advertised you doing it to public as a fix to some ailment.')
