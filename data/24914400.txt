I&#x27;ve had auditors find a configuration file with passwords on a production server that uses them, then try to present a report on how they logged into each one. Duh, of course they work.)<p>2) This is related to #1, but business people, especially across silos in an organization, may not fully comprehend an exploit unless there is obvious proof. I&#x27;ve seen laughable levels of denial by otherwise intelligent people once they get into management. As in, &quot;Yeah you showed it to me on the screen, but I&#x27;ll need to confirm it with other sources&quot; who then look at the same screen.<p>Pro tip 1: by default AWS AMI&#x27;s are not encrypted. (The reason is that the main list of AMIs doesn&#x27;t use your KMS keys.) So if you have a compliance program that requires encryption at rest, get cracking!<p>Pro tip 2: All theoretical exploits have shown to be practical ones later. Stop deceiving yourself.')
