I use Python at work. Let me have my fun with lifetimes and types at home.<p>But I also agree with the other posters that this is a bit missing the point about what type and memory safety are supposed to achieve.<p>In all seriousness, if type safety feels like a burden and not an aid, then either you&#x27;re using the wrong language for the application or the wrong language for the developer.<p>Don&#x27;t forget that Rust exists to solve a problem.
