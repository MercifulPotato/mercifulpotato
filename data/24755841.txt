In general, police should have enough kit to easily overpower the criminals they expect to face. We have been fortunate in many areas (e.g., most of the US, Europe and practically all urban areas) for the police to not <i>need</i> automatic weaponry. But this is not universal. In other parts of the world police may face a much better equipped adversaries and automatic weapons.<p>We should strive to make the world safer so the strongest weapon the police on the street has is a book for writing fines, but until we are there we should equip law <i>enforcement</i> to overcome threats they expect to face.
