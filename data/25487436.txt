For normal developer gigs in Germany you&#x27;ll usually get 70-80â‚¬&#x2F;hour. Contracts are often for 6 months and will get extended in 6 months steps. Depending on how much you work you can make 150k+. Still not comparable to SV salaries, but better than being a permanent employee in Germany.')
