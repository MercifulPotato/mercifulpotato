A tangential question: At elite levels how well does performance on an ergo translate to on water performance? I rowed reasonably successfully at a junior level and I was much faster in a boat than others that would kick my butt on an ergo. This was always explained away as better technique. Iâ€™d be interested to know at a level where everyone has great technique if ergo&#x2F;boat performance is more consistent.')
