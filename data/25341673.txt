Looking forward to a marathon stream. :)<p>A question about fuzzing and determinism:<p>It seems like this requirement of determinism is connected to (and reinforces) a brute force approach to discovering problematic inputs.<p>This precludes strategies like performing a truly stochastic search (where you put complete faith in the randomness) over your input space.<p>Are people attempting this kind of thing? Are there additional requirements to fuzzing that make probabilistically finding a thin trajectory through the input space undesirable?')
