The difference between gross and gross-gross is that it&#x27;s basicaly the same taxes as between net and gross, but around ~80% of it. So this part is never talked about. When job wages are specified it&#x27;s always in gross. So basicaly most workers truly don&#x27;t see that the actual taxes are almost double than what they see in the difference between net and gross pay..')
