Item(by='kaens', descendants=None, kids=[24712697], score=None, time=1602101958, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24711392, text='you&#x27;re off by a little bit.<p>&gt; The duty and role of a government is to act in the best interest of their citizens which that government represents.<p>&gt; In a well functioning representative democracy, voters will kick out politicians&#x2F;administrations that donâ€™t represent their interests well.<p>part of what i&#x27;m saying is that if these statements are true, then we are not in a functioning representative democracy.<p>&gt;if i lie to you a bunch and you vote me in, i&#x27;m not representing you.<p>&gt;This feels like a contradiction to the previous point that<p>correct. it is an argument against it.<p>&gt; Maybe a lying politician gets to do this once, but after that it&#x27;s the populace&#x27;s job to hold them accountable. The people have a responsibility in a democracy as well. I agree it&#x27;s not easy and opportunists will try to rig the system. Being difficult doesn&#x27;t absolve us of the responsibility.<p>regardless of whether or not i agree that in &quot;the way its supposed to work&quot; this is the case, it&#x27;s been a lot more than once and for a lot longer than a little bit of time. longer than i&#x27;ve been alive.<p>with what time, resources, or authority are you suggesting the populace hold them accountable with? don&#x27;t answer that just yet.<p>&gt; I get the impression we fundamentally disagree that there&#x27;s &quot;zero accountability to the people&quot;. I think there is, but people may just not have the fortitude to do it for a variety of reasons.<p>We don&#x27;t disagree in the sense you are talking about, technically. Zero accountability that the accountable will accept as valid though.<p>If i am born into a life with zero political agency and a constant threat of not having food or shelter in a populace that is largely entirely alienated not only from their peers but from also what they produce and consume how is that me getting what i deserve? In what way do you expect the hypothetical me to be organized or able to organize? How successful do you think someone like that could be at doing what you are suggesting when they don&#x27;t have more than a $400 buffer and no supply chain?<p>&gt; In many ways, I think the adage of &quot;People get the government they deserve&quot; is true.<p>I don&#x27;t think the adage you&#x27;re referring to is true at all; on the contrary I think that the responses you are speaking of simply take a long time to bubble up into enough of the populace to make them inevitable. Once that threshold is crossed you may as well swap the adage around. The structures and superstructures of societal organization are things that exist prior to you, it&#x27;s natural for them to be baked into assumptions of &quot;just how things are&quot;.<p>&gt; If you want to tolerate rigged systems or lying politicians, or don&#x27;t want to get actively engaged, what kind of system do you think you deserve?<p>I don&#x27;t think that inaction in face of miserable conditions that have been part of your experience of reality since day one makes someone &quot;deserve&quot; those conditions. It just makes them someone living in the reality they&#x27;ve been presented with. Engagement however, of all sorts, has been rising')
