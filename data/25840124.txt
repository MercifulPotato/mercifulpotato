If you want to talk about, say, Python, you&#x27;ll probably go to &#x2F;r&#x2F;python. But what if &#x2F;r&#x2F;python&#x27;s mods start sending the sub down the drain? Go to &#x2F;r&#x2F;python2? &#x2F;r&#x2F;python3? &#x2F;r&#x2F;python_lang? New users are still going to go to &#x2F;r&#x2F;python and be sucked into a bad community. If they&#x27;re really invested in discussing Python, maybe they&#x27;ll find &#x2F;r&#x2F;python_lang, but if they&#x27;re not they&#x27;ll just bounce off and the entire community won&#x27;t grow.<p>IMO reddit needs namespaces. Back in the beginning, there weren&#x27;t subreddits, just reddit.com (like HN is now), and as reddit grew they created subreddits to divide discussion. I think it&#x27;s time for another subdivision. This might work well with their attempts to become more of a people-focused social media company: a person can start a subreddit and appoint their own moderators: &#x2F;r&#x2F;ranger207&#x2F;python would be an entirely different subreddit from &#x2F;r&#x2F;antihero&#x2F;python. This reduces the &quot;default name&quot; problem: if you want to discuss Python and search &quot;python subreddit&quot; you&#x27;ll get both results. You won&#x27;t automatically assume &#x2F;r&#x2F;ranger207&#x2F;python is better than &#x2F;r&#x2F;antihero&#x2F;python like you would assume &#x2F;r&#x2F;python is better than &#x2F;r&#x2F;python_lang. Anyway, that&#x27;s a big digression...')
