Back in these days there were two computers in each classroom.  One for the teacher and one for the students to share.  Generally, students never used the single computer because what is the point, there&#x27;s only one.  My AP Calc teacher&#x27;s &quot;student&quot; computer was broken.  The school IT department couldn&#x27;t be fussed to fix it, so we asked if we could and we did.  As a reward for fixing the computer, we were allowed to use it.  We played GTA (original) every day.  One person was back there at a time during lecture.  Your goal was to find a flame thrower and a chain of joggers, we called them the school children.  If you killed all the joggers in the chain you got a big bonus.  You can see where this is headed.  Once you got the flame thrower and the school children on the screen you announced it to the class, lecture would stop, you&#x27;d flame thrower the school children while everyone watched, and then you traded off to the next person and the lecture continued.  All but one person passed the AP exam that year.')
