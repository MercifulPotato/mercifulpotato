And for some languages, being a diehard adherent has some signaling function.<p>E.g. a Haskell programmer, regardless of the suitability of the language itself, is probably serious about programming, and has advanced skills in certain areas of mathematics â€” you don&#x27;t hear of too many &quot;Haskell script kiddies&quot;.<p>Whether such programmers would accept being systematically underpaid, I don&#x27;t know. It seems an unethical idea in any case, and if the language is truly N times as productive, programmers versed in it should be well worth more than a standard industry salary.')
