No European country subscribes to this view and they remain viable and vibrant Democracies.<p>I find it an interesting peculiarity that so many people here think there is major value in the broadcasting of known falsehoods and propaganda, and equally bizarre the notion that a random individual&#x27;s free speech is in any way comparable to the power wielded by moneyed interests. In practical terms American free speech laws are really only for immunizing the rich and powerful, and their corporations, from any deleterious consequences to their false speech.')
