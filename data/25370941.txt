We&#x27;re bound to run out of helium sometime, therefore we&#x27;ll run out in 10  years.<p>The arguments presented in this bet are of the second sort.  They do <i>not</i> say anything about why what they&#x27;re betting on should happen in 10 years or in any other timeframe.<p>Sure, the bet is for the end of 2020, but in order to be persuasive you actually have to make an argument for why what you predict does or does not happen in that timeframe.<p>No such arguments were even attempted here.  That&#x27;s what&#x27;s so frustrating.')
