I&#x27;ve had accounts with lots of karma generated by simply agreeing with everything I read or just commenting with useless side suggestions. T<p>I&#x27;ve experimented a lot. Without changing tone just disagreeing with a popular opinion is all that you need to get voted down. I&#x27;ve even experimented with emotionally charged impolite popular opinions. People will vote you up just because they agree.<p>If I wanted a shitload of karma. I know how to get it. Removing one or two of the more &quot;expressive&quot; sentences above will in my experience not do much for a thread that is very very biasedly supporting FP. FP is great, I prefer it but most people cannot maintain such neutrality for their favorite paradigm. Or favorite anything for that matter.<p>Not to mention if you recall a while back someone posted a GPT-3 AI generated story that got voted to the front page. Most commenters didn&#x27;t realize it was AI generated. A select few were able to figure it out and they posted comments that were vehemently voted down for not being in agreement with the general sentiment. HN is a technical crowd but they are not above common mob behavior.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;8&#x2F;16&#x2F;21371049&#x2F;gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;8&#x2F;16&#x2F;21371049&#x2F;gpt3-hacker-news...</a><p>Scroll down to the picture. The person stated facts but his facts were misinterpreted to be attacks and he was told to be civil by someone who thought of himself as level headed. The reality is that the levelheaded person is as biased as one can get.<p>You think you&#x27;re helping me. You think I&#x27;m putting up stubborn resistance to your help. Is that the case or am I just simply describing to you some of the insight I&#x27;ve gotten from messing around with HN for over a decade? Did I in fact put up stubborn resistance or am I just conversing with you and stating a disagreement? Hard to say.<p>Your immediate assumptions are no different than the &quot;levelheaded&quot; dude from earlier. Let&#x27;s just be clear, I&#x27;m fully aware of the &quot;expressive&quot; areas in my posts.<p>You will also note that many of the posters assumed I&#x27;m attacking FP and that I don&#x27;t have much experience with FP. All wrong assumptions. I have lots of experience and I prefer FP over other paradigms. I am simply stating that I disagree with the fact that algebra is the future of programming and can replace all imperative programming.')
