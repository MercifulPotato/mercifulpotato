This thread takes it as a given that a non-distributed DB is better if you don&#x27;t need to scale up (i.e. if you run a single &quot;node&quot;). Let me offer a couterpoint: it&#x27;s easier to embed CRDB into some software you&#x27;re distributing than it is to embed Postgres. This is to say, we do try to compete at every scale (well, perhaps not at SQLite scale).\nCRDB doesn&#x27;t have all the SQL features of PG, but it does have its pluses: CRDB does online schema changes, it is generally simpler to run, comes with a UI, comes with more observability, can backup to the cloud, can be more easily embedded into tests.<p>Online schema changes are a big deal; the other thing that I hope will help us win small-scale hearts and minds is the ever-improving observability story. I hope CRDB will develop world-class capabilities here. Other open-source databases traditionally have not had many capabilities out of the box.')
