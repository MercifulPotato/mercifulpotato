As far as I know, neither has been commonly used since the release of MacOS X in 2001 (I mean, older Mac OS machines were surely being used for several years after that too, but it&#x27;s been a while). It does not seem like a particularly likely revenue opportunity. Like most other archaic orphaned file formats, with a few exceptions.<p>I&#x27;m not totally sure who the audience is for this hobby project even! It says people running Mac OS System 6, which was released in 1988, replaced by System 7 in 1991. (If you were running System 7,or system 8 released in 97, or system 9 released in 99 -- you wouldn&#x27;t need this converter). I do wonder who these people are running a 1988 Mac OS release, on what hardware, and what they are doing!<p>A Mac OS System 6 machine CAN connect to the internet, but barely, I think this may have been the first version that did TCP&#x2F;IP built into the OS, but it was finnicky. It got a lot more solid in System 7.')
