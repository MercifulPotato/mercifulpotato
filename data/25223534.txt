I wanted to switch the DNS to AdGuard because my mother-in-law had a JavaScript pop-up that convinced her to call &quot;Microsoft&quot;.   I put uBlock Origin on Chrome and Edge.<p>Users can set the DNS setting on their devices to use something else but I bet it&#x27;s a tiny fraction that do.   As somebody who worked at an ISP, I can sympathize a little bit with not wanting customers to f*ck up their DNS.')
