I always think of the example of Lebron James. If he was always comparing himself to others he wouldn&#x27;t have gotten nearly as good as he is. Especially since he&#x27;s risen to the top end of the skill bracket. Comparing yourself to the people in the room only gets you better than the best person in that room. That strikes me as a very slow way to get to be the best ever unless you&#x27;re in some supremely gargantuan rooms.<p>I think what everyone ought to do is only ever compare yourself to yourself. &quot;Am I doing this better than the last time I did it? If not how can I do that?&quot; It&#x27;s a function that&#x27;s always growing and the rate of growth is how much effort you put in. It&#x27;s not bounded by the people you&#x27;re comparing yourself to.')
