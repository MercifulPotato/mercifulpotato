While that might be true (personally don’t think it particularly is), non-US persons don’t enjoy any of the rights of the US constitution. There are different laws in different places. Assange should enjoy the British Rights to freedom of the press&#x2F;expression, whatever those are (or the rights relevant to wherever he was).')
