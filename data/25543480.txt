To be fair to the original, the whole &#x27;this research will save the planet shtick&#x27; is pretty much boilerplate for any paper[0].<p>Photocatalytic H2 production will never be practical vs even boring old solar-&gt;electricity-&gt;Water-splitting. Literal acres of catalyst and transparent plumbing are not cheap or maintenance free, never mind that a hydrogen &#x27;farm&#x27; producing mixed hydrogen and oxygen will make the Hindenburg look like a tea candle in comparison.<p>re the conditions: the energy cutoff appears to be at around 370nm, so it essentially operates under UV light only, at atmospheric to a few bar pressure and close enough to room temperature.<p>[0]e.g. Every nanotechnology paper is going to claim to all but revolutionize one or more of: drug delivery, cancer treatment, materials science, or my favorite, lithium batteries. Nine times out of ten though they are just taking &lt;insert metal&gt; and making &lt;insert shape&gt;: something which is useful to know how to do, but not typically revolutionary.')
