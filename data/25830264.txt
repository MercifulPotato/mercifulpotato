With stores closed, services shuttered and experiences unavailable, people are holding onto money longer, and it&#x27;s changing hands less.  If money is changing hands less (lower velocity) you need more money in the system to enable the same amount of commerce.<p>Once the economy starts back up again, the fed could reduce the money supply in line with the increasing velocity.')
