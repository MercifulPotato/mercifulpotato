I suppose you can always go the sassy option and just offload this problem onto Travis or CircleCI, but then they&#x27;re the ones stuck figuring out how to rack thousands of Mac Minis, dealing with thermals in a machine that isn&#x27;t set up for hot&#x2F;cold aisles, a computer that doesn&#x27;t have a serial port or dedicated management interface, etc.<p>If you&#x27;re a big enough org or the app is for internal use, this might not be an option anyway. At that point I imagine most people just give up on it and figure out how to run macOS on a generic VM. But at that point you have to convince your IT department that it&#x27;s worth it doing a thing that is definitely unsupported and in violation of the TOS.<p>Or maybe some of these are big enough that they are able to approach Apple and get a special license for N concurrent instances of macOS running on virtualized hardware? Who knows.')
