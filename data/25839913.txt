We have to deal with jfrog, who has separate billing teams for SaaS and on-prem so for us to switch from on-prem to SaaS is a pain in the ass. If AWS ever offers artifacts storage with more artifact types, then obviously we&#x27;re switching. And that&#x27;s just 100% so we don&#x27;t have to deal with jfrog&#x27;s dumb ass contracts anymore, never mind pricing.<p>ugh the pain that comes from negotiating our contract every year. Or the pain that comes from trying to get trial licenses. Or the pain we&#x27;re seeing now from switching to SaaS.')
