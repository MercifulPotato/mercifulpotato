Item(by='garmaine', descendants=None, kids=[25726451], score=None, time=1610351458, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25725755, text='&gt; But we are passed the point of objectivity in what may be the first battle in a civil war.<p>A small crowd of extremist nut jobs walked from one end of the national mall to the other and pushed their way past an ill-equipped police squad to damage some property in the national capital, and assaulted one police officer enough that he would die of his wounds.<p>This is a very bad thing. I hope that every single one of the people involved are caught, tried, and pay for their crimes. The desecration of the capital itself is shameful and sacrilegious, and that is not lost on me either.<p>But &quot;civil war&quot;? Please research what an actual civil war is like. Watch some news coverage of Syria. The storming of the capital is an act of insurrection, legally speaking, and it should be prosecuted as such. But are you really suggesting that we are near the point of nation-wide violent armed uprising, pitting brother-against-brother in a conflict that will rip apart any semblance of society (in which I MUST choose sides!), and reduce our cities to cratered wastelands like has happened to Aleppo or Raqqa?<p>I generously don&#x27;t think that is what you literally mean. But then I don&#x27;t know how else to interpret &quot;the first battle in a civil war&quot; except as exaggeration for effect, hyperbole. Please don&#x27;t do that.')
