That corrupted picture of your kid.<p>Who knows.<p>I&#x27;ll tell you, who knows. God damn every sysadmin (or the modern equivalent) can tell you how often they get ECC errors. And at even a small scale you&#x27;ll encounter them. I have, on servers and even on an SAN Storage controller, for crying out loud.<p>If you care about your data, use ECC memory in your computers.')
