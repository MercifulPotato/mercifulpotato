It’a a bunch of rich people in California. If you want a public utility for communication and socializing, go help build one. Contribute to Mastodon or the rest of the fediverse. Write to representatives (or become one yourself) and propose legislation to fund a public tool that is actually owned by the people. It could even be part of the fediverse!<p>But asking Twitter to do any random thing someone wants because they are a big company is insane and is going to cause us nothing but pain.')
