I&#x27;d also like to see political discussion focused more on substantial issues. I also dislike it when people attack one candidate for something while ignoring their preferred choice doing the same thing.<p>Do you honestly believe that the reasons you asked about are the only reasons someone would support Joe Biden over Donald Trump? I&#x27;m not a fan of Trump but I certainly don&#x27;t think everyone who supports him does it because they&#x27;re either crazy or family.')
