I don&#x27;t unless it actually happens (schrodinger&#x27;s cat), but there&#x27;s a high probability this would be the case rather than not.<p>Will people still get infected? Yes, I&#x27;m sure they will since typical face masks are not P100. But when you&#x27;re preventing ~80% transfer on an exhale and ~60% on inhale, if both participants had masks on then that filters a lot.<p>Granted this assumes other precautions would be followed as well since obviously places like bars and restaurants where you have no mask on will continue to be an issue.')
