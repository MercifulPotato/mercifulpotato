Item(by='palimpsests', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610990614, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25816339, text='Thanks for your reply, no apologies necessary, and I am glad you found a teacher that you resonate with!<p>I have degrees in physics and music. I understand all of this from first principles.<p>Speaking as someone who has spent tens of thousands of hours in music, with other musicians at many different stages of learning - for probably the majority of music students, this is (initially) essentially useless and potentially even obfuscatory and unhelpful. It can be interesting to learn about later if someone wants to. Does nothing to help people get better at playing their instrument, which is what most people seem to want. Having an interest in acoustics and the physics of music can be helpful in driving someone to play and practice if it simply gets someone to spend more time with their instrument.<p>In your reply I wonder if past music teachers have emphasized memorizing theory without application - in what I have seen, this is not the norm. The emphasis is on practice and application, developing an internalized somatic memory (e.g. muscle memory &amp; ear training), and technique in order to avoid hurting yourself.<p>Internalized somatic memory is not the same thing as memorizing concepts with your mind :)<p>Let me ask you this - it sounds like you are coming from a classical &#x2F; folk perspective? I’m coming from a jazz foundational perspective, that’s the “form” of music theory education I am referring to. Which is quite common in the U.S. Do you have much practical experience playing &#x2F; learning jazz or related genres on an instrument? (is this a genre that even interests you?)')
