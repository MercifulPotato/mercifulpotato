This is helpful whether you&#x27;re initially supportive of or opposed to the idea. In either case, you have to be explicit about the conditions&#x2F;facts you think are necessary for success and why they&#x27;re either true or false, which tends to lead to a more concrete discussion with more space for agreement and shared understanding. If you&#x27;re supportive, this makes it easier to acknowledge that those conditions&#x2F;facts might not necessarily be true. If you&#x27;re opposed, this makes it easier to appreciate the idea and work on it despite your reservations.')
