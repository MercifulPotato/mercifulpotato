A. Corey for me was a breath of fresh air.<p>The book really considers things like the time it would take to go from Earth to Mars, or the edge of the Solar System, and also take into account gravity forces in battles and other events.<p>It still has a lot of very sci-fi things in some areas, but it was very interesting to see that going from Earth to somewhere after Neptune really took 8+ months for the passengers, including some of the psychological stress of spending that much time together on a small ship.<p>The TV Series is also good but misses a lot of those little things that the books explicitly deal with. It became my favorite book series because of that.<p>No magically going to another galaxy in the blink of an eye. Going to another planet always required planning, sacrifices, time, etc. In addition it also has some pretty nice politics compared to other space stories.')
