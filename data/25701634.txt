They want these these rules (even if it&#x27;s more censorship) applied evenly to both right and left speech.<p>While what we have right now is not &quot;free&quot; speech, even moderated speech has a bias and both sides point to the other when it comes to these rules being applied unfairly.\nRepealing 230 is a way to hurt who they see as responsible - the companies running the services as they are the one who apply these moderation rules unfairly.')
