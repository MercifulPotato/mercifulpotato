It&#x27;s also useful as a reducing agent in steel production. Finally, the higher energy density makes it suitable for larger vehicles like long range trucks. Electrification is preferablem but not everything can be electrified.<p>Also, if you have enough renewable generation capacity to reliably cover peak loads then there are also going to be times when you have massive overproduction. Battery costs for the coming decades will be too high with to buffer multiple weeks of power use so it makes sense to have an &quot;electricity sink&quot; where you can dump any excess. Hydrogen production via electrolysis is an excellent option for that since it&#x27;s very quick to scale up and down and the end product has many different uses.')
