Those who are risk averse should impose restrictions on themselves, not require everyone else to alter their lives. Life after all, carries risks. Anything you do has a nonzero risk. And if normal life is OK during a seasonal flu why is COVID any different? It seems  arbitrary to suddenly claim that personal choice and individual assessment of risk-benefit tradeoff is not allowed above some risk threshold. Same for the potential reality of required vaccinations - bodily autonomy is sacrosanct and it should not be violated.<p>I say this as someone who wears masks, hasnâ€™t been to any gatherings, and is fully vaccinated. Freedom and choice matters.')
