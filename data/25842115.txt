Broadly though, I agree that &#x27;lisp semantics&#x27; is a very fuzzy term. I&#x27;d claim this family has several strong semantic themes despite their differences. E.g. their approach to meta programming, their approach to dynamism, lexically scoped closures, and the everything-is-a-expression rule. Julia fits all these themes (and others), though it&#x27;s dynasmism is a bit more restricted than most lispy languages, and it&#x27;s AST is printed differently, even if it&#x27;s internally represented and manipulated the same as other lispy languages.<p>You&#x27;re probably right though that we wouldn&#x27;t be tempted to group them together nowadays if it weren&#x27;t for their syntactic similarities.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MikeInnes&#x2F;Continuations.jl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MikeInnes&#x2F;Continuations.jl</a>')
