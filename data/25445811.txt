Your options are to be equally sectarian &quot;back&quot; or to attempt compromise, but compromise met with sectarianism is defeat. We saw this with Obama, every time he compromised on healthcare republicans just demanded more compromises. That&#x27;s how he ended up barely passing Romney Care. I&#x27;m sure someone on the right can make the same claim about something the right compromised on and failed to progress.<p>I think this just has to keep going on and on until there are move voters in the middle than the edges or until voters get tired of deadlocked politics. And remember, people don&#x27;t change their minds, they die and get replaced by new people. So this will not be fixed any time soon...')
