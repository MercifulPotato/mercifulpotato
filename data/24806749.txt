Thats the 50% of the fun writing in it, because you will deal mostly with the cool things, and who would not like the language that gives you that kind of pleasure?<p>And the languages that are used for this kind of stuff will suck somehow, because its hard to make things right on them, it requires a lot of discipline and you will have to deal with big codebases, in big teams.. so the things gets much harder to do right.<p>The guy that is chearing Rust today, is the guy that will complain 10 years from now, how Rust sucks, because he have to deal with it everyday in its big avionics codebase and any mistake can cost million of dollars or peoples lives.<p>Its psychology. We need the shiny new thing to give more meaning to our lives. It will never stop, but with time you learn to navigate over it a little better.<p>There is very little change in languages now, and once someone does a real paradigm shift, it will be impossible to ignore.')
