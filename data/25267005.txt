The problem is that Linux GUI and apps generally expect laptop&#x2F;desktop-ish levels of hardware capabilities because that&#x27;s what they were developed on&#x2F;for.  You&#x27;re literally running the same code base that the x86 versions run, just recompiled for ARM.  Most mobile SoCs, especially the ones that are Linux-friendly in terms of being open enough to be viable, are not even remotely that.  On iOS and Android, widely used apps such as browsers are <i>extensively</i> optimized for mobile.<p>On the Pinephone, and all other ARM-based Linux devices, we&#x27;re still running applications like web browsers that were written expecting to run on multi-core I&#x2F;O monsters with lots of RAM, beefier GPUs etc. (the main exception being the main GUI shell... it would be so much worse if you had to boot the phone into a full Gnome&#x2F;KDE environment)  We&#x27;re still in the late stages of getting the pile of software that is a typical Linux distro running <i>at all</i> on a mobile device.  Then assuming these devices get enough traction, you&#x27;ll start to see more effort put into mobile-optimized software.')
