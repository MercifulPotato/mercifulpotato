Most of the devices I have killed by travel: dust infiltration, vibrated the BGA chips off the boards by motorbike vibrations..<p>My requirements have all been fulfilled with the Huawei MateBook X Pro.<p>You could say it&#x27;s heavily inspired by the MacBook. Aluminum case. Chiclet keyboard with decent travel. 2000x3000 display (2:3 ratio!). Awesome trackpad. Good battery life. Portable. Solid. 2x USB-C and 1x USB-A. Sustained multiple drops.<p>For context, I am able to pull solid 12-hour days on the device, without a mouse, without fatigue or frustration.<p>Cheaper than a MacBook. Might be worth a look.')
