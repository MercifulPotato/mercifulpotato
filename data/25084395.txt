Also, IIHS testing in the US further pushes up the structural standards for mainstream models due to testing at even higher speeds and with harder tests, even though it isn&#x27;t a regulatory requirement.<p>The original US NCAP tests from 1979 were performed at higher speeds than Euro NCAP today. (which is the standard most other NCAPs borrow their tests from)<p>Euro NCAP does place some higher standards for pedestrian safety and active safety features, though.  I don&#x27;t think C-NCAP recognizes these, though.')
