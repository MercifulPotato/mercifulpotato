I rarely try to force these rules to my code whether I am writing new code or changing existing code. Sometimes breaking these rules will make it better, and sometimes enforcing the rule will make it easier to read.<p>My process is to write the code, take my hands off the keyboard and just read it. Take a break and come back and read it again. Then upload a code review request but before you “publish” it for review read it in the browser again and makes changes as you see fit. This applies to design patterns as well. To me it is always circumstantial and should not feel forced. Sometimes the inherent nature of the logic requires me to keep all the conditionals together in a tight method with good documentation to make it easier to read it a year later. Sometimes it just “feels” cleaner to split it out. It always depends.')
