I tried to compare it to the fact that you can&#x27;t find fault in &#x27;how your neighbor came to decide on his vote&#x27;, but the federal election is a two level system and they do have to follow the minimal procedure that, as the suit alleges, the legislative and not the executive has sole power in making the rules. Are you disenfranchised if your neighbor doesn&#x27;t follow this law? It&#x27;s not a sensible comparison anymore.')
