I have seen in some buildings at NASA Goddard a few runs of old 10Base5 cable with vampire taps still in place. I should grab one as a souvenir of the old days. I&#x27;ve also found various adaptors and old switches that could bridge a 10Base5 to 10Base2 network.<p>The 15-pin connectors at the ends of the MAU cables were designed to be used vertically, with a latching mechanism to hold it in place. Many Unix workstations mounted the socket horizontally on the motherboard and in that orientation the latch didn&#x27;t really work. This created all sorts of reliability problems.')
