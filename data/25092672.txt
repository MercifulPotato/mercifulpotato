Asym crypto is slow. Symmetric is fast.<p>The fact this key is leaked means it is quite likely a new version of the program will be pushed with a different key, but for any data still using this version of Widevine, this is the key piece of information to unraveling the entire cryptosystem by masquerading as an intended stream endpoint. You&#x27;d have to trawl the source for any other relevant goodies like parameters and algo names, but all of those tend to be unprotected in the clear, with only the key material being subject to overt secrecy.<p>Again, haven&#x27;t trawled the code myself, but that would be the gist of it if I have any intuition whatsoever on applied cryptosystems for media streaming.')
