Some people take a very cursory look at Debian and assume the packaging is an exercise in masochism that we inflict on ourselves.<p>And yet the number of DDs keeps increasing (and Debian is one of most successful projects).<p>Indeed it takes time to do packaging, and this is by design. Packagers are expected to thoroughly review the code they are packaging and smooth out various sharp corners.<p>Many times I&#x27;ve found bugs in the upstream code while packaging. Sometimes around security and privacy, often around documentation, usability or non-x86 architectures.<p>Every time I check if other distributions opened bugs or applied patches for the same issues. It almost never happens.<p>This is why I might spend 2 hours on a package instead of 10 minutes.')
