From where I sit, it never stood for RIAA members the commercial works they profit from.  Recall the Time magazine &quot;Man of the Year&quot; cover many years ago circa the debut of YouTube.  It was, IIRC, supposed to be mirror.  The &quot;you&quot; that was named &quot;Man of the Year&quot; was not meant to be a RIAA member corporation.  It was meant to be an ordinary, non-commercial internet user.  The entertainment industry has &quot;taken over&quot; what I thought was a resource for non-commercial internet users to share video.  Here we are seeing the resulting effects of acquiescing to that &quot;takeover&quot;.  I would guess most content on YouTube is in fact non-commercial, true to the website&#x27;s original purpose, which arguably makes youtube-dl useful for non-commercial purposes.  However, it seems that is not what Microsoft thinks.  The (passive-aggreesive) &quot;corporatisation&quot; of the internet (via the web).  Lame.')
