Without knowing what they controlled for, it&#x27;s hard to accept this one as evidence.<p>You are misunderstanding GP&#x27;s point.  The data shows that the less time people spend in <i>pretrial</i> detention (not jail&#x2F;prison after conviction), the less likely they are to re-offend.<p>And in many cases, folks arrested for really violent crimes aren&#x27;t offered bail at all.<p>If someone is arrested for a non-violent offense (petit theft for example) and bail is set at $1,000 and they can&#x27;t get their hands on $1,000 (because they&#x27;re poor which is why they&#x27;re stealing, maybe?) they will rot in jail until the case is adjudicated.<p>But a wealthy person arrested for beating his wife <i>to death</i> who can afford $50,000 bail can walk out the door and murder his girlfriend while awaiting trial.<p>Bail just punishes the poor.')
