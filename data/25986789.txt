If the central bank is flooding the market with money then you want people to make less money off of stock gains and more from actual income. Capital gains can be driven by irrational investors like squeezed short sellers. Short sellers promised to buy even if the current price is stupid.<p>High capital gains taxes would discourage this type of trading. Long term investments can still make lots of money from dividends.')
