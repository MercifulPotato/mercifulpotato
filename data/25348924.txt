Even if you&#x27;re not I don&#x27;t think those little nudges are that effective.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve been working lying down for 20 years, almost all day, almost every day. I only have back problems when I use beds that are not very firm.<p>I&#x27;m over 6 feet tall and weigh about 120 kg and I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s. I run 10kms (without stopping except for quick drinks) regularly, in 1:20. I can do bench press, shoulder press, lateral pull down, seated row and seated dip machines with the weight set to my bodyweight (about 4 sets of 8 reps each machine, ramping the weight).<p>I actually don&#x27;t do a lot of exercise on the scale of things, and I can regain the above abilities within a month or so if I become totally inactive for a long period. I&#x27;m actually a fairly large person which helps with the weights but makes the running pretty rigorous.<p>Like most things, if you work your body regularly you will be fine. How you don&#x27;t use your body when you&#x27;re not exercising doesn&#x27;t affect that.')
