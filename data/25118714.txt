Nor would I agree that &quot;mathematicians compute &#x2F;all sorts&#x2F; of uncomputable systems, with no apparent restriction.&quot;<p>It is hard to describe the behavior of real-world mathematicians since that is the realm of psychology rather than logic or mathematics, but if we stick to the realm of idealized proofs, it&#x27;s clear that we are only ever computing over computable descriptions of uncomputable systems (which is totally fine and something we do all the time!).<p>For example, the first-order theory of the real numbers (real closed fields) is a classic example of a complete and decidable theory. Every first-order statement in that theory can be proved or disproved in an automated fashion.<p>Yet how can this situation persist for the real numbers, entities which we clearly know are non-computable? Well the theory of real closed fields is capable of only describing a subset of the properties of the real numbers. It is worth emphasizing that this is a subset! Those properties in the theory of real closed fields apply perfectly fine to the real numbers. They just don&#x27;t capture all its properties.<p>So what about the other properties of the real numbers that, for example, make up the field of analysis? Well we can prove those in a larger theory, e.g. ZFC. And again the proofs in ZFC are computable objects, although ZFC itself is no longer decidable. So again the description of the real numbers is a computable thing, even if now we don&#x27;t know how to computably enumerate all of its consequences (but again we know how to enumerate subsets of them!).<p>Now does ZFC completely describe the reals? This depends on whether you&#x27;re a mathematical Platonist or not. Do you believe in the notion of the one, true set of real numbers that exist on a Platonic plane independently of our axioms about them? That is there are no &quot;independent&quot; theorems, only theorems for which we haven&#x27;t found the best way of grasping their Platonic truth? Then no ZFC does not completely describe the reals either as a result of Godel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem.<p>Alternatively do you believe that the real numbers are an artificial mathematical construction which can have different properties depending on which axioms you are willing to admit? Then there will be properties of the real numbers which are independent of ZFC as a result of Godel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems.')
