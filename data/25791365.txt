Most don&#x27;t talk about their religion at work. But some can get annoying.<p>This one guy would use weird jesus love us language during outage. It drove every focused on troubleshooting mad. Another guy decided he will convert me to Christianity. Loved long discussions with him. I might have turned a bit atheist though. But he started it. Atheism is also a religion in my view.<p>Another person I worked with turned out be extremely religious and racist on twitter. He was nicest guy at work. But once I saw his Twitter, I just felt repulsed by him especially racism. He quit eventually to start his own bible startup.<p>These are just extreme examples, most religious people never mentioned religion until I became their friends on facebook and saw they were Jesus lovers')
