Wife is from Cornwall - 6 hour drive away. We met at uni, 2 hours for her, 4 for me.<p>Then my parents moved to Greece, we moved to London for career and bounced around the south east.<p>Eventually though we settled in Cheshire, and the parents followed - one is a 10 minute walk away, the other is 20 minute drive.
