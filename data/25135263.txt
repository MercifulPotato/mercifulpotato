Look at the UK. Excess death once of the worst in Europe but not actually bad at all, lower than 1999&#x2F;2000 in fact. Hospitals were ghost towns during these periods, cleared out with operations cancelled and people told to avoid attending to make way for a wave of COVID patients that never came. Same story is repeated all over the world, hence viral videos of dancing medics on TikTok. The hospitals were quiet, there was no bloodbath. See past the groupthink and mass hysteria: the stats don&#x27;t show anything except a normal year made worse by lockdowns.')
