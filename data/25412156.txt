Let&#x27;s say it asked you if it has four legs (no), does it have wings (yes), and then it guesses that you are thinking of a hummingbird.<p>That&#x27;s wrong, because you were thinking of a penguin. It would then ask you what yes&#x2F;no question it could have asked to tell a penguin from a hummingbird, and you could tell it to ask &quot;Does it fly?&quot; and the answer is &quot;no&quot; for a penguin.<p>It would add that question to its decision tree, so if anyone else thought of a penguin it would get it.<p>For much of my stuff at work, I use an unfiled filing system. I started this one day when I was asked to write some one time report to solve some mystery.<p>I spent a half hour with the line &quot;mkdir &quot; typed into my terminal window unable to think of a good name for the directory to do this task in. Finally I gave up on naming the thing, and did &quot;mkdir unfiled&quot;. Then in unfiled I did &quot;mkdir 1&quot;, and &quot;vi directory.txt&quot;. In &quot;directory.txt&quot; I added something like this:<p>&quot;1  Report for Alice and Bob to identify source of unexpected load on main website&quot;<p>and then went into the &quot;1&quot; directory and wrote the code to gather the data and analyze it and produce that report.<p>I intended to figure out a real name for the thing later and rename&#x2F;move it.<p>I never got around to figuring out a real name, and unfiled&#x2F;1 is still there. Along with unfiled&#x2F;2, unfiled&#x2F;3, ..., unfiled&#x2F;314.<p>This has actually worked out well for me. Suppose I run into some kind of issue with UTF-8 handling in MySQL. I remember I&#x27;ve dealt with that before, and grep in directory.txt for terms like mysql and utf. That turns up that the work for those earlier problems is in unfiled&#x2F;258, and so that&#x27;s where I go to find the programs I wrote for investigating that kind of issue.<p>Not everything goes in unfiled, of course. A good rule of thumb is that if it is something my replacement would need to takeover if I got hit by a bus, it should not be in unfiled. It should be in a well named repo on my department&#x27;s git server.')
