It should be pointed out that, other than lawyer costs, divorce tends to be zero sum. So if it is financially devastating for one party, it tends to be a financial windfall for the other. Divorces <i>can</i> be equitable, or they can be lopsided, but donâ€™t net destroy much value unless the parties are spiteful and deliberately destroy their own value.')
