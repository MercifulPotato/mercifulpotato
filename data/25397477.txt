The content was primarily the product of ATMOS studios in Australia. It started out as a plugin for EV Override, but Ambrosia bought the rights and helped turn it into the 3rd iteration of the game.<p>The original EV was great to explore in, but fairly linear (two main threads to the storyline, I believe), but Nova was massive with so many routes through, I doubt anyone ever saw it all!')
