Though, I suppose if one was dedicated enough to contribute every month, it would be... (and of course, motivate that dedication) But let me repeat to be clear: this is great for a paid product.<p>You&#x27;re way ahead of me, but let me share this anyway: if you are <i>kind of</i> open-source, and step too far away, it can generate a pure open-source rival. Or looked at another way: being sufficiently open-source is a barrier-to-entry (denies oxygen) to a fully open-source rival (&quot;why would anyonw use it, when there is already your mature project?&quot;) Though &quot;product-shaped&quot; probably the greater help here.<p>A subscription model for a non-hosted desktop app twists my mind a little, but I think it makes a lot of business sense, both for you and for customers (two examples: it&#x27;s an expense, not an asset; monthly (or yearly) is more affordable than an outright purchase).<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s great to be able to devote yourself to open-source, without being taken advantage of.')
