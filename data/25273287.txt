Hostnames were invented by a woman named Peggy Karp who had this radical idea that online systems should have names instead of numbers. None of her colleagues thought of that. So she invented the HOSTS.TXT technology. She wrote the RFCs. It was the standard naming system on the Internet for more than a decade. We continue to use her work on every single computer and phone to this date. Yet she got written out of history. Not even the Wikipedia article for the Domain Name System mentions her, despite the fact she was its creator. That was likely due to rhetoric like what we see in this paper, where the guys who invented the servers for automating DNS chose to focus too heavily on the shortcomings of Peggy&#x27;s system in order to gain support for evolving it.')
