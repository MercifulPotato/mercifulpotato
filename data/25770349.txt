My hypothesis on why salaries have gone up so high here is if you want to hire folks away from successful companies, that success means their stock grant is likely worth loads more than it was when they signed on, which you now have to match to compete.<p>If hypothetically every engineer at Apple hired in 2017 got $100k&#x2F;yr (say $70k cash and $30k RSUs) but because the stock has 4x’d in that time, now they’re making $200k ($70k cash, $130k RSUs). To hire them away now you have to offer $200k as a starting package. And that’s for every single Apple employee with significant stock comp. There’s a critical mass of successful companies, so for google to hire from Airbnb, they have to pay that skyrocketing-comp premium. Airbnb has to do the same to hire from Uber. Uber has to do the same to hire from Facebook, and so on.<p>Stock based comp in an on-average-growing competitive environment means market comp goes up too.')
