Specifically, any DPA (irrespective of whether or not they are the lead DPA) is given competency to deal with any complaint lodged against it, or deal with any breaches of the GDPR, if the case relates only to an establishment in its Member State (even if that establishment is not the &#x27;main establishment&#x27; of the controller or processor) or substantially affects data subjects in that Member State7. In such cases, the local DPA is required to inform the lead DPA without delay and the lead DPA will have three weeks to decide whether or not the case should be dealt with via the co-operation procedure (discussed below)8.<p>Taken from: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dataguidance.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;eu-one-stop-shop-under-gdpr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dataguidance.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;eu-one-stop-shop-under-...</a><p>It could be that Ireland did not react within the one-stop-shop allowed time frame, freeing France to start the procedure.')
