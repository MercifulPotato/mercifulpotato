Since it’s US-based, it has more sources in the US and covers more domestic stories, but I don’t think it’s accurate to say it’s a mouthpiece of the US government. NYT has a somewhat adversarial relationship with the government, and regularly publishes highly damaging stories the government would rather suppress.<p>There’s an important distinction between an independent media outlet with a US perspective, and US government propaganda. The former holds some principles that the nation will better prosper if corruption in the government is exposed. The latter just wants to increase the standing of the nation, and&#x2F;or keep the present leaders in power.')
