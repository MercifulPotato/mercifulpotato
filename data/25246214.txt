Item(by='javajosh', descendants=None, kids=[25248479], score=None, time=1606668264, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25246024, text='I think I understand sentence 2, but the meaning of 1 and 3 elude me!<p>But I disagree with your last sentence, at least as a generalization. There are legitimately talented, accomplished, capable, and <i>arrogant</i> people all over the place! In fact I&#x27;d say a slight majority of talented people are arrogant (say, 60%). That said, there are pretenders who are arrogant without talent, and they &quot;poison the well&quot; for the 60%.<p>I think this is especially a problem in software, because the field is still &quot;pre-paradigmatic science&quot; (in the Kuhn sense) which means, in part, that there is no great way to measure relative developer capability. The best you can do is examine their history of &quot;finishing hard things&quot; or &quot;solving synthetically hard problems.&quot; How fast and well do you learn? What is your <i>intuition</i> about design, about code? Do you actually care about the structure of software enough to have opinions about it?<p>The biggest problem we face is that the really good developers answer yes to the last question, but then are faced with the dilemma of being forced to <i>dwell in an inferior technology space</i> in order to make a living. Presumably a strong paradigm would reduce this error mode!<p>If you had ideas around defining that paradigm for software applications, somewhere between the too-abstract Turing machine&#x2F;Lambda Calculus and the too-concrete &quot;everything is just a string of bits&quot; mental models, would that make you narcissistic? Or just too ignorant to realize that &quot;the best paradigm&quot; is too subjective to define, or illusory, or already discovered (and ignored)?<p>Was Lavoisier, and the other scientists that converted the practice of alchemy into the practice of chemistry narcissists because they competed with each other for recognition and fame?')
