Safari and Chrome are both noticeably better than Firefox on OSX.<p>I&#x27;m a Firefox fanboy, still use it on OSX because it&#x27;s important to me, but the amount of random pauses, crashes, etc is just painful on OSX. It&#x27;s like none of the Firefox developers use it on OSX or something.<p>And before someone says &quot;oh it&#x27;s your extensions&quot;, that IMO leads to two talking points<p>1. It&#x27;s 2020 and major extensions still cause memory leaks in Firefox. Debugging them isn&#x27;t easy at all. Almost all of the resources say something like &quot;Run in safe mode and see if it fixes things&quot; and then lots of posts of &quot;post your about:memory here and I&#x27;ll analyze it.&quot; I&#x27;m a software engineer by trade and it&#x27;s been difficult for me to diagnose...<p>2. Nah because I don&#x27;t run any extensions on my OSX firefox install')
