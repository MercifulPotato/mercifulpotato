They don&#x27;t have a point of reference they could use to guide them to a better lifestyle<p>They only know the right-now and that&#x27;s good enough for them.<p>This is something I&#x27;ve seen with my friends and family who have never been in good shape. They don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s possible to go up 3 flights of stairs 2-3 steps at a time at a brisk pace and NOT be panting with exhaustion afterwards. They don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s not normal to fart 24&#x2F;7 and have constant heartburn, because that&#x27;s all they&#x27;ve ever known.')
