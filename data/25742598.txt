Lawful objections were raised, lawful debate was held, and a lawful vote was taken.<p>You originally asserted\n&gt;&gt; &quot;The real threat to democracy is allowing leaders to stop following the democratic process. For example, on 02021-01-06, 147 congresspeople voted to throw out the votes from an entire state, even after their party had pursued the appropriate legal remedies [ <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;legislink&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;stat&#x2F;24&#x2F;STATUTE-24-Pg373.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;legislink&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;stat&#x2F;24&#x2F;ST...</a> ]. Next time, they may succeed in throwing out votes. At that point, USA will be an oligarchy. This is the real threat to democracy.&quot;<p>Like it or not, the Senators and Representatives followed the lawful process. It was not exhausted until the objections were defeated. Asserting there was something &quot;undemocratic&quot; about the objections or the potential of throwing the out the electoral votes is irrelevant, it is not unconstitutional or illegal.<p>The objective of the process is to end up with someone holding the office of President. If it is true, however, that the election was fraudulent, and that fraud involved disenfranchising the democratic vote for the slate of electors, that would be a threat to democracy, especially if Congress refused to acknowledge it. The courts want no part of it because it&#x27;s the responsibility of the State Legislatures and Congress.')
