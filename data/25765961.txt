Most Wikipedia articles about a specific website link to the site.<p>Google does index content from 8kun. It just doesn&#x27;t list it under that shortened name. If you search for 8kun.top the link to the site shows up as top result, and you can use site:8kun.top in your search terms to search content from the site.<p>They do this to a lot of sites. For example a search for xxx-gay-boys does not turn up xxx-gay-boys.com, at least in the first 10 pages of results. Furthermore, I&#x27;d say that xxx-gay-boys.com has a lot more reason to be annoyed by this than 8kun, because those 10 pages are full of sites that are direct competitors of xxx-gay-boys.com. Even searching for xxx-gay-boys.com does not find it, and site:xxx-gay-boys.com does not work.<p>It&#x27;s not some blanket ban against linking to porn sites, either, because trying one of those that showed up in the xxx-gay-boys results, boy18tube.com, a search for boy18tube does show the site as the first results, and site:boy18tube.com searches the site.')
