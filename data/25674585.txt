Item(by='herbstein', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610042169, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25674287, text='&gt; I&#x27;m pretty sure people in Germany though they were stopping the fascists by supporting the Nazis.<p>You&#x27;d be pretty wrong. At best they thought Hitler would soften greatly after he rose to power, at worst they agreed with everything he said and did.<p>In &#x27;33 German non-Jewish shops started putting up &quot;German Free&quot; stickers. Einstein fled the country in that same year. His photo was widely published in newspapers with &quot;not yet hanged&quot; as the sub-heading. His friend, Theodor Lassing, was shot and killed, an act that was celebrated in Germany.<p>Hitler had been imprisoned for his actions before his rise to power, and was a largely known entity before the Germans &quot;turned to him&quot;. There wasn&#x27;t a lot of confusion about what he thought, who he hated, or what he wanted to do with them. Mein Kampf was released in 2 parts across 1925 and 1926.<p>An <i>actual</i> criticism about the time just before Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, is that every other powerful party took him for a joke. They didn&#x27;t expect him to be a viable rival. So instead, the Communist party (one of the major parties at the time) spend their squabbling with the Socialdemocrats instead of focusing their attention on the &quot;real enemy&quot;.<p>If you&#x27;re <i>actually</i> interested in this topic, you should read the book &quot;They thought they were Free&quot;. It chronicles how normal people fell to support the fascists - the Nazi party.')
