Mortgage comps in the early 90s.  Printing was the slowest part of the process.  I installed a print spooler and was 3x more productive than peers and boss.<p>I was fired for “installing unsanctioned software”.  Yet a friend’s brother was a muckity there and heard what happened and wanted to hire me full time - this was a summer part time job.  I said nope.  Had fun being the right hand for a chemical engineer at one of the local refineries and learned a lot more.')
