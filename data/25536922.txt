But why do root certificates have to expire at all? Relying on the system to be updatable and requiring constant maintenance doesn&#x27;t feel very sustainable, and generally causes all kinds of problems. Modern Android versions treating user-installed root CAs as second-class don&#x27;t exactly instill confidence either.')
