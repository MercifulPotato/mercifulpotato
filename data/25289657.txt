HDMI 2.0 devices have been on the market since like 2016 already.<p>I don&#x27;t know why all OEMs gimp the Ryzen variants like this. It&#x27;s either they have slower USB&#x2F;HDMI, or worse screens, or outdated wireless or less RAM&#x2F;storage than the Intel version of the same device.<p>One theory I heard, is Intel requires OEMs to sell a certain percentage of their chips on premium machines if they want to stay on their <i>nice partners list</i> and get their chips at good prices, so OEMs, in order to stay in Intel&#x27;s good graces, just gimp the Ryzen ones to force your hand to buy Intel if you want no compromises, other than an outdated CPU.<p>My aging laptop is in dire need of replacement and I would also want to replace it with a Ryzen one but the very few ones that have no major compromises have been sold out for months and show no signs of being restocked(in the EU at least) whereas Intel&#x27;s outdated 9th and 10th gen based laptops are in stock everywhere but I wouldn&#x27;t touch tose with a 10ft(3,048m) pole.')
