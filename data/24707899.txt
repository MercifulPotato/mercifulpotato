In english, the Pomelo is &quot;Citrus maxima&quot;, one of the &quot;ancestral&quot; citrus varieties, which is very large with a very thick rind.<p>The grapefruit is (believed to be) a hybrid of the pomelo and the regular (sweet) orange, which is itself a hybrid of some sort (a much removed descendant of pomelo and mandarin).')
