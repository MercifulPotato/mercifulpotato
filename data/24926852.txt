I would hope we can recognize that some things just can&#x27;t be done in public, while other &quot;offenses&quot; are more subjective and their validity can depend on the relationship of the individuals involved as well as how the supposed target&#x2F;victim took it. For example, whether it&#x27;s OK to hug someone in public depends on things like whether it was your life partner or a stranger, and whether the recipient was OK with it.')
