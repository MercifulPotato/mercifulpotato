Days went by and they still hadn&#x27;t activated my account.<p>Growing frustrated, I convinced the seller to accept Bitcoin, which was comparatively instant.  The phone arrived a few days later, meanwhile the Transferwise morons still had their heads up their arses with no movement and no good explanation.  I&#x27;m not a financial risk; I&#x27;m a good little citizen with no red flags.  Reading between the lines my sense was their staff were overloaded or their onboarding system was simply broken.<p>Bitcoin was incredibly helpful for me that day, and my favorite feature about the phone is the way I paid.  In addition to a great story, I&#x27;ve got to admit there was something liberating and empowering about giving what felt like a big middle finger to the slow, decrepit, old-fashioned institution who couldn&#x27;t even deliver on their core business proposition.  Like saying &quot;screw you, I don&#x27;t need you and your crappy service anymore, come back when you can compete on merits&quot;.<p>Whatever else you criticize about Bitcoin, it&#x27;s still &quot;cash you can email&quot;, and even if that&#x27;s all it ever amounts to I still find it a bloody useful innovation.')
