In many ways:<p>1) it’s pretty important to have easy syntax for math with overflow checks. Otherwise there will be bugs. Bad bugs. We have those and it sucks.<p>2) it’s pretty important that if the overflow wraps in ISA then it wraps in language semantics but C just says “meh whatever” for signed overflow. That leads to even more bugs.')
