So hopefully people won’t be evicted and not have to worry about bills right now.<p>But I wonder if an instacart app for food bank delivery would be a good idea.  Kind of like meals on wheels.  Dunno.. it would beat queuing in cars for miles.<p>Maybe there’s a way to do crowd funded UBI... it could start around grocery stores maybe with grocery store gift cards..<p>Food deserts are a big thing though. It makes me think that there should be way to instacart deliver food to people.')
