At least that way I could be an a more familiar environment.<p>Interesting how things get reinvented every so often:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ORVYL_and_WYLBUR" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ORVYL_and_WYLBUR</a><p>&gt; The names ORVYL and WYLBUR are often used interchangeably, but:<p>&gt; ORVYL is a timesharing monitor that supports a file system, command language, program execution and debugging, and provides supervisor services.[1]<p>&gt; WYLBUR is a text editor, word processor,[a] job submission and retrieval, and e-mail program designed to work in conjunction with ORVYL or with IBM&#x27;s OS&#x2F;360, SVS, and MVS operating systems.[2] and<p>&gt; MILTEN is terminal control software used by both ORVYL and WYLBUR for start&#x2F;stop terminals.[1]<p>&gt; WYLBUR is not a full standalone operating system in the mold of Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS) or Unix. Instead it runs on top of an IBM batch operating system (OS&#x2F;360, SVS, MVS). It takes the form of an editor with a Remote Job Entry system and thus has much the same relationship to the IBM operating systems as Emacs does to Unix. For these reasons WYLBUR is often thought of as a text editor rather than a time-sharing system. However, whereas Unix does not need Emacs to provide text editing services, IBM&#x27;s operating systems originally needed WYLBUR. Later innovations such as IBM&#x27;s Time Sharing Option (TSO) made WYLBUR less relevant for IBM users and gradually replaced it.<p>[snip]<p>&gt; ORVYL and WYLBUR first became available in 1967â€“68, before TSS&#x2F;360, TSO, or any other official time-sharing solution from IBM. This was roughly the same time that third-party time-sharing systems such as MTS became available and the under the radar development effort of CP-67 at IBM&#x27;s own Cambridge Scientific Center took place. WYLBUR had the additional advantage that it could be used in conjunction with IBM&#x27;s mainstream operating system, OS&#x2F;360.<p>&quot;Text editor as a primary user interface&quot; is a design idea which pops up every so often. People pushing modern Emacs into being their widow manager (exwm) is a new reinvention.')
