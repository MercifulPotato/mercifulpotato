Item(by='rleigh', descendants=None, kids=[24777145, 24779662], score=None, time=1602681764, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24774889, text='Netflix has done similar stuff with Ascension, The Witcher, Altered Carbon and others.<p>I do prefer quality over quantity, and more episodes per season isn&#x27;t IMO a good thing.  Having tight focus, telling a complete story from beginning to end, is more important than adding a lot of unnecessary filler.<p>I wasn&#x27;t the biggest fan of Altered Carbon, but thought Ascension was exemplary.  While it finished with an ending that could have set it up for a second series, the story it told was complete, and leaving some mystery is no bad thing.  I&#x27;m currently reading the Witcher books, and the series was a reasonable adaption of the content of the first two books of short stories.  There&#x27;s plenty more material for the future, but what was done in eight episodes was decent and self-contained.  Way better value than a movie ticket.<p>What I like about these short series is that they are free to take risks and make niche stuff that doesn&#x27;t cater to the lowest common denominator.  There&#x27;s plenty of stuff on Netflix that doesn&#x27;t appeal to me, and that&#x27;s OK.  There&#x27;s also stuff that would appeal were it not poorly-written and produced dross.  I would really prefer their &quot;data driven&quot; decision making to bear in mind the lasting appeal of these productions within their niche interest, rather than only using the initial response as an indicator of long-term success.  Some of the best productions took years to develop a good following, and yet were successful beyond expectations.')
