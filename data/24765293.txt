Item(by='burntsushi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602595277, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24765172, text='&gt; Sadly I cannot say the same about Rust<p>I know. It&#x27;s hard to miss. :P My point was to reflect your claim of the suitability of C++.<p>Rust is still young. Much younger in some domains than others. GUI is obviously one of them, and I suspect it will be quite a while before it ever catches up, if at all. If that were my requirement to use Rust, then I&#x27;d forget about it and check back in five years.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where you are on the innovation curve[1], but I&#x27;d say Rust and GUI are all the way to the left right now. (I don&#x27;t think Rust itself is, but GUI in Rust is.) There are bindings to existing toolkits, but as you say, they&#x27;re hard to use. So I think some innovation is required and people are working on it.<p>My guess is that you&#x27;re somewhere in the &quot;late majority&quot; group on that curve. Partially because you seem to require support by the platform itself (not just platform support by the language) and also due to requiring a mature solution to a deeply complex problem (GUI). Those things tend to take a really long time to happen, if at all, unless they are built and created by the platform itself.<p>Your desire for binary libraries isn&#x27;t as out of reach though I think. It&#x27;s just a hard problem to solve and there just honestly isn&#x27;t a ton of motivation to do it as far as I can tell. It might require a well funded player to help move that along. (Not just in the work required to do it, but in the resources required to provide it I think.)<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ou.edu&#x2F;deptcomm&#x2F;dodjcc&#x2F;groups&#x2F;99A2&#x2F;theories.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ou.edu&#x2F;deptcomm&#x2F;dodjcc&#x2F;groups&#x2F;99A2&#x2F;theories.htm</a>')
