If a CEO makes 200 times more than the average employee, the surcharge increases to 0.2%, and so on per multiple of 100.</i><p>What do they mean by &quot;earns,&quot; are bonuses included? Nonmonetary compensation like having your car or mortgage paid for directly? Increase in stock value that&#x27;s part of your comp package?<p>I&#x27;m sure folks will try to game this to get around it, I&#x27;m just curious how.<p>Also it sounds like this is a surcharge on <i>taxes paid</i>, not actually a new tax on revenue. So if you pay $1 million to the city of San Francisco in taxes, and your CEO earns exactly 100x more than the average worker, you now have to pay... $1,001,000?')
