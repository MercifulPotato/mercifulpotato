What norms people expect to apply in the fora they use, most prominently Facebook.<p>So they haven&#x27;t updated their laws to match the current society&#x27;s norms, and the result is that Facebook has to write rules for something approximating all of society. That cannot be simple for Facebook, and I think it&#x27;s a bit cowardly of the two big parties that neither of them have really tried to bring the law into harmony with current perception of justice and acceptability.')
