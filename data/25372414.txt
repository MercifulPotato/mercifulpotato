A heavier ship might be able to run more at minimum throttle so if one flames out there might(?) still time to throttle up one of survivors that is already lit, from three near mimimum to two near maximum or some combination.  These things are moving literally tonnnes of fuel per second so even throttle-up inertia might lag too much unless they can predict failure really early.<p>One engine didn&#x27;t have the grunt required(?) but SN8 might have been doomed due to fuel supplying both lit engines.  Ho hum.<p>This was as much a test of the Raptor engines as it was the bellyflop and landing manoeuvre, perhaps more so.  They&#x27;ve got data from literally hundreds of Merlin engines regarding failure modes etc.  A long way to go with Raptor and many more explosions to be livestreamed!')
