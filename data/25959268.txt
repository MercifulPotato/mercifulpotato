A doctor can&#x27;t really just hazard a guess without actual facts to base them in or risk losing their ability to practice and&#x2F;or reputation. &quot;Right kind of people&quot; can be and are often plenty wrong about things but it fades into obscurity and they are never held accountable.<p>Of course they are right sometimes but on many issues with a binary choice (should or shouldn&#x27;t wear masks) that&#x27;s a 50% chance.<p>In the long run you want to be able to discern hearsay, opinion, and rumors from facts and accountability to them.<p>You see it today when inquiring if a pregnant woman should get the vaccine. Doctors won&#x27;t really advise you because although they maybe feel it&#x27;s totally safe if you&#x27;re far enough along, they would be held accountable if something happened. They can be &quot;pretty sure&quot; about things, but that isn&#x27;t enough. Meanwhile, &quot;very smart person&quot; on Twitter can reference a bunch of content from unaccountable people that says it&#x27;s safe and come off as an expert when they aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s easy to be &quot;right&quot; when you don&#x27;t have skin in the game and especially so when no one is going to hold you to account for all the times you were wrong or misinformed.')
