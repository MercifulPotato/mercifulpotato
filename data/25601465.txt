Here is the snippet about my other comment (p.25)<p>&gt; Every process, event, happening -call\nit what you will; in a word, everything that is\ngoing on in Nature means an increase of the\nentropy of the part of the world where it is going\non. Thus a living organism continually increases\nits entropy -or, as you may say, produces\npositive entropy -and thus tends to approach the\ndangerous state of maximum entropy, which\nis of death. It can only keep aloof from it, i.e.\nalive, by continually drawing from its\nenvironment negative entropy -which is\nsomething very positive as we shall immediately\nsee. What an organism feeds upon is negative\nentropy. Or, to put it less paradoxically, the\nessential thing in metabolism is that the\norganism succeeds in freeing itself from all the\nentropy it cannot help producing while alive.')
