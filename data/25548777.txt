But it is not beyond God&#x27;s power to bring some good out of it. I don&#x27;t see how we can read the Gospels and come up with any other answer. Nor do the lives of Christ&#x27;s saints lead us to any other conclusion.<p>If we do not always understand why God allows certain events in our lives — why He permits the evils we do or endure — the saint&#x27;s witness assures us: the same mercy that restores life, that can reunite mother and son, may also permit death as the prelude to restoration.<p>— Fr.
