Item(by='defen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610483809, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25752682, text='No, because &quot;moderate conservative&quot; is not a stable political position, at least as far as social issues go. It really consists of people who are comfortable with things how they are and who oppose liberal attempts to remove unprincipled exceptions to liberalism. Liberals have a vision of what they are fighting <i>for</i>, conservatives only have something they are fighting <i>against</i>. The one exception to this which has had some political success is abortion, because it has been successfully framed as fighting <i>for</i> the rights of the unborn.<p>Consider the &quot;moderate conservative&quot; opinion 100 years ago on women having the vote; compared to today&#x27;s moderate conservative. Or on segregation 60 years ago. Or on gay marriage 20 years ago. Or on transgender issues today vs what will be considered &quot;moderate conservative&quot; 20 years from now.<p>The only cohesion they <i>do</i> have is on economic issues, but people are finally starting to realize that it&#x27;s been a grift all along, perpetuated by big business and conservative establishment elites. &quot;We&#x27;ll pander to you on social issues (and then fold like a house of cards) in exchange for moving your job overseas, importing workers to reduce labor costs, and lowering taxes on the rich&quot;<p>So given this loss of trust in the conservative establishment, people find themselves rootless and end up finding a community in this sort of nuttery (whether it be Q-Anon or ethnostate fantasies). Barring a return to throne-and-altar conservatism (which seems unlikely) I don&#x27;t see it getting better any time soon.')
