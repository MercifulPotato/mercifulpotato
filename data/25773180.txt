A few months ago I started pondering whether the community would benefit from a job board which specializes in Scala. Long story short, I believe the idea has potential so I decided to go for it. You can check it out at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ScalaJobs.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ScalaJobs.dev</a>.<p>I would love to hear feedback and suggestions on how to improve the website.<p>Personally I was thinking to add:<p>- More filtering and search options. Like for example, tags for libraries, frameworks and adjacent technologies.<p>- A section linking to resources to improve Scala skills. I.e. Scalazone, fp-tower, RockTheJVM etc.<p>- A section for recruitment agencies. In my opinion ScalaJobs.dev&#x27;s value is somewhat complementary to that of recruitment agencies. I think it would be useful to help people discover agencies specializing in Scala jobs.<p>- A blog section. Suggestions for the types of articles are welcome.<p>Feel free to leave a comment or to reach out to me directly with feedback and suggestions!')
