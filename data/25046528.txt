A search for optimum while criticizing everything else seems like it&#x27;s letting the perfect get in the way of the good.<p>&gt; secular slaughtering processes, as they do not seek ritual values, should be more free to converge to the most humane solution.<p>Ok, but is there any reason it would converge to a humane solution at all? How strong is the market pressure in that direction? Jewish people are willing to pay a price premium to get a specific type of slaughter. Are secular people willing to pay a similarly-large price premium to get humane slaughter?')
