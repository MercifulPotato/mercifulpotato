You can have too much market freedom and too much government intervention. Moderation is key. It&#x27;s also important to regulate the right things. A lot of economies are failing to grow because of government oppression or corruption. A lot of economies get into undesirable situations because they are too liberalized.<p>The balance is usually tilted slightly towards free markets because many governments are often incompetent but the free market doesn&#x27;t tolerate incompetence or inefficiencies. In many cases it is so hyper efficient that smaller players have such a hard time that monopolies form and globalization brought this to a new height where we have entire countries like China specialize in manufacturing to the point where USA&#x2F;Europe can&#x27;t compete and seek out other opportunities.')
