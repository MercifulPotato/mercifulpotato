Like a spam filter for PRs.<p>Something like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;marketplace&#x2F;issue-label-bot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;marketplace&#x2F;issue-label-bot</a>\nbut assigning an &quot;invalid&quot; label and closing the PR.<p>Maintainers might want to enable this only during October. It would be a cool reaction from the community, given that there is not much else we can do.<p>The best place where to find training examples that I can think of is @shitoberfest on Twitter (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;shitoberfest" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;shitoberfest</a>), but most of them are just screenshots, not actual links :(')
