Integrated malware protection is a good thing, <i>but</i> it needs to work to be useful (e.g. not automatically flag properly code-signed non-malware as malware). If users see the SmartScreen popup for regular software too often, they are just trained to automatically find and click the &quot;Run anyway&quot; button.')
