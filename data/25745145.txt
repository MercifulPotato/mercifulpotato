Velocity of money is a mostly useless metric in our current highly unequal society. High currency supply and low velocity means high fragility... That money is just waiting in people&#x27;s pockets to be released back into the market. The more money there is sitting around in everyone&#x27;s pockets, the more prices are going to fall when that money finally comes out of their pockets (and panic means it tends to be all at once)... We have a tiny number of massive pockets. The entire financial order ends up depending on the reliability of a handful of high net worth individuals to play along with the current scheme. It&#x27;s no surprise then that governments ends up wanting to control and limit how these high net worth individuals spend or invest their money.<p>If you get an unlimited amount of something without having to work for it, of course it becomes worthless to you.<p>What&#x27;s happening in the economy today is like what would happen if we played a game of monopoly and one player ended up with all the money and the bank started loaning people new money to keep everyone playing... So the richest player would just keep getting more money because the dynamics of the game cannot change... In the meantime, fairness is thrown out the window - Money loses all correlation with value creation. Then there is a point when one of the players grabs the board and flips it over.')
