That way all my domains are managed under one account irrespective of where they were purchased. They offer every DNS setting you would ever need (unlike some registrars) and their propagation is always super fast. Their API is top notch. The best thing is it&#x27;s a free service, and the only service of theirs I use. No need for their cloud services. Just amazing DNS.')
