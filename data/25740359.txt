There is a lot of emotion running here so I watched the hearings on youtube to get my eyeballs on it without reading through a newspaper.<p>&gt; 60+ courts heard the &quot;evidence&quot;\nThey didn&#x27;t see the evidence. Seriously look at it. There are a lot of articles saying various things about it being thrown out, but it didn&#x27;t get to court proper in any of the cases.<p>&gt; the actual court cases were not about what Trump and co were claiming in the news.\nAgree. They aren&#x27;t going to try and claim fraud because that would take forever, they wouldn&#x27;t have a chance to get the outcome they wanted that way. That they keep screaming fraud can be seen as a separate allegation that isn&#x27;t being put to courts(because it would take too long)<p>&gt; You must be confused;\nWhat a nice way to talk to someone. This doesn&#x27;t help with civil discourse, please don&#x27;t let your emotions get the better of you, democracy could be at stake.<p>&gt; Reuters ran this poll ...\nReuters ran many polls, here&#x27;s one where 45% thought the election was not legitimate and accurate.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-election-poll&#x2F;half-of-republicans-say-biden-won-because-of-a-rigged-election-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN27Y1AJ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-election-poll&#x2F;half-of...</a><p>&gt; They have been, they will be inspected even more, and they will find the same results.\nThey were not.\nGA did not check the signatures, the video was not investigated, the eyewitness testimony of a trucker with a trailer full of ballots going missing was not investigated, and the observers to the recounts were kept too far away from seeing anything in every case in the swing states, what alone is suspicious, but few people are actually watching the eyewitness testimony because the press isn&#x27;t reporting it.<p>&gt; Now, instead of pushing all the &quot;we don&#x27;t know!&quot; narratives, spend your effort educating people that we do know, and this is the process by which we can, and do, check the details.\nI have checked the details, please check my claims yourself, there were hearings in all the swing states and hours of eyewitness testimony.<p>The risk is high and it is a shame that it has to be Trump that this might be happening to, because it would be the perfect crime, because everyone is biased against him.<p>I can see where the Trump plebs might end up, if you think that your elections are rigged then you don&#x27;t have taxation without representation, with no legal recourse this would be ground for revolution. Remember one persons terrorist is another persons freedom fighter.<p>This is dangerous, and for any healing to happen I think that all Trumps evidence needs to be brought forward and investigated.')
