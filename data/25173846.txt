I&#x27;m fairly confident most people think climate change is concerning, but not &quot;on the brink of destruction&quot;<p>&quot;American capitalism&quot; is also responsible for the greatest reduction of poverty globally in all of human history.<p>&gt; Nothing else pales in comparison to the destruction that&#x27;s coming as a direct result of USA turning a blind eye to climate change.<p>Interesting, because the United States has actually been lowering carbon dioxide emissions, and total output absolutely pales in comparison to China which has seen nearly exponential growth [0].<p>This may be completely wrong, but it seems like a majority of climate change talk always revolves around how the US can be doing more, and rarely about what other countries can do.<p>Interesting how America is always to blame for the world&#x27;s problems. I&#x27;m not saying America has been perfect, but it certainly does more good than bad.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_carbon_...</a>')
