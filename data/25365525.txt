How did down ballot republicans outperform Trump everywhere, when Trump&#x27;s approval ratings among republicans were incredibly high?<p>The bellweather counties perplexes me.<p>The crazy turnout in specific counties that far exceeded demographically similar counties that wouldn&#x27;t have the impact to flip the election. The fact that Trump out performed himself with all demographics except white men, he had historic republican support from black and hispanic voters, except in specific key counties.<p>The fact that all of these counties all flipped the next morning was perplexing, especially since many of the flips came from ballot dumps that had statistically impossible ratios of votes for Biden. Or the massive number of ballots that were showing up for Biden, but had no downballot choices filled out at all.<p>Couple all of this with the thousands of witnesses that swore on strange activity during counting, and the absolute lack of security around the Dominion machines. I&#x27;m surprised HN hasn&#x27;t been all over the Dominion machines, the HN of several years ago would have had several posts decrying the security of those machines.<p>There are reasons to doubt things. The doubt needs to be addressed with transparency and in court, and so far, all of the municipalities that are raising suspicion are fighting tooth and nail against transparency.<p>If the concerns are met with censorship and dismissal without real rebuttal, I don&#x27;t see an optimistic future for this country.')
