I know that this stuff seems like a good idea when it’s theoretical and it doesn’t happen near you but when it’s <i>your</i> neighbor doing heroin and the police won’t do anything about it, you start to wish that drug use wasn’t so normalized.<p>I used to live in Salem. Used to be extremely crime-free with very few homeless. Now, they line the streets of downtown and no one goes there anymore. If we’re leaving drug users on the street too now, the only consequence of this policy will be more white flight. Shame, too, because Salem used to be a hidden gem of the Pacific NW.')
