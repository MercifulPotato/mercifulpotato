As a brown immigrant Muslim looking person, not only do I feel safer in the US than I would in China, I feel safer here than in France.</i><p>Do muslim looking persons in muslim countries feel equally well protected from America?<p>&gt;<i>Americans arenâ€™t frothing at the mouth to ban Islamic religious clothing while schoolgirls in France have to remove their headscarves.</i><p>That sounds like more progressive. Do women&#x27;s rights in the West stop when it comes to muslim women -- where we &quot;allow&quot; them to wear headscarves lest they get beaten up by their fathers&#x2F;spouses?')
