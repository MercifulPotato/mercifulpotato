Donâ€™t tell your mother. This reminds me of a couple things one being the monkeys that eat coffee beans then poop them out to be gathered and used by humans and my dad also tells me a story about a seed people were desperate to try and grow. Everything they tried failed and the seeds would not germinate. Then one day the researchers was in a foreign part of the world and saw a painting that had a Dodo bird under the same tree eating the seeds. Something sparked a thought in the persons head and they decided to take the seeds and feed it to their turkey. Apparently after the turkey at the seeds and pooped them out they would germinate. This also reminds me of how forest trees need fires to release their seeds it seems like nature required an animal to eat these seeds and travel with them before pooping them out into some ready made soil ready to start the plant. Good luck with your grape')
