Definitely unwise in any case.<p>It is only legal in a handful of states, usually those with insane quantities of feral pigs.<p>In a lot of the US, it would be illegal.  However in Arkansas where the person in question was, it was legal on private property.<p>In nearby Alabama or Louisiana you need a permit, likewise in California.  So in those states it would have been illegal.  In Arkansas, Texas, or Oklahoma, there&#x27;s no permit.<p>In Texas, it&#x27;s legal on public property even.  Texas has a feral pig population nearing 2m, which causes almost (supposedly) half a billion dollars in damage annually.  Or $50m.  Or a billion.  It depends on the study.')
