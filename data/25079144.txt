I think there is solid legal DMCA ground for them to remain hosted in the US, without even needing to reach for the whole &quot;freedom of speech&quot; thing.<p>I won&#x27;t even get into how I think GitHub is being overly courteous to media companies by extending takedown ability for alleged Section 1201 violations. I&#x27;m firmly convinced the only remedy the DMCA offers for that is via the courts, and that the takedown process explicitly requires the identification of <i>infringing material</i>, not circumvention tools.')
