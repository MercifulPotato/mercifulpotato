In many ways it&#x27;s just an implementation detail, but I don&#x27;t know if the MDN people are planning anything of the like (but MDN is for  tech people, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem there).<p>The big upshot is that all the hard problems like merges and history&#x2F;diffs and whatnot are solved for you by the VCS. I don&#x27;t think MediaWiki allows you to &quot;blame&quot; anything for example; something I&#x27;ve often wished for. It&#x27;s just a whole class of problems you don&#x27;t have to think about.')
