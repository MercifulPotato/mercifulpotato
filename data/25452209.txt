My biggest problem with buying them has been how absurdly bad the hardware has been for years other than the trackpad.   The screensize&#x2F;weight ratio, the screensize&#x2F;body size ratio, the keyboards, and the performance were all well behind the competition.  MacOS only running natively on bad hardware was a great reason not to use it, the fact they charged a $500+ premium on their software was really just another nail in the coffin.  You had to need or fucking love MacOS to justify buying a mac.<p>How things change in a year or two.  Pretty much only the weight&#x2F;size relative to the screen size remains substandard and I expect them to improve on those fronts.')
