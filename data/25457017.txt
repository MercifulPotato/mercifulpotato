They&#x27;re designed to be pretty free flowing to begin with, since they&#x27;re intended to be on the input side of the furnace blower.  It would also keep the fan itself a bit cleaner.  Suction is almost sufficient by itself to keep the filter in place.<p>FWIW, Alton Brown made a jerky dryer using a similar technique, and he used bungee cords to hold the filters to the box fan.  That&#x27;s probably less hassle than duct tape.')
