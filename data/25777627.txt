(Charge HR replaced once or twice, Blaze replaced once, and Charge 3 replaced once.)<p>I suspect I&#x27;m still a profitable customer, but I suspect they&#x27;ll become a lot stingier eventually.<p>My main concern with switching to a different brand is that I&#x27;m worried that they&#x27;re be more breakable and less readily replaced. (Also, I&#x27;m on Android, so there are too many options and I can&#x27;t decide.)')
