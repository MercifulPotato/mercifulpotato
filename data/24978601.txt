You don&#x27;t want that.<p>Think about the difference between big company $BIG selling you the consumer a million Widgets for 10^9 currency units, versus 26 small companies $a..$z each selling to the next in a long supply chain which results in a million Widgets.<p>In revenue taxation, big company $BIG pays 10^9∗$TAX_RATE.<p>Whereas the 26 small companies pay something more like 26∗10^9∗$TAX_RATE because each time a company pays the next company, that&#x27;s revenue for the next company.<p>The difference in tax between those two scenarios is so enormous, that it would create enormous pressure for companies $a..$z to consolidate into a single company.<p>Repeat this across the entire economy, and you have enormous pressure to consolidate everything into as few companies as possible.')
