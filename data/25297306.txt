I remember back in (good lord) 2011 when the MRI research was shown [1]<p>I&#x27;m very excited about the new m1. While I&#x27;m tempted to buy it, I also can&#x27;t wait to see what they do with it in their pro models. Or what the second generation looks like.<p>The competition is great for everyone, and Apple going all in on arm as they run from Intel&#x27;s manufacturing failures is very well-timed.<p>I think this was somewhat inevitable, to be sure. Microsoft had Qualcomm and AMD processors in their surface [2], and I think as TSMC continues to dominate in manufacturing, we will see really exciting gains.<p>Also, I&#x27;m thrilled that CPUs are coming with tensor cores now. I think fast matrix operations might be separated from gpus (at the least, you no longer need a &gt;$400 gpu for it), and that&#x27;s a win for everyone, too.<p>In two years, we could be able to reimplement early neural network research on a macbook air! (I mean, you already can, but instead of taking minutes&#x2F;hours&#x2F;days, even more recent things become accessible)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engadget.com&#x2F;2011-05-17-bbc-loving-apple-looks-like-a-religion-to-an-mri-scan.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engadget.com&#x2F;2011-05-17-bbc-loving-apple-looks-l...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;2&#x2F;20888999&#x2F;microsoft-surface-pro-x-laptop-3-custom-processor-qualcomm-amd-specs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;2&#x2F;20888999&#x2F;microsoft-surfac...</a>')
