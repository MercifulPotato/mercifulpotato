Technically domain names are not necessary to successfully send own mail with own server, i.e., without using a 3rd party email provider.  E-mail predates DNS; mail software has always supported IP addresses.  However, today, the dominant 3rd party e-mail providers will reject mail coming from an IP address not associated with a domain name.')
