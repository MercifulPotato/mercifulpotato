I personally lost 120 lbs (and counting) while drinking lots of sweet-n-low and aspartame-sweetened soda.<p>Anecdata isn’t data but I’d argue a study of 30 participants barely counts as useful data either.<p>Maybe the artificial sweeteners mess with glucose metabolism, maybe not. Maybe these things are more variable person-to-person than expected.<p>If you’re trying to lose weight, and you’re having problems with diet soda, maybe make a change. But if you’re drinking diet soda and artificial sweeteners, and also finding success, don’t let random low-sample-size studies scare you off.')
