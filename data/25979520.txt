A lot of extremely popular Java libraries make extensive use of runtime reflection and none of the AOT compilers handle it well without a lot of extremely error prone manual configuration.<p>I actually like Java and the JVM but if AOT compilation and efficient memory usage is what you want Java is definitely not the language to use.')
