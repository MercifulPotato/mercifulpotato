Sure, if I was a top technical contributor I&#x27;d leave in a second, but I&#x27;m not.  I need to be close to HQ for now until I receive a <i>strong</i> signal from management indicating otherwise.<p>I did recently evaluate moving to our Redmond office so that I can better care for my aging mother in my old hometown.  Then I saw that houses nearby are even more expensive than the bay area.  Nuts.  Finding a rental house that can accomodate my mom and family in the south bay will not be easy though.<p>Slightly unrelated, I&#x27;m excited to see if satellite internet will open up even more remote areas of the country to remote developers.  It would be nice to setup a coding cabin in the backwoods somewhere far from the city, where I can go part-time to escape the din.')
