Modern combat aircraft are giant electrical power systems with an aircraft wrapped around them. When the A-10 was designed half a century ago, this was not a requirement and there is no way to retrofit it.<p>Modern air defense systems are explicitly engineered to very effectively kill things like the A-10, and it can&#x27;t support modern counter-measures because of these limitations. It still works in environments for which it was designed i.e. absent modern air defense systems.')
