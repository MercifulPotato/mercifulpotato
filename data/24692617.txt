The problem is that they often appear to work for this job, so they can make it all the way into code. Your own example strings illustrate that:<p><pre><code>   &gt; &quot;foobar&quot;.lstrip(&quot;foo&quot;)\n   &quot;bar&quot;\n</code></pre>\nOf course, if the developer making this mistake tested with &quot;foofbar&quot; instead then they would realise their mistake. A more typical example of this type of mistake would be url.lstrip(&quot;<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a>&quot;).')
