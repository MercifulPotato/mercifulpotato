Even without an uptick in authoritarianism, I would expect more journalists to be arrested in a year with lots of riots and protests against the police than in a calm year. Specifically, you have record numbers of journalists working in close proximity to police officers who (warranted or not) are working long hours with people shouting in their faces (let&#x27;s say, &quot;conditions for which they&#x27;re inadequately trained&quot;).<p>Maybe you&#x27;ll argue that it&#x27;s authoritarianism either way, and maybe you&#x27;re technically right, but a top-down directive to arrest journalists sounds a lot different (and scarier) than the situation I described above.')
