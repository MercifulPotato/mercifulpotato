You could --- and places like DDHQ did --- scrape the SOS sites to know almost exactly where the ballots were coming in. The central premise of this analysis is not just that the mail-in process was partisan-neutral, but that it had the effect of randomizing the returns statewide. Of course, it did nothing of the sort.<p>Again, what you really saw here was that the election day vote trended sharply more R, because R voters were encouraged not to use mail-in votes, while the entire D campaign apparatus was --- like it has been since Obama --- designed to get people to commit their votes early with mail-ins. The mail-ins took longer to count, because unlike in Florida, they couldn&#x27;t be counted early. So what you were watching as time went on was large tranches of mail-in ballots that took forever to count coming in from D-heavy areas (or from areas where Biden outperformed Clinton, and where the mail returns were, like everywhere, more D than the election day returns).')
