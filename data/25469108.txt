Item(by='jventura', descendants=None, kids=[25470584, 25469317, 25470052, 25469221], score=None, time=1608310950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25467900, text='While I praise the author&#x27;s effort, as a professor myself (I teach CS in a local polytechnic school - something like the US community colleges) I really doubt the quality of either the WGU and of the knowledge retention.<p>As an example, this semester I&#x27;m teaching Operating Systems concepts (definitions, processes, threads, semaphores, mutexes, signals, memory layouts, IO, etc.), and even if I take the theoretical concepts out (like not explaining how a fork() works under the hood), I still have 20 hours of labs and some 60 hours for two projects. How can this author ever reach the same level of competency as my students who let these concepts &quot;sink&quot;, as he dedicated 15 hours in only 2&#x2F;3 days.<p>Second example: in 2019 I taught some classes for a 4 month course on basic programming and web apps. Even having 7h of classes per day, things had to be really succinct, and in 4 months, although they were capable of doing some web apps, there was a lot of confusion in their heads because of the fast pace.<p>Some other examples on his post: 9h30 minutes for Discrete Math I. Either trivial things were handled, he is a math wiz, he rushed through all the exercises, or no exercise solving was necessary..<p>Again, I don&#x27;t want to undervalue the author&#x27;s effort, but as someone who as been teaching for quite some time, and has taught people from the 7th grade to MSc, I&#x27;m really suspicious of the quality of the degree and of the knowledge retention..')
