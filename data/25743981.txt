Label it &quot;security&quot; testing, some details on what endpoints&#x2F;methods where checked. Suggest a market value for this work, and say that an invoice with 50% rebate <i>can</i> be made out to cover it, if they wish.\nNeed to word it carefully to avoid it sounding like a threat or demand. Intention would be to highlight the work put in and the value for the company, and make it as easy as possible to compensate that.')
