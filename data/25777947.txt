We were seated in the theater when they announced that the show had been cancelled and we&#x27;d be getting refunds and free drinks.  We tried again a few months later (we lived in LA at the time so Vegas was easy to get to) and the same thing happened again.  We tried a third time and finally got lucky.  It was worth the wait.  What an amazing show!  We were actually planning to go see it again when Roy had his tragic accident and the show closed for good.  :-(<p>RIP S&amp;R.')
