One of them is recirculation, and in some cases, humidifiers. But my understanding is that recirculation is controlled by the crew, and humidifiers are an option the airline may or may not take.<p>Unless an airplane has a condenser of some sort, and I don&#x27;t know any plane that does that, there is no magic. Moisture has to come from inside the plane, either though passengers breathing (that&#x27;s the idea with recirculation) and&#x2F;or heavy onboard water tanks (humidifier).')
