I&#x27;d be furious too :(<p>&gt; please don&#x27;t take that privilege for granted.<p>I will always take that for granted. It is literally my only &quot;god given&quot; right to move wherever I want and live there (provided I can sustain myself)[1]. The idea that a country has the right to restrict my movement based on an arbitrary border, by issuing a paper defining where I may travel and for how long (based on my skin color) is absurd and something worth going to war for both metaphorically and literally.<p>[1] technology plays a big part here in the crimes that countries commit against individuals (refugees and otherwise), and I&#x27;ve witnessed an gradual increase of restrictions, over the past 20 or so years especially in Western countries including my home country. Compared to 20 years ago we now already live in a dystopia of restriction, it just is distributed unevenly.')
