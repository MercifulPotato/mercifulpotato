Are you watching disk IO? Is there a noticeable delay when the node starts before it&#x27;s ready to receive requests?<p>Try setting &quot;-raft-snap&quot; to a lower number, maybe 1024, and see if it helps. You&#x27;ll have much fewer log entries to apply on startup. However the node will perform a snapshot more often, and writes are blocked during the snapshotting. It&#x27;s a trade-off.<p>It might be possible to always restart using some sort of snapshot, independent of Raft, but that would add significant complexity to rqlite. The fact the SQLite database is built from scratch on startup, from the data in Raft log, means rqlite is much more robust.')
