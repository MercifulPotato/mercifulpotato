I&#x27;m pretty convinced the one I cashed out of is going to get diluted a bit more than acqui-hired by one of the big investors (who is in the same field as the startup) as the growth just doesn&#x27;t look to have happened there.<p>I think given the overall situation I came out of it well, but it does go to show that even when you do hit the startup share lottery as we both have the actual cash outcome can vary by a significant factor, though we are both lucky to have made cash given the 99.9% of startups whose shares end up worthless.')
