As most of us here know full well, in modern application development, most of the time, there are MANY ways to accomplish particular &quot;thing&quot; that will WORK, but I want to find the most-efficient and most-maintainable way. So when I need to find an approach to something new, I&#x27;ll search and read many things about it, until I find consensus. I&#x27;ve approached news like programming, looking for consensus. The problem is that no one agrees on anything any more. There is no overlap between the two sides. Each side just says the other is completely wrong.<p>As the intelligentsia discuss what Greenwald&#x27;s move implies about the state of American journalism, and even what the facts are about Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop, people in the middle, like me, despair of ever getting to the truth in these matters any more. We are forced to simply forget about it, because we have no hope of reading enough materials, and spending enough time on it, to sort out what the most-probable conclusion is. Every article argues the complete opposite of the other. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE JOB OF THE JOURNALIST.')
