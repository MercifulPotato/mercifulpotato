Legitimate use of HTTP&#x2F;0.9 in consumer-facing web servers is exceptionally unlikely, but there are all sorts of scenarios which could have led HTTP&#x2F;0.9 responses to bleed into the data.<p>For instance, here is an untested hypothesis: ~30 of the hostnames on the list have abandoned DNS A records, pointing to EC2 servers. Those EC2 IPs have since been repurposed as honeypots of some kind. The honeypots present themselves as HTTP&#x2F;0.9, in order to look more like low-grade IoT devices.<p>That hypothesis is almost certainly wrong, but you could quickly invent another and at some point one of them will be correct. The internet is just a very messy place.')
