If the two computer models have identical chips, then why does Apple even bother putting a fan in the pro?<p>To me the fact that the Air is fanless and the pro has a fan would indicate to me that they have different clock rates on the high end. I am sure the Air is capped lower than the Pro in order to make sure it doesn&#x27;t overheat. It is probably a firmware lock, and the hardware is identical. But once we do benchmarks I would expect that the pro outperforms the air by a good margin. They added a fan in the pro so that it can reach higher speeds.<p>Surely the Air is capped so that users don&#x27;t ruin their computers by running a process that overheats the computer.<p>But of course Apple doesn&#x27;t want to reveal clock speeds. The best they can give us is &quot;5x faster than the best selling PC in its class&quot;. What does that mean? The $250 computer at Walmart that sells like hotcakes for elementary age kids that need a zoom computer or the Lenovo Thinkpad Pro that business buy by the pallet? Who the hell knows.')
