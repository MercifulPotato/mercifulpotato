Item(by='fakedang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605559975, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25112193, text='&gt; Collectors who loan out objects aren&#x27;t responsible for the day to day operations - such as &#x27;general preservation - of a museum, nor are they held to fund those operations. However, loan contracts do contain assurances and describe formal conditions trying to ensure the protection of the object during transit and on location.<p>I didn&#x27;t mean to say &quot;general preservation&quot; of the museum, but rather the general preservation of the artwork, depending on its type and age. Different art, different costs, all handled at the collector&#x27;s expense - museums don&#x27;t have to pay for that, but only for specialized display casings and security systems, which are a fraction of the cost of the piece.<p>The Met is actually one of the better run places that I often hold up to as a benchmark. Not to mention, it&#x27;s &quot;classy&quot; enough and was prudent enough to keep the young crowd in its sights. My qualms were against aged places, largely in Europe, who have to rely on government subsidy and if that isn&#x27;t available, use their funds to fundraise more, while many a time their curators are paid a 6 figure income.')
