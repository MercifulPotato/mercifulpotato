Either way, hiding assets is relatively easy if there are millions of dollars on the line. Also, moving to CO or UT is even easier than moving to Belgium from France.<p>Put another way, the more complicated the tax, the easier it is to find loopholes. It’s basically impossible to write a simple wealth tax. If you do, you end up capturing people who shouldn’t be captured (for example a founder with illiquid stock and purely paper wealth). I’m actually all for taxing income pretty heavily especially in a progressive manner. Better yet, tax consumption. I think a luxury consumption tax, especially one that penalizes things like expensive cars, jets, boats, and similar would be a more effective way to tax the rich.')
