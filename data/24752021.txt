But there we don&#x27;t just dive into the specifics of audio, but also back to an analogy that&#x27;s closer to software developers.<p>Bouncing a full track to stereo is a lot like compiling software into bytecode&#x2F;assembly. You get something usable and distributable to end users that you can reverse only partially. Part of that is intended. Just as with proprietary software, the exact combination of synthesizers, instruments, plugins and settings are closely guarded secrets of musicians, mixing and mastering studios.<p>And just like in software, some of those &quot;shaders&quot; aka plugins are actually proprietary themselves and can cost multiple hundred dollars each — so redistributing the &quot;source code&quot; can be not just difficult but actually illegal or impossible.<p>As you see, the incentives generally aren&#x27;t aligned towards this form of distribution.<p>Just like in software though, I think there&#x27;s a set of people interested in actually distributing their source tracks, made with open source software — and IIRC, that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s happening here as the base of these source separation efforts!')
