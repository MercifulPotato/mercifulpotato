The license is a fork of the AGPL and adds a clause that requires you to open source not only software, but supporting software that is used to run the service. One could argue that this license would result in more publicly available software, not less.<p>Here is the clause for reference:<p>&gt; If you make the functionality of the Program or a modified version available to third parties as a service, you must make the Service Source Code available via network download to everyone at no charge, under the terms of this License. Making the functionality of the Program or modified version available to third parties as a service includes, without limitation, enabling third parties to interact with the functionality of the Program or modified version remotely through a computer network, offering a service the value of which entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Program or modified version, or offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the Software or modified version.')
