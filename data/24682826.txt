Item(by='bArray', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601851129, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24680974, text='&gt; sexism being the only cause acceptable to society at large<p>That&#x27;s how I understood it.<p>&gt; If you suggest different reasons, you&#x27;d get in trouble if<p>&gt; you worked at Google for example.<p>Unfortunately, it seems so. And this is the same most places I&#x27;ve experienced. In academia for example, you couldn&#x27;t even pose the question in most places - there would be protests, your tenure would be under review, your funding would be cut - to name a few possibilities. If academics are nothing, they are overly cautious.<p>You have to ask yourself for example why the term &quot;intellectual dark web&quot; was coined [1]. They don&#x27;t refer to them as &#x27;wrong&#x27; or &#x27;conspiracy theorists&#x27;, they just pose different questions, and for that alone they were ostracized.<p>I refuse to live in a world where even posing the question is not possible. If Google won&#x27;t dare hire me, I&#x27;ll build my own theme park with blackjack and hookers [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Intellectual_Dark_Web" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Intellectual_Dark_Web</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowyourmeme.com&#x2F;memes&#x2F;im-going-to-build-my-own-theme-park-with-blackjack-and-hookers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowyourmeme.com&#x2F;memes&#x2F;im-going-to-build-my-own-them...</a>')
