I&#x27;ve had two different windows 10 machines constantly wake themselves up (one was at at 1am!) regular as clockwork because a scheduled task you couldn&#x27;t turn off had gone bonkers.<p>My laptop still has problems with a .NET &quot;optimization&quot; task you can&#x27;t remove that basically thrashes the disk constantly erroring for x86 assemblies I don&#x27;t even use. I ended up replacing the program with an empty one, but every year or two it restores the broken program.<p>I know it&#x27;s back when my fan starts trying to take off like an aeroplane. I tried figuring out which .NET assembly was causing the problem, but in the end it was easier to just replace the offending program.<p>The most annoying part of that process is that you can actually remove the task, but windows would then see it was missing within a few days and add it back.')
