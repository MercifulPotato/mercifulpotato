Sure, excellent. A unified body of regulatory agencies to coordinate development of standards? Yeah, ok. <i>A whole political-bureaucratic system that removes autonomy from participating countries and does not allow members to get into bilateral agreements outside of the block</i>? Hell no!<p>Were the EU something along the lines of NAFTA or Mercosur, I&#x27;d be 129% behind it. But this ever-growing monster that it has become, no way. To me the EU is becoming Germany&#x27;s revenge for losing two wars: they failed by military force, so now they are taking it over by economic domination.')
