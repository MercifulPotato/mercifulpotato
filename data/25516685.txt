Let alone United Launch Alliance. I think Rocket Lab will keep a very comfortable profitable niche for a long time though.<p>The Falcon 9 has really cornered the market for commercial payloads and it&#x27;s not profitable to compete. And the Starship will cement that place further. <i>Maybe</i> Amazon&#x27;s Project Kuiper and Jeff Bezos&#x27; investment in Blue Origin might make Blue Origin competitive in the long run, but given their current track record I doubt it will happen soon enough to make a difference.<p>I&#x27;m sure that they&#x27;ll be enough military payloads to keep the Ariane&#x2F;ULA&#x2F;CASC&#x2F;ISROs occupied for decades to come. But short of unprecedented industrial espionage, in the next 10 years they&#x27;ll all going to struggle to develop re-usable rockets that can keep pace with SpaceX.')
