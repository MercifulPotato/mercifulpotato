Most popular editors today support vim bindings. So this bulwark is gradually eroding.<p>The second is the automation. Any piece of your workflow can be captured and remapped to a couple keystrokes.<p>Some other editor might innovate a new feature that vanilla vim  doesn’t have (in fact this occurs regularly).<p>The (not unique in idea, but in implementation) power of vim is not any superficial feature, it’s the meta feature of extensibility, and how this is interwoven with the modal editor idea.<p>I think many people who come to vim and then leave it for another editor get the first idea, but never got used to the second idea, or never got around to integrating the two.')
