The author is basically just putting out a detailed study plan for passing an exam. If a doctor posted a plan for passing the medical boards would your first thought be &quot;Wow, look at that massive medical monoculture problem!&quot; That seems like a ridiculous stretch in my opinion.<p>To your second point, I hear this all the time in threads about tech interviewing: &quot;Tech interviews are biased and make no sense&quot; and also &quot;I&#x27;m too busy to have to do a lot of work for this interview.&quot; If you don&#x27;t want to put the time in to prepare, fine, don&#x27;t, and then see how you do. Again, in my mind it&#x27;s very similar to studying for the medical boards - in most cases doctors have many, many thousands of hours under their belt in training before still needing to study a ton to pass their boards.')
