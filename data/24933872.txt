If someone refuses to print this, due lack of evidence and lack of truth - that is not called a cover-up. There is no reason to dignify it with airtime in the first place.<p>After all one can publish this sort of stuff on blogs, internet forums, tabloids etc.  Curation is the true news product - sifting of truth from untruth is one way to do it.')
