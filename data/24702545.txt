Item(by='tristor', descendants=None, kids=[24704193], score=None, time=1602019947, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24702242, text='&gt; There is almost no way to stop them once they reach full size.<p>There is only one known way to stop a full-grown feral hog, and that&#x27;s with a (big) gun.  Unfortunately.  So until we have a better answer, our best bet is to kill them as rapidly as possible. Even with all the lore and furor around it in Texas, hog breeding is outgrowing active efforts to exterminate them and the population increases every year and is trending upwards.<p>They&#x27;re also very aggressive, so enjoy that if you encounter feral hogs.  I carry a large bore revolver with me when I go hiking and everyone assumes it&#x27;s for bears... it&#x27;s actually for feral hogs.')
