I&#x27;m not worried about users that have sufficient knowledge to intentionally modify a file. Users who know enough to find, much less modify an sqlite database can make their own mess if they want to. I&#x27;m more worried about cases where something like a sidecar file gets deleted or overwritten, or fails to be copied along with the main file. Some programs and file formats come up with their own way of embedding sidecar metadata in the main file, but that is a complete hack that has to be used to work around the fact that the sidecar file cannot be made inseparable from the main file while still being just another file. Alternate data streams on windows can sort of do this (xattrs on nixen aren&#x27;t really up to the task) but they are completely non-portable.')
