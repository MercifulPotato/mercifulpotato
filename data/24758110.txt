They have no place in mainstream media, so they are forced into some weird corner of FB. I have never personally encountered a Holocaust-denier opinion anywhere (including the internet), probably because I&#x27;ve never looked for one. I only know they exist because they are brought up as weirdos, like an evil version of a flat-earther.<p>That would be like saying some transcontinental ham radio morse code is drowning out your music on FM radio. It just doesn&#x27;t interfere; you have to have a crazy antenna to even get the signal.<p>Let&#x27;s not pretend that this somehow fits into the spirit of free speech. This is about making it hard for people to find these crazy messages <i>even if they are looking for them</i>.<p>You can debate that. Maybe some messages are too dangerous -- like DIY H-bombs or something. But arguing that is clearly in contradiction with the spirit of free speech.<p>(Note: I am not claiming that it&#x27;s illegal censorship. FB is a private company and can do what it wants.)')
