I believe they were also worded in a way to be technically correct (for example if they had multiple short positions, e.g. naked short calls, if they &quot;closed their short position&quot; that could mean they chose their smallest&#x2F;cheapest short position to close and it would be technically correct).<p>The data doesn&#x27;t back up the broader (and presumably intended) interpretation of their statements.<p>In my (inexpert) opinion THAT is the definition of market manipulation.')
