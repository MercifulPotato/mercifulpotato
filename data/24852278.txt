The result is paradigms that are near impossible to overturn no matter how much falsifying evidence there is or positive evidence for an alternative theory.<p>A good scientist questions and examines EVERYTHING, especially assumptions and basic principles.  If something doesn&#x27;t make sense, that should be a big flashing warning light, not something to memorize and regurgitate and repeat the party line.<p>Fundamental scientific advancements are slowing because we are building on some wrong foundations.<p>A few examples of areas we&#x27;ve gone wrong and need to consider alternatives:<p>* germ theory<p>* relativity<p>* cosmology (expansion, black holes, big bang, dark everything)<p>* plate tectonics&#x2F;fixed size earth<p>* cause of modern chronic diseases')
