It&#x27;s now, as I understand, more-or-less a Chromium clone.<p>If you like(d the old) Opera, 12.16 IIRC, though, I would suggest a more-or-less Chromium clone: Vivaldi. It feels like it has the same truly-a-user-agent feeling as Opera gave me so long ago. I believe it&#x27;s staffed by ex-Opera devs, too.<p>EDIT: Okay, I just realized you acknowledged it was a Chromium fork...I wish I knew how to read. My recommendation on Vivaldi still stands however.')
