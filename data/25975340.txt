I did a fair amount of meditation in the past so thought I&#x27;d give it a try, but keep it extremely sole just focus on my breath and being a witness without getting involved with anything going on around me. I do this for 15 mins around 16:00 (depending on what&#x27;s going on at work). For me it works, I feel refreshed, re-energized like after a nap, but with the advantage that I have no problem to fall asleep at night.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lz3yvJ08k0Q" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lz3yvJ08k0Q</a>')
