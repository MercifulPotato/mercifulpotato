COVID-19 fatality rate is around 6 â€“ 8 times worse than influenza, but that&#x27;s just a difference in degree. Personally I do wear a mask in circumstances where it actually makes a difference to slow down the COVID-19 pandemic, and encourage others to do likewise. But spare us the moralizing and appeals to emotion. That doesn&#x27;t help, it just divides people.')
