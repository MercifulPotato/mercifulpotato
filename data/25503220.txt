They censor channels that speak critically about their religion.<p>The problems with that are:<p>- agreement with any criticism in that religion is apostasy, so the moderator must 100% of the time delete the post&#x2F;video to protect themselves, let alone their religion.<p>- the contents of most religious texts contain what is considered today to be hate speech, so quoting, even exactly, from the text can get your entire channel banned.<p>- some religious texts are considered to be the perfect word of god, so pointing out logical inconsistencies is something  not publicly debated before (again, apostasy.) Those religions are incapable of processing these holes. In response they&#x27;re either compartmentalizing the cognitive dissonance (ie. brainwashing themselves and others) or scrubbing&#x2F;softening online versions. ie. moving away from the &quot;perfect word of god.&quot; You can see where this leads.')
