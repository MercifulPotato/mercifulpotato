Perhaps this is a sub-law of sorts.<p>There’s a similar one where fact checks will start out with one premise in the title, provide a completely different fact or two that they’ve “corrected”, and think they got away with people thinking they have “debunked” the original premise when really it was just a deflection. And often they work since many people just read the title and think if a fact check exists, it must be a true debunking.')
