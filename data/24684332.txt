You can&#x27;t possibly watch it for the racing, in a series where 90 minute races routinely end with over 25 seconds between each podium car. Where the fanbase fanatically opposes things like simplified powertrains, simplified aero and control parts, which would all result in far better, closer racing but would (in their minds) erode the prestige of the prototype series. Personally I think prestige comes from winning hard-fought races, not driving a Mercedes to yet another cruising victory.<p>It boggles my mind that people bother, when there are such incredibly close series like MotoGP, GT World Challenge [Europe|Asia|America], V8 Supercars, etc... The only explanation is that the fans simply don&#x27;t care about the racing itself.')
