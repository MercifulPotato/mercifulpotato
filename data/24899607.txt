I completely agree with Twitter keeping NY Post account disabled. Until they can prove to be a real news source, they are tabloid fake news. The fact they they will publish articles other news sites won’t means not that they are “The Rogue News Organization in a sea of Liberal Media”, but more “They post bullshit that’s intended to incite culture war, not report the news”.')
