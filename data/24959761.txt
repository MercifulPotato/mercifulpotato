Item(by='Broken_Hippo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604241832, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24954530, text='The &quot;dude that has no idea what he is talking about&quot; is me.<p>I&#x27;m American. I&#x27;m a white female, and I now live in Northern Europe.<p>The only time I&#x27;ve had guns drawn on me by cops is when I&#x27;ve been with someone with dark skin, and statistically, you are more likely to be shot by cops if you are black. There is definite differences.<p>I&#x27;ve had folks help me in the states, I&#x27;ve had fake help because I&#x27;m female, and been stopped for being out late. No one bats an eye here, and I*m in the largest city I&#x27;ve lived in. No one goes out of their way to help in the states for the most part, and people won&#x27;t vote to allow folks to even have a safety net nor healthcare.<p>In comparison, if I lose my hat at a bus stop, it&#x27;ll probably be there waiting for me the next day here. (had the experience). I fell on a bike and someone stopped to make sure I was OK. I don&#x27;t get harassed at bars by myself and I don&#x27;t get harassed walking home from a bar.<p>Last time I came through customs was coming home from Amsterdam, and the guy was nice to me while he searched my stuff. I didn&#x27;t feel the danger and apprehension that I get with American cops.<p>Sure, people are crazy here just like they are everywhere - which I&#x27;ve stated - but society as a whole is way nicer and more helpful and overall, fewer people treat me badly for being weird. (Am an immigrant, and everywhere has their buttheads, but most folks are nice).<p>Edit: I&#x27;ll add that folks here don&#x27;t randomly say hi on the street nor talk at bus stops. This isn&#x27;t folks being nice in the states, but talking at people. People don&#x27;t ask me &quot;how are you&quot; unless they are interested in an answer. Many parts of the US are full of superficial, fake niceties and this isn&#x27;t friendly. It is just fake, and I&#x27;m rude if I don&#x27;t want to take part.')
