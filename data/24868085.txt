Of course, there are bad apples everywhere, but with LSD if you’re reagant testing it to at least verify the presence of indoles (LSD or one of its many analogs), you can be pretty sure it’s not an NBOME substance, because there’s no good reason for a seller to put both LSD and NBOME in the same tab. Or you can just swallow it instead of taking it sublingually, apparently NBOMEs are not metabolized by the stomach.')
