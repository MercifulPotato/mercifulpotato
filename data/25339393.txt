Have a trustworthy organization that confirms bugs, but doesn’t require disclosure before payment.  Let researchers place a value on their own work via a “buy it now” option and let organizations negotiate to buy bugs affecting their products.<p>The only info shown publicly should be a severity rating.  If an exploit is fixed, published, or used before a company buys it, the 3rd party could publish proof of previous knowledge about the exploit.<p>There are a lot of good incentives in that system.  The trusted third party will want to do a high quality job of verifying and categorizing exploits because overselling them will deter companies from buying and companies would be increasing their liability when they fail to buy bugs.<p>For example, in this case, what’s the damage?  IMO you could do millions of dollars in damage.  In fact, if you went hog wild exfiltrating or destroying data, I bet the industry would value the damage over $1 billion dollars when you’re being prosecuted.<p>I wonder what kind of legal hurdles a company would face trying to set something like that up.  I think it makes a lot more sense than having companies working on the honor system because they’ve demonstrated they don’t play fair and bugs are severely undervalued.<p>This is a $1 million bug IMO.')
