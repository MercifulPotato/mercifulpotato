European aristocrats made bank off slave labor outside their state borders and still do to this day. If it weren&#x27;t for Marx&#x27;s letter writing campaign causing a large anti-slavery hubbub during the civil war, England&#x27;s ruling class was favoring recognizing the sovereignty of the confederacy. Slavery was wildly unpopular domestically (you can see &quot;woke&quot; products at the time labeled their products as made by paid labor), but the source of cheap cotton powering England&#x27;s massive mill industry was well understood and appreciated by people with significant capital.<p>I don&#x27;t really appreciate the insinuation that the parent commenters implications are unsupported by western historical discourse and are a product of chinese propaganda. You&#x27;re ignoring a vast swathe of western culture by doing so, notably the 19th century discussions about authority and oppression between the anarchists and, loosely, the socialists (who had not yet coalesced around Marx to the extent you see now). Meanwhile it&#x27;s not clear &quot;big government&quot; is even a meaningful term outside american partisan bickering.')
