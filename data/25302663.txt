And then people start calling it charisma and flock to it and we end up in the realm of populism and fad instead of getting shit done.<p>This is the world we live in now. Self-promotion and public relations are the controlling factors in most large decisions I see in my profession (higher education) that it&#x27;s just, well, sickening.<p>It seems like, across most fields, public relations and how we are perceived is far more important than the work actually getting done.<p>If you can wrap up a shit sandwich in a pretty bow and sell it, why worry about the quality of what you&#x27;re selling?<p>It&#x27;s depressing. Honestly, it drags me down on a daily basis to see people who plainly have no function except to be self-promoting and who can play the PR game get ahead consistently.<p>And the best part is, it&#x27;s an impotent rage. What is there even to do about this? I have no idea.')
