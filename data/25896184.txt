You can lock in a 30-year fixed rate mortgage with a predictable payment (effectively hedging against inflation), but there&#x27;s little to no recourse against landlords doubling your rent next year or refusing to renew your lease.<p>* Fully pedestrianized, live-work development is still a scattershot novelty, often requiring heroic efforts to get zoning and incentives set up, but the 1000-hectare, 900 houses and 4 golf courses, 700 km of roads that curley-Q and cul-de-sac, master-planned community, has been raised to an art form.<p>* Attempts to support public transit are not just forgotten, but aggressively fought, in part because buses&#x2F;light rail&#x2F;subways are considered services for undesirable groups.<p>* The whole urban-renter situation tends to be treated either as a &quot;well, it&#x27;s just poor&#x2F;minority&#x2F;etc.&quot; as a subconscious motivation to allow stagnation, or handwaved as a transient situation for the &quot;successful professionals&quot; -- they&#x27;ll eventually move out to a McMansion so it doesn&#x27;t matter that their experience is lousy for a few years while they save a down payment.<p>Unless the wealthy&#x2F;successful&#x2F;influential embrace this lifestyle, there will be limited momentum to improve it for anyone else.')
