Plus addressing is only useful so long as everybody plays nice. Back when I used gmail I noted several services that would either not accept an email with a plus or that would strip it out. A truly disposable email would not allow a simple regex replace to get your permanent address.<p>Catchall addressing is infinitely more useful to an end user, but comes with the caveat of requiring you to pay for a domain (and almost certainly hosting too) and setting it up. I&#x27;ve actually caught a security breach this way, seemingly before the service in question. Sadly said service concluded after a few weeks that there was not breach, so I just filter out that email now.')
