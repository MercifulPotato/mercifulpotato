It makes it impossible to pay for anything and I get scared whenever I see this stupid logo during payment.<p>Their site is an example of over-engineering designed to make seemingly simple things hard. Like for example, it always tries to detect OTP and fails most of the time. Then it obscures the Continue button and add an extra step.<p>But worse is their internet speed detection algo. Why in the world does a payment processor need to check my internet speed and show me a popup your internet connection is slow (happens mostly on 4G). Then it tries some refresh voodoo which makes the payment fail sometimes debiting the amount and failing (which takes 5 days to refund).<p>It&#x27;s mind boggling that Amazon is one of their customers. Is nobody doing user-experience testing?')
