Every time I need to encode (<i>encode!</i>) such a basic concept as &quot;it could be this or that&quot; using subclasses and some Design Pattern to Manage the Variants (usually Visitor, sometimes State), I metaphorically weep for my soul.<p>There are plenty of other minor gripes I have with the language -- there have been multiple instances where generic generics (HKTs, `class Foo&lt;F&lt;_&gt;&gt;`) would have made things much clearer -- but sum types are certainly the most prominent.')
