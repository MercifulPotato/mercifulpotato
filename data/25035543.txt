If we&#x27;re gonna do that, might as well just do pop vote.<p>You don&#x27;t hear the same argument against the senate as often because it&#x27;s practically impossible to get rid of it. But many people are still against it (myself included).<p>&gt;why shouldn&#x27;t they allocate all federal funds to themselves and deprive other states entirely?<p>That&#x27;s a funny argument, because red states currently receive a lot more federal funding than what they pay in taxes, and blue states pay more taxes than what they get back in return. Plus, blue states actually want to give red states <i>even more</i> money, when you consider that blue states support more federal funding for healthcare and other programs.<p>Everyone is always concerned with protecting the smaller, less dense states, but really it&#x27;s those states that have disproportionately more power. California contributes so much to red states, and what do they get in return? A bunch of senators and presidents who do nothing about climate change, thereby letting California burn even more. California is the one that needs more protection here, not the states whose farmers are getting six figure checks as bail-outs because the president they elected doesn&#x27;t understand how trade wars work.')
