In short, it&#x27;s solvable in theory. The game as it&#x27;s currently played has a finite game tree (thanks in part to the 50-move rule) and that finite game tree can in theory be brute-forced. In practice, I think it&#x27;s one of those problems that&#x27;s so large we can&#x27;t possibly solve it. For an idea of the scale of a complete solution, solutions for all positions with 2 kings and 4 other pieces occupy ~100GB and solutions for positions with 2 kings and 5 other pieces are ~10 TB and it&#x27;s believed that 2 kings + 6 will be in petabyte scale.')
