Several students have since joined the project he started, so obviously they&#x27;re now writing Julia too. That project&#x27;s experiences with the language were so good, it soon became obvious that for our use case, Julia was superior to any other language we&#x27;d used so far. So pretty much the whole research group has now shifted to Julia, and that&#x27;s what we teach new students. Slowly, other groups in our institute became interested, and more and more people are adopting it, which in turn means that their new students will also end up learning it in future.')
