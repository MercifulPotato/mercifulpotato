A lot of times stdlib code is restricted to use only backward compatible code with old API contracts, some parts are neat but others are unwieldy. It&#x27;s a hit or miss.<p>2. Library code is different to application code. You can&#x27;t get as much variety in style, abstractions, design patterns in stdlib as you can in a real world application.<p>I reckon it&#x27;s important to read to get a whiff of succinct Go code, very good at learning protocols (like OAuth, Http etc) if you&#x27;re interested, but won&#x27;t be hugely helpful in building a CRUD app.')
