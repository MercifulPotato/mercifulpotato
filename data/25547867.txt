That is, actually getting resources from the point of collection to the point of consumption.<p>In most RTSes, once you collect resources they essentially go into a magic resource counter in the cloud. You can collect wood on one side of the map, and instantly create a building with that on the other side of the map.<p>I would be <i>really</i> interested in playing an RTS that focused much less heavily on variety of combat, and much more heavily on variety of logistics.<p>Imagine a game where you had to shuttle food to your army to keep it fed, or physically bring stone to a construction site to build a castle, and you had to physically stockpile resources in vulnerable depots that would become targets of enemy raids.<p>You&#x27;d have to do a lot of design work to make the ergonomics of setting up the logistics infrastructure not incredibly tedious, but I think it could be done.<p>The closest RTS I have seen to this is probably the Warrior Kings series which was definitely ahead of its time in many ways.')
