I can build a basic web site in both golang and nodejs, from scratch, using a plain editor with no autocomplete.  It’s actually a very good feeling.  I can even do a react app from scratch if we aren’t counting webpack config.<p>My last proof of concept project at work, the server side was running behind so I spit out an extremely basic but totally functional node server and frontend in an afternoon without using any fancy frameworks and the Java dude was still trying to build the same thing three days after the demo was done.  It’s pretty useful to just be able to write it straight from your keyboard without having to go googling a bunch of stuff.<p>Why is everyone acting like it’s impossible or unreasonable?')
