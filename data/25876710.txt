Somehow Apple&#x27;s chips will get better, but competition will stand still?&quot;<p>Arguably this has been the case for the last ten years (comparing chips on iPhones to others).<p>I think x86 can&#x27;t compete, CISC can&#x27;t compete with RISC because of problems inherent to CISC (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;debugger.medium.com&#x2F;why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-3262b158cba2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;debugger.medium.com&#x2F;why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-32...</a>)<p>It won&#x27;t be for lack of trying - x86 will hold them back.<p>I suppose in theory they could recognize this e-risk, and throw themselves at coming up with a competitive RISC chip design while also somehow overcoming the integration disadvantages they face.<p>If they were smart enough to do this, they would have done it already.<p>I&#x27;d bet against them (and I am).')
