The latter two groups are 7 millions bigger than the first two groups. That&#x27;s what we know. \nLooking at the Senat&#x2F;House races, there seems to be a sizeable group of people voting Biden, and then pro Republican further down. I interpret that as &quot;against Trump, but also against the general goals of Democrats as perceived  by them&quot;. I believe this is because the Republicans managed to paint all Democrats as Bernie-like Socialists, while the Democrats did not manage to paint all Republicans as Trump like Idiots&#x2F;Racists&#x2F;Liars.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the Democrats should, but they should try harder not to be painted as Socialists, if they are not. Or be socialist. I don&#x27;t think the latter is a winning strategy in America, but at least they would lose for what they stand for, not for what they don&#x27;t stand for.')
