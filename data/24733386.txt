Looking at what is getting through and finding that a lot of it as easily identifiable as fraudulent is NOT a valid signal.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly likely that there are far more bots that are being blocked and that the bots that are getting through have invested a lot of effort in to fooling Reddit&#x27;s fraud protection, but really don&#x27;t care at all about fooling the landing page site (and of course, there are a lot more such sites, so it&#x27;s a lot more expensive to design &amp; operate a system that would fool all the other sites). Consequently, they&#x27;re &quot;easily identifiable&quot; (though in truth the author is unfortunately use a very crude model for identifying fraud which will include a ton of false positives) by the landing page, but not by Reddit.')
