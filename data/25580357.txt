More like a space station than like a hotel.<p>And that level of lockdown you&#x27;d need at some point anyways, because even adults well within working age require intensive care often enough when infected to overload any health system.<p>And yes, despite all this, if vaccines were decades out  (if you  expect to be unable to achieve China-grade suppression) instead of months a path like the one you advocate might be the least bad. But &quot;vaccines decades out&quot; a counterfactual.')
