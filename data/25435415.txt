There are still non-world online included with games with significant offline content that have no MTX (although some does have MTX too).<p>And there is still plenty of offline only games not infested with MTX, often with no paid DLC, or only sensible expansions that are very much optional purchases.<p>But online worlds that are not designed to continuously extract money from people seem to have become pretty infrequent, whether shipped with an offline game or not. And to be honest, I&#x27;m not surprised. Unlike matchmaking and the like, the online world type multiplayer tend to require a lot more server resources.<p>Without MTX or subscriptions, I bet a lot of online worlds would get shut down by 24 months after game release, simply due to exhausting the portion of the game sales allocated to running the servers by that point.')
