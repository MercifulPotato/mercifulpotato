The lower productivity of those workers becomes a drag on everyone else.<p>There are reasons why an employer may fire a worker. &quot;Refuses to work&quot; is one.<p>&gt; Second: this is the worst. Instead of shedding the dead weight it insists on protecting the people who&#x27;ve been paying dues the longest, at the expense of young people.<p>Maybe if people did not understand &quot;dead weight&quot; when they read &quot;older people&quot; employers could be trusted to decide who to keep and who to fire.<p>&gt; A just society is one where people doing more work get more pay.<p>That cannot be the only or even the main criterion else people who can&#x27;t work starve.')
