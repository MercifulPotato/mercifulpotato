It feels a lot more modern and pleasant to use than C without the rather large complexity of Rust. Of course, nothing comes free, so it&#x27;s also less safe than Rust.<p>I personally really enjoy Rust&#x27;s commitment to safety and I do find that the difficulty of writing Rust code that will pass the borrow checker and its stricter type system is well worth it but I know that some people find it frustrating and not very pragmatic. If you fall in this camp then Zig might well be worth a try.<p>Basically coming from C if you think that Rust goes too far, try Zig. If you think that Zig doesn&#x27;t go far enough, try Rust.')
