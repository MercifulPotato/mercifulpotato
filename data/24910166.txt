NextJS is great tool and focus on shopping and using that as a use case to improve your whole framework is fantastic.<p>I also love youth that I see in the team, I am a little bit older :).<p>Like others here, I am impressed with Svelte and trying to find how and where to use it. We live in great time where we are showered with amazing tools for development.<p>Having said that, for more traditional, ReactJS scenarios, NextJS is pretty much without competition (even though there is plenty). New features with localization and image optimization are fantastic and allow next level of mobile websites. If we are ever to break Apple&#x2F;Google monopoly on appstore, this is a way to do it. I think analytics package is solid addition and if you don&#x27;t want to pay, you don&#x27;t have to use it, it is for commercial projects.<p>Anyhow, I am really impressed with features they did and how it is integrated into their platform. Not huge fan of Vercel name still :) but it is great platform.')
