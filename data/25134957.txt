Over the past 100 years, global temperatures have risen about 1 degree C (1.8 degrees F), with sea level response to that warming totaling about 160 to 210 mm (with about half of that amount occurring since 1993)<p>Source:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sealevel.nasa.gov&#x2F;faq&#x2F;13&#x2F;how-long-have-sea-levels-been-rising-how-does-recent-sea-level-rise-compare-to-that-over-the-previous&#x2F;#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%20100%20years,about%206%20to%208%20inches" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sealevel.nasa.gov&#x2F;faq&#x2F;13&#x2F;how-long-have-sea-levels-be...</a>.<p>&gt; Bird population<p>In 2018, the all-species index in the UK, based on the aggregated population trends of 130 breeding species, was 11% below its 1970 value.<p>Source:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;system&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;attachment_data&#x2F;file&#x2F;877998&#x2F;UK_Wild_birds_1970-2018_final_accessv2.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;...</a><p>&gt;Is carbon dioxide bad?<p>From the IPCC 2014:\nHuman influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems.<p>Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have\nwarmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.<p>Source:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipcc.ch&#x2F;site&#x2F;assets&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipcc.ch&#x2F;site&#x2F;assets&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;SYR_AR5_FINA...</a><p>If you really want to learn I cannot recommend the IPCC&#x27;s reports enough, whether you &#x27;trust experts&#x27; or not, they lay out the problems we face as a species. The scientific consensus is that the Earth&#x27;s climate has warmed significantly since the late 1800s, caused in large part by human activity.')
