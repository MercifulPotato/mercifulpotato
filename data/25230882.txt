Item(by='scarygliders', descendants=None, kids=[25231220], score=None, time=1606499444, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25230797, text='&gt; “just because light is contained to only go that fast doesn’t mean matter has to be constrained to only go that fast.”<p>See, I&#x27;d try and frame it as &quot;just because Causality constrains light to only go that fast...&quot; and try to think what Causality is. And if Causality is a property of spacetime then how would I go about building a &quot;Causality Engine&quot; in order to alter spacetime in such a way that the speed of Causality can be broken ;)<p>My mind is warped - pun intended.')
