My argument is, are you sure the &quot;its only physics&quot; people are modeling the world in a correct, precise way and there aren&#x27;t other factors to be considered beyond what they propose.<p>The point I think the author is making isn&#x27;t &#x27;calorie counting is wrong&#x27; -- &#x27;calorie counting is not the whole picture&#x27;. When someone says software is just 1s and 0s, How hard can building software be? You&#x27;re right its 1s and 0s, but that&#x27;s not an entirely helpful model to work with if you&#x27;re trying to build software.<p>For example, you could say the number of people coming out of a building will equal the number of people that go into a building, its basic Maths - counting is the only thing you need. Now if the person uses this logic for a maternity hospital and they suddenly find out there are more people coming out than are going in. It doesn&#x27;t mean that math is broken.')
