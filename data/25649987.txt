That would be split between the federal government and the state of Alaska.<p>$900 million is a big number but when I opened this article I was wondering why any of the big name billionaires who are making climate change &#x27;pledges&#x27;, or basically thinking about Bezos here, wouldn&#x27;t just buy it up instead.<p>Then I got to this part in the next paragraph<p>&gt; The former governors Frank Murkowski and Bill Walker have encouraged the state to bid on any unwanted tracts itself, and last week a state-owned economic development corporation voted to authorize bidding up to $20m.<p>It looks like there is at least in Alaska some efforts to keep the lands away from oil companies.<p>Given that billionaires love to collect land even more than they like starting space companies, it&#x27;d be a huge philanthropic initiative to purchase it and have it turned into protected wildlife refuge.')
