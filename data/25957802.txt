It isn&#x27;t a graphical game, but that means nothing to complexity.  The number of objects and behaviors that the game engine must track, and track perfectly every clock tick, blows away most graphics engines.  There is no room for the trickery that graphics&#x2F;physics engines use to determine which objects need to be tracked.  Factorio must track everything always, whether it is on screen or not.  Each of those objects is also interactable.  The character builds and maintains bespoke systems layered atop each other ad infinitum.  The network of possible behaviors may be more akin to a giant excel document than a minecraft world, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less complex.<p>See also Prison Architect.  Cartoonish 2d graphics, reminiscent of SouthPark imho, but nevertheless a very complex game.  Even after a thousand hours with it, Prison Architect&#x27;s AI still surprises me every time I play.')
