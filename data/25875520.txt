Redux is a tiny library.  On a two year project, why not create your own custom state management system from scratch, one which makes the .NET people comfortable and has the features that match your project’s needs?  It boggles my mind that many devs consider state management libraries to be something sacred, like a compiler, which you would never consider reimplementing yourself on an enterprise project.')
