What made it click was that, at the end of the article, it&#x27;s explained that the doors are not opened by Monty at random. My previous reads about the problem did not disclose this, so I had made the assumption that the door opening was random. I&#x27;ve also never seen the show, for what it&#x27;s worth.')
