Doctors skew even older. Teachers are about the same. Childcare workers are a little younger but skew non-white which brings their risk back up. If the <i>only</i> precaution taken was for people over 60 to not work with the public, the medical system would collapse for the general public.<p>These numbers partly reflect increasingly delayed retirement, although those careers are extreme cases - 25% of americans <i>over 65</i> still work. I don&#x27;t believe it would be possible to meaningfully protect even just the group of over 65s, because it would require massive social spending and organization in a way that half the country would simply not accept. Aside from their participation in the paid workforce (presumably doing things that someone in the general population needs, at some point), many families would lose informal childcare. These protected old people would need access to doctors and nurses and hospitals, all filled with the infected younger people (or could we dedicate entire hospitals to them, staffed by elderly medical  professionals? Which ones?) They would need to live for free if not able to work, or have their income replaced. They would need to find a place to live somewhere besides the family home, if it was currently shared with younger family. Etc...basically I believe that an attempt to &quot;just protect the vulnerable groups&quot; would fail to protect those groups, and would cause similar chaos among the general population.<p>(Edit: these are all US numbers. I would be fascinated to see equivalents from other countries - I know that the frequency of intergenerational living varies greatly, for instance, as well as retirement ages)')
