This works fine under Windows and Mac.<p>* My monitor configuration wouldn&#x27;t be hardcoded in my xorg config file, or swapped around manually with xrandr. I&#x27;d have a way to code up config options for whatever is plugged in, and if something unanticipated happens, it&#x27;d do something reasonable until I coded that config in too.<p>* I wouldn&#x27;t need to reconfigure my drawing tablet to connect to the right monitor each time I plug it in.<p>* The system wouldn&#x27;t get into an unrecoverable, unstable state with e.g. an unreliable USB cable.<p>.. and so on. It&#x27;s designed for a fixed set of hardware, with layers on top of that to support hotswapping. I don&#x27;t have &quot;USB 4k Logitech Webcam&quot; on the native level. I have &#x2F;dev&#x2F;video3. I then have layers to map names back.<p>Same thing with HDDs too, actually. I refer to them as &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sdc4, rather than by a GUID or name or similar.
