The parts of the US that I am familiar with make extremely widespread use of indoor climate control. Many buildings, such as offices and schools, have windows that barely open or don&#x27;t open at all. And even if the weather permits you to eat outdoors, there usually isn&#x27;t enough public space where you could do it comfortably and safely. I guess you could drive to a restaurant and then eat in your car with the windows rolled down.')
