I feel like there are significant downsides with digital that make me want to go back to paper (but if I were to print out everything I read, my small apartment would be overflowing in a year and it seems so wasteful).<p>One of the most obvious benefits to paper that comes to mind is the ability to lay multiple non-sequential pages (from the same paper and from other papers) side-by-side.
