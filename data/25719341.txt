Then note and filter out the sections you are less interested in or don&#x27;t appear to provide the biggest bang for your buck.<p>- Annotate, annotate, annotate. Active reading is better than passive reading. I use a 2-in-1 chromebook and a passive pen to highlight in the adobe pdf reader.<p>- Write detailed notes in addition to annotating (i.e. in a separate notebook or markdown file). Cull&#x2F;convert your notes into Anki&#x2F;Memrise digital flashcards. Drill on your phone when you are lying in bed.')
