The post explicitly says the code has intrinsic complexity, so it seems very plausible that the comments <i>do</i> explain what&#x27;s going on. Perhaps they are like:<p><pre><code>    &#x2F;&#x2F; Step 1: Prepare the widget\n    ... 10 lines of code ...\n    \n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Step 2: Fnagle the widget \n    ... 10 lines of code ...\n</code></pre>\nSome (Martin Fowler in <i>Refactoring</i>) would respond to this by putting each of those 10-line code blocks into their own functions call step_1_prepare_widget() etc., but many times (not always) this ends up making the code harder to follow.')
