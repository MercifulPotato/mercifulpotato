How to communicate that is challenging. I remember Pandora’s generated stations having a similar issue years ago, where it would catch similarities between on-trend bands and bands that had fallen out of favor. It was right, but it could sometimes be hard to submit to the insight of the algorithm. Spotify is one that I think does this well as they understand how not to give a recommendation that insults or offends, even if it’s technically an accurate response.')
