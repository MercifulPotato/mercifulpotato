Positioned that way it will be about as interesting to most kids as a plate of cold spaghettiâ€” am thinking here of the book I was given as a teenager on developing ActiveX components, because it was an enterprise-y thing, when what I really wanted was a book on DirectX, for making games.<p>But yeah, if the Pi shows up as part of an IOT system, or as a TV&#x2F;streaming box, or to play retro games on, or whatever, then it&#x27;s there and it&#x27;s available to be tinkered with; and from my limited experience, basically none of those use cases will run on their own without at least a little bit of tinkering. :) Even my little Linux-running Powkiddy emulation handheld has probably consumed about as much of my tinkering time as it has my retro gaming time.')
