Mobile app development as an utter shitshow in 2007 with no signs of it getting any better.<p>It just seems weird to complain that the company that made mobile apps mainstream &quot;didn&#x27;t allow it&quot; earlier. The only reason they delayed a year is because the SDK wasn&#x27;t publication ready yet. They hadn&#x27;t even finalised the APIs yet and they were still very buggy at the launch of the first phones. We know that from interviews from former employees, the iPhone OS changed hugely between launch and the second phone a year later. A lot of the internal apps were extensively rewritten. Not a great time to push third party development.')
