Nothing comes remotely close to a simple ripgrep against literally all of the repositories, both in terms of convenience and speed (it&#x27;s instantaneous against hundreds of repositories, at least on SSD!). The only hassle is configuring .ignore files (most is covered by .gitignores), but usually only have to do it a few times to exclude the few spammy offenders.<p>I&#x27;m using it with my emacs (+helm), I just have a global keybinding which instantly opens a new code search. I could imagine having a web frontend being very convenient for people who aren&#x27;t hooked on Emacs, even I often want to  persist a code search result for several days, so will give datasette-ripgrep a try!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beepb00p.xyz&#x2F;pkm-search.html#code" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beepb00p.xyz&#x2F;pkm-search.html#code</a>')
