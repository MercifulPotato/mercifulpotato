Ended up finding it (#142) from the cover art. I bought it as a gift for the person who taught me to play tabletop games. They used that issue which included some details for 2nd Edition and the Warhammer RPG. Thanks for preserving this content! Especially in the simple format you&#x27;ve presented it in.')
