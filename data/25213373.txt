Item(by='dheera', descendants=None, kids=[25213525], score=None, time=1606333284, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25213240, text='reCaptcha has also gotten increasingly annoying lately.<p>I forgot my password to one site and tried about 2 or 3 different passwords and in-between each it asked me to do about 7 or 8 of those labelling exercises. I finally just gave up and left the site.<p>Not only that, but the labelling exercises weren&#x27;t clear. It wanted me to label a &quot;公交車&quot; which means more like a public city bus and there were also school buses which would normally not be called that in Chinese so I didn&#x27;t label them but Google thought they were part of that class, and wouldn&#x27;t let me proceed without me labelling them, and furthermore, punished me with more &quot;hard&quot; exercises like that. I guess they are trying to turn me into a stupid bot.')
