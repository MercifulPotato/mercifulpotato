Why???<p>I mean, saying that:<p>&gt; <i>Many people see the Chinese govt&#x27;s deficiencies as a result of &quot;evil&quot;. I don&#x27;t really subscribe to that.

Would you say the same thing about the Soviets (with their Gulags) or Nazis (with their death camps)? I mean, literal genocide [2] is not just <i>&quot;incompetence&quot;</i>. It&#x27;s something far more malevolent.
