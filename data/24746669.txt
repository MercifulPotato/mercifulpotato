Why does the same not apply to medicine, law, physics, mechanical engineering etc.? Or perhaps it does? Would you say only a low percentage of mechanical engineering students are any good, namely those who have tinkered with mechanical contraptions from age 12?<p>Does CS require uniquely high intelligence &#x2F; problem solving ability compared to other fields? I don&#x27;t think so. Then what do those 2% have that others don&#x27;t? Some have suggested frustration-tolerance, we could perhaps add detail-orientedness. But these are also needed in engineering. Perhaps the abstract, intangible nature of CS makes it harder?')
