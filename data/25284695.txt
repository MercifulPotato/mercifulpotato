Doubly so if web&#x2F;WASM can make those API calls.”<p>You want a government mandated software platform?<p>Regardless of whether any of your criticisms have merit, putting the government in charge of API design seems like a questionable suggestion to say the least.<p>Also, all these breakups you are suggesting are anti-consumer.  Your assumption is that somehow ‘competition’ would produce better products than we currently have, but history doesn’t support that idea.<p>Without vertical integration you just end up with inefficient consortia attempting to solve problems by committee and political jockeying.<p>That’s what enabled Apple to overtake WinTel in the first place.<p>The way to unseat Apple isn’t to use the government to force us back in time.<p>It’s to recognize the needs they aren’t   satisfying and actually contribute to meeting them.')
