Item(by='jacurtis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611599237, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25905793, text='MOST seaplanes have piston engines that use 100LL AvGas, which is a gasoline with lead in it (the LL stands for &quot;low lead&quot; as opposed to &quot;unleaded&quot; in car gas). The lead keeps airplane engines, especially older ones from knocking.<p>These planes are DHC-2 DeHaviland Beavers, which traditionally do have radial engines that would require leaded gas. So there is some significance to the rumors.<p>BUT... Harbour Air (the airline featured in this article) is a large seaplane airline that have converted all their Beavers to Turbo-Beavers, so they use Turbo-prop engines, which is essentially a jet engine with a propeller on the shaft instead of a fan (turbo-fan is what most commercial jetliners use, these are essentially the same type of engine but using a propeller to convert engine revolutions into propulsion as opposed to a fan). So in this case, Harbour Air&#x27;s beavers actually use Jetfuel which does NOT have lead in it.')
