Since `&amp;mut` references are exclusive, they&#x27;re quite similar to immutable values in functional languages, despite the API appearing mutable.<p>In Rust the &#x27;interor mutability&#x27; term is used for types like `Mutex`&#x2F;`RefCell`, `Cell`, or atomics, which are mutable even through shared references. These come with the same problems as interor mutability in scala.')
