It&#x27;s easier to move on if I don&#x27;t come to a rest.<p>I&#x27;ve interviewed enough to have had very good ones that went nowhere and poor ones that got me hired. Having low or no expectations from any one prospect is healthy.<p>And yeah, even sending a short thanks but no thanks form-email can be emotionally taxing.')
