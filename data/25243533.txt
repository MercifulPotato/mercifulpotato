My biggest problems with my phone with LineageOS is that I cannot use a microSD card as more internal disk space, not a problem with LineageOS itself, but a problem with Android 6 and above on my phone.  The other problem is LineageOS not having an update for my phone for 2 or 3 years, as mine is an old budget phone from 2014.<p>On the whole I have been very happy with LineageOS as it has allowed me to continue to use my phone for years longer than I would have with the simply bad manufacturer updates that almost completely filled the internal disk space and stopped updating something like 2015 with Android 5.  Less unnecessary expense, less eWaste, thumbs up.<p>For me, I would definitely go with a phone manufacturer that supports rooting their device and put LineageOS on it if I think I need it. I may not install it, but the option for the future is the main thing.')
