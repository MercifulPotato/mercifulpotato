It sounds ridiculous to me an ocean away.<p>But on your last point, I am much more inclined to agree. Indigenous people are not a mere tree, and dealing with the whole imperialism&#x2F;colonialism(&#x2F;genocide?) thing is an entirely different level of ethical consideration.<p>I&#x27;m way more hesitant about anything impacting actual people or reinforcing past stealing of indigenous land than I am about nostalgia about some tree or building.')
