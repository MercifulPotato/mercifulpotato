Pareto discovered this last century. It doesn&#x27;t matter what the socio-economic system is. It is just a reality of life.<p>&gt; One of Pareto&#x27;s equations achieved special prominence, and controversy. He was fascinated by problems of power and wealth. How do people get it? How is it distributed around society? How do those who have it use it? The gulf between rich and poor has always been part of the human condition, but Pareto resolved to measure it. He gathered reams of data on wealth and income through different centuries, through different countries: the tax records of Basel, Switzerland, from 1454 and from Augsburg, Germany, in 1471, 1498 and 1512; contemporary rental income from Paris; personal income from Britain, Prussia, Saxony, Ireland, Italy, Peru. What he found – or thought he found – was striking. When he plotted the data on graph paper, with income on one axis, and number of people with that income on the other, he saw the same picture nearly everywhere in every era. Society was not a &quot;social pyramid&quot; with the proportion of rich to poor sloping gently from one class to the next. Instead it was more of a &quot;social arrow&quot; – very fat on the bottom where the mass of men live, and very thin at the top where sit the wealthy elite. Nor was this effect by chance; the data did not remotely fit a bell curve, as one would expect if wealth were distributed randomly. &quot;It is a social law&quot;, he wrote: something &quot;in the nature of man&quot;<p>This is known as the &quot;Iron law of oligarchy&quot;. Elites will always end up running everything and collecting everything. If you remove the current set of elites a new set of elites will take their place. Unfortunately these facts forms the basis of fascism. However that doesn&#x27;t mean the observation isn&#x27;t valid.')
