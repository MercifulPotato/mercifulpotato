This is the thing you seem to have a hard time with.<p>Of course this isn&#x27;t a symmetric relationship, but its nature, and even its legal nature, isn&#x27;t ordained by nature, but is a result of political activism, and differs over time and place. Whatever that relationship is now in the US, it is clearly something that is as temporary as it&#x27;s always been, and everyone constantly aims to change it. Google&#x27;s executive and board are much bigger political activists than this group of employees, but they all seek to change the power balance.<p>&gt; don&#x27;t be surprised (and cry foul) if you are terminated.<p>You might not be surprised but crying foul is legitimate.
