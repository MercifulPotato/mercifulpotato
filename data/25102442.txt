Item(by='Yetanfou', descendants=None, kids=[25102580], score=None, time=1605458263, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25102308, text='&gt; This is the opposite of your proposed ideal.<p>No, it is the result of the current media not willing to move away from their standpoint and as such in need of something on &quot;the other side&quot; to create the balance. In an ideal situation the media would be spread over the spectrum but that is obviously not where we - this phenomenon is not limited to the USA - are now.<p>&gt; You should be promoting apolitical news, not increasingly polarized news to &quot;even it out&quot;. Moving more right or left doesn&#x27;t bring anyone closer together.<p>That would not work, neutral views do not balance out left- or right-wing views unless those neutral views are in a large majority. A simple (and greatly simplified) model and calculation can easily show that. Take the GAL-TAN scale which puts political ideology in a 2-dimensional grid with left-right on the <i>x</i> axis and libertarian-authoritarian on the <i>y</i> axis. Ignoring the <i>y</i> axis for now the majority of the media lie somewhere to the left of the middle. If the objective is for the political scale to even out there is an actual need for an even amount of media to the right of the middle, adding media on the middle will still make the scale tip to the left. Moving the left-leaning media to the middle would help but that is not happening any time soon.')
