Artist != someone who sells artworks. Selling art is something else than making art. You could argue that it is almost completely detached from making art.<p>If UBI makes 10% of the population &quot;talented artists&quot;, what does that even mean? Who should consume all this art? Doesn&#x27;t it make &quot;art&quot; much more common and thus, less valuable to society?')
