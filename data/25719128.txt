Item(by='tikhonj', descendants=None, kids=[25719393], score=None, time=1610309533, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25719000, text='&gt; <i>Using a special command (nix-shell) whenever I needed to do development things (e.g. Rust builds) was not my idea of fun.</i><p>Funny you should mention that, because that&#x27;s exactly what got me using Nix everywhere :). I&#x27;ve always hated installing tools and libraries globally—what if I need a different version for a future project?—so I like tools that sandbox as much as possible like virtualenv, cargo, cabal... etc. But these tools are all language-specific and have their own limitations (especially around native libraries and dependencies written in other languages).<p>nix-shell gives me the equivalent of virtualenv that works for <i>everything</i>. I can have a single sandboxed environment even if my project uses a bunch of different languages and I can manage <i>everything</i> in a reproducible, low-overhead fashion. No more worrying about making a mess by installing tools or packages globally.<p>Then, once I got really used to that, I spent some time setting up direnv[1] and lorri[2]—both of which are themselves managed with Nix, of course!—so that my environment gets automatically configured as soon as I enter a project directory without needing to call nix-shell explicitly. To be honest, the experience is still a bit rough, but it works well enough day-to-day that I have my reproducible sandbox cake and eat it in an mostly frictionless way too :).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;direnv.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;direnv.net&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;target&#x2F;lorri" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;target&#x2F;lorri</a>')
