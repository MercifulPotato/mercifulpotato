Having your entire user session under a process supervisor that can anything can hook into is good for stability since your &quot;desktop&quot; now has a much more control of what&#x27;s actually running. They days of logout just failing because your compositor can&#x27;t kill all the things are pretty much gone. Logind is far far from perfect but it&#x27;s a breath of fresh air compared to ConsoleKit and it unifies the concept of a session so that GUI&#x2F;VNC&#x2F;SSH are all the same kind of thing.')
