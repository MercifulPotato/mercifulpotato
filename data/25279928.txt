Also note that their financials aren&#x27;t public, so there&#x27;s all kinds of funny possibilities (what if SpaceX launches are sold below cost as a loss leader?)<p>I&#x27;d also imagine that they need a TON of subscribers to make it profitable. However by commoditizing their satellites the marginal cost of improving coverage is low (compared to GEO where every satellite is a billion dollar bespoke system).<p>Phased array antennas have been around for a while but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the starlink terminal is the first consumer device to actually use them (other than maybe boat radars?). They&#x27;re still pretty expensive.')
