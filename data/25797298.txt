Companies like Mongo, ES, etc leveraged open source and venture capital to get where they are today, and now they&#x27;re finding that open source isn&#x27;t the business that venture capital wants it to be.<p>I really don&#x27;t know why they get so much defense in the community; I view their actions as a straight betrayal. The one thing you can say about AWS is, they&#x27;re the enemy you know. They don&#x27;t have a history of turning their back on OSS, but they also don&#x27;t have a history of abusing OSS to gain traction for their product (though, the MySQL&#x2F;Aurora relationship could reasonably fall under this. I think its different; not a betrayal because they haven&#x27;t turned their backs on MySQL, but are just trying to make it better for their customers in ways MySQL alone can&#x27;t do). With AWS, you know what you get; they care about the tech and the money; no politics (well, almost), no weird philosophies guiding decision making, just solving problems and getting paid to solve those problems. That&#x27;s infrastructure, baby.<p>Its a lot hazier with, say, MongoDB. You wouldn&#x27;t believe the pressure they&#x27;ve put on customers on 3.6; we&#x27;re talking weekly emails, even a few cold calls, from sales reps. &quot;Hey, I know its the holidays, but have you taken a look at 4.0 yet? Let me send you a link to check it out, lots of cool stuff.&quot; Yeah; the real reason they want you to upgrade is because 4.0 has a bunch of new features that competitors like AWS can&#x27;t replicate due to its new licensing. I&#x27;d love to hear from someone running MySQL on RDS, and if they&#x27;ve had a similar experience with AWS sales concerning Aurora; I suspect they haven&#x27;t. Frankly, AWS never talks to us and we never talk to them, unless there&#x27;s a problem or we want a discount, and they&#x27;re always accommodating for both. The perfect relationship.')
