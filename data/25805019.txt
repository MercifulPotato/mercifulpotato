Writing Go on it mostly. Zero problems. Fast, reliable. Probably the best computer I&#x27;ve ever owned. I am using VMs in AWS for a lot of more complex development work though so it&#x27;s fair to say that this is a limited terminal machine with some local development being done. The only third party applications I have installed are Zoom, Slack, MacVim, Go, Terraform, AWS CLI as an example. I am not using homebrew etc as I don&#x27;t need to.<p>Main thing: it just works, silently and quickly!')
