Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611262052, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25852525, text='&gt; It&#x27;s theoretically possible for a state to decide that it doesn&#x27;t need a governor.<p>The guarantee clause (Article IV section 4) says &quot;The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government...&quot; What constitutes a &quot;Republican Form of Government&quot;? Is having a governor essential to it?<p>I think the answer is nobody can really say because the Supreme Court has never had to consider that exact question, and nobody knows how they&#x27;d rule if they did. They have previously ruled that the guarantee clause is &quot;non-justiciable&quot; (in Luther v. Borden, 1849), which implies they&#x27;d let a state adopt whatever form of government it likes, but they could change their mind about that if they wanted to.<p>What if a state wanted to adopt the Westminister system, like a Canadian province or Australian state? What would SCOTUS have to say about that?')
