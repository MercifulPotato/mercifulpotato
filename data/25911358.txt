Every times is yet another failure and never seen its light. One day, in process of setting up another SaaS and buy a domain and setup email. I said it would be great to forward email to my personal email, all I want is a way to receive email to those domains. So I went ahead and built this service. Now, all I need is point MX records to my app and can receiving emails. All of my emails are powered by this service since the last 3 months.<p>Eventually I can see I need other things such as webhook to process incoming email via HTTP request and finally in 2021, after 10 years, my first SaaS see its light.<p>Using my app&#x27;s webhook feature you can build workflow similar to &quot;Mail to kindle&quot; or &quot;Send email to create a support ticket&quot; of Zendeck. An example I built with  webhook is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pix.fastloop.xyz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pix.fastloop.xyz</a>  . If you want to process incoming email, give my service a try too.<p>Let me know how you think. Any feedback is appreciated.')
