They&#x27;ve been around for decades. Applied Cryptography gives them (excellent book; highly entertaining, yet reasonably mathematical). The gist of it is that:<p>- Everyone can verify who voted (so number of votes equals number of voters)<p>- Everyone can verify their individual vote was correctly and uniquely counted<p>- All votes are released under unique, anonymous identifiers, so anyone can recount all votes<p>- However, no one can verify anyone else&#x27;s vote individually<p>It&#x27;s pretty awesome! I&#x27;ve watched with gradual shock and horror as voting machines came out and seemed almost designed for riggable elections.')
