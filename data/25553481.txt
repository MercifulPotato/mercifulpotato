If you fall for 1&#x2F;N of the scams you are exposed to, multiplying the number of scams by K means you fall for on average K times as many scams.</i><p>Only if exposure to each scam is independent! I wouldn&#x27;t expect that to be the case. I hypothesize people prone to falling for scams get exposed to comparatively more scams, and people resistant to scams get exposed to relatively fewer over time.<p>So your main point stands: delivery of scams has been thoroughly optimized to saturate a vulnerable population and not waste time on a resistant population, compared to a few decades ago.')
