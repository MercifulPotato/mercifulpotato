It looks for PR comments with a specific keyword, then pulls the branch, tests it, and pushes a merge commit automatically.<p>Taking this approach has two big upsides. First, the bot is just a binary running on a cheap VPS; so I know that it&#x27;ll be fast and that I can ssh in at any time to debug if necessary. Second, if there&#x27;s a feature that I want, <i>I can just add it</i>, rather than twiddling my thumbs. For example, I noticed that I was manually deleting my merged PR branches every time, so I added a few lines to the bot and now it deletes them automatically.<p>The obvious downsides of this approach are: 1) Implementing even an MVP of such a bot can consume significant time and energy, which you may not have a lot of; 2) If there&#x27;s a bug, it&#x27;s your fault and now you need to spend <i>more</i> time and energy tracking it down; and 3) Your bot might have a security vulnerability that exposes secrets, allows injection attacks, etc.<p>I&#x27;d love to see tooling&#x2F;frameworks that make it easier to create custom CI systems. I think startups (and perhaps larger companies as well) could benefit a lot from building a CI in-house, since it allows you to optimize for your own specific needs. I see a lot of parallels to code linters, where spending a bit of time writing custom lint rules or static analysis tools can have a large payoff.')
