There is a very good fundamental structure we inherited through millions of years of evolution.</i><p>It is worth noting that the training data used for training humans has been undergoing it&#x27;s own optimization process for a while too (arguably for about 40ky, since the Upper Paleolithic Revolution, which is roughly when cultural evolution started taking over). In AI adjusting the training data is called Curriculum Learning. Right now most curriculum learning is done just by adjusting the <i>order</i> of training samples, rather than creating samples specifically optimized to facilitate learning (although GANs might be considered a Socratic approach to the latter, if you squint at it).')
