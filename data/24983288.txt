More and more it feels like the OS, the browser, are guarding the user not against bad apps, but also against the user.\nFirefox Mobile only allowing less than a dozen extensions. Chrome mobile supporting no extensions. These are different than the OS, but the same kind of decisions done &quot;for the user&quot; by removing capabilities from the environment.<p>Even the people not fighting against people in the War on General Purpose Computing keep seceding our sovereign systems away from us. The need for security is real, but I don&#x27;t see that we are approaching it with balance. We seem to be growing ever more heavyhanded, permitting users less &amp; less, and I don&#x27;t see a reciprocal respect &amp; empowerment being considered, furthered or advanced.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24982862" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24982862</a>')
