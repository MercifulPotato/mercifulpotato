A lot of vector image interchange formats are just plaintext so normal text clipboard APIs should suffice.<p>Animated images could definitely be somewhat useful though, albeit much more niche than static raster images. In most cases where I want an animated image on my clipboard, a link will suffice. What I want may not map to the majority of course, but at least PNG support is a start!')
