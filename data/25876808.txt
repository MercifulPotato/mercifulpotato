The article mentioned the majority of the carbon reduction wasnt actually due to reduced demand, but rather from lowered emissions from using renewables (and more specifically the closures of coal plants). This seems like pretty good news to me. You can continue to grow and operate the economy while reducing carbon emissions to levels they need to be at by switching everything to renewables.')
