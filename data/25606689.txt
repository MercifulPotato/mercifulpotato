If you are being hired to replace someone who left, try to find out why they left (or were fired).<p>I have not done much moving around in my (long) career, but I have many friends who have.  There are plenty of jobs out there, but many of them are tainted by toxic people or cultures.  During your interview process, find out what you can.  If you come away with any concerns, trust your feelings.  If uncertain, raise your concerns and seek more information before you accept an offer.  You will either come away with more concerns, or you will find out that your concerns were unfounded.<p>Any big company hiring a new PhD grad should do their best to make the new employee feel welcome as part of the team.  It seems that there were plenty of warning signs in this case, but as this was the author&#x27;s first work experience, she either missed them or did not recognize their significance.<p>It&#x27;s a shame that the visa process and ITAR rules compounded the problems described.<p>I&#x27;m a bit confused about the end of this article where she writes; &quot;If Apple refuse to take actions, I will interview with major media outlets describing the experience in more details and I will release a list of all individuals involved from senior management to the HR director and all the evidence as public record.&quot;<p>She no longer works for Apple, and probably doesn&#x27;t want to ever work there again, so why the threat, and why the ultimatum?  Why not just go public with all of the names and documentation?  They already did their best to damage her reputation and career.  Why should she hold back?')
