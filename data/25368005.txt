A slippery slope would imply that the issue gets worse and worse along some spectrum over time. For example: arguing that allowing homosexuality will lead to bestiality and pedophilia because they all exist along a dimension of perverted acts.<p>deumeti is just pointing out that cheer-leading censorship and tyranny, just because you are on the &#x27;winning side&#x27;, will inevitably lead to you becoming oppressed in the same way. Think of all the stories where a bunch of lackeys support the antagonist, only to be ultimately betrayed and destroyed. It&#x27;s more of a &#x27;Lucius Malfoy&#x27; argument, not &#x27;slippery slope&#x27;.')
