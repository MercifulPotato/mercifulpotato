Item(by='stewjacks', descendants=None, kids=[25649705, 25648059], score=None, time=1609865279, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25644817, text='I&#x27;ve been working on a b2b SaaS side project in the computerized maintenance management space for the past ~4 years ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;salientforms.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;salientforms.com</a> ). Revenue is great for a side project, however I&#x27;d like to build the feature set out to appeal to more clients, and generally do business development.<p>My background is compsci&#x2F;software&#x2F;hardware engineering, as well as the practical and physical side of how this sort of product works (urban systems, transportation, construction, maintenance). I&#x27;m looking for biz dev, growth, and interesting product ideas. My ideal co-founder would be someone who&#x27;s worked in or has connections to the world of transportation, is motivated to find clients and grow a business, and is reasonably good at hacking and coming up with prototype ideas.<p>I&#x27;m in Toronto. Location doesn&#x27;t really matter, but the product has a slight skew toward winter right now so a Canadian who knows would be ideal. Reach out via the site link above or via github.')
