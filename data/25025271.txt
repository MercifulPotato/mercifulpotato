Also managed to screw up the bootloader and partitions on more than one time. I&#x27;m not gonna pretend I&#x27;m an expert, I just want a simple system, which Arch really is. But sometimes too simple, requires a lot of reading and understanding, which is usually not a problem, but sometimes it is.<p>One recent example was me trying out KDE Plasma. Usually I use AwesomeVM but the HN thread about the new Plasma version made me try it out in Arch. After the install and trying to use it for a while, I wanted to go back.<p>Uninstalling the package(s) is not enough, as it already has been overwriting bunch of stuff and changed configs that are not being rolled back after uninstalling.<p>Still to this day KRunner launches (via some d-bus command or something like that) when I do my Super+R shortcut, which usually runs the AwesomeVM launcher, not KRunner. Haven&#x27;t figured out how to get rid of it yet, but got other stuff to do right now, so simply living with it for now.<p>With NixOS, I&#x27;d just reboot and select the previous version where KDE Plasma was never installed.')
