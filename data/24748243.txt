He&#x27;s mostly not motivated by the money. After making $1B from the PayPal exit he could have just retired and bought a yacht or an island. He wants to de-carbonize transport and colonize Mars. Both to give humanity a better chance at surviving into the future.<p>That&#x27;s three billion dollar companies so far and counting. Is there anybody else who&#x27;s done that?
