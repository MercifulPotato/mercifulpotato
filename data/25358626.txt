Dev with 256 GB RAM to User: WFM</i><p>I would not be surprised if a lot of these problems could be traced back to developers having above-average network connections and super beefy computers. Combine that with fresh or minimal installs while testing the software, without lots of data that accumulated over month or years of use and in consequence they experience their products as super snappy.<p>Summary: they maybe never experience their products as a normal user would.')
