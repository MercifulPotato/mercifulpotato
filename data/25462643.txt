Unless there is a ton of it, 1 star reviews are often outliers having had a bad experience, people who clearly havenâ€™t read the product description or having some gripe otherwise. The 5 stars often have the feel (fake or not) that they would give that rating no matter the quality of the product. Whereas 3 star reviews often point out shortcomings of the product that might or might not affect me, so it is the most useful.')
