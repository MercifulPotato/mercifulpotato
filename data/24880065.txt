One, a comparison to C++ is a little disingenuous because C++ is notorious for slow compile times already. Two, it’s not really accurate to say that Rusts compile time is an implementation detail. In fact, many times over the lifetime of Rust the Rust developers have traded off compile time for particular features that they wanted to add. Compare this to, say, Go, which refuses to add any feature without a serious consideration of compile time impact. Sure, the current implementation could be sped up - but it certainly wasn’t designed to be.')
