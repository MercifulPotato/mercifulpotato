Item(by='hajile', descendants=None, kids=[25056403], score=None, time=1605056257, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25053959, text='A normal SRAM cell takes 6 transistors. 6 * 8 * 1024 * 1024 * &lt;total_mb&gt; is a big number.<p>Next, SRAM doesn&#x27;t scale like normal transistors. TSMC N7 cells are 0.027 nanometers while MY cells are 0.021 (1.35x). meanwhile, normal transistors got a 1.85x shrink.<p>I-cache is also different across architectures. x86 uses 15-20% less instruction memory for the same program (on average). This means for the same size cache that x86 can store more code and have a higher hit rate.<p>The next issue is latency. Larger cache sizes mean larger latencies. AMD and Intel have both used 64kb L1 and then move back to 32kb because of latencies. The fact that x86 chips get such good performance with a fraction of the L1 cache points more to since kind of inefficiency in Apples design. I&#x27;d guess AMD&#x2F;Intel have much better prefetcher designs.')
