This is a story about people who are reasonably successful but they keep never making it truly big.<p>If anything, having a big breakout success is so rare that &quot;almost succeeding&quot; many times is a lot more common.<p>It sucks - e.g. I was part of building a tablet years before the iPad (we were not first, either, and not the last pre-Apple attempt) - but after a couple like that you get used to it and learn from what the successful attempt did different instead of being annoyed at it.<p>And then you try again with something else.')
