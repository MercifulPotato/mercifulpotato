It seems like you&#x27;ve already decided it&#x27;s possible to find life &quot;meaning&quot; at work.<p>Like other comments have mentioned, you&#x27;ve provided no information as to what &quot;meaningful&quot; looks like to you.<p>I have a friend&#x2F;former colleague that hated work. We would complain in the lunchroom together about the insanity of cooperate life. I quit the job for an equally insane (but much better paying) role.<p>A few years later, we caught up for a beer. He quit a few months after I did and got a job with the local government maintaining a wetland area near a large city. He was getting paid 65K per year and absolutely loved the work more than anything. He loved the fact he was actively saving something everyday and wasn&#x27;t in an office.<p>Other than the above friend, I know exactly zero other people IRL that claim to have get significant &quot;meaning&quot; from work. Including myself.')
