It felt like you had to know a lot about it&#x27;s internals and the change detection mechanisms to make things work performantly, and if you needed to opt out of its model and dip into lower-level DOM manipulation code then that was quite a headache. I&#x27;ve found React to be a much more boring technology where everything just works.')
