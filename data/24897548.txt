Investors are happy, employees are happy, regulators are happy. A month later, the company goes bankrupt.<p>How did no one see it coming?<p>Chances are the CEO did but knew other people wouldn&#x27;t. She knew the decay was not yet solid enough, not yet visible enough, for outsiders to recognize it as decay. So, she chose not to highlight it. She gave their followers a nice, wide window into the company&#x27;s activities as required by law, focusing on the easy parts, while leaving the decaying lines between the parts decaying in the dark.<p>The journalist phrase &quot;shine a light&quot; comes to mind: if leaders don&#x27;t give followers a true belief they need (honesty) to organize the information they&#x27;re given (transparency), then outsiders must bring or draw their own insight instead. To peer through the cracks and connect the dots while others fumble in the dark.<p>Effectively, transparency without honesty becomes a tool for manipulation. It enables the powerful to appear clear while maintaining their invisibility, and therefore their invulnerability.')
