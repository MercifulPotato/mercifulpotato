The course has its own Kaggle competition.<p>I also really liked &quot;Discrete optimization&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;discrete-optimization" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;discrete-optimization</a>). At the time that I took it it also had a competitive element where you would solve optimization problems and there was a leader board comparing all the students in the current batch. That was when courses still started in batches and were free so the experience would probably no longer be the same, unfortunately.')
