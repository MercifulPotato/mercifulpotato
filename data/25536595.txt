Most &#x27;big news&#x27; is very easily understood by lay people (e.g. &quot;Congress is debating a pandemic relief bill&quot; or &quot;The World Trade Center has been struck by aircraft&quot;), or it has a long delay before the news is actionable.<p>Something complex like the financial response to the pandemic leaves plenty of time to write a more thoughtful analysis. The only fast &#x27;news&#x27; the mainstream should be reporting on is what various interested parties are saying and when to expect certain details. Anything more than that and they themselves become the fount of misinformation because they can&#x27;t possibly have all the details. <i>If the people voting on the 5,000+ page omnibus spending bill didn&#x27;t have time to read it, with all their support staff pitching in ~ and the fact that they helped write it ~ what chance does a news organization have?</i><p>&gt; In mainstream news the correspondent for X will helpfully add that knowledge to the story being reported so you can understand the new facts in context.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is actually helpful at all. Very rarely is the information complete or accurate. It&#x27;s <i>always</i> presented as being fact, when it is often more opinion. We killed a lot of people over yellowcake uranium that never actually existed while the news assured everyone it did. [0]Of course, the evidence the news was citing was debunked by our allies almost immediately.<p>Personally, I think so-called news should behave more responsibly, take their time, and produce more complete analysis so they can actually inform instead of mislead the people.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2003&#x2F;03&#x2F;31&#x2F;who-lied-to-whom" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2003&#x2F;03&#x2F;31&#x2F;who-lied-to-wh...</a>')
