Assuming one key reason is the heavy environmental cost, a thing that could be done very easily and have a huge impact is to replace meat in foods where it&#x27;s not center stage and&#x2F;or cheap meat products.<p>Why do they bother making cheap chicken nuggets out of chicken, or cheap fish fingers out of fish? It&#x27;s the worst bits, ground to a paste, texturizers and flavors added, then coated in crumbs and fried. Doesn&#x27;t need to have any meat in it at all.
