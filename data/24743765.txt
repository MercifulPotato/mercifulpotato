I&#x27;m on my second one, not because the first one broke, but because it was so dirty that I replaced it in 2012.  Really regret getting rid of the old one.<p>I never liked the newer Microsoft ones as much, and I can&#x27;t go back to a straight keyboard, so I&#x27;ll have to go down the rabbit hole when this one breaks.  This discussion has been really informative.')
