It&#x27;s simply &quot;well I guess we need to increase&#x2F;maintain our market share, time to lock it down!&quot;<p>Zooming out here, I think there&#x27;s an interesting pattern&#x2F;trend that needs to be solved for (with old or new solutions): if you can make a superior UX and&#x2F;or get a strong network effect of users, then you can make these moves and &quot;boil the frog&quot; so to speak. Some companies know when to stop before their users get too mad while others boil it quite quickly. I don&#x27;t see any end to this problem, in music or elsewhere, unless something fundamental changes.<p>I&#x27;d be preaching to the choir here to bring up open standards, but I wonder if it is time to bring in mandated (by law) regulation for some industries. Let the current big players in a few markets design something super abstract, and then let reps from many (+ some significant representation from users &#x2F; small players) maintain and slowly shape it. I&#x27;d wonder if that could even commoditize some of these to even make entry by smaller players easier.<p>Potential markets to approach with this regulation:<p>- Music<p>- App Stores<p>- Social Media Posting (I know Mastadon exists, but not going to open that can of worms in this post for now)<p>- Maps (OSM already is kind of here)<p>- Ride Sharing<p>- Food Delivery<p>- Streaming Services<p>- Health Data Apps<p>- Dating Apps<p>I think OSM is a great example of how this can bootstrap smaller players and ideas into quick effectiveness. I can&#x27;t imagine what it could do for these other areas. If you remove the friction of user switching, you make it that much harder to &quot;boil the frog&quot;.<p>Yes, regulation will inherently slow down these areas in terms of &quot;innovation&quot;, but we as users need to ask if that speed is worth the power and control most users end up giving these companies in regards to data&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;long term UX and user friendliness.')
