Item(by='busterarm', descendants=None, kids=[24993392, 24997988, 24996167, 24996060], score=None, time=1604513620, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24991404, text='Kim used to brag about snooping on the documents he hosted for people and ratting people out to authorities and&#x2F;or blackmailing them.<p>The trail of bridges burned is quite long and starts in the mid-90s. His early handle was Kimble and he used to hack companies and sell their secrets for money (like PBX access) and did typical war dialer&#x2F;phreaker&#x2F;credit fraud scams you&#x27;d expect from &#x27;90s blackhats.<p>He came into some money thanks to some German friends of his, one who worked at Lufthansa, and exploited that to &quot;go legit&quot; even though it mostly wasn&#x27;t his own skills that he was trading on. He still ended up perpetrating a few frauds afterwards that cost friends and investors a lot of money. Look into Monkey AG and Monkeybank.<p>Why anyone trusts him with their data or investments has always puzzled the hell out of me.<p>I think people, especially &quot;hackers&quot;, just have short memories. It&#x27;s similar to how like Kirtaner is getting a lot of press right now for going after QAnon (he just had a Reddit AMA), even though the 420chan he hosted in its early years was a hot bed for child abuse imagery and even had a secret &#x2F;pedo&#x2F; board.  He also lies about founding Anonymous, which is kind of funny because of what I just said and the whole &quot;we do not forgive, we do not forget&quot; thing.<p>Jax also finally got called out on her scumbag past recently (although not all of it...) and I&#x27;m surprised how rarely this happens...given how much dirty laundry is out in the open...')
