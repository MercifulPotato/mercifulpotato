It&#x27;s also somewhat common for signs to be written in kanji and ambiguous romaji, which changes a quick Google Maps lookup into a dictionary adventure.<p>A direct mapping from kana to romaji produces &quot;tou&quot;, which is not how it&#x27;s pronounced[0], but does make it much easier to type in.<p>The classic example is 「東京」&#x2F;「とうきょう」, pronounced &quot;Toukyou&quot;, romanized as &quot;Tokyo&quot;.<p>[0] I am currently studying Japanese for &quot;it would be nice to be able to read my bank statements&quot; purposes, and the teacher has spent a great deal of time emphasizing that pairs like 「とう」 and 「とお」 have the same pronunciation.
