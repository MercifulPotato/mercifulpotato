It is there to teach us critical thinking, and consequently, how to be a good citizen.<p>That&#x27;s an interesting use of &quot;purpose&quot;. That isn&#x27;t what our system was specifically designed for (Prussian system adopted by the US) by the people who designed it.<p>They wrote heavily about how well their new education system instilled obedience and created good soldiers and workers. They were very proud of these good outcomes.<p>It&#x27;s also not the actual measured outcomes of our current system. Hell, &quot;critical thinking&quot; is explicitly excluded from the curriculum by a chunk of the US.<p>The use of &quot;purpose&quot; to mean &quot;thing we want it to be&quot; isn&#x27;t a critical type of thinking.')
