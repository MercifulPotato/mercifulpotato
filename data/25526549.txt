If you&#x27;re already on the same WiFi, it&#x27;ll use WiFi but if not, it&#x27;ll connect to each other via Bluetooth (eg, connecting to the same network [a network of two devices]), but the setup of the connection is automatic.<p>Maybe Snapdrop can do something similar with the new Bluetooth Web APIs.')
