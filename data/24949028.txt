No “modules” or package metadata, just source code files that are concatenated.<p>- Global scope, aided by the ability to namespace includes.<p>- A single data structure, like LISP. Probably records&#x2F;dicts but could be anything.<p>- Only two types: Integers and UTF-8 strings. I’m serious.<p>- No functions. Data transformation occurs though  pattern matching &#x2F; destructuring.<p>- Automatic compile-time static memory allocation.<p>- Streaming I&#x2F;O, with incremental computation, to allow for static memory allocation.<p>- No standard library, only semantics for destructuring the single data type, integers, and strings.<p>I think the closest languages to this would be variants of datalog.')
