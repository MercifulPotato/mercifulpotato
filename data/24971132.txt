Item(by='thrwyoilarticle', descendants=None, kids=[24971253, 24971812, 24971306], score=None, time=1604340811, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24969793, text='I have irrationally strong feelings about production car speed records.<p>Firstly,<p>&gt;Bugatti&#x27;s claimed 300-mph-breaking Chiron run was never going to count<p>As much as they would like to believe otherwise, Guiness World Records can not create truth. If the Chiron goes faster than the SSC, it&#x27;s the fastest production car. That&#x27;s it. Two way runs &amp; proper filming are an important factor if you&#x27;re trying to decide who gets the piece of paper but there&#x27;s nothing &#x27;official&#x27; about it. If someone goes faster but never tells anyone, they still went faster.<p>That is apart from one point: the Chiron isn&#x27;t a production car. But neither is the SSC. Nor the Veyron nor the Agera RS. If you don&#x27;t believe me, try to buy one. No matter how much money you have, or at what time you try to do it, you can&#x27;t. All of these cars have extremely limited units sold only to people with an existing relationship with the company. All of them set records with special editions. That&#x27;s just a modified car. If there are only 25 Agera RSes &amp; every one is modified for the owner, how do you establish the one that did the record isn&#x27;t just the equivalent of a binned, liquid oxygen-cooled CPU that dies after the record setting run? You can&#x27;t even drive the Veyron away from a record setting attempt: you need to replace its $40000 tyres.<p>Bugatti&#x27;s record was once in doubt because they deactivated the speed limiter for the run. This was later retracted because it&#x27;s not actually about trying to set consistent rules, it&#x27;s about creating marketing material for Volkswagen&#x27;s halo car. Which is why they won&#x27;t let anybody else run their faster cars on their track.<p>Other, assorted viewpoints:<p>- If your car is just a modified Lotus, it doesn&#x27;t count.<p>- For bidirectional attempts, how can you say that a car has a top speed of C mph when C = A+B&#x2F;2 mph and A&gt;B? That&#x27;s an invented figure.')
