Just because someone repeats a lie, doesn&#x27;t make it true.<p>I&#x27;m all for fair legal trials, and the cases are all dropped as nobody is able to mount any evidence, lawyers admit it was a lie before the judge, etc.<p>There should be no surprise that mailed votes have more votes for Biden, as Trump was supposedly all against mail-in voting, even though he used the same method himself. This means he&#x27;s confident in the methodology, and just lies as usual.<p>Trump actually despises all the people following him. He only loves himself and would not think twice of hurting anybody to further enrich himself.')
