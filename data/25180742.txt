My cycling purchases used to be top end, really top end, but now I can go for a ride in a pair of regular shorts just as well as â‚¬80 ones. And I feel such a dick for blowing so much, so unnecessarily. Equally, thanks to various YouTubers (Hambini, Durianrider etc) - it&#x27;s all a scam, anyway. I&#x27;m glad I woke up. Sorry lbs, and online stores, but it&#x27;s back to basics for this non-pro.')
