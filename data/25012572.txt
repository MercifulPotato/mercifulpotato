Also if you&#x27;re going to be in nature for a weekend, you can opt to carry your physical ID as a backup (or leave it in the car if you&#x27;re comfortable with that).<p>&gt; <i>hand over my phone unlocked to the police or to everybody who wanna see the license.</i><p>The article covers this.  You never hand over your phone; you send a grant to the other party&#x27;s device to read only certain bits of information from the ID app.  And the article mentions that the right way to implement it on the ID-holder&#x27;s side is to require PIN&#x2F;biometric unlock in order to approve the transfer, but then immediately go into a lockdown mode so if the LEO then takes your phone, it&#x27;ll be locked.<p>&gt; <i>More worse, until now, they just checked and it was ok. From now an, everybody is always saved after that in a DB.</i><p>That already happens now; if you get pulled over, the cop isn&#x27;t going to manually read your ID and copy it into their squad car&#x27;s computer.  They scan the barcode on the back and all of it gets sucked in.  (Even many bars and convenience stores that sell alcohol will scan the barcode and get way more information than they need.)<p>&gt; <i>And why is that more secure? If you cheated until know and showed a false ID, so you show now just a false phone.</i><p>Sure, you can borrow someone else&#x27;s phone, but presumably your photo won&#x27;t match theirs.  And if it&#x27;s close enough, then yeah, you can probably get away with it.  But just because something doesn&#x27;t close all the loopholes, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not worthwhile.  A discouragement for this particular thing is that the person you&#x27;ve borrowed the phone from will probably not want to give up their phone for an entire night!<p>Personally, I&#x27;m torn on this.  If it really would allow me to selectively give only the bits of information from my ID that various parties actually need, that would be nice.  But I worry more about how the ID data will be secured on whatever non-government third-party&#x27;s backend this will inevitably be outsourced to.')
