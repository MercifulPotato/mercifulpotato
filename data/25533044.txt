Item(by='djsumdog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608856553, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25532752, text='&gt; Not yet supported are new unique features introduced by the DualSense such as Adaptive Triggers and the VCM based Haptics. These features require a large amount of data and complex data structures. It is not clear how to expose these. The current Evdev and FF frameworks are too limiting. We hope to have a dialog on how to expose these over time in a generic way.<p>It looks like the Sony devs want to support the new vibration features, but don&#x27;t want to abuse the existing hid&#x2F;input layer for the amounts of data it apparently requires. It is good they&#x27;re looking for feedback (I assume via the kernel development mailing lists) on the right route to implement them.<p>It&#x27;d be neat if we started to see a lot of open source projects that used this controller in the same way Kinect projects took off.')
