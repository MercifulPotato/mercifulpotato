Compose is just way less verbose and far simpler.<p>The advantages of Kubernetes seem to be adding an overlay network, config and secrets management. None seem particularly useful for me though. Generally, I care which host a service I’m running is on, so tacking affinities to everything is additional work and doesn’t help with scalability. Since services are already pinned to a host, configuration is easy to manage by deploying it to the server. And, since most traffic is on the local network, an overlay is not really useful. I use a set of containers that form an SSH reverse proxy to expose some home services to remote services without exposing them to the public.<p>All this is orchestrated with Ansible. My config are still not published online yet, but I have an older blog post about it. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.iamthefij.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;21&#x2F;docker-orchestration-from-the-couch&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.iamthefij.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;21&#x2F;docker-orchestration-f...</a>')
