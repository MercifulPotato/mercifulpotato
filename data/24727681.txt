Note that abstractions, names, etc are conceived in the specification and are then translated into computer code. Even if you skip the specification step, as sometimes is done, you&#x27;re then dealing with an implicit, ad-hoc specification.<p>I think that&#x27;s a distinction without a difference; you might as well say that a story is a creative work but translating that story into symbols written on a page is purely mechanical.')
