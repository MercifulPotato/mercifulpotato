Item(by='mynameishere', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609530372, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25605498, text='There is something about one person being in a beehive of drama, but at the same time confusing ordinary office politics with &quot;nepotism&quot; or constantly conflating Apple policies and national policies (the so-called &quot;Muslim Ban&quot; etc) or taking what might be honest advice &quot;Quit before you&#x27;re fired&quot; as some sort of threat.  In other words, when one person&#x27;s short experience contains more complaining than I&#x27;ve made in my entire life--especially when that one person is dealing with a massively deep-pocketed and &quot;woke&quot; corporation--there&#x27;s indeed something very off about it.  This person is almost certainly going for the big bucks.')
