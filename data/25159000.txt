It took an open buffer and opened ansi-term and executed Vim on the file from the original buffer. I got some perverse pleasure in running Vim in my Emacs instance.<p>I don&#x27;t remember if I got as far as saving non-file buffers as temp files so they would be accessible to Vim or not. That would have been the next logical enhancement. Maybe it would also be possible to pipe the buffer directly into Vim? I&#x27;m not sure if Vim would display in the foreground if you did that or not. I feel like I&#x27;ve had situations where piping things into Vim managed to wedge it in the background, but some of that was on Windows where console process communication is a wasteland of broken dreams.')
