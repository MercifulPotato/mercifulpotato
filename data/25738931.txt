And we typically don&#x27;t need employment protection, since there&#x27;s a line of employers eager to hire us. &quot;Normal employment contracts&quot; are for losers (Ok, they are useful under some very specific circumstances e.g. when you have a newborn baby and need a lot of paid sick leave. Outside of that situation, you&#x27;re simply leaving money on the table by choosing employment contract).')
