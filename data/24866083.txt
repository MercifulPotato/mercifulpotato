Item(by='cbkeller', descendants=None, kids=[24866162], score=None, time=1603427855, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24865887, text='Well, this is where it seems to get complicated.<p>There is an 1831 letter from Whewell to Somervilles&#x27; father, asking him to thank her for the advance copy of her book which she apparently sent him, and also on behalf of the Philosophical Society for the copy she sent them [1] -- so they would have at the very least been aware of her and her book by the time of the 1833 discussion.<p>It is definitely not clear to me that the assertion in the article is correct, but one thing they do appear to be correct about is that &quot;man of science&quot; appears to have attained substantial currency (or indeed dominance) as an alternative to &quot;natural philosopher&quot; by 1830 [2,3]. Why not keep using that? Perhaps just because it is unwieldy? On the other hand, this was 1830 -- people were not so adverse to verbosity back then.<p>In any case, the deeper questions of why the profession was thought to need a noun at all, and of Whewell&#x27;s internal motivations, seem to me still rather unanswered.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;b21960239&#x2F;page&#x2F;170&#x2F;mode&#x2F;2up?q=whewell" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;b21960239&#x2F;page&#x2F;170&#x2F;mode&#x2F;2up?q=wh...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;whewell&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;whewell&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;ngrams&#x2F;graph?content=man+of+science%2Cnatural+philosopher&amp;year_start=1700&amp;year_end=2019" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;ngrams&#x2F;graph?content=man+of+science...</a>')
