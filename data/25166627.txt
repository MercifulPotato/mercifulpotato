Just a vanilla Dockerfile with a few RUN commands and COPY commands. It would hit cache until about the third layer, and then would cache break every time.<p>On my local computer (Arch) podman is v2.1.1, which seems to have whatever bug I was hitting fixed.<p>So I guess my complaint isn&#x27;t about podman specifically-- It had bugs and they were fixed, and that&#x27;s great. But I hate that RHEL 8 touts it as a docker replacement, and won&#x27;t carry docker in their repositories, when the version they have in their production releases is so broken.<p>We eventually sledgehammered docker CE&#x27;s CentOS repo into our RHEL 8 jenkins server and now everything works perfectly.<p>Running podman on the production webservers seems to work okay though-- apart from the process killing problems.')
