I spent weeks CMD+TABing between Semrush, google trends, trustpilot to research companies... And I was tearing my hair out doing it.<p>So I&#x27;ve spent the last 6 weeks building out this tool that automatically aggregates:\n1. Growth Metrics\n2. User Reviews\n3. Facebook Ads\n4. Google Ads\n6. Backlinks\n7. And More...<p>Half of that time was learning React, Next.JS, FaunaDB... But the other half was actually designing useful graphs to quickly show if a company was growing or declining.<p>So that I could quickly answer (1) how big a company is... (2) What are their main growth tactics...<p>So if you&#x27;re an entrepreneur, analyst, or just very curious about new startup companies, then you might find this useful.<p>Any questions leave them in the comments :)')
