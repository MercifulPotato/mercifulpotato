I&#x27;m using RTX Voice while I&#x27;m working on Windows and noisetorch while working on manjaro.<p>RTX Voice seems to work a bit better, but noisetorch compares really well to it. I have a microphone which has static noise and is not really mechanical decoupled from my table. Both applications are good at cancelling that kind of noise.<p>Noisetorch is a bit more focused on suppressing noise while you&#x27;re not talking, which is the use case of the posted article. RTX Voice is better at suppressing noise while talking, which you can hear in Nvidias demos as well.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lawl&#x2F;NoiseTorch" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lawl&#x2F;NoiseTorch</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;werman&#x2F;noise-suppression-for-voice&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;werman&#x2F;noise-suppression-for-voice&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jmvalin.ca&#x2F;demo&#x2F;rnnoise&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jmvalin.ca&#x2F;demo&#x2F;rnnoise&#x2F;</a>')
