I want to stop worrying how the game show host in chief is killing my countrymen today. I want to stop doomscrolling the news without it hurting my ability to survive. I want to live an existence where my greatest worries are will my flock and crop perform this year, and will I be a good parent, spouse, and neighbor. Period. Full stop. This world is so needlessly cruel, dehumanizing, and, irrational that I want out. My dreams of escaping to a mundane life on the land is what gets me out of bed each day and then stops me from making worse choices than demeaning myself for money.<p>If we hold peoples hands and show them just how utterly fucked they are then maybe we can finally have cogent discussions on how to solve the deep systemic problems that lead to inane situations like this, without it taking generations.')
