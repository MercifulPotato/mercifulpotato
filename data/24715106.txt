This is reflected in the 2019 Rust language survey, and it’s also reflected in the student frustration in the first few weeks of our weekly survey responses<p>&gt; While I think Rust would be poorly motivated in CS 107, I think it is extra poorly suited for CS 110.<p>I have essentially no experience with Rust, and I want to like it. But I get the feeling that it isn&#x27;t very user-friendly and that I would enjoy it much less than other memory safe languages like Swift, Go or Java or even sharper-edged languages like C++ with smart pointers or Objective-C with ARC.<p>Also given the large body of legacy C&#x2F;C++ code still in use and development, I&#x27;m disappointed that clang still doesn&#x27;t seem to support a memory-safe mode&#x2F;ABI, as it could eliminate a large class of errors.<p>Maybe Unix made a critical error by adopting and promoting unsafe C; its predecessor Multics, written in PL&#x2F;I, had essentially zero buffer, heap, or stack overflows over its entire lifetime (though it probably still had race conditions and concurrency errors.) ;-)')
