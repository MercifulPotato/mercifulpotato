Very much as you describe. I&#x27;d like to know more about it, honestly, but he&#x27;s very much the kind of guy for whom work is just work and not interesting to talk about after hours. In his early fifties he is one of the youngest at his job - and despite having been at one company his whole career, he&#x27;s one of the least longest-serving. We don&#x27;t talk money, his lifestyle doesn&#x27;t seem lavish but maintaining a single-income family in a high cost of living area is a lifestyle not to be sniffed at.')
