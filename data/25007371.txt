Ideally, though, you should have a working familiarity with both languages.<p>Isn&#x27;t this pretty difficult with Rust, considering the complexity, different paradigms and the fact that the language is still evolving? I could be wrong but Rust doesn&#x27;t seem like a part-time every-once-in-a-while kind of language.')
