Democrats picked someone more popular than Trump in 2016 and lost. Biden&#x27;s home state is the swing state of Pennsylvania. Home state advantage is generally fairly minor, but in this case the margins are so close that it might have actually made the difference (obviously we&#x27;ll have to wait for the final count, which we won&#x27;t have for days).')
