My app is on the major stores and literally zero downloads come from simple organic listing. It&#x27;s pretty clear we need to invest considerably in our own channels&#x2F;marketing.<p>In all fairness, though, while a Store listing doesn&#x27;t guarantee users, the absence of a Store listing <i>does</i> guarantee no users. Epic found this out with Fornite when they tried to get users to sideload via their own website. So a Store listing is a necessary-but-not-sufficient condition.<p>The user funnel seems to be awareness via non-Store marketing channels -&gt; search on Play&#x2F;App Store -&gt; install. Remove the second step and your funnel disintegrates.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s also possible that Fortnite&#x27;s Android woes were due to artificial hurdles (e.g. requiring users to first navigate menus to allow &quot;unsafe&quot; side-loading). I suspect they don&#x27;t have this difficulty on PC where it&#x27;s just a simple go to website-&gt;download-&gt;install.')
