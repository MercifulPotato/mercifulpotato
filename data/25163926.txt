Since overnight demand is small compared to daytime, only about half of the energy needs to be stored. That averages out to $60&#x2F;MWh, <i>today</i>.  In 5 years it will be something like $40-$50. In 10 years, when NuScale deploys, the cost of solar+storage will be $30-40&#x2F;MWh.  And it might even get cheaper.<p>NuScale may be useful for polar locations without much wind, but I don&#x27;t foresee them having a huge addressable market.')
