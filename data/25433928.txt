A free market is not just about individuals owning and trading property. A free market requires that <i>all trades are voluntary</i>. If people are forced, for example by law, to make trades they would not freely choose to make, you do not have a free market: forced trades are not voluntary. But if people are manipulated into making trades they would not freely choose to make if they knew the information the manipulator is hiding from them, those trades are not voluntary either.')
