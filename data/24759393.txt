It&#x27;s trivially simple to pass the test without the &quot;level of talent&quot; being targeted. It is just a matter of repetition. There are entire websites dedicated to beating this well known hiring step. Anyone can learn recursion and caching and work a bunch of leetcode &#x2F; hackerrank problems and get a job at a place who implements these interview practices. Whether it takes you 2 weeks to prep or 6 months to prep is not revealed to the interviewer.')
