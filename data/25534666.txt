This color space looks like it will suffer from the same problem.<p>If you try to shift hues, keeping a constant luminance causes a problem.  You can&#x27;t transform a bright blue to a bright yellow, because the luminance of blue is considered much lower than yellow.  The best you&#x27;ll get is a very dark brown.')
