I have a log of my location from my phone going back nearly 10 years, to the days of OpenPaths. Passive location tracking is a really great tool. I actually like Google&#x27;s implementation of it but I&#x27;d still rather control my own data and do my own thing (I have my own visualizer at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wanderin.gs" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wanderin.gs</a>). Mendhak&#x27;s GPS Logger is an excellent tool for that.')
