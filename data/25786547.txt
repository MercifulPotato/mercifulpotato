I say <i>some</i> because I’m unconvinced that Tor is quite ready to handle <i>all</i> traffic yet.<p>What is unreasonable is your focus on Apple.<p>By excluding the fact that your <i>complaints are a general problem with TCP&#x2F;IP</i> and apply to <i>essentially any service</i>, you don’t seem to be doing a great job of informing people about the reality of the problem.<p>It’s also worth noting that if your position has now moved to how the tracking could be being done by someone monitoring Apple’s network rather than Apple themselves, you are tacitly acknowledging that your claim that <i>Apple</i> is keeping records of your location are just speculation.')
