Item(by='an_opabinia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607101922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303608, text='Maybe the more precise words are, where do the economic gains the company is concentrating into the hands of ownership come from? Where do you draw the line for how much rent is too much?<p>Taxi drivers have always been undocumented and much poorer than the people they were driving. Uber didn’t change that, and nobody needs permission to boss a poor person around - go to a restaurant, send your kids to school, shop, you will be bossing poor people around. The remedy is immigration and labor law reform, that is something Uber actively worked against - and won! They care because the economic gain they are concentrating comes from people driving below minimum wage because they lack documents or work authorization.<p>It had nothing to do with lures or whatever, everyone knows what the deal was. Cars could require no maintenance and people would still be screwed. Uber shut down its self driving car unit and none of that shit mattered. Nobody is out there designing cars that are cheaper, we already have $1,000 used cars, in fact all the effort pours into cars that are way more expensive. Uber blew a lot of money on incentives as long as Lyft does and vice versa, and people just drive for both and none of that shit mattered.<p>The difference I’m trying to illuminate here is, a permanent subclass of undocumented worker is enshrined in the law. The difference between a W2 and 1099 employee is enshrined in the law. Uber spent a fortune maintaining the status quo, not creating a new one, they did not write those laws.<p>Personally, I believe, like those guys in the 2006 Borat movie who wish they owned slaves, that people like this status quo, and that Uber could have spent 1&#x2F;10th the money campaigning for Prop 22 and it still would have passed. People like cheap shit. They <i>enshrine</i> the divide in the law. Bernie Sanders was assailed by the NYTimes for his most divisive opinion, that if people are willing to work below minimum wage they will get the job, and that the government has <i>enshrined</i> that arrangement through immigration law - you’re just not seeing how deeply vested the average person is, not just Travis Kalanick is, in an exploitative status quo.<p>Meanwhile we type this all out on iPhones. Would you rather they cost 5x as much? I don’t know, if phones cost so much more, if you could ban the exploitation of Chinese labor for real, 50% of the ultra high paying jobs of HN readers would cease to exist overnight. It would be like a pandemic hit software, instead of just Main Street.<p>This shit is complicated, you can certainly point out that billionaires are bad people, but we all benefit from exploiting someone somewhere, and the road to justice will often visit the people who promote it. And maybe that’s why you and I aren’t out there protesting but those other people are.')
