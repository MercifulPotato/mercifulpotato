I wasn&#x27;t part of my then-wife&#x27;s gaming group in 2006, but there were more women in it than men. The best Call of Cthulhu keeper I&#x27;ve ever met is a woman, and she&#x27;d been running games for at least a decade by then. Dueling anecdotes, maybe, but I think if roleplaying ever was a &quot;no girls allowed&quot; club, that must&#x27;ve changed considerably earlier than the author gives it credit for. Or maybe, as with most things especially before the whole world had really melted into the Internet, there was much more local variation than the author was aware of.')
