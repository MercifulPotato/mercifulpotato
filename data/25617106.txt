Maybe it&#x27;s because I care primarily that the app works and the latest version is stable.  I&#x27;m generally not going in and considering upgrades to apps strategically, and even if I did I have no ability to see the previous changelogs let alone install those versions.  If for some reason I want to avoid an upgrade now I&#x27;m living on borrowed time and need to start thinking about a replacement or carefully curate my backups so as not to lose access.  Sure in a perfect world it would be nice to have perfect changelogs, but it&#x27;s so far down the list of things I want out my apps that I place zero value on it.')
