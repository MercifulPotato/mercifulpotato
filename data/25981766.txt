Does the license text have to be included in only the source code or the compiled software? What if the source code of the derived software isn&#x27;t made public? What is &quot;substantial portions&quot; of the software? Can a MIT project be relicensed? What is the point of any of these clauses then?<p>While it is a great license, I wish something closer to just public domain would have become the OSS default, since that is what 99% of developers want anyways.')
