My hope for Servo is that it becomes 100% Rust as much as sustainably possible (I understand for codecs and some things recreating them in Rust might be overkill when there&#x27;s standardized libraries just use them), even the JS engine.<p>Have you ever compiled and run servo?  I have.  It&#x27;s really cool but nowhere remotely close to being ready for a full production browser.<p>Mozilla are embracing Rust, they are just no longer interested in the idea of developing\nentire components of Firefox in a silo, maintaining both at once during the entire process, and then spending multiple years trying to integrate it back into the browser.<p>Back when the Servo team was let go, what they basically said is that moving forwards things will be done more piecemeal and in-place, rather than hundreds of thousands of LoC at a time.')
