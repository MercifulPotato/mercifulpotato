Just that it is provided by the central Govt itself - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digilocker.gov.in" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digilocker.gov.in</a>.<p>You can keep many Govt issued IDs in there and those are all good to be accepted and treated as valid across the country - for example DL and vehicle ownership docs when checked by cops. You can keep some non Govt IDs as well e.g. insurance docs.<p>I do have some privacy&#x2F;safety concerns but I&#x27;d trust my Govt (that issued most of these docs in the first place) more than a corporation who are known as a business with privacy invasion as their primary function - in fact almost anything they do revolves around this core idea.')
