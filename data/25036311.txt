Found the Solid FAQ link down thread. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solidproject.org&#x2F;faqs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solidproject.org&#x2F;faqs</a><p>After skimming, PODs sound a bit like IPFS. Intriguing? I&#x27;ll have to ponder.<p>It&#x27;ll take some effort to work thru some use cases, see how PODs could line up. There&#x27;s so many different types of care, each with its own gestalt (for lack of better term).<p>Just from memory: Clinic (visit-based, episodic, aka encounter), on going care (chronic conditions, kidneys, cancer), emergency care, ambulances and EMTs, continuity of care stuff (more like a journal or diary), delegation and consults, ad nauseam. This list is only meant to illustrate that interaction patterns for consent (grants &amp; revoke), access, and life spans are many and varied.<p>But just know ahead of time that I&#x27;m not optimistic that Solid &amp; PODs bring anything new or practical to the table.')
