All mentioned languages are Turing complete and thus equivalent on that level.<p>&gt; you can&#x27;t access raw memory.<p>I can wrap a file in a ByteBuffer in java and the JVM will (make a best effort to) perform native I&#x2F;O on that. Does that pass as &quot;access raw memory&quot;? If not, you&#x27;d have to explain how this is different from the abstract machine that C++ is defined on.<p>Sure, in Java you can&#x27;t escape the garbage collector, but in C++ you also formally invoke UB if you violate the object lifetime requirements (even though will generally work due to this part of the standard still being... work in progress, let&#x27;s say).')
