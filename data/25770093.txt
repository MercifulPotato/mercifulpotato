Glenn Greenwald a.k.a. &quot;the guy who helped Snowden get the word out&quot; and could be described as a disillusioned liberal, seems to have clearer principles and hence wrote a clearer article: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;how-silicon-valley-in-a-show-of-monopolistic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;how-silicon-valley-in-a-sho...</a> One of the takeaways that nobody&#x27;s really talking about is that Parler itself didn&#x27;t really deserve this. If a bunch of Nazis walk over and stand near me, am I suddenly a Nazi? It&#x27;s guilt by association, and if we&#x27;re going with that... if we&#x27;re going to, in the secret little court in each of our minds, &quot;hold Parler liable for its moderation decisions&quot; despite the fact that Section 230 won&#x27;t allow that in a real court, then every outlet that has given Trump a voice for the past 4-5 years is just as guilty, starting with network news shows in 2016 putting his phone calls &quot;from the campaign trail&quot; on the air, knowing his wisecracks would draw more viewers. The profit motive accounts for 4 years of your never being able to escape Trump. And I believe the change of administrations (i.e. kissing up to the new one), not the Capitol thing, accounts for the sudden and belated change of heart. It&#x27;s not Hanlon&#x27;s razor but yeah never assume &quot;ideology&quot; as an explanation where &quot;greed&quot; will suffice.')
