All the info that&#x27;s out there says that immunity to C19 is temporary, so a vaccine after having gone through it doesn&#x27;t seem redundant.<p>Does anyone know if there&#x27;s been any research on effects of the vaccine on the people who got C19 and recovered? I&#x27;m especially worried about possibility of a cytokine storm possibility as a reaction to vaccine.')
