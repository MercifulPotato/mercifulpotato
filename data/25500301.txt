Company went public that same year, and stock climbed to over $50&#x2F;share.  I was a black box QA Engineer w&#x2F; barely any work experience and I was sitting on ~$750_000 USD of paper money.  By the time I started vesting &amp; could sell, the stock price was down to about $12&#x2F;share, and I started selling everything I had vested.  I ended up w&#x2F; maybe $25K in cash.  A few months later the stock was at $2&#x2F;share &amp; it never back above my stock price.<p>A few years later I joined a company that gave me about 15_000 options at $7&#x2F;share.  Less than a later, the stock was over $55&#x2F;share.  I made pretty good money on that one.')
