They might not get that much done, but they are still net positive :). And of course they improve if you can hold them for a longer time.<p>People really hard to work with on the other hand are a tough nut and can hold back projects. I think this is often bad hiring. At least a company I worked for hired because they couldn&#x27;t find anyone better (for the budget) and it turned out to be a big mistake.<p>Either way, you have to live and calculate with what you have.<p>If you do product work however I don&#x27;t see why deadlines are all that important and would rather focus on the small, most impactful next iteration.')
