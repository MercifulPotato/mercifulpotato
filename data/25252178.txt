I think black and white is never a good rule, so although I would side on the conflict-theory perspective it would be very naive of me to claim that incorrect analysis doesn&#x27;t ever contribute to dissinformation. Same goes with many of the points in the article that the author assigns to &quot;mistake-theorists&quot; but I can see myself subscribing to these.<p>With those in mind, I&#x27;d say that although not the sole cause of dissinformation, conflict of interests is the most important and impactful factor.')
