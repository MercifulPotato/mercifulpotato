So it works like a charm for relatively small fragments of structured data like e.g. HTML pages, XML-docs or SQL statements: lots of &quot;SELECT * FROM&quot; fragments that can be replaced by a single token. I suspect it works even better for this kind of data than for natural language data, which tends to be skewed in a Zipf-like way.')
