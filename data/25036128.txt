Also in Europe selling seeds of non approved varietals is not possible. Legislation is changing slowly, but a lot of diversity is lost forever.<p>What you can see a lot on current market are &quot;heirloom&quot; varietals made by entrepreneurs that take industrial variatel, cross them to create new completely new varietals. But just because something doesn&#x27;t look like modern tomato it doesn&#x27;t mean it taste good.<p>You can still find old varietals in seed banks and around seed savers, but hip breeders are much more noisy in the market. I am not saying those new breeds are worthless, but they are kinda hit and miss and I would not consider them heirloom.')
