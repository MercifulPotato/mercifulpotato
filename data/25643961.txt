Ultimately, people are what matters. You know who can&#x27;t exercise free speech and assembly? Dead people. Why is a 6 month hard lockdown worse than letting people keep walking around for 6 months? This sounds like a moral, absolutist statement you&#x27;re making; like life is an art project, and the aim is to exercise some particular set of principles.<p>(Free speech? What&#x27;s the threat to free speech here? Is it the people spreading bullshit and conspiracy about Covid that&#x27;s getting people killed?)')
