If we followed the logic to the root cause here, we&#x27;d get to the problem. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much Apple limiting supply in their app store. Stores have the ability to limit what inventory they shelve.<p>However, this is only an issue because there is only one app store allowed on the iPhone that is controlled by Apple.<p>That&#x27;s the rule-based point of contention that won&#x27;t cause collateral damage to other retailers who don&#x27;t have a similar singular point of control.')
