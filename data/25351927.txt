Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[25352495, 25352788], score=None, time=1607464657, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25351635, text='&gt; There are many things that doctors do not recommend because they don&#x27;t believe the average person can use it correctly.<p>&gt; ...She told me that they don&#x27;t usually prescribe that one because they don&#x27;t trust the parents of their patients to correctly administer one drug only twice per day (A) when giving the other drug (C) 3 times (they are worried about overdoses of the twice daily medication A).<p>I wonder if they&#x27;re not even worrying about &quot;the average person&quot;, but a kind of &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; person.  Depending on how severe an &quot;overdose&quot; is, that might be totally the right call.  Even if only 1 in 100 patients would mess up and OD, prescribing the less-effective combination would actually end up helping a lot of patients.<p>IMHO, software engineers also end up infantilizing their users with similar &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; thinking, but usually with less justification.')
