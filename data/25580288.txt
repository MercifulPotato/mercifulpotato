I would call it &quot;a brick&quot;.<p>&gt; My wife’s iPhone 6 from 2014 just got a patch in November.<p>But the new OS is not going to be installed anymore (according to the link above). Any technical reasons for that, apart from the planned obsolescence?<p>&gt; Look, I’m not going to assume bad faith, maybe you really believe this or thought it seemed true to you. When your preconceptions turn out to be this dramatically contrary to the actual facts, I seriously suggest you take a look at what it is about those preconceptions that is leading you so far away from reality.<p>Thank you, I am also assuming good faith and so could you please provide evidence for your claims? For how long do security updates typically come and for how long the OS is updated to new versions? Anecdotes are not enough on HN.<p>&gt; industry leading device support and lifetimes<p>In the industry of planned obsolescence 5 years support becomes a gold standard praised by fanboys. But in reality it is very short and leads to nature pollution. I see no reason not to support devices forever or let the community support them when they are too old. Apple does neither of those.<p>&gt; things that are so clearly wrong and we easily disproved?<p>Your words are very strong yet you give no (reliable) disprove.')
