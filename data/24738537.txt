However it&#x27;s not used for redistribution of compiled artifacts, that&#x27;s still JARs. Instead a jimage file is created when JARs are &quot;jlinked&quot; into a runtime image.<p>This requires modules and it&#x27;s a new technique that post-dates Java 8, so not many Java shops use it yet. However Java 9+ comes optimised this way by default, that&#x27;s what the &#x27;modules&#x27; file is in the JDK lib directory. Class files have their strings extracted and placed into a single string table are compressed, and their offsets then placed into a &quot;perfect hash table&quot; that&#x27;s guaranteed to satisfy lookups in O(1) or O(2) time.')
