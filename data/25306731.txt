Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607110841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25304533, text='I&#x27;ve been online for a lot 9f years and a great many people over the years have thanked me for participating in various forums, writing things of substance, etc.<p>The problem is everyone loves getting freebies from me and no one thinks I deserve an adequate income for what value I provide.<p>Everyone says you need to <i>add value</i> here and many people say that&#x27;s what I do, but almost no one is willing to pay me, promote me, treat me like someone whose work deserves to result in an adequate income.<p>I cannot successfully network because I&#x27;m a woman. Men mostly email me to hit on me. After more than 11 years, I have exactly one sort of friend through Hacker News.<p>No amount of good faith effort on my part ever resolves any of this.<p>I think in all those years, maybe three or four times someone other than me has posted something of mine. My articles hit the front page somewhat regularly, but my Patreon gets less than $200&#x2F;month.<p>I need a better income. I don&#x27;t need emotional support or reassurance that people enjoy it when I give away what I know for free via forum comments. I already know people love getting freebies from me and then enjoy spitting in my face when I complain that I have inadequate income, that being on Hacker News is doing nothing to help me make business connections, etc.<p>When I say it looks like it&#x27;s rooted in my gender, I get a ration of shit about how it&#x27;s not.<p>No amount of rebutting BS arguments of that sort really moves the needle on my financial problems.<p>I don&#x27;t know what to do to fix that. It seems utterly impossible. I feel I do a lot for other people. No one does much for me.<p>I wish I could figure out how to leave HN. I feel like HN is a parasite feeding on me and treating me abusively and the problem is other places are mostly vastly worse, which leaves me with no apparent solution.<p>I don&#x27;t need pats on the head. I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of that in twenty years on the internet. What I can&#x27;t manage to get is an adequate income and a large part of the reason for that appears to be sexism and misogyny.<p>No amount of being nice about it fixes it. It just seems to make other people feel okay about crapping on me.')
