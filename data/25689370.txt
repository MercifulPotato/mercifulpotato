It&#x27;s that you talk while having some button being pushed down e.g MOUSE SCROLL (MOUSE3) (for me it&#x27;s probably one of the most practical choices)<p>so in this case you&#x27;re always muted unless you want to talk<p>Why it&#x27;s so great? because you can e.g play game, write code, do stuff on your PC and when you want to mute yourself, then you don&#x27;t have to try to find some shortcuts or even worse - put video-co app on focus and click mute button, but instead you just stop pressing your PUSH2TALK hotkey! :P')
