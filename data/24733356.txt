Ads are paid for my the click.  Some people never click on ads.  The kinds of people who are likely to consider running an ad blocker are the same type who never click on ads regardless if they have ads or not.<p>The ideal situation is never advertising ad blockers, never bragging about them, never making a big deal about them, and keeping some mild barrier of entry.  This way the average person who has less of a concern about ads will not run an ad blocker, and meanwhile the one who never makes money for the company to begin with doesn&#x27;t have to deal with it.')
