If I&#x27;m getting an email from Notion, I want it to show up as &quot;From: Notion&quot; in my inbox, not &quot;From: Ivan&quot;. I have several companies that do this and I never know who the email is from, which adds some cognitive friction I don&#x27;t need when triaging my inbox. You can put your name in the subject line if you want.')
