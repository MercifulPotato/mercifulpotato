Past performance is not indicative of future results. Nowadays, especially the articles from there posted on HN are very much in the territory of tabloid journalism.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;m glad to see I&#x27;m not alone in this thinking, although my introductory sentence to this might be seen as too harsh by some. I see no value in having their articles on HN what-so-ever.')
