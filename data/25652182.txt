Only in last 4 years graphics stack feature and performance parity thanks to Intel, AMD and Valve.<p>Today LLVM is well-developed for GPU drivers and there is tons of other ready-to-use code for OpenGL and Vulkan implementation. E.g RADV was initially created by two developers only and now it is better than AMD official Vulkan implementation.<p>On top of this modern GPUs are now less complex to develop drivers because they&#x27;e decoupled from display controllers and hardware no longer have fixed pipelines.')
