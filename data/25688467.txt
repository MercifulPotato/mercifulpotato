The guy is done. He&#x27;s still massively popular and a threat given his popularity amongst pretty fanatical groups of people, but as far as raw, democratic power he lost his election by a pretty decent margin, and lost the House&#x2F;Senate for Republicans.<p>A lot of people who sucked up to him and his rhetoric must be realizing it&#x27;s time to suck up to someone&#x2F;something else. He&#x27;s always attracted an uncomfortable amount of media attention and now that he can&#x27;t attract political power to remain in office he&#x27;s a liability rather than an asset.')
