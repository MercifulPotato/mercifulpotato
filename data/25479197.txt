Despite a second lockdown, cases in London started increasing again, and areas in &#x27;Tier 3&#x27; (highest tier restrictions) also started increasing cases post-lockdown.  This was despite other areas continuing to drop cases despite having the same measures.  Apparently the areas that had started rising were correlated with percentage prevalence of this new strain, which at the moment is known to be present in the UK, but might have come from abroad, or travelled already.<p>As a result of this, I can see the vaccination programme getting a huge rocket, as it looks like lockdown and highest restrictions aren&#x27;t decreasing cases - which is potentially disastrous for containing the virus, and stopping the hospitals get overwhelmed at a time when they normally operate at full capacity.<p>Christmas relaxation rules have been cancelled in the UK, which has caused much disappointment to my family and friends.  Understandable, but no less disappointing.')
