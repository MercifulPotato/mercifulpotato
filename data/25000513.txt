Item(by='pgustafs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604600139, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24999837, text='1) A node _could_ run arbitrary code, but unless it trusts the code&#x27;s provenance then it should use a white-list as you mention.<p>&gt; why not just settle on a fixed-but-extensible list of hashing algorithms that are known to work well today?&quot;<p>Sure, that&#x27;s what a whitelist will be, but with one major difference:  each node gets to pick its own whitelist, there&#x27;s no built-in centralization via the &quot;one true source code.&quot;<p>2)  Yes, miners will choose hashing algorithms that are easy for themselves and hard for others, but the nodes get to value each block from their own perspective.  If they think a miner is using a weird hash function, they can penalize it or just blacklist the function.')
