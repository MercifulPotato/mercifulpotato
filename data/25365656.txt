Similar to a recreational dose, or much smaller? If it was much smaller, i could imagine people not really being able to tell.<p>EDIT: The paper [1] says there are two MDMA &#x27;sessions&#x27;, about three weeks apart, and:<p>&gt; Each partner was given 75 mg MDMA in the first MDMA session, and 100 mg in the second MDMA session, with an optional supplemental half-dose 1.5 hours later in both sessions (participants were informed that the supplemental half-doses could prolong the therapeutic window of MDMA effects).<p>I am told that a typical recreational dose of MDMA is 100 mg. More concretely, an Orange Tesla is ~250 mg, so make of that what you will.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;20008198.2020.1840123" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;20008198.2020.1...</a>')
