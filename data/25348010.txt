Some things that come to mind in no order:<p>* Food - an incredible an ever-changing restaurant scene, from cheesesteaks to 10-course tasting menus. And all much more affordable than fine dining in most US cities, plus free BYOB is extremely common.\n * Music &#x2F; Sports - incredible music scene with major and minor venues of all kinds, and a professional sports team in all 4 major leagues with a passionate fanbase.\n * Size - neither a very large city (NYC) nor a very small city (Boston). Easy to get around, narrow streets make it very walkable.\n * Attitude - Philly people are just different. I&#x27;d describe it as a &quot;warm hostility&quot; :) but you&#x27;ll find Philadelphians are very welcoming while also being brutally honest.\n  * Diversity - there is no racial majority in Philly. It&#x27;s about 40% white, 40% black, and 20% other.\n  * Price - Philly is cheap!')
