Maybe the US has more wealth concentration at the top than China, but it&#x27;s clear that both countries experience this problem&#x2F;symptom to an extraordinary degree. It&#x27;s also clear there are tons of self-made multimillionaires and billionaires in the US, including probably a surprising number right on this very forum (well, maybe not billionaires so much). You&#x27;re trying to make it seem as if the US is <i>dramatically</i> more unequal than China and that every wealthy or powerful person in the US inherited everything but this is far from obvious and probably false.<p>&gt; The difference between the US and China is that we put this &quot;raw power&quot; in the hands of private enterprise and management, whereas in China they sequester a lot of that talent into the party and sometimes loan it out to private industry.<p>On this point I do completely agree with you.')
