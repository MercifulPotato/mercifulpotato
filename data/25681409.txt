While surrounded.<p>The lies coming out of the media (which normally lie he took the selfie with the protesters) at the moment are insane.<p>Sure, &quot;Trump deliberately attempted a coup&quot;.... because he&#x27;s mentally ill.<p>But the media is actually pulling off a real coup by consistently implying it was even close to happening. Feeding &quot;Multiple European security officials&quot; who feed them back.<p>How did the &quot;5 people dead&quot; reported from the media actually die out of interest? We know one, filmed from many angles, all the rest? These ongoing media lies are outrageous.')
