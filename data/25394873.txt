They most likely could find a monitor that would have looked fine.  Its hard to say what they actually did just from what you see in the film.<p>Filming monitors and TVs was and is a very common thing.  You can probably get away with filming a 30 fps monitor if your shutter speed is tight enough and you&#x27;re ok with a few pulldown frames sneaking in.<p>&gt;Remember that when film plays back the projector shows you the same image for most of the 1&#x2F;24 of the time before switching to the next frame<p>Is this true?  Isn&#x27;t it 50&#x2F;50 or so?  Take a look at a rotary disk shutter.  Film is pretty delicate and you can&#x27;t pull it through that fast.')
