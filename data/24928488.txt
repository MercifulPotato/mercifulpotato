Item(by='BossingAround', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603961791, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24928353, text='&gt; In my HN browsing I find Java is rarely actually discussed here, though often dismissed. I don&#x27;t know why.<p>Personally, I feel like Java is not really as hated as some people make it out to be. It&#x27;s a stable language that very few people choose for their &quot;cool side project&quot;. At the same time, it has excellent tooling, mature and prod-ready open source frameworks, and backing of some giant companies.<p>This is not to say that Java is perfect. I think most dissatisfaction comes from students or junior people who are baffled by the complexity of Maven&#x2F;Gradle configurations, strict project structure (where a class can be 10 directories deep), and Java&#x27;s insistence on boilerplate (which is often challenged by new Java releases. Those, however, are quite rare in production; I&#x27;m starting to see Java 11 here and there but the majority of projects I&#x27;ve seen run 1.8).')
