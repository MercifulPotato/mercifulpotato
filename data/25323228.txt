On some platforms the kernel provides no backwards compatibility guarantees and that means backwards compatibility is handled by libc. This means C is enshrined into the platform and often the path of least resistance.<p>There was also a pure Rust Wayland binding that failed because Wayland assumes that you are using C semantics which made it hard to provide a safe interface for Rust that was also convenient.')
