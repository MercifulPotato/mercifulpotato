Jail is where you go after being charged, but before conviction, or if you&#x27;re convicted of a misdemeanor (less than 1 year sentence).<p>Unfortunately, there is an incentive for local prosecutors to convict people of offences with sentences longer than a year, so as to have them moved to state prisons, but that&#x27;s a somewhat separate issue.')
