Mailed ballots cannot be secured from tampering, since they cannot be observed. I voted remotely this selection, and I have no way to verify my ballot was counted correctly by my county registrar, or even received.<p>Another minor problem cryptographic electronic voting solves is inaccurate vote counts.<p>If we allow vote-by-mail we should allow cryptographic voting over the Internet. I agree in-person voting is the most secure, but we already use a less secure system.')
