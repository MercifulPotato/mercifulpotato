You have to take exchange rate when calculating PPP. Which is what I have been trying to explain to you. You are completely skipping exchange rate, which is why you are getting an inflated figure of 1.91$ per GB.<p>You should be calculating it this way:<p>Exchange rate: 73.17 INR = 1 USD\nNow 9 cents is, 0.09 USD = 0.09 * 73.17 = 6.58 INR.<p>Since PPP is 21.3,\n6.58 INR would be 6.58 &#x2F; 21.3 = 0.3 USD<p>So 9 cents in India is equal to 30 cents in USA. Now, that is 30 cents per GB and not 1.91$ per GB.<p>Remember that PPP is INR&#x2F;USD and not USD&#x2F;USD.')
