In theory, spaced repetition would allow you to keep that knowledge from getting stale.<p>I think you&#x27;ll find you learn new things quicker with judicious use of spaced repetition. As a bonus, you&#x27;ll never forget those things as long as you maintain the habit. And we&#x27;re all always learning, so that shouldn&#x27;t be hard.<p>I do think the hardest part of spaced repetition use outside of the classroom is choosing what to memorize. In school, those decisions are made for you. I find it easy to bite off too much and start memorizing minutiae of a technology instead of the essential items. But I think it&#x27;s just another skill to master.')
