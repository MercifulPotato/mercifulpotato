Item(by='switch11', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602045975, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24705058, text='Here are the problems<p>A) Google pushing its own services over better services owned by others<p>Example: Yelp was the best reviews service for quite a while<p>Google was stealing their data and putting Google Reviews first in results<p>This was an obvious negative for customers as instead of getting more reviews and better reviews at Yelp they were getting lower reviews and lower quality reviews at Google Reviews<p>B) Google doing secret investments (such as in RetailMeNot) and sending customers to RetailMe Not instead of other discount sites by putting RetailMeNot #1 in every search result<p>3 to 4 years later REtailMe Not was sold and only then did it become public knowledge that Google Ventures had invested in it<p>Google was not looking at who had the best deals for each retailer and putting that first. It was putting the company it had a personal stake in, first<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>*<p>C) Companies that were growing very fast, such as Vroom and were considered dangerous<p>Google was inundating search results with negative reviews and negative posts about such companies<p>This was inaccurate and misleading. That particular company ended up IPO&#x27;ing<p>However many other that were offering customers a great deal&#x2F;better service got hurt by Google search engine manipulations and were not able to survive<p>D) Google miscategorizing and manipulating results for potential competitors<p>This is the law suit and the European fine that Google got<p>There were companies like Findem that had to close down because Google &#x27;disappeared&#x27; them from search, as they were potential competitors<p>So instead of what is best for customers - multiple search engine options - Google was hiding what it considered dangerous competitors<p>E) Pushing Chrome and taking market share and building a second monopoly (in browsers)<p>Microsoft had an anti trust law suit and was almost broken up for pushing IE using Windows<p>Google is doing EXACTLY the same thing<p>Google Search\nGoogle Docs\nall google properties are constantly pushing Google Chrome<p>not based on any criteria other than Google owns Chrome and sets Google Search as default browser on Chrome<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><p>Basically, the list is super long<p>Google is using the defence that users pay nothing<p>HOWEVER, it is taking user data and monetizing it and another company can share that monetized money with users OR can provide a better service<p>We don&#x27;t see it clearly because it is being done in almost every area<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>*<p>any promising company that might do well, is attacked or hidden<p>In China we have lots of new companies come up<p>However, no such rise in US<p>US look at companies going  IPO. It is almost all Enterprise<p>Why?<p>Because Google, Amazon, Facebook are doing a very effective job of stifling innovation and killing off any fast rising company via various illegal means<p>If not for the Apple App Store we would see even fewer customer side&#x2F;consumer side startups<p>Google is using control of Google Search, Android, and Chrome to keep out ANY company that competes in any way with Google (and google does lots of things)<p>Amazon is using control of marketplace to make sure no 3rd party sellers can become very big<p>Facebook is using its monopoly in social media and understanding of what is growing fast to buy up anything that it considers dangerous, and limit those that might become dangerous<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><p>These are all well documented<p>Your questions are postured like Big Tech talking points<p>This claim is downright laughable -&gt; the quality of the service is impeccable<p>For many Google properties there are much better options<p>We can see many things such as Google+ closing down<p>However, other very good upcoming products are never given a fair chance<p>We should completely remove &#x27;advertiser&#x27; angle. That&#x27;s a false direction<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><p>The right direction is<p>What is best for customers?<p>Is Google interfering with that?<p>If so, then it is abuse of their monopoly position<p>As simple as that<p>Just because you offer a free service, does not mean you can do anything illegal you want and claim &#x27;customer is not paying anything&#x27; so it is not an abuse of monopoly power<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><p>Basically what Google is doing, or trying to do<p>-&gt; Screw over EVERYONE who is on the customer facing side<p>If you run ANY company that is growing fast and adding lots of customers, then Google wants to stop your growth&#x2F;kill you<p>because they consider every fast growing customer&#x2F;consumer side company a threat<p>-&gt; Most startups don&#x27;t realize this fully. The large tech companies are attacking EVERYONE with a divide and conquer \nstrategy<p>They know that tech is very fluid and things can change very quickly<p>So they basically have a list of 1,000 to 10,000 consumer-facing companies they consider dangerous (possible rivals)<p>and they are manipulating search results, hiding organic traffic, and doing other attacks against ALL of these companies<p>When it becomes too big, or too late, then you see things like the Attacks against Tik Tok')
