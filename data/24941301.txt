Blazor&#x27;s performance in upcoming .NET 5 is reported to be already 2-3x better than in .NET 3. I expect that ongoing work on ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to WebAssembly, including an ability to freely mix AOT- and JIT-compiled code (expected to be shipped as part of .NET 6) will further improve Blazor&#x27;s competitive position vs. Rust&#x27;s WebAssembly from the performance perspective.')
