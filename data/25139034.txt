What&#x27;s published is only if the vaccines prevent the occurrence of the <i>illness</i> (as in &quot;did somebody have symptoms&quot;).  Also: &quot;Animal challenge data suggest that vaccinated animals may still be infected even if they don&#x27;t experience symptoms.&quot; For more details (including the whole article from which is that citation) see my other comments here.')
