Have even emailed the address provided with feedback as I work for a University which like many use a mix of RHEL and CentOS.<p>As per the FAQ though I suspect there is more to this than meets the eye. Two things strike me: 1. The suggestion that low or no cost options for RHEL are coming for certain categories of user. 2. As much as Stream will be a rolling and &quot;beta&quot; channel, Fedora&#x2F;CentOS&#x2F;RHEL already have testing repos within their release process so Stream may not be as unstable as this might first suggest.<p>With local staged repository mirrors Steam may end up being less volatile than the existing point releases which were notorious for breaking things at times.')
