If you&#x27;re not connected, it fails.<p>Works really well with Mullvad which has a SOCKS proxy setup only available when connected.<p>Great for work connections too, I&#x27;ve setup all work&#x2F;business websites to auto-open in a &quot;work&quot; container which I&#x27;ve created a local bridge proxy for to ensure my work connections are always over the corporate VPN.<p>This is also really good if you consult or work with many customers - you can start to build a catalogue of containers with specific settings for those customers.<p>Container Proxy addon:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;container-proxy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;container-pro...</a>')
