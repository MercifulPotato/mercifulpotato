I was in Europe this past year, and hopped around from city center to city center on 200km&#x2F;h Trains. It was great.<p>I remember driving through Chicago as being frustrating too. I was going though the city maybe more than 10 years ago. It was actually super scary. Lots of construction on the highways. Lanes blocked off. And I remember a few times where I had to go from almost a stopped position, across a few lanes of full speed traffic, to get to an exit or a booth.')
