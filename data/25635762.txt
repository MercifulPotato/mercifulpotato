Very briefly: railroads, oil&#x2F;telecom companies, car&#x2F;retail companies then WW2 then govt begins to try and pull management from companies into the military.<p>This is the military-industrial complex of Eisenhower. Companies were integrated into the military during WW2, and their influence was maintained after: management practices from companies into the military. Kennedy&#x27;s govt was full of people from business making foreign policy&#x2F;military decisions (with unfortunate consequences). Again, it is difficult to understate how far ahead the US was with management training so it is natural that this innovation spread into the military.')
