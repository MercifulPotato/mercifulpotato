Incredible how I&#x27;ve used mine for 7 years and it seems new still. Only issue is 8 gigs of ram makes things like docker or ides difficult, but I get hesitant to buy a replacement because of the year to year changes. I mean, why buy a new one if you have a machine that&#x27;s been going strong for so long?')
