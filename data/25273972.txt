Obviously because they get paid in grants, but... are there any other reasons that actually benefit the company itself instead of the shareholders?<p>Board executives represent the interests of the shareholders, not the company. The shareholders literally own the company, and can call a vote to replace the board members. Hell, if the shareholders think it is more valuable to liquidate the company and cash out, they can do it.')
