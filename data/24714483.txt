Item(by='mehrdadn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602117781, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24713432, text='&gt; then given infinite time even the infinitesimal chance of spontaneous order will have it&#x27;s moment.<p>Does this hold true for a 1&#x2F;infinity chance event?<p>Or (not sure if this is analogous) if you choose infinitely many real numbers ~ unif(0, 1), is it guaranteed you will hit every number in that interval at least once? I&#x27;m not even sure the question is well-defined to be honest (at least not without making assumptions about infinities that we have no way to show hold true for this universe), but if it is, is the answer yes? It&#x27;s not obvious to me.')
