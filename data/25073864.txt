I&#x27;m not sure about Safari (since I don&#x27;t use a Mac) but on Firefox you can set up tab discarding (via extension) that unloads unused tabs. So there&#x27;s a lot less incentive to use bookmarks when you can just leave a tab open forever. Really the only reason to use bookmarks instead of tabs is for synchronization across devices.')
