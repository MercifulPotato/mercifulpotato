What they really see is Excel vs. some contractor doing &quot;a system&quot;.<p>The reality is that Excel is available today and works, and scales up... well, until it doesn&#x27;t. Still, you have data entry that everybody in the field understands, that&#x27;s rock solid (so no need to unit test anything), and has a tried and true authentication module built in (a file sent from a government mail address). There&#x27;s a risk of user errors, but the system will be working immediately[0]. Deployment can be done by anyone, as it&#x27;s just clicking on File-&gt;New and starting to type data in.<p>Meanwhile, a &quot;pigsqueal&quot; solution will take half a year to design, produce and deploy (that&#x27;s in an emergency, a year otherwise). And that&#x27;s with competent IT people, and not someone who wants to profiteer off the crisis. Then you&#x27;ll have to train the users, and hope the reality won&#x27;t necessitate any changes, because they will take a while.<p>I think plenty of decent coders appreciate the fact that Excel is suitable for a surprisingly wide range of tasks, and that if you spot it widely used somewhere, it most likely means there isn&#x27;t any comparable alternative available.<p>--<p>[0] - Note that the user error that finally happened did not happen in the place where you&#x27;d expect it to.')
