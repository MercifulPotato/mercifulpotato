Git doesn&#x27;t manage the database, so when the files make it to production and the plugins are activated, they see a database they haven&#x27;t been installed in and then correctly run their hooks. Same for migrations. Migrations are managed with database entries, so if your production database doesn&#x27;t have those entries, it will still run the migrations.<p>You can check out WP CLI to automate some of this as well.')
