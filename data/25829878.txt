Item(by='morelandjs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611029115, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25825244, text='My issue with effort estimates is that it is taboo to report estimates with uncertainty (think how silly that sounds). I&#x27;ll often give a low-end &#x2F; high-end and the person asking for the estimate will tell me they want a single number. If you did this in physics you would get laughed and for good reason. It&#x27;s bad science, and it&#x27;s bad forecasting.<p>You should never claim better precision than you know. It&#x27;s often more accurate to say &quot;more than an hour but less than a week&quot; than to say &quot;6 hours&quot;. We learn scientific precision in middle school... why is modern workflow management still so bad at uncertainty propagation?')
