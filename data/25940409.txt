Just as in my December Inspiron 7506 - I got suspicious when, after putting to sleep, the fan would randomly turn on for a short time, and the laptop would stay warm. After some digging it turned out S3 is not available at all (i.e., under Fedora <i>cat &#x2F;sys&#x2F;power&#x2F;mem_sleep</i> returns only <i>[s2idle]</i>, and not <i>deep</i>.)<p>There are justifications floating around such as &quot;certain devices&#x2F;Windows drivers don&#x27;t handle wake-up properly&quot; or &quot;CPU idle states are not re-enabled on wake-up&quot;, but still, I would like to have the option of deep sleep mode and just deal with any HW problems at my own risk. The &quot;always connected&quot; sleep functionality is of no importance&#x2F;use to me at all.<p>Too bad, as I really like the build &amp; screen quality on this model, and I guess I&#x27;ll just get used to turning it off (which is not terrible, booting up takes only a few seconds.)')
