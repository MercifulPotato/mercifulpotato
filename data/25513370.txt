Disciplined adults can maybe resist control; kids are super malleable and we leave them to faceless algorithms that tune themselves to the basest versions of our nature (a &quot;base&quot; we&#x27;ve probably spent our entire existence attempting to rise above).<p>The internet (maybe best framed as instantaneous &quot;world connectivity&quot;) might not be inherently bad, but &quot;consumer tech&quot; leans towards exploiting &#x2F; re-centering our &quot;nature&quot; + breaking down taboos in exchange for the &quot;new market&quot; that always emerges as a result. “Make something people want” (even if there may have been good reason for that want to go un-served).<p>I imagine this playing out on the level of individual adaptations &#x2F; boundaries – from building personal discipline (hard) to just having enough of a life to be offline more than online – rather than any macro improvement. New tech (eg. Urbit) might do it, but I think it requires both utopian and revolutionary (tear-the-whole-thing-down) thinking, both of which are vastly more likely to (catastrophically) fail than succeed.<p>All that pessimism aside though: anyone can still choose to personally resist that pull instead of accepting it as inevitable, as challenging as it might be for some. And maybe you&#x27;re perfectly fine (maybe even better than you&#x27;d have been otherwise) in that regime anyway, who knows?')
