Folks like Let&#x27;s Encrypt are unable to get a foothold[2], with so many decaying unmaintainable operating systems out there. Chrome &amp; every other app doing 3rd party HTTPS have to start creating their own root certificate stores that they can maintain, since the dead operating system on such a vast % of devices will not. Tragic situation, in my opinion, and with so few unlockable phones, buyers have limited ability to maintain or repair their own devices.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chromium.org&#x2F;Home&#x2F;chromium-security&#x2F;root-ca-policy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chromium.org&#x2F;Home&#x2F;chromium-security&#x2F;root-ca-poli...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letsencrypt.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;own-two-feet.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letsencrypt.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;own-two-feet.html</a>')
