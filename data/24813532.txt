I paid for the default &quot;basic warranty.&quot; This week my fans started wobbling, causing lots of noise. I called Dell, told them I was using Linux, then they immediately offered to send someone in-person (with pandemic safety precautions) to fix it. And they did. It took 15 minutes for my fan to be replaced once they arrived. The person was very helpful, and they improved my boot time, too, by setting the clock in my BIOS.')
