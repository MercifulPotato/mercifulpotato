They are isomorphic duals.  But ergonomics are important to prevent errors. I personally think Matrix-in-front is nice because it evokes the idea that the matrix is a function acting on the vector.<p>In the real world, When you start doing matrix-vector, if you aren&#x27;t careful with row-major vs column-major <i>storage</i> you can introduce performance regressions.  Let&#x27;s say the architecture can do 256 bit memory move into 4xf64 mmx registers, you have to think carefully about what is going where before proceeding.  Some architectures might be able to do an arbitrary stride so that those f64s can be nonadjacent in a simultaneous move.  I suspect not handling this correctly is part of what holds back really good fp8, fp16 performance, and I suspect for example the TPUs struggle with this.<p>Of course optimizing for matrix-vector can be different for optimizing for matrix-matrix, since the column vs row memory access preference for the front matrix is exactly the opposite of the back matrix.')
