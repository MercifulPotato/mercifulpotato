It&#x27;s not merchant fees or inconvenience. E-wallet apps are very common in Asia and they let you load an amount once and pay multiple smaller amounts. They even auto reload.<p>They&#x27;re, at least for the time being, cheaper then using any other payment gateway and are even free most of the time.<p>They&#x27;re also in fact quicker and more convenient than using a credit card because your phone is more likely to be at hand and the transaction often involves just scanning a QR code and tapping confirm.<p>They&#x27;re a very viable way to do microtransactions.<p>2. Culture<p>Microtransactions have been around for a long time in Asia so have good adoption rates. This was the result of having to pay transaction fees in USD but having a currency that&#x27;s a lot weaker. Think having to pay $1 for lunch and the transaction fee being $0.50.<p>In the west, not so much. People aren&#x27;t used to doing that because companies prefer a steady income from recurring subscriptions and the cost of transactions are proportional. Quite a few things that don&#x27;t need to be subs are for some reason.<p>In Asia subs are a higher threshold for sales. (At least they used to be, they&#x27;re much more common now.)')
