Item(by='Arathorn', descendants=None, kids=[24831049, 24840373, 24835580, 24832139, 24835560], score=None, time=1603140181, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24829840, text='This an excellent response, and thank you for writing it (and for considering Matrix so highly).<p>I think the main reason why this isn&#x27;t going to turn into Reddit is that the reputation is strictly relative, and hopefully we can set a precedent for proportional behaviour.<p>So, while you will always have some set of people who think you shouldn&#x27;t discuss firearms and assign folks in firearm communities negative reputation, hopefully that would never result in widespread bans or filtering.  If a moderator got overenthusiastic and imposed a blanket ban, hopefully their community would rise up and vote with their feet (just as you would today if a rogue moderator got trigger-happy with &#x2F;ban).  Meanwhile, if someone got overenthusiastic with blanket filter rules (i.e. &quot;automatically assign negative weight to content from users from these communities so it&#x27;s hidden by default&quot;), then individuals could and should override it by assigning their own filters.<p>We&#x27;ve tried to model it after real life, for better or worse.  If someone chooses to use the same identity for discussing both firearms and (say) cooking, then they may get shunned by some cookery folks.  But most of the cook group won&#x27;t care and ignore it.  You might get unlucky and discover the head chef is anti-firearms and kicks you out, but frankly that sounds like a good reason to find a more broadminded cook group.<p>You&#x27;re right that a large server like Matrix.org could take an opinionated view and go and apply radical blanket bans for all sorts of stuff, and set a precedent that it&#x27;s okay to throw your weight around.  But a) we&#x27;re not going to do that - for instance we haven&#x27;t yet blocked any server from Matrix.org; b) the only blanket bans we&#x27;re considering for Matrix.org at this time are against spam, child abuse, and folks conspiring to kill; c) we&#x27;re pretty confident that if Matrix.org overstepped its bounds on moderation, the network would route around the damage anyway: there are something like 55,000 servers that we&#x27;re aware of on the network, and we believe Matrix.org accounts for only about 20-30% of the traffic (and that includes IRC bridges etc).  So folks would vote with their feet and shift server - especially once we have portable accounts.<p>Finally, P2P Matrix will change the dynamic entirely on this - no more servers (by default) means that users will be entirely making their own choices on where to hang out and who to hang out with.')
