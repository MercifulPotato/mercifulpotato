I don&#x27;t have any crypto-related accounts. My phone number is not tied to most of my accounts.<p>- Some horny old German dudes started messaging me on WhatsApp. After a bit of investigating, I learned that my phone number ended up on those &quot;local girls in your area&quot; porn ads.<p>- I started receiving spam calls, which is pretty unusual in Germany. I received ~5 calls from US numbers, which I did not answer.<p>- Today, I got a call from a Forex bank about an account activation. Because of the events above, I tried to get more info. He just said that the account was for a person named Pyotr. Not a rare name in Germany, but definitely not my own.<p>My phone number has been public on my website for 3 years, because I&#x27;m legally required to put it there. However all that nonsense started very recently. Nothing like that happened before.<p>My email was part of the 123rf breach, among others that included phone numbers.<p>Could anyone shed some light on what is happening, and what I should do about it?')
