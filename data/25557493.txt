Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=[25557679], score=None, time=1609141464, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25557316, text='I think it is a matter of development time&#x2F;resources.<p>One issue is that HN is not really open source. Although there was an open source release years ago, the current code base is an evolution of that and closed. It then comes down to how much time&#x2F;money Y Combinator is willing to invest in enhancing it, and I assume more essential stuff takes priority over nice-to-haves like dark mode.<p>I think, ideally, the current version could be open sourced, and then people could contribute PRs to add stuff like dark mode. I think dang has said before that the reason why they don&#x27;t do that, is they don&#x27;t want to expose certain &quot;secret sauce&quot; (abuse&#x2F;spam detection, voting code, etc), since if the algorithms were exposed people would exploit them.<p>I guess one solution would be to split the code base into open core and closed plugins, open source the core and then keep the secret sauce in the closed plugins. But, I guess that would take time to carry out that refactoring, which comes back to the issue of limited development time&#x2F;resources and what priorities that will be spent on.')
