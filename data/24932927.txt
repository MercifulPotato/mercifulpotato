Item(by='teorema', descendants=None, kids=[24933108], score=None, time=1603992778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929492, text='I think you could generalize the idea of &quot;individuals who extract income but who do not perform useful work&quot; to &quot;individuals whose extracted income exceeds the utility of the work they perform.&quot; Maybe to the converse as well, to an excess of &quot;individuals whose extracted income subceeds the utility of the work they perform&quot;. It&#x27;s basically talking about unjustified inequality.<p>I think to some extent this maps onto the idea of rent-seeking monopolies in current society and undercompensation of individuals. It&#x27;s hard to go to something like this<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mkorostoff.github.io&#x2F;1-pixel-wealth&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mkorostoff.github.io&#x2F;1-pixel-wealth&#x2F;</a>&#x27;<p>and not conclude that many people are being undercompensated grossly, and a small number of others are being overcompensated grossly.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I agree with others that I don&#x27;t think this maps onto &quot;braininess&quot; per se. I just think that&#x27;s one of the character traits that happens to be valued the most in Western societies at the moment, so it&#x27;s projected by the elites the most. In the past it might have been valor or nobility or courage or whatever it was -- the thing that is presented as justification for the excessive income, and protection of that income.<p>In general I think individuals are misvalued, not in the sense that persons don&#x27;t matter, but the economic value placed on single individuals can be (and usually are) grossly overstated or understated. I think this transcends many many fields.')
