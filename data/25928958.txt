The GPU driver exposes no *_swap_control extensions anywhere. There’re 3 extendable parts, EGL, GLES client and GLES server with many extensions each, but nothing resembling GLX_EXT_swap_control&#x2F;GLX_MESA_swap_control&#x2F;GLX_SGI_swap_control.<p>Other applications on that Pi4 who render many FPS (web browser or VLC player) also have screen tearing. I assume these people know way more about Linux GPU stuff, yet they failed too.<p>Do you have an advice how I can do that on that Pi4, with EGL 1.1 and GLES 3.1?<p>P.S. Based on the internets, the problem was introduced in Pi4. In earlier versions things were good.')
