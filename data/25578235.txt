Probably the biggest (at least in the US) is railroad consolidation--we&#x27;ve gone from ~100 Class I railroads to 7 (8 if you include Ferromex in Mexico). This consolidation means you don&#x27;t need parallel mainlines. Additionally, train traffic has generally shifted from serving individual cars to customers along the tracks to a heavier emphasis on delivering to consolidated freight stations (with last-mile delivery handled by local truck), which means the utility of tracks in the suburbs is lessened.')
