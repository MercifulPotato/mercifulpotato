My job was split roughly into thirds - babysitting and mediating team issues, running interference to keep the executives out of my team&#x27;s hair and bird-dogging HR and payroll issues.  I would walk around sometimes and see if anyone needed me to expedite something or clear a blocker and I would go do it.  (We were lucky in that we were working on something interesting and kind of ground-breaking so we didn&#x27;t need a lot of &quot;team building&quot; rah rah to get everyone to work up the enthusiasm to work on a product nobody really cared about.)')
