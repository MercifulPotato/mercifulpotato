I know I did that, so I know it is possible. I don&#x27;t particularly like maths courses, I just took a lot of them since they were free credits.<p>Is this useful information for how to treat typical students? No. However, talent having such a profound impact on peoples ability to learn, understand and apply mathematics is something most people are aware of and hence it isn&#x27;t strange that people who studied maths thinks that genius requires inborn talent. The author of this piece instead takes a jab at it and tries to say that they just believe that since they got told by their parents that they were smart, I don&#x27;t think that is true. Most people studying maths doesn&#x27;t view themselves as good at maths, so what is more likely is that they take their own struggles despite hard work and passion as evidence that genius requires inborn talent.')
