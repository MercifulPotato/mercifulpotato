I always tell them, you wont do it. They attended the right school, joined the right firm, attained that corner office. As a founder they would give up all that, and their family and friends will tell them that they&#x27;ve made a massive mistake, for years, while it appears that nothing is happening.<p>Then they sheepishly admit that this is true.<p>As a bootstrapped founder when I was younger, even dating was awkward. People considered me to be quasi-unemployed, despite working 80 hours a week. It&#x27;s really hard to do if you&#x27;re thirsty for status.')
