Maybe some well-informed HNer can shed light?<p>1. If the goal is to get the desired protein inside the patient&#x27;s body, why is injecting mRNA that produces the protein more effective than simply introducing the protein itself?<p>2. How does the patient&#x27;s immune system know to treat this protein as unwanted if it&#x27;s being produced by the body&#x27;s own cells?<p>3. How do vaccine developers avoid creating an over-active immune response in the patient (i.e. an allergy)?')
