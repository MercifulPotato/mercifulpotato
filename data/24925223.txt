They just actually just introduced what they called reverse stacking : If you stack 1000 utk, you can get the 1% fee payed by the seller.<p>I am not sure about how much fees Visa will add from their part of the currency transfer. But I guess these fees will stay the same no matter which project you use as long as Visa is part of the payment solution.')
