Different situations, different people, different levels of expectations, differing levels of legitimate authority, emotions vs. outcomes etc.. Some people perceive &#x27;loudness&#x27; to be problematic, some people don&#x27;t care (see: inside of a hockey locker room).<p>Usually focusing on material things, outcomes etc. matter, the rest is not that important. Personally, I try to have a huge latitude for tolerance of different types and don&#x27;t care that much otherwise frankly. Truly diabolical patterns of behaviour like back-stabbing, not taking ownership of failure - this kind of stuff is quite bothersome - and those behaviours can come in &#x27;nice happy bosses&#x27;.')
