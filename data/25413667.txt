Suddenly, we have bicycle paths everywhere, from which cars are prohibited. Bicycle usage becomes much more reasonable for the unathletic.<p>Where did we ever get the idea that we&#x27;re not supposed to ride on the sidewalk? Kids do it all the time. Parents don&#x27;t let kids ride in the street. Are kids getting arrested for that crime?<p>Compare mass. A typical bicycle weighs 18 pounds, adding just 10% to a human. The car is at least a factor of 10 more, and trucks are a factor of 400 more.<p>Compare speed. A typical human runs at 10 MPH. The average speed in bike lanes is 11 to 12 MPH. Hey, that&#x27;s almost the same! Cars obviously go far faster, often 70 MPH but rarely below 25 MPH.<p>Compare energy. We can calculate it in junk units if we take any measure of speed, square it, and multiply by mass. That gives us a runner at 18400 units, a bicyclist at 26714 units, and a driver at 4900000 to 392000000 units. Even at the low end, with a small slow car, the driver has about 200 times the energy of the bicyclist. The bicyclist has only 50% more than the runner.<p>So, by the numbers, it is really clear that bicycles should be considered pedestrians. The kind of people who join bicycling organizations and lobby for bicycling laws might disagree, but they are a tiny sliver of the potential bicycle-using population.')
