And indeed if you try to use this fd to fsync() you get EBADF.<p>I guess this is just an edge case of an edge case that most people aren&#x27;t concerned about. One way to work around this issue with a bare minimum of compromise to security would be a setuid program that does nothing but open its working directory then fsync it.')
