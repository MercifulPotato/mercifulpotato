Thank you so much for the mention! We’re trying our best to make a great calculator, so it’s always a pleasure to get this kind of feedback!<p>As a note to the HN crowd: we’re facing an intersecting UX challenge. The vast majority of our users aren’t very technical - they’re high schoolers really. But we also want to cater to a more advanced audience such as engineers.<p>Initially we thought it would be really hard to please everyone. But it turns out it’s actually possible to create a simple interface that still lets you do more advanced functions. And even better, designing for the “newcomers first” turned out to be a great guidance when designing our software. Judging from the feedback we get, assuming the user won’t ever read any manual or doc is actually quite a good starting point!')
