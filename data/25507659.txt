Any senator or congressperson can release proposed legislation like this.  The vast, vast majority of it never gets further -- Especially ones released right before the end of the term.  Senator Tillis can introduce this legislation again next year, but nothing is going to happen with this bill before it dies an unceremonial death on Jan 3.<p>It&#x27;s good to keep abreast of what congress is considering in this regard, but this is nothing more than a wish by the Senator and the handful of lawmakers that are co-sponsoring it.<p>A useful headline would be `Senator introduces bill to make illegal streaming a felony` but to say &quot;it will happen soon&quot; is misleading.')
