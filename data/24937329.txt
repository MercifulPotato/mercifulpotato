You could design all the graphs, logical connections on the computer then load them and just snap all the parts together. The main drawback I encountered then was how to implement the wagon since it can move in an arbitrary track path circuit. I&#x27;m not sure how that could be done. Another idea that&#x27;s a little out there is that if someone could implement the basic building blocks using molecular parts, then maybe that&#x27;s how we build molecular machines!')
