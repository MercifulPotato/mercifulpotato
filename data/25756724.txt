The fact is that 90% of running a fintech business is identifying and bounding fraud risk, and these &quot;banking API&quot; companies are able to move the needle down a couple of basis points.<p><i>edit</i> It&#x27;s shit like this that just screams for the Fed to force FIs to implement a standard API for verifying accounts and making transfers. I bet half of fintech would collapse overnight, but the collective cost savings would be in the billions.')
