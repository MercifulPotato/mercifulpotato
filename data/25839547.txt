Sure, they can do it on big power hungry server processors, but they&#x27;ve been missing out on all of the growth in mobile and embedded processors, which are now starting to scale up into laptops, desktops, and server workloads.<p>Except ARM CPUs aren&#x27;t any more parallel in comparable power envelopes than x86 CPUs are, and x86 doesn&#x27;t seem to have any issue hitting large CPU core counts, either. Most consumer software doesn&#x27;t scale worth a damn, though. Particularly ~every web app which can&#x27;t scale past 2 cores if it can even scale past 1.')
