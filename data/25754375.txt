But that&#x27;s not moral (what they are doing currently). We should abandon these instances and find better ways to communicate - less centralized.<p>- Store owners (and property owners in general) should be able to defend their property with firepower (or pay for such services) freely, without fear of repercussions. This stands both against BLM and MAGA. Of course, this luxury is not allowed in the current world.<p>So we have to find find better ways - don&#x27;t stand in the way of a moving train, but find ways to survive and prosper no matter.

I prefer not to work for US companies (especially the SV commie bunch), I don&#x27;t travel to the USA any more.
