But if you have something like a web server with a timeout of 60s you won&#x27;t be able to open 10&#x27;000 connections at once to it. Some or all will be probably run into the timeout before the ruby could process the whole request. Therefore I would try to use some form of rate limiting via a FiberPool with a backlog.')
