Governments did, and we need to keep that in mind, because depending on the state, the government response was often far too harsh and not backed by science.”<p>This is like saying you were hurt by the airbag, not the crash. You could say that specific government reactions made things worse, or the failure to provide economic assistance forced people into risky situations but the root cause was the entire world learning that it was quite risky to be in close proximity to other people.')
