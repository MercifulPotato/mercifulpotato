He once said in an interview:<p>&gt;Whatever you do, do the best you can, because the film lives forever. No, &quot;because that day it was raining and the actor don&#x27;t have time.&quot;<p>&gt;I said, &quot;would you go to every theater and tell the audience?&quot; No! The audience sits in the theater: good movie? Bad movie? That&#x27;s all.<p>And he practiced what he preached, sometimes going through hundreds of takes to get a stunt just right.')
