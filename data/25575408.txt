Know &#x2F; related to many Chinese nationals, spectrum from FLG practitioners to purged officials. From rich coastal provinces to poor inland ones. China&#x27;s a stressful place, everyone bitches about how things are, the loudest from their multi million dollar tier1 condos. But almost no one wants to go back to Mao days, except the FLG practitioner because they missed ideological purity of the old party. People can sing whatever, and if you believe the recent Harvard surveys, they sing mostly good things. The fact that they&#x27;re singing in the first place is unparalleled freedom compared to Mao times where private speech got you fucked, i.e. what the Uyghurs are going through now, which is to say 99% of the country has moved past that. It&#x27;s an unambiguous improvement. First ever civil code just passed this year as well.<p>It&#x27;s only been 30 years, about how long it took Taiwan&#x2F;Korea to liberalize, except things take longer when you have 1.4B people and antagonism from global superpower. Taiwan&#x2F;Korean dictatorship got unambiguous and sustained US support. Under Xi, it&#x27;s 2 steps forward and 1 step back. Realistically it&#x27;s is 5 steps forward and 1 step back, but west likes to paint that 1 step as a chasm.')
