Item(by='Karawebnetwork', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608135044, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25442364, text='&gt; Would you estimate that you have less periods of feeling nostalgia, for you cannot picture your childhood home?<p>I think so. I barely remember anything from my childhood. I experience nostalgia but probably less of it. For example, smelling garlic bread will make me think of my childhood home that was next to an italian restaurant. I can also perfectly remember the layout of the building. I remember the fear I had one day as there was no electricity and I had to climb 4 flights of stairs in pitch black. But I can&#x27;t see any of it. I can&#x27;t see what my grandmother used to look like. In a strange happenstance, I remember she looked a bit like the queen does on the $20 paper bills so I often get nostalgia by handling money. She did not look identical, but had enough &quot;variables&quot; that were identical for my mind to &quot;confuse&quot; or &quot;link&quot; the two, in a way. I know that when I was a child, I would confuse my parents or teachers with characters seen on TV.<p>&gt; Would you estimate that you have less periods of feeling cringe, for you cannot re-play an embarrassing conversation in your mind?<p>Actually, I can remember conversations. I simply cannot hear them or see them. I still have the text transcript of it silently playback into my memory, bringing back conversations in my short term memory and allowing me to relive them. It&#x27;s more like instinctively knowing, the same way you know 4+4=8 without imagining two bundles of four sticks. The only sound I can produce in my head is my own voice, so sometimes I will &quot;talk&quot; with someone else anyway. It is identical to how it would look to see me read outloud the dialogues for two characters. I have been told that people can even hear musical instrument... all I can do it focus hard and reproduce the noise of the instrument with my voice. So it just sound like acapella done by someone with no music talent.<p>To answer your question, I rarely have issues falling asleep. I do have memories of times where I was a teen and would struggle to fall asleep because I would think back on what happened at school. But it was a rare occurrence.<p>&gt; Now the spicy, Ethical question. Would you estimate that you have less periods of feeling remorse for your actions?<p>Yes. I feel as if it has taken me more time than others to reach certain developmental milestones. Now that I am an adult, I have those remorse. I can think about how doing X would trigger Y and make someone feel like Z. It&#x27;s like a huge mindmap. But before being able to juggle so many concepts, events and variables? I wondered for a long time if I might be a sociopath. Turns out I simply needed to learn all of those concepts from a different perspective. Like a left handed person trying to learn to write by attempting to mimic a right handed person.')
