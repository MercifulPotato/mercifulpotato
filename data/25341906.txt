I&#x27;ve been tutoring students in 5-7th grade for about two years, most of them benefit from tutoring because they have knowledge gaps missing from previous school years (for whatever reason). Before March this year, all the tutoring was in-person and it was relatively easy to keep them engaged and they made good progress. Now that I&#x27;m doing this over video calls, their attention wanders much more easily. Motivating them to do work is very challenging nowadays.')
