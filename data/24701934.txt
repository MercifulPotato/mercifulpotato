Without actually having researched it too much, I suspect the educational access program is too restrictive for a pivot to PBS affiliate due to service area limitations.<p>You could view the educational access program as a failed attempt to bolster these types of services. There are definitely active educational access stations but I&#x27;m not aware of any case where they&#x27;re still used to deliver teleinstruction - would love to hear about any that do.')
