Youtube&#x27;s own &quot;view transcript&quot; tool spits out a small side window with about 5 words per line. For me, that&#x27;s a pain to read.<p>This transcript is displayed in paragraph form, nearly as readable as a typical article.<p>One very specific question: is there a way to get it on Instapaper&#x27;s mobile app? While it transfers well on the web version, clicking on the transcript through the app takes me to the web version.<p>Thank you for this contribution!')
