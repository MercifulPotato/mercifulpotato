Anecdotally, the chart leans to the server side security breaches.<p>In the absence of knowledge, we get two security talks repeated over and over.  This is the first: do a better job with passwords.  The second is &quot;You are irrovacably insecure because of [some issue], but update your passwords regularly.&quot;<p>Security has not developed a reputation for being a craft or science.')
