The fixed costs are huge, it is either difficult or impossible to actually offset a living wage to the delivery person if they are only fulfilling one order at a time. The only way this model works now is by hosing down restaurants (in many places right now, there is literally no choice for restaurants but to make delivery apps money). It is true, lots of these restaurants got themselves into this mess by not realising how valuable deliveries were...but...I don&#x27;t understand how this is long-term viable. Paying someone EUR10 to deliver EUR20 of food makes no sense for most customers.')
