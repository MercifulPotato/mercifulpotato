Electrical metallurgy is very promising technology. Just replacing what we do now with hydrogen is about as difficult and will end up more expensive.<p>Check out Boston Metal.<p>&gt; Finally, the higher energy density makes it suitable for larger vehicles like long range trucks. Electrification is preferablem but not everything can be electrified.<p>Trucks will be battery electric, its clearly more efficient for 99% of the routes.<p>&gt; Also, if you have enough renewable generation capacity to reliably cover peak loads then there are also going to be times when you have massive overproduction.<p>Renewables will only cover peak loads with the help of massive amounts of batteries in the first place. No amount of solar power will create enough energy to cover the evening peak.<p>&gt; Battery costs for the coming decades will be too high with to buffer multiple weeks of power use so it makes sense to have an &quot;electricity sink&quot; where you can dump any excess. Hydrogen production via electrolysis is an excellent option for that since it&#x27;s very quick to scale up and down and the end product has many different uses.<p>Battery cost have been coming down fast and the trend is looking to continue.<p>I have huge question about the ideas of trying to store many weeks of energy production, the economics of that are very questionable. And hydrogen is just one of many technologies that can potentially &#x27;solve&#x27; that if it even ever is solved. Hydrogen is far from clearly the best way to approach that problem.')
