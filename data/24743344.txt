I had a hard time choosing between it and the Abasi plugin but I felt like Nolly shined more in a wide range of scenarios. Overall I have been very happy with it, 10&#x2F;10 would recommend especially since they recently added a build in tuner. I have had some issues but I think it’s just my $30 usb interface.')
