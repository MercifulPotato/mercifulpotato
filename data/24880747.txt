He&#x27;s questioning the nature of this world where a clear black and white decision is not always possible. He is saying in this case could there be No justifiable action possible?<p>The hypothetical scenario is likely to help you empathize with the events from the chinese perspective. You cannot relate to the people reacting to terrorism in China. However, by envisioning a similar&#x2F;equivalent scenario in your own country can possibly help you identify with the situation from their perspective. That is the purpose of the hypothetical.<p>The question still stands if the posed equivalent situation was happening in America, what is the appropriate response? I don&#x27;t know how to answer his question, do you?<p>&gt;Killing millions of people is not a proper response to and isolated terrorist act<p>Don&#x27;t play with words here. Millions are missing in concentration camps getting reeducated, this isn&#x27;t actual genocide. This is not equivalent to sending the military to another country and conducting actual killings. What China is doing is still atrocious but quite different then literal slaughter.<p>Also it&#x27;s not a response to one isolated incident. Several terrorism acts with hundreds slaughtered and no end in sight is what is actually going on. I don&#x27;t think you would call several 9&#x2F;11&#x27;s happening on american soil isolated terrorist attacks. Perhaps terrorism attacks in China seem isolated to you but this is not the case to a Chinese person.')
