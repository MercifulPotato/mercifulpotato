A lot but precisely I don&#x27;t know and it doesn&#x27;t matter much.<p><i>I just gave up trying to compile SKIA.</i> Come on, don&#x27;t make it sound like it&#x27;s a hard task, on the github issue from blend2d someone gave to you a repository that include a Cmake for skia which should be straight-forward.<p>Claim:\n<i>he will not publish skia benchmarck until it&#x27;s new &quot;more parallel&quot; version of blend2d is ready which imply he is skeptic that current blend2d is competitive with Skia.</i><p>Claim denial:\n<i>I&#x27;m the author of Blend2D and I have never stated what you claim I did.</i><p>What you actually said:\n<i>I think comparing with GPU implementations would make sense after multithreaded renderer lands, because competing GPU implementations use the whole GPU hardware whereas the current Blend2D software-based renderer only uses a single thread.</i>\nWould make sense easily translate to I&#x27;m not interested in doing it until there is a point in doing it which is: a fair comparison. \nSource: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;blend2d&#x2F;blend2d&#x2F;issues&#x2F;36" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;blend2d&#x2F;blend2d&#x2F;issues&#x2F;36</a><p><i>Otherwise all you say is just unfounded, sorry.</i>\nOriginal statement:\n<i>Blend2d is still slower than skia</i>\nBacked by expert wisdom comparing skia with cairo showing huge performance gap. \nBlend2d own benchmarcks not having a that huge performance gap with cairo (but it has kinda with the multithreaded mode I give you that) \nThen the logical reasoning become basic transitivity&#x2F;equivalence relation\nTo state that what I said is unfounded is a low effort refutation because it is too categorical. In all honesty my reasoning has weakness: I don&#x27;t have precise quantification of the lead that Skia has over cairo (maybe there was some benchs on the NVpath paper?) and multithreaded blend2d do have a quite significant gap with cairo. \nSo optimistically, current blend2d might actually come into the ballpark of Skia, it could even outperform it but probably not by a huge margin. \nAnd keep in my that the baseline performance I expect from skia (very old benchmarcks and expert wisdom based on old benchmarcks) has probably improved since recent years (e.g one could think about more AVX512 use, the Vulkan backend, etc)<p>So I&#x27;ll transform my original statement in an equivalent one consequence wise:\n<i>Blend2d is still slower than skia</i> to: Blend2d has not shown evidence of being faster than skia, nobody should use it until this evidence become available.<p>I&#x27;m not going to contribute, sorry. \nYour last paragraph is interesting and that would be quite of an achievement of you if Skia tried a JIT compiler.')
