As a senior level engineer&#x2F;architect with maybe a small team leading role, when was the last time you took a solid 2 week off without anyone calling you for work? Heck, look at the number of unlimited PTO companies out there where employees never take a day. Just as an example.<p>The experience my friends have in the EU seems to be pretty good over all with healthcare. The US healthcare system give fantastic results at a phenomenal and often strange price. It&#x27;s a trade-off I&#x27;m sure.<p>I agree that having savings helps. And I have quite a bit of savings. But I still wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable being laid off .<p>Over all I&#x27;m here in the US and I love it. But I&#x27;m pointing out that there is give and take to everywhere.<p>Also everyone keeps talking about working for FAANG but.... The vast majority of US engineers don&#x27;t work for them.')
