Does it mean that they have no idea what a for-loop is? Or that they have basic understanding of a programming language, but lack the fundamentals? And how do you define fundamentals?<p>The phrases &quot;can&#x27;t code&quot; and can&#x27;t pass &quot;fizz-buzz&quot; are loosely used. What exactly is fizz-buzz? To me, it&#x27;s writing a for loop to reverse a string, but to someone else, it&#x27;s implementing Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm in a 40 minute period to solve some made up problem.')
