All terminals and artifacts associated with that git workspace stay on the associated desktop.<p>The only exception are windows that need the entire screen, which get their own adjacent desktops.  But for these I use the same desktop number always so it&#x27;s easy to find.<p>This way I spend almost no time searching for stuff in i3.  Switching between desktops is like doing a full screen grouped alt-tab.  So much faster.  In fact I do this even in non i3 desktop environments, but i3 makes it a lot easier.<p>However, I don&#x27;t do things like email or document reading in i3, since I find that the less constrained traditional window environment is better for that.<p>The other great thing about i3 is that it&#x27;s is fast over remote desktop sessions, because the ui itself is so minimal.')
