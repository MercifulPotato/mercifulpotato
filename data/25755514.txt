I do believe I had a pretty mild case all things considered, and I&#x27;m pretty much fully recovered at this point but still plan to quarantine for another week.<p>What I experienced was basically indistinguishable from a mild cold except for the loss of smell and taste, which took over a week to show up after the onset of the initial symptom (a fever). While I know loss of smell can happen from non-COVID infections, I can say this is the only time in my life I&#x27;ve had a <i>total</i> loss of all smell and taste. I&#x27;m very fortunate that this total loss only persisted for a few days, and at this point based on my subjective experience my smell and taste senses appear to be normal again.')
