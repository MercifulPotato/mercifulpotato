I bought every release from 2.3 to somewhere in the 4.x series, and had them all in a closet until a few years ago. Unfortunately I got rid of them in a fit of cleaning.<p>I regret it now. Since then I’ve gotten back into OpenBSD as an occasional user on a random server here and there, and a Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 6. I bought it specifically for OpenBSD and it works great.<p>Those old CD sets were cool. Many included extra art work, song lyrics, install instructions and would boot and install for several architectures.<p>These days I mostly just run current snapshots, so a release has little impact for me personally. But it’s always fun to see OpenBSD still moving forward after 25 years.')
