I used to be bullish on Dropbox and I&#x27;m a loyal user, but the reality is that Wall Street doesn&#x27;t appreciate this space given how commoditized it has become.<p>Unfortunately I have started to believe them. There&#x27;s really no recent breaktroughs or interesting bets coming from Dropbox.
