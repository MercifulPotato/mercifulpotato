However superstars rarely end up in those jobs. We&#x27;re looking at people with kinda average engineering skills, poor understanding of the American culture, no connections, and grim determination to grind their way out of their old life.<p>Liberating the indentured h1b workers is not just flipping a legal switch, it&#x27;s a cultural integration project.')
