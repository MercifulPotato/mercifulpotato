If I was working in person, someone coming up to me and asking &quot;do you have a sec?&quot; would be a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Even if I worked in a private office, someone knocking on the door would deserve enough attention to explain their situation. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever worked at a place where I could get away with telling my colleagues &quot;don&#x27;t come talk to me unless we have an appointment&quot;. Being available to help is part of the job.')
