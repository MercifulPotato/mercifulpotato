This very specifically works only because browsers don&#x27;t generally care that an HTML page is anything close to valid HTML. There&#x27;s no guarantee at all that this will continue to be the case, and it&#x27;s resonable to assume that some browser in the future might decide to do render things that are very clearly a JSON document as a JSON document instead - fundamentally breaking the core architecture of your system.<p>React is a different approach, but it plays by the rules and doesn&#x27;t serve invalid HTML or Javascript.')
