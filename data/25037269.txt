I tried rebooting a few times but no dice. I guess deleting and reinstalling the app will lose all my tokens; I have recovery codes religiously preserved, but setting up more than a dozen accounts all over again is going to be painful.<p>Has anyone had this problem before? Is there any way to extract the current data from the app? Even just a list of the accounts, so I know what to set up again.<p>I have a feeling my next TOTP generator won’t be Google’s.')
