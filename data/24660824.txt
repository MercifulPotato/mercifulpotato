Usually this would be defined as the input size. Unless you would like to be able to run this on arbitrary definitions of what a &quot;vowel&quot; is (and in this case, it&#x27;s indeed both small and static), the only useful interpretation would be to consider this function O(1), regardless of iteration over this 5-element list. If the list of vowels would considered a parameter, it would indeed be O(n) or O(m).')
