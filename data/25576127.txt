Item(by='taurath', descendants=None, kids=[25576558], score=None, time=1609282879, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25571396, text='It doesn&#x27;t help and may accelerate feelings of having no way out, but you also can&#x27;t be seen as &quot;violence is sometimes okay&quot; when its literally a crime as an adult.<p>There&#x27;s always enough kids from abusive or neglectful households to make lots of conflict in schools. It used to be (I have heard) that schools and teachers were extremely well respected such that a parent wouldn&#x27;t go against something a teacher said. So in a way the teacher could help actually parent the kid. Nowadays school is more like having a personal childcare service and parents act like they&#x27;re paying customers and control every aspect of their kids interactions with it.')
