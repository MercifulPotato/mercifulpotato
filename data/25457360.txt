In her own words, she announced that she&#x27;d like to discuss an end date for her employment if she wouldn&#x27;t be given the chance to fix the paper up for publication. This would very much fly in Germany. Her other email to the public list telling people to stop doing what they are doing might not, but then in Germany you&#x27;d have the Betriebsrat and the union stepping in and giving validation to such a firing (or not).<p>Googles problem is that Timnit - who was hired to investigate  the ethics of AI - refused to just retract a paper that might contain inconvenient statements about the ethics of AI and then refused to just roll over when fired. And they refuse to adress that, and can&#x27;t just be open and transparent about it by e.g. sharing Timnits emails to prove she was making threats and being unreasonable, so some people are made and have opinions.<p>In Germany, this would start and end with the Betriebsrat either blocking the firing or approving it. This would provide due process, transparency and legitimacy in one go.')
