For example, one can remove a clause and thereby make the program more specific. One can remove a goal and thus make the program more general.<p>This is possible due to the way the language is designed, the interplay of syntax and semantics enables this. The program fragments serve as explanations that can be shown to programmers to pinpoint mistakes in the code. Thus, when narrowing down mistakes, it becomes possible to focus on smaller portions of the code that are therefore easier to understand.')
