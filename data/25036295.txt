I mean the ones about their life experiences that led them to the dark place they find themselves in. You don&#x27;t exit the womb a neo-nazi, you get there over time, through (bad) experience, and (questionable) learning. If you can&#x27;t answer the &quot;why do they believe what they do?&quot; with a genuine, i.e. not rhetoric, not othering, answer, you don&#x27;t have the facts.<p>There are truly horrible people out there, but the vast majority of people that voted Trump are normal people with boring everyday lives. Treating every individual in that group like its extremists serves only to divide and polarize. It makes the problem worse. IF your goal is to effect positive change, you need to take a different approach. However, if you goal is to feel superior and good and like you&#x27;re &quot;on the right team&quot;, feel free to keep hating.')
