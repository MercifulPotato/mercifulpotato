Item(by='trsohmers', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609793382, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25636821, text='51% attack does not correlate at all with owning 51% of the coins, it is about having 51% of the network hashrate. If you were to round up the current network hashrate from 145 million TH&#x2F;s to 150 million TH&#x2F;s, and use the Nicehash price of ~$219 per PH per hour as a price, it would cost around $15B to run a 51% attack for an hour. Obviously the price per PH would go up as you buy up that much hashpower (which wouldn&#x27;t even be for sale), so this is a low end estimate, but your $300bn number is completely out of the park.')
