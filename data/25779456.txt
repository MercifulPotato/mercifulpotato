I haven&#x27;t seen a counter-example to that. Profitable models aren&#x27;t going to be delivered on a silver platter. They need to be able to process pretty low level data effectively and build ad-hoc custom tools and data pipelines around that to test out their ideas. Otherwise they&#x27;re constrained to the tools others have built and that massively narrows the search space that they&#x27;re capable of traversing.<p>The best quants are 1&#x2F;3 statistician, 1&#x2F;3 developer and 1&#x2F;3 trader, in my view.')
