Marketing can be quite awesome and impressively done. However, you know AI&#x2F;GPT-3-based writing and helping of marketing copy will lead to lowest common denominator scaling of marketing copy to everyone with tweaks for the specifically targeted person.

Gross.<p>As to your dig, my conscience is clear; I made a conscious effort to avoid such ends in my professional life, sometimes to my short term detriment. My personal time is mine to do with what I please, even if you consider some of that time to be used in a self righteous or low effort way. It&#x27;s not self righteous to point out bad things.')
