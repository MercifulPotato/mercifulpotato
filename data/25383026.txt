This article feels pretty specific to me though. It’s saying the federal stimulus in the spring was mostly successful, however the situation is still ongoing and the federal government isn’t likely to act again. Therefore it’s up to the state to do something similar, and the state can afford it by raising taxes on capital gains.<p>I personally know people that were saved by the $1,200 earlier this year. Waitstaff, retail workers, even some healthcare workers. This is a clear example of “we are part of the way there and need more funding”. The vaccines are being manufactured, we just need to give people more time.<p>&gt; Without addressing the actual root causes of inequity, distributing... funds will amount to little more than an invitation to use force to take from the haves and deign to the have-nots<p>I’m curious what you think the causes of inequality are? Picketty makes a strong case that it’s caused by the fact that wealth grows more wealth at a faster rate than labor grows wealth. In which case a wealth tax or capital gains tax would cut right to the heart of inequality.')
