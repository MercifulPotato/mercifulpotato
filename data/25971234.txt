Either you&#x27;re passing in str and can just grab the char* out of the existing PyObject, or you have some more complicated thing that was wrapped once in a PyObject and doesn&#x27;t need to be converted, etc.  But sure, if you have some dict with a lot of data and need to convert it into an std::map you&#x27;ll have a bad time.')
