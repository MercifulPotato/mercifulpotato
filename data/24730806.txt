It isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s coming out of users pockets (via higher prices). From the article:<p>&gt;Yen says the company was forced to raise its prices since the 30-percent commission that Apple takes completely ate away ProtonMail&#x27;s profit margins.<p>Now multiply the 30% increase times every (paid) app on your phone.<p>(NB: I&#x27;m not against Apple making healthy money from the App store but 30% is just gouging IMHO)')
