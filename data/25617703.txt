Item(by='dodobirdlord', descendants=None, kids=[25618942], score=None, time=1609630245, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25617531, text='&gt; An unmanned combat aerial vehicle would probably win in a dogfight<p>If by &quot;unmanned combat aerial vehicle&quot; you mean a missile, maybe. Up to a point fighter planes get faster as they get larger. Any &quot;drone&quot; that could go toe-to-toe with the F-35 is going to be around the same size and look roughly the same. But more significantly, the F-35 is a stealth fighter that serves primarily as a sensor platform for long-range weaponry. The premise that it would find itself in a dogfight is not realistic.')
