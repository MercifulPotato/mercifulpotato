I bet it&#x27;s not much.<p>&gt; That’s why System76 is more expensive. They’re NOT overpriced. They’re priced as “general purpose computers” must be to be competitive.<p>They&#x27;re so much more expensive because they&#x27;re niche.  Not because of anything inherent to the product or producing it.<p>So &quot;overpriced&quot; sounds fair to me.<p>&gt; I agree with this author, but this suggests that the strength of his conviction is maybe $400.<p>Is that not enough?  If you can spread the word enough, and get enough people that are willing to spend $50 extra, you&#x27;ll find plenty of companies begging for that money.  The profit margin for building computers is bad.')
