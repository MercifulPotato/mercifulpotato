Amazon may consider unions to be an existential threat.<p>There&#x27;s no story here, just like there&#x27;s no story that many companies donate to Republicans despite having liberal founders&#x2F;CEOs. Elon Musk famously donates to both parties, although one assumes he personally has a preference for one (or neither) of them.')
