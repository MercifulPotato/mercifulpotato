Item(by='docbrown', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604826802, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25024263, text='&gt; Personally, I think letting people go there own way as much as possible is the best course, and empowering the United Nations is pretty much the opposite of that.<p>As in a Native American reservation type of self localized governing? That’s the only way I could see any good coming from separating each individual locality apart and attaching their own executive branch to it. We currently have 50 seperate states which almost govern in that way but they still must answer to an executive branch and that can be confusing.<p>Should one branch have a say in all local decisions? Who gets to decide on which person makes those decisions for all? My fear would be that governing completely independent of any other branch could also lead to authoritarianism: if one person persuades the locals they have the best mind to guide them through troubles, they’d ultimately have the final say in decision making once they gain their trust and the ability to govern.<p>(Apologies if formatting makes it sound confusing, I jumped off my laptop and am instead currently using mobile. Will edit to clarify any discrepancies.)')
