While portions of it reflect Davis&#x27; bouts of insanity, the core of it is a world that has passed us by, and all of the anger that goes along with losing something that you can never get back. For all of the shortcomings, it&#x27;s hard to not look back at what computers were like in the time of the Commodore 64 and not have at least a little contempt for how everything panned out afterwards.<p>Urbit is what happens when you have smoke blown up your ass for too long. It&#x27;s everything that TempleOS didn&#x27;t want to be; for all of its aspirations of being a Third Temple, the point was always that TempleOS was within your ability to understand. Urbit is postured in a way that implies it&#x27;s never meant to be truly understood.')
