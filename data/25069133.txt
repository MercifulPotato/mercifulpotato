If I open google voice I have an option to prioritize &quot;Internet connection&quot; over my &quot;operator&quot;.<p>So this leaves me wondering if google voice will be more streamlined inside a single app, or if it will be more restrictive to only function while having an active US number(SIMcard) in the phone.<p>I used to use skype back in the days, then Gizmo5, and have been using google voice for 11 years now, has the hn community moved on to something else that I have missed?')
