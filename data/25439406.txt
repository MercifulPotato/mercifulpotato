I can see it interpreted as forbidding storing the document on a workstation that is locked-down to prevent exfiltration of sensitive data (and such a system would almost certainly also use an encrypted FS among other measures), but forbidding the use of an encrypted FS per-se seems extreme. All an encrypted FS is doing by itself is ensuring that if you don&#x27;t have access to the content, then you don&#x27;t have access to the content.<p>Nothing about the GFDL forces anyone to redistribute, it just ensures that recipients have the right to redistribute. By itself, an encrypted FS is no hindrance to redistribution.')
