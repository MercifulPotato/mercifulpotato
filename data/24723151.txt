Strict data table where everything is a string or number? Great. Full fledged application where your table rows are actually selectable items that modify app state and cause rerenders elsewhere? Surely a slight performance hit in the table is worth the smoothness of an application.<p>For example, I have a workflow execution tool. You have a Table serving as a left column, and when you select a workflow (by clicking its table row), it populates the right column with the graph of that workflow.<p>I often feel as if arguments against SPA are constructed against the worst examples of the thing, when the UIs it enables are smooth, performant, and best-of-all not requiring user installs.')
