Culture Rings are like Niven&#x27;s Ringworld, and go all the way around a star, spinning around the star to simulate gravity.  Culture orbitals are also ring-shaped and spinning to simulate gravity, but they&#x27;re nowhere near as big (relatively speaking; still more surface area than Earth), and generally orbit a star more like a planet does.  Culture Spheres are Dyson spheres.')
