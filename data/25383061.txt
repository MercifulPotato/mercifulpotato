Item(by='titzer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607668913, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25382354, text='&gt; is predicated on the assumption that: the government can use your dollar more effectively than you can at creating an equitable [wild, wild] world.<p>When you realize the &quot;you&quot; isn&#x27;t you as an individual--a middle, or upper-middle class person who might see another dollar in taxation--but the &quot;you&quot; is mega corporations and billionaires who only use their money in pursuit of more profit and building walled gardens to keep the grubby masses away, that might soften this hard-line libertarian view a bit. Corporations are soulless and amoral. And they have been caught time and time again sacrificing people&#x27;s livelihoods, health and safety, mental and physical, to their bottom line. Corporations are also responsible for the vast majority of pollution on this planet and produce 100% of the trash littering the oceans. (you won&#x27;t find a mom&amp;pop&#x27;s root beer can floating out there, anywhere).<p>In general I&#x27;ve found that my 20s libertarian view was highly biased to an underlying assumption that my experience is typical, and that the only thing that needed fixing was getting the government out of &quot;my&quot; life and wallet, and that everything would just magically follow from my own personal freedom. The reality is that every one of these typical people are very small fish buffeted and cajoled by advertising and the abusive power of rich people.')
