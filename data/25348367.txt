It also poses ugly questions for teams who need certified processes or strict security requirements.<p>I could be missing something and I don’t think the motivations are strictly mercantile, but this does make CentOS Stream much less appealing (compared to RHEL) than CentOS 7&#x2F;8. I am personally not that affected by all this (my org uses RHEL) but it’s a huge hassle for a good number of serious CentOS users.')
