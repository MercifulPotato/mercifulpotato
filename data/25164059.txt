Right now, we exclusively use Tapioca for gem RBIs and we don&#x27;t use any `srb rbi` tooling at Shopify. That works perfectly fine, but you don&#x27;t get any `sorbet-typed` RBIs, which, right now is not a concern for us.<p>The DSL generators are not 100% complete to fully replace `sorbet-rails` right now, but we are preparing a 1.0 release of the gem that should be able to do that.')
