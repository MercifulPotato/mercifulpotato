I don&#x27;t live in the US. I used to have an US phone number when I travelled there, but I don&#x27;t anymore. I tried setting up a Twilio phone number but they told me that won&#x27;t do.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a service that allows me to rent a &quot;non-voip&quot; phone number but all I find are shady websites, and this website https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dtmf.io&#x2F; which seems to provide exactly the service that I need except it&#x27;s for UK numbers and they&#x27;re out of numbers anyway. I don&#x27;t know if I will just have to resign to write a lot of angry messages to my bank until I get tired or they happen to find a magic switch that allows me to receive messages to my local phone number or to my jmp.chat number')
