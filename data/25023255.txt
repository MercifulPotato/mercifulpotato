Afaik, all the states that legalized it did so through initiatives(ca, ak, or, wa, co), and then forced the changes on the state by voting for them.<p>I think the other states are getting on board because of the incredible new found tax revenue, and the stats showing crime didn&#x27;t go up in those states. More states would certainly have legal pot by now, if they could decide who gets to get rich from it (ie: who gets the golden tickets to grow and sell). NY is a great example of how the politics of where the wealth will go has turned the process into a quagmire.')
