Item(by='__blockcipher__', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611268661, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865291, text='&gt; It seems reasonable to me at least to say: you can use this software for free, but you can&#x27;t resell it. If you want professional support, please support someone who is maintaining the software.<p>Well, first of all I disagree that that&#x27;s reasonable, but let&#x27;s be clear here:<p>any license with a non-commerciality provision is not open source. This is explicitly part of the open source definition:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.org&#x2F;osd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.org&#x2F;osd</a><p>&gt; 6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor<p>&gt; The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.<p>This is why Elasticsearch and Kibana are no longer open source; you have a choice of two proprietary licenses if you want to use their version.')
