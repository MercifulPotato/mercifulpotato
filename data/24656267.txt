Gamasutra had an interview with Ed Logg last year where he talked about hardware limitations.  A portion from it:<p>&quot;Logg: There were no difficult or technical issues. Of course there were limitations such as the amount of stuff I could draw and still update the game at 60Hz. The limited RAM also limited the number of asteroids I could draw so you may see some large asteroids go away with a single shot if the screen if full.<p>There was issue of the spot killer that was interesting. The spot killer was a feature added so that if the game crashed when the beam was on that it did not burn a hole in the phosphor on the screen. Thus I needed to have enough deflection on the screen so the spot killer did not turn off the beam. Therefore I put the copyright on the bottom of the screen and the scores at the top.<p>However, no one told me how much deflection was actually needed and I found out later this was not quite enough, so on some games the screen would dim if the player ship and the3 remaining asteroids were at the right spots on the screen.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamasutra.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;DavidCraddock&#x2F;20190913&#x2F;350030&#x2F;Outstanding_Ideas_Ed_Logg_on_Asteroids_and_Gauntlet.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamasutra.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;DavidCraddock&#x2F;20190913&#x2F;35003...</a>')
