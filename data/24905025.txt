He&#x27;s enthusiastic about making YouTube videos, but doesn&#x27;t understand the nuance of copyright law or the ToS.<p>For example, the first thing he did after I helped him set up OBS was to fire up a game + Spotify to make a live stream.  I had to explain to him why he&#x27;s not allowed to stream music like that.  He doesn&#x27;t do it now, but there&#x27;s still a decent chance his channel that gets 5 views per video will get struck or banned for a similar misunderstanding in the future.<p>He doesn&#x27;t know much (under 10) beyond using the Windows Game Bar or OBS to upload something and doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of spare storage, so he doesn&#x27;t keep copies of videos anyway.  I download them so if he gets banned I have an archive and can help him set up a new channel on another platform.<p>I know it&#x27;ll be easy for someone to say &quot;do X, Y, and Z&quot; then, but the reality is that it doesn&#x27;t take much for it to become &quot;not fun&quot; for younger kids and the opportunity to encourage them to learn valuable skills like video editing, etc. are lost when they lose interest.')
