A risk ratio less than 1.0 means that the treatment reduced the risk (or was correlated with this), and above 1.0 means that the treatment increased the risk (or was correlated with this).<p>Since the risk ratio of treatment was 0.05, there was a 0.95 reduction in risk, which is where the 95% number comes from.')
