We&#x27;re all discussing contemporary Liberia. Some of us are not even discussing Liberia, but Africa in general. And Africa as a whole, is not like Liberia at all, it&#x27;s extremely diverse and different from itself. Eswatini, Libya, Ethiopia, and Liberia couldn&#x27;t be more different from each other.
