No one else wants to enter the arena. No one wants to even come close. If there were viable alternatives, I would use them.<p>I live in NYC where Walmart is banned so we&#x27;re left with the Mom-and-Pop stores + the permitted national retailers like Walgreens and CVS both of which charge multiples over products available on Amazon. We&#x27;re talking like 300% more for items like toothpaste and other toiletries. And in-store experiences that flat-out suck. Everyone knows this and that&#x27;s why practically no one cares about Amazon&#x27;s bad PR or their questionable HR practices behind the scenes. In one ear and out the other.<p>Execution and customer service is everything and right now and Amazon&#x27;s execution for customers has been amazing for a long time now. This isn&#x27;t like a 37Signals space where you can one-down the competition. You one-up or go bust. I can&#x27;t sympathize with your situation without more details being shared. Whatever your response was to that case must not have been up to Amazon&#x27;s standards. It seems unlikely they would randomly pick on revenue generating sellers without cause.')
