Index funds buy stock and never sell it. It&#x27;s real money, buying real shares, that takes the stock out of circulation, that don&#x27;t get day traded.<p>Anyway, not to be caught in semantics, but I believe stocks can be priced high and very high, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it has to fall. The index fund system props up the prices forever.')
