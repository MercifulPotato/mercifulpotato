Don&#x27;t tie your own raise to someone else not performing. That&#x27;s the point I am making. Ask for what you deserve based on what YOU think you are worth. Otherwise, you are basically saying &quot;The other person who is shitty gets paid more than me. I am less shitty than them. So pay me more&quot;.')
