But with a desktop..<p>macOS is so pissing me off, half the file system is being locked down, Apple makes exceptions for their own stuff (like the recent thing where they disable network filtering for their apps). Every app has to be sent to Apple for notarisation, and much more.<p>I got into macOS because it was a great POSIX system with great desktop apps and a consistent UI. But Apple is making it into an iPad with keyboard now. The UI is getting more and more bulky, apps are being dumbed down (and promoting even dumber iOS ports) etc. The NeXT underpinnings are neglected. The benefit is gone.<p>I chose FreeBSD over Linux because most mainstream distros are doing the same thing. Ubuntu is pushing snap too much, redhat is pushing systemd into everything. I don&#x27;t want this commercial control again, even though it&#x27;s not as bad as on Windows. Windows 10 has similar crap like Apple, forced updates, telemetry etc.<p>Also I like FreeBSD&#x27;s consistent environment and excellent documentation among many other things.')
