Many consider &quot;effective moderation&quot; a purge of everyone who doesn&#x27;t adhere completely to their cultural orthodoxy.  Others think that if a platform so chooses it should be allowed to host any and all voices that don&#x27;t spam or break any laws.  Unfortunately the former are authoritarians who believe they have the right to deprive the latter from making that decision (and they currently hold the reigns of power in Silicon Valley and Washington DC).')
