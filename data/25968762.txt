Users promised $x in exchange for stock. RH have their $x. RH needs to make good on the exchange or clearing house. Seems to me that risk runs the other way... Other brokers&#x2F;clearing house participants might be unable to pay RH users because leverage + a unexpectedly high stock price.<p>I understand why RH would shut down leverage. After that point, I don&#x27;t understand why&#x2F;how stock purchases represent a risk to anyone but the buyer. How is the non-leveraged side creating a risk of nonpayment? I really don&#x27;t know how any of this works though, so let&#x27;s leave this all aside. Lets grant that RH&#x2F;users are at risk of being unable to cover trades.<p>So what? GME buys on RH create a scenario that risks RH running out of money. So what? Why&#x2F;how does this risk the clearing houses? It&#x27;s a $20bn stock. A 2% move in any of the big companies is a $20bn.')
