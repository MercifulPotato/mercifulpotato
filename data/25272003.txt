The big issue for me was Does key exist? -&gt; No -&gt; Upload object with key.  Followed by Get key -&gt; Not found.   Less rarely, I&#x27;d see Upload object followed by an overwrite object, followed by a download download some combination of the two if the download was segmented (like AWS&#x27;s cli will do).<p>The first one happened often enough to cause problems, the second one was a fairly rare event, but still had to be handled.<p>It might have been more of an issue with &quot;large&quot; buckets.  The bucket in particular where I had to dance around the missing object issue had ~100 million fairly small objects.  I ended up having to create a database to track if objects exist so no consumer would ever try to see if a non-existent object existed.<p>Time to revisit all that mess, I suppose.')
