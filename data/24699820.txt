I haven&#x27;t always worked at a FAANG company though -- before I did I appreciated the upward pressure FAANG companies were putting on salaries.<p>I took another look at your comment I replied to, I must have glossed over the &quot;If they have not ties to the party, they shouldnt have tried to compete&quot; part. I apologize. I want to be clear that I&#x27;m not suggesting these companies shouldn&#x27;t compete, I&#x27;m glad for all of the employers we have in tech. What I am suggesting is that they pay the price the market for that talent is currently willing to bear and if that results in less concentrated ownership for the ones that eventually do come to dominate the industry I won&#x27;t be losing any sleep. For those that think current giants are &quot;unbeatable&quot; -- current FAANG companies were tiny and irrelevant 20 years ago and the industry was dominated by a different set of &quot;unbeatable&quot; giants.')
