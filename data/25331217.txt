Item(by='corobo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607340790, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25330951, text='&gt; Is there a good way to broadcast to Twitch, YouTube, and Reddit simultaneously?<p>Yes (disc: I dunno about reddit, do they have livestreams? haha I had no idea) restream.io is one service that does this, or you can configure your own nginx-rtmp<p>&gt; Is it a bad idea to target multiple communities?<p>Probably, the way you&#x27;re suggesting. Find your niche and stream on the site they use. You&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;re talking to nobody most of the time unless your users gather in one place. Viewers (ok, it&#x27;s me) don&#x27;t like it when you answer a question from someone and can&#x27;t see what the question was. At least factor that in if you go down this path - re-state the question<p>&gt; How expensive is it to run your own single-tenant stream on your own website?<p>Almost zero because nobody will watch it<p>&gt; Is that a bad idea?<p>Not really but it might be a waste of time<p>&gt; Are users revolting on Twitch against the ads and RIAA take downs?<p>Nah everyone else has forgotten and moved on. At the least folks don&#x27;t care enough for there to be an uproar about it<p>&gt; Or is it unlikely to ever be unseated?<p>Twitch unseated? On the heading they&#x27;re on now, probably. Literally all they need to do is stop ads and push subs and they&#x27;ll be locked in for generations. A single sub is worth like 2500 ad views and people gift them in 5s, 10s, 20s like it&#x27;s going out of style.. what are they even doing with this ad focus? The only ads I even see are ads for Amazon Prime shows I&#x27;ve already watched anyway! Who&#x27;s even paying for these??')
