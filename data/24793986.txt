What I want is for linux to be a true alternative to windows or macOS for all users - not only the tech-savy. The goal should be for someone like my mom or my wife to be handed a linux based machine and for her to not see it as a scary thing, but as a viable daily driver.<p>I&#x27;d argue that your comment is somewhat elitist - what does it even mean to say that someones interest are &quot;primarily superficial and not aligned with the core values and spirit of linux&#x2F;foss&quot;? Plenty of linux users already care about how their interface looks, that does not mean that they don&#x27;t care about open source.')
