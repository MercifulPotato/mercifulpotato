I work at one of the companies he lists as prestigious, and I think most of my co-workers consider Stripe to be a top company to work at and very competitive to get into. A lot have in fact left to go work for them, because they have a reputation for having good career growth and great engineers. If I decided to go somewhere else, that’s actually where I would send my resume first.')
