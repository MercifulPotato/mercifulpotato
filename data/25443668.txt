They only need one place ( cough centralised cough ) where their customer can easily find them, have all the relevant information, ( Email, Tele, Opening Time etc ), and a small space for newest update. Which could be special menu once in a while. And that is it. It is the same thing as most business dont need an App.<p>I feel like what you described is just a website. The &quot;one place&quot; to find businesses is your local search engine. Sure, a website isn&#x27;t free, but if your business makes any amount of money whatsoever, the costs of hosting and maintenance will be a rounding error.<p>I could be overestimating people&#x27;s willingness to leave the Facebook walled-garden, but to be fair, I&#x27;ve never used Facebook proper to find more information on products or businesses.')
