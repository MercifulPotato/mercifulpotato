However, whats even cooler is that Tramp can execute remote commands.  IOW, if you edit a file in a remote directory, you can also use M-x compile RET to run a remote build process and see the output in your Emacs <i>Compilation</i> buffer.  If the paths pritned are relative, you can even use M-x next-error RET to jump to a build error location.')
