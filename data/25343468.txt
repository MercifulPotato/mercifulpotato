Item(by='danShumway', descendants=None, kids=[25363977], score=None, time=1607420307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25343400, text='Two problems:<p>A) That is an extremely dangerous road to encourage law enforcement to go down. &quot;Charged with&quot; is not the same as a conviction, and resisting arrest is a broad category that can encompass a wide variety of behaviors. Police in most instances should judge danger based on the current information they have, based on who is actively presenting a threat -- not based on whether or not someone was <i>charged</i> with something in the past. I can go into more detail on that if you want, but... I don&#x27;t really think it should be hard to figure out why that would be problematic.<p>B) Even ignoring the above point, your comment is exactly the kind of off-topic change I was warning about. This thread was started by someone claiming that Rebekah&#x27;s <i>whistleblowing</i> was justified and that it was worth throwing financial aid her way because she was doing the right thing. It was followed by another commenter questioning why she deserved aid, and as evidence that she didn&#x27;t, that commenter devolved into a personal attack over her previous criminal record. Now we&#x27;re debating whether the police used excessive force and whether they should have been scared of her.<p>The thread is off topic. The point is, the police shouldn&#x27;t have done a raid over a crime this minor in the first place. Rebekah&#x27;s previous criminal record doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the severity of the crime that caused this raid. The conversation over how police should have acted during the raid is a distraction from the original point that this was not the kind of crime that warranted breaking down someone&#x27;s door and pointing a gun at their family.<p>&quot;battery against a police officer&quot; in a completely separate case does not change that point. It&#x27;s irrelevant information to what we&#x27;re currently talking about.')
