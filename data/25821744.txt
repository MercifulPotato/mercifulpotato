That&#x27;s crazy I always understood looking to be about stopping unhealthy discussions etc. not to prevent bu reports.<p>My main gripe with stale bots is that some have incredibly short timelimits attached to them. We were arguing about the expectations from users on maintainers to fix their issues immediately and I was strongly arguing that users can expect oss maintainers who are not compensated for their work to just jump.<p>But there is also the other side to it, if I report a bug and the maintainer gets to it and ask for some more information (sometime quite extensive) to close the bug because I didn&#x27;t reply within a week.
