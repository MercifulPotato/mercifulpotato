My only request is that this doesn&#x27;t happen in every single thread regardless of whether it is relevant or not. (To be clear, I am &quot;guilty&quot; of the former myself; there are a handful of topics that I have a particular opinion about and I don&#x27;t hesitate to share them even if I have mentioned them many times before. I just try to not bring them up in places where they clearly have no connection to what&#x27;s being talked about.)')
