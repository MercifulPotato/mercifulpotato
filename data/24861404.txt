Internet is the best means of learning today, they are deprived of it.<p>Heck even top universities don&#x27;t have good infrastructure in India.<p>Our maid&#x27;s daughter wants to take up CS after high school, she saw us working on laptops from a young age I guess, but her mother cannot afford to pay for college fees + a laptop + broadband.<p>India&#x27;s silicon valley, Bangalore, cannot provide its residents uninterrupted power 24x7 in 2020, villages are lucky to get 5 hours of power a day. Can you believe large tech parks in Bangalore run on Diesel generators ?<p>There are hardly a few datacenters  and associated jobs in India, reason - hardware and bandwidth is prohibitively expensive, cause - taxation.  Think of all the small jobs that would be created in the surrounding ecosystem (foodcarts, cafes)<p>When the govt only talks and doesn&#x27;t walk the walk, most high skilled Indians leave country due to lack of opportunities, not only would their spending create jobs more importantly it drains the country of mentors for the young.<p>China is going head to head with the US in AI and world class software products, despite their handicap in English, where is India ?')
