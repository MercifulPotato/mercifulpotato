I know for a contact smartcard if I try to perform an operation with the card not present, I get a prompt to insert the card, and then I get a prompt to enter the PIN when inserting the card and continuing. A contactless card in a ring form-factor is unlikely to be on the reader for long, though... is gnupg aware of contactless readers and will it e.g. ask for your PIN without the card being present and then prompt you to tap the card?<p>I&#x27;m aware that&#x27;s what Android apps like OpenKeychain do, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find much information on how gnupg&#x2F;pinentry&#x2F;etc behave with contactless cards.')
