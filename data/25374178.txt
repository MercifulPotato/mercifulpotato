I&#x27;ve never heard of any such system; I don&#x27;t think states in general communicate with each other and do automatic unregistrations like this.<p>Googling, I found this:<p>&gt; Since the U.S. has a very mobile population and voters rarely inform election officials when they move, voters can often be on the voter rolls in two (or more) different states at one time. Unless states have an efficient way of communicating with one another, itâ€™s possible that they may not be able to identify an individual who is on the rolls in two different states.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncsl.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;elections-and-campaigns&#x2F;double-voting.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncsl.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;elections-and-campaigns&#x2F;double...</a><p>&gt; You describe it as &quot;ridiculously easy,&quot; but you seem to be unaware of the protections that are in place.<p>It is true I have never actually tried it, so I should say it <i>seems</i> like it would be ridicuously easy.
