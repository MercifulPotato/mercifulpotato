There is an infinite amount of paperwork that results from being paid in stock, and while it&#x27;s obviously worth it for $200,000 a year on top of your base salary and bonus... it is still kind of a hassle.  You have to file with the IRS your plan for selling shares (so they know you&#x27;re not making insider trades), you can only access your money inside trading windows (unless you set up the aforementioned auto-sale or other trading plan), and your taxes become a $700 ordeal with tax professionals every year.  Honestly, I just did my taxes myself and I messed them up one year.  It takes the IRS 3 or so years to notice, and then one day you have a sternly-worded letter from the government demanding $60,000 immediately because your brokerage sent the IRS incorrect paperwork.  Then you pay someone to fix that, then your state says &quot;whoa, the IRS just got $60,000 from you! we want our cut!&quot; and then you say &quot;no no, those papers I mailed you a year ago show that they were wrong&quot;, then you wait a year... and get a $30 check in the mail because it turns out they owe YOU money.  It&#x27;s a big pain.  My TL;DR is you don&#x27;t know how much you owe, the government doesn&#x27;t know how much you owe, and you will have to pay someone to take a guess that the IRS agrees with, and hope they agree.  If they don&#x27;t, be ready to pay even more money to persuade them that they are wrong.<p>I miss the days where I got a W-2 and filed a 1040EZ.  It&#x27;s ultimately worth it to take the stock, of course, but it&#x27;s kind of a hassle.  My advice is to find an accountant your first year at a FAANG and let them handle everything.  Don&#x27;t do it yourself.')
