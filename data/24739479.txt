Passing a new immigration bill is very hard since there are so many competing interests benefiting from the status quo and there is very little to gain electorally.<p>The current administration tried using executive action and regulatory approaches to fulfil their agenda and both keep getting struck down in courts. The new upward revision in wage levels are also expected to have the same fate. There is simply very little regulatory leeway on H1B visas since they are encoded in law.<p>It is highly unlikely for a  democratic administration to spend political capital changing H1B when they have bigger priorities (healthcare).<p>At the end of the day, Indians are the only affected population on H1B due to backlogs and aren&#x27;t a strategic voting bloc for democrats. Everyone else gets a green card in a couple of years anyways. They are more focused on undocumented and family based immigration.<p>A broken immigration system and the H1B status quo is expected to last for a while unless there are external factors (collapse in international student numbers, US emigration, US companies moving jobs out of the country) forcing action.')
