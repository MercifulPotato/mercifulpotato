If you&#x27;re on a new project and that&#x27;s the stack you pick it can work well for a while but as soon as your product is large enough you get multiple GraphQL api&#x27;s built by different teams that don&#x27;t behave in a similar fashion. If you&#x27;re in an org with historical code now you&#x27;ve got APIs that are RESTful and then some which are GraphQL based. Making those work together is either a hack on the frontend or a rewrite project.<p>Ultimately the thing that speeds up teams, again in my experience, is predictability not flexibility. If you tell someone they have a RESTful API they know exactly how to work with it, document it, etc. GraphQL which is shiny, new, and used by in-vogue orgs is fine, you can use it to get the job done, but I don&#x27;t believe that it warrants much praise.')
