We&#x27;re more interested in fuzzy searching, addresses and points of interest.<p>Street numbers seems like a pretty big weakness for open source datasets. If all you have is the name of a 1km street, you only get 1km precision.<p>The APIs from other commercial providers (e.g. TomTom) have better data, but noticeably worse search. I don&#x27;t think they make their raw data available except for very large deals.')
