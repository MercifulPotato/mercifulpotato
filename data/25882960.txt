While I like higher-end pens, I scatter pens all over the house and (normally) leave them in hotel rooms, in various luggage, etc. so I really prefer something that&#x27;s pretty disposable. Still, a nice list and maybe I&#x27;ll give something else a try. (And I see there are a couple other Uni-balls on the list.)')
