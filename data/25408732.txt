It&#x27;s an unfounded rant with a question mark behind it.<p>So, let me counter with some questions.<p>What Linuxes did you try, that convinced you all of Linux is buggy and not one (release of) one distro?<p>What hardware are you running, on which the bugs surface? Is it a cheap, low end laptop with a stressed out motherboard, for example? Did you run other OSes on that same hardware to compare?<p>Is &#x27;networking&#x27; the only bug? Because if so, how does &#x27;one bug&#x27; equal to &#x27;full of bugs&#x27; or &#x27;buggy&#x27;?<p>Edit: to be clear: I&#x27;m not saying your troubles are not troublesome or the bugs you encounter dismissable; on contrary. I am trying to say that there are a lot of reasons for a bug and that debugging or troubleshooting requires elimination. You seem to have concluded that it is &quot;Linux&quot;, to have eliminated all other causes (a distro, a faulty setting, broken or buggy hardware, etc) which may be a fair assessment, but if you did, please give the details that made you conclude that.')
