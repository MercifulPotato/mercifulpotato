It&#x27;s running really smoothly with updated software.<p>The outside is prestine as it always has been. I used it extensively in cafes, but the battery is still fine. I work up to 8hrs a day with it and I love it.<p>Very hesitant to get a new once though. Especially with everyone still complaining!')
