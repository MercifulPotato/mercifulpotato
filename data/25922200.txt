The two events are very different. DOMInteractive is a legacy event that refers to the time when JavaScript can safely interact with the DOM. This really has nothing (or very little) to do with user experience.<p>Time to Interactive, on the other hand, is the time when a user can expect the page to respond quickly to interactions (clicks, scrolls, keypresses), ie, these user interactions should have no user perceivable latency. This is not a metric that has a corresponding browser event. It requires a bunch of post-processing based on various events. The researchers have made no attempt to calculate TTI.<p>Source: I&#x27;ve been working in this area of research for 15 years.')
