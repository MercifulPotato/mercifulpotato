Item(by='sebastien_b', descendants=None, kids=[25563576], score=None, time=1609187966, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25562894, text='They do look similar (enough to become a potential suspect, though I don&#x27;t think should be enough for a warrant), and given that police departments don&#x27;t &quot;protect&quot; their mugshots, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the picture was indeed reused (or photoshopped).<p>But I really wonder if the same officers that dealt with the suspect also questioned the innocent victim in this case - it seems like this wouldn&#x27;t be the case (and gross negligence on their part) - those people should&#x27;ve been able to tell them apart (instead of solely relying on the picture they got from the license). I think this is what the judge wanted instead of just the facial recognition &quot;evidence&quot; (which eventually led to the charges being dropped) - something like, oh I don&#x27;t know, the fingerprints from the abandoned vehicle? Basic investigative work, perhaps?')
