The article isn’t 100% clear it ‘only’ loses some data writes, but it also doesn’t explicitly say files not being written are affected, directory structures are corrupted, etc.<p>So, to me, it looks like WSL2 not completely flushing writes to the underlying file system. Bad, but not as bad as file system corruption (which could lead to losing all data on the disk)')
