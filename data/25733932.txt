Because they can cut Parler off just as easily as Amazon. Do they literally have to buy physical servers and host them on their own property somewhere? But then how do they get connected to the internet without going through some privately owned ISP that might cut them off? How do they register a domain without using a private corporation?<p>Basically, I&#x27;m asking how you can realistically &quot;self host&quot; without going through a private corporation that might decide to cut you off at some level in the stack?')
