If it&#x27;s badly wrong, you have power-plant sized energy feeds fighting each other â€” imagine a train wreck, two massive oversized freight trains smashing right into each other. It&#x27;s like that, but with electricity instead of a physical collision.<p>This can obviously cause major damage, so once you start deviating from the reference frequency by enough, it&#x27;s safer to just cut off the interconnects and go offline.')
