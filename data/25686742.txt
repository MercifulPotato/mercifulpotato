The AG got the financial info, found that tether was fully backed by dollars, and that the Tether company lent some of those dollars to the Bitfinex company, which is the basis of the NY AG lawsuit. Bitfinex has since issued tokens to cover the loan.<p>To say that the NY AG got the subpoena info (which would require more evidence than an audit and be under penalties of perjury as well) found no backing and let them continue a ponzi is to say that the NY AG is part of the conspiracy. So enough with the tin foil hattery.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;BitcoinMarkets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ksvlc3&#x2F;daily_discussion_friday_january_08_2021&#x2F;gijduzu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;BitcoinMarkets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ksvlc3&#x2F;dail...</a>')
