The most active critics come from political parties which don&#x27;t want that plant due to political reasons. Having a nearby nuclear plant effectively controlled by an ally of Putin is not a good thing and I agree with that, but this has nothing to do with safety. It&#x27;s all political play.<p>Ironically, a decade ago the same political parties which now oppose the Belarusian nuclear plant wanted to build a nuclear plant here in Lithuania. What&#x27;s more ironic was that the chosen location was just a couple of kilometers from the border of Belarus.<p>Personally I&#x27;m happy that Belarus managed to build the nuclear plant. In the end of the day, every new nuclear plant results in one less coal power plant somewhere.')
