I see that over and over again, dropouts seem to suffer from this life-long hangover about what could have been? They tend to over-appreciate the power of schooling or the power of college. In the same way, I might be under-appreciating my own degrees. Gates is the opposite of Peter Thiel who studiously climbed the educational ladder until he stumbled to see the light. Thiel is now one of the staunchest critics of college.</i><p>I have wondered the same, and often felt this longing for &quot;what could have been&quot; myself. (I&#x27;m a college dropout who pursued a rather unconventional startup path.) Even though I&#x27;ve found myself surprisingly well-equipped to tackle most challenges, even when working with researchers, I have a very strong sense of impostor syndrome. I feel that I <i>don&#x27;t know enough about what I don&#x27;t know</i>.<p>Sometimes, I think that if I&#x27;d spent more time learning, I would know <i>where to look</i> to learn the next thing. Perhaps this is just imagination.<p>I&#x27;m sure I would feel the same kind of longing had I spent more time in college. A funny predicament.<p>EDIT: If the page doesn&#x27;t load at first, reload the page. It should load right away.')
