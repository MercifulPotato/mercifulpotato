Everything is quite spread out on it... again I assume for cooling. It looks like cooling is either a major concern for this device, or that Sony over-engineered its cooling in order to prevent problems.<p>It&#x27;s heatsink, and PSU would&#x27;ve still pushed the outline past the PCB dimensions, so why not to go for a bigger, lower layer count, easier to route, and cheaper PCB?')
