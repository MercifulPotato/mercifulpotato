I haven&#x27;t had that happen to me, but it&#x27;s worth a try. Hold eject and next track for about 2 seconds; it may be easier than disconnecting the battery or pulling a fuse.<p>WARNING: The engineering menu starts a speaker test in a few seconds if you don&#x27;t cancel it, and it&#x27;s very loud. You want to cancel that.')
