Heck, maybe that is the same reasoning; there, at the place of infinity, is all the energy and mass which ever was in the universe, all in one place. And what do you get when the whole universe is all in one place? A big bang? Transforming from matter to light (via stars burning and eventually Hawking radiation from the last things remaining: black holes) carries all the energy in the universe off into the distance. Where does it go? Off into infinity. If you take infinity as a place that means it all goes to the same place? Then that process <i>is</i> the &quot;collapse&quot; which brings everything together into the same place ready to be turned into matter again? That&#x27;s my pop-science understanding of his proposal.')
