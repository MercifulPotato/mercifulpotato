You want to merge to trunk but there are conflicts.  The upstream library project L was changed in your branch but not in merged down by the submitter.<p>Even if P simply relies on a binary of L that is already in the artifact store, you still have to deal with merging this code down when normally you wouldn&#x27;t.<p>In fact, the much bigger issue is that you now must deal with the double edged sword of updating the entire org when a shared dependency must be updated.<p>Perhaps you even completed that task in your project branch.  Now you get to deal with merging into every project in the org that was touched.')
