If a large company hires only from Harvard, they just say that Harvard is non-discriminatory, so that policy is as well<p>It is just as easy to prove that a pro-elite-university hiring practice has a differential impact on a variety of protected classes as one that uses an IQ test, and there&#x27;s probably better evidence for lots of jobs that performance is predicted by IQ test results, to overcome the presumption of disparate impact discrimination from the differential impact.<p>IQ tests, however, have a greater cultural awareness of the potential for illegality, which probably translates to a greater risk of an employee talking to an attorney and thus a suit being filed in the first place.<p>Hiring from elite universities exclusively is a safer way to discriminate because there&#x27;s less chance that the victims will seek redress, not because it outsources responsibility.')
