Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not in the Apple ecosystem and tend to use my devices until they break, but I own a single device that uses usb-c: a raspberry pi 4b. There are two other usb-c ports in my house, one on my laptop and one on my desktop, but I&#x27;ve never used them. I don&#x27;t even own a separate usb-c cable (the pi charger is integrated).<p>I kind of dread making the switch for peripherals because I&#x27;m going to have to replace everything.')
