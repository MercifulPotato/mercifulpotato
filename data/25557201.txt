ARM isn&#x27;t highly customizable, since it has over 1000 instructions you must implement. RISC-V only has 47 instruction you must implement. All fairly simple ones.<p>I think this is a wrong comparison. There is a subtle difference here that is being missed.<p>CPU&#x27;s become bloated over time as they get used differently, as the applications shift, as they try to address newer areas. And with each iteration, they still have to support the legacy code. That is how you end up with thousands of instructions<p>It is easy to have a lesser instruction count when you are starting from scratch and have no legacy.<p>What is going to stop RISC-V from becoming another ARM or perhaps x86 even, in another couple of decades ? When it spans such a large application space that most of the extensions become default and the core becomes bloated ? Time for another ISA then.')
