Item(by='vetinari', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605281172, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25081623, text='&gt; Why would I care whether my program is on one disk or another? Why would I even &quot;install&quot; something, instead of dragging&#x2F;dropping a single &quot;file&quot; (yes I know it&#x27;s a directory) like I usually do.<p>Answer to your second question is very similar to the first one. Why should user drag anything anywhere, and decide to which folder put the applications? It is much easier to click on the install button in the store-like application.<p>Many users are confused by dmgs and they keep launching apps they downloaded from their ~&#x2F;Downloads folder.<p>&gt; Do Linux applications all self-update using Sparkle like Mac-applications do?<p>Linux applications were auto updated by their respective package managers before Sparkle was a thing. I consider keeping a Linux system updated to be much easier, than Mac one; even if it is updated by multiple mechanisms underneath (apt&#x2F;dnf, ostree, flatpak, fwupd), from the user&#x27;s POV it is unfied in the form of Gnome Software or KDE Discovery. On Mac, you have Apple App Store, Sparkle, brew, Microsoft Update, Adobe Update, Eclipse updater, and myriad of other mechanisms, specific to each app.<p>&gt; I input my apple-id on a new mac and everything sync perfectly without any issue. Do I get that in linux? One login and my mail, notes, calendar, photos, music, files, backups, keychain sync across all devices?<p>I don&#x27;t get that on a Mac. But then, I&#x27;m not locked into their products.<p>&gt; And also simpler UI-questions: Can I rightclick on a file&#x2F;folder and it says &quot;Compress to zip?&quot;<p>Yes, you can. In Gnome (default for Ubuntu, Fedora), you can right click a folder and there is a &quot;Compress...&quot; menu item. It will give you a choice of .zip, .tar.xz, .7z. I&#x27;m sure KDE has something similar.<p>&gt; Can I easily configure keyboard shortcuts system-wide?<p>Easily? There&#x27;s no system that would do that. Some are more flexible, but more difficult to configure, and vice-versa. MacOS goes into the less flexible one, for example I&#x27;ve never managed to have the media keys controlling VLC instead of launching iTunes, or Apple Music nowadays.<p>&gt; Can I have a photos-app that is as good as Apple Photos?<p>This is about the first time I see &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;Apple Photos&#x27; used in the same sentence.')
