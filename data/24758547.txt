I never want to give up remote work. It suits my personality perfectly. Remote meetings are great. They tend to be shorter, get to the point, and if they begin to ramble and I don&#x27;t need to engage, I can open up another tab and browse HN.<p>However, I do appreciate how lucky I am. My entire family are out of the house during my working hours. I have the luxury of a dedicated study in which I can work. I have multiple laptops and screens. I have a good webcam, microphone and speakers. I have an enormous desk for it all to sit on, and probably most importantly a fast and reliable broadband connection. I also have a dog to keep my company.<p>If working from home meant balancing a laptop on my knees while I sat on the edge of my bed, and tethered through my phone, I doubt I&#x27;d find it so pleasurable.')
