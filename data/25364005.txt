That would be subjective, to be sure, and perhaps challengeable, but I&#x27;m going to bet that Google had a <i>lot</i> of discussions with their legal team before taking this action.<p>tl;dr: being a &quot;platform&quot; is neither a Get Out of Lawsuits Free card nor a requirement for content to be unmoderated.')
