They have to hire people willing to work for peanuts. Like the circus, they take who they can get, from among people who need to be a part of the magic.<p>Meanwhile, game developers, as a rule, are interested in (surprise!) game development, not languages. What Rust brings to the table, few game developers are looking for. But Rust builds are notoriously glacial, where game developers are wedded to the edit-build-test cycle.<p>So, gaming will be one of the <i>last</i> places for Rust to thrive. That doesn&#x27;t mean no games will be in Rust. Rust coders will compete for jobs using it, rather than game shops competing for Rust coders.')
