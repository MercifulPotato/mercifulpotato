E.g., first four notes of the 1st movement of Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Symphony. To hear how a motive gets turned into a theme, listen to the next ten seconds of the 1st movement of Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Symphony.<p>texture: whether the music sounds relatively busy or bare at a given moment, using more granular terms for &quot;busy&quot; and &quot;bare&quot; as you learn more about music<p>modulation: ever wonder why Whitney Houston sounds more energetic at the last chorus of &quot;I Will Always Love You?&quot; It&#x27;s because she&#x27;s singing higher than before. But if she&#x27;s singing the same melody as in the other choruses slightly higher, how could this possibly sound good? It&#x27;s because the rest of the band also shifted everything up by the same frequency ratio as she did, at the same moment. When everyone does this together, it&#x27;s called changing keys, or modulation.<p>However, &quot;pushing a button&quot; to suddenly pitch everything up on a dime is a relatively recent discovery that has flourished thanks to the ubiquity of cheap and powerful computers. Prior to that, composers used ad hoc methods like transitional themes to prepare the listener for the new key, sometimes going so far as to read the music of peers in a desperate attempt for new approaches. It was quite an inefficient and unproductive time by comparison to the speed and precision with which we produce music today!')
