I&#x27;ve been on 16gb since...well as long as I can remember.<p>Every time I upgrade I&#x27;m jumping from DDR2 to 3 to 4 and probably soon 5.  So its not like I keep the sticks anyway.  Even when I stay on DDR4 I have to upgrade because the speed of the RAM is too slow to feed the processor.  Its unfortunately rare for me to not have to buy RAM with a new CPU.')
