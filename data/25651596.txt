If you have a really good spectrum analyzer, you&#x27;ll be able to spot the occasional cellular traffic, but by and large the spectrum that has been auctioned off to corporate owners goes almost entirely to waste.<p>50 years ago when fixed-frequency narrowband receivers were all we had, this made sense. It was a necessary compromise. Nobody needed bandwidth but everybody needed a dedicated frequency to accommodate their primitive hardware. Today it&#x27;s the opposite, and the relative usage of ISM bands vs everything else proves it. The radio-frequency situation makes the real-estate markets with block after block of unoccupied apartments look downright efficient by comparison. We need to fix this.')
