There are custom Mavericks kernels that work on modern Ryzen processors, for instance[1].<p>The graphics side of things is admittedly a bit more worrisome—macOS doesn&#x27;t work with all that many GPUs, and none of the driver code is open source. Graphics acceleration isn&#x27;t strictly necessary, but you will have a gimped experience without it.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;macintoshgarden.org&#x2F;apps&#x2F;custom-kernels-ryzen-processors" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;macintoshgarden.org&#x2F;apps&#x2F;custom-kernels-ryzen-proces...</a>')
