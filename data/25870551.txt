Telegram&#x27;s native applications really make a difference here, they are a cut above the rest compared to today&#x27;s messaging offerings, in my opinion.<p>Hence my messaging and contents to some extent is governed by which app I use, but I don&#x27;t ask my Signal contacts to use Telegram because if we&#x27;re both chatting on Signal, we know why. Vice-versa, I don&#x27;t ask Telegram contacts to use Signal because in general those chats are with my SO and friends who need overall security that&#x27;s feature-rich but not bulletproof 24&#x2F;7.<p>That being said, I appreciate the article clearing up the technical differences for a wider non-technical audience, I do have a feeling however that when users experience both apps they&#x27;ll make a decision to use them based on UX&#x2F;UI more than anything else (skewing towards security or features as they personally see fit).')
