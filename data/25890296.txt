But, I&#x27;ve yet to see a good tool that only enforces format on new&#x2F;changed lines; and a reformat en masse is asking for trouble.<p>However, the arguments about a consistent style giving you benefits seems to fall flat when you&#x27;ve got dependencies that don&#x27;t follow your style. If you&#x27;re in go, and everyone uses gofmt, and always has, I guess that solves that. But you probably still have some code that&#x27;s not in go (the OS you run on, at least), and that&#x27;s probably not consistent. And if you&#x27;re not in Go, you may have a different required style than your libraries and your language environment and nothing is consistent anyway; so why enforce anything beyond best effort blend in with the surrounding context?')
