Item(by='ACow_Adonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602967155, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24812878, text='um, I&#x27;d argue respectfully that &quot;unprecedentedly dangerous&quot; is the phrase approaching the delusional.<p>when this whole thing started,  I did what any self respecting analyst would do: try to calculate the numbers and calculate the likely outcomes and risks (primarily to my own family).<p>And I kept arriving at the conclusion: it&#x27;s statistically bad in the sense of spread and infectiousness, but as a virus and comparative lethality it&#x27;s not THAT bad.  The main danger was from responses&#x2F;strongly compressed infection timing, and assuming you didn&#x27;t overreact and your health system held out, if your family were in their 50s or younger and healthy,  existentially it wasn&#x27;t much worse than the flu (and for the youngest, possibly even less dangerous).<p>but what I was scared of was the human response.<p>Because it targets the old and infirm, and because they largely control most wealth and power,  and because we largely don&#x27;t have mature ways of dealing with mortality in common cultural discourse, and because a lot of our countries have become increasingly partisan, I figured the response would probably be bad&#x2F;chaotic&#x2F; and have lots of badly targeted over-reactions, unintended consequences, and probably a lot of name calling, fear mongering and virtue signalling.  our media has just gone crazy.<p>6 months later (and in the lockdown in Melbourne), I stand by most of my initial judgements. One problem locally (and maybe NZ shares this problem,  I dunno), it&#x27;s that the trump&#x2F;Johnson swing to the right&#x2F;populism left the opposition (we have Labor in power locally too, so the opposition is conservative) being relatively flirting with anti-science and anti-int\ntellectualism as well as general juvenile behaviour and responses, so even though one might not fully support local actions (I don&#x27;t fully support the lockdown extents in both Melbourne or NZ long term), there isn&#x27;t really a viable political alternative presented either.')
