Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606223247, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25196771, text='&gt;The wide availability of guns seems to be one of the major underlying reasons for the evil police.<p>What?<p>Wrongful police shootings may dominate the headlines but they are a rounding error compared to asset forfeiture abuse, discriminatory enforcement, lesser forms of police violence and good ol&#x27; influence peddling.  For everyone that&#x27;s shot for no good reason there&#x27;s hundreds of people who are unnecessarily roughed up, tazed or just have their money taken under color of law (I consider a fishing stop that ends in a BS ticket instead of a warning to be in the latter category).')
