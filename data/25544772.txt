This will then be about nine times bulkier and three times heavier than a typical 7.5-gallon gasoline tank.

This is especially important at higher speeds: the energy required to accelerate a large mass can by recovered with a high efficiency using regenerative braking, while the friction of a bulky vehicle with air is lost (alternatively, passengers will drive a larger vehicle than required since the internal space is insuficient).')
