Email is totally insufficient for sending unencrypted secrets, so it shouldn&#x27;t be thought safe to store them either. Many email clients will cache your mail unencrypted on your disk as well.<p>It&#x27;s actually better that people start to treat their mailboxes as somewhat ephemeral, as communicating that you are you encourages use of things like PGP signatures.   And then people can send encrypted email for things that are worth keeping secret.')
