Great e.g. for backing up VM images or encrypted containers where only a small part of the file change - only that small part will be resent between snapshots. Chunking algo is &quot;content-defined&quot;, can probabilistically quite efficiently detect shifted chunks and duplicated chunks across different files.<p>(Naturally, all this machinery will also handle the simple cases of renamed and duplicated files on your filesystem)')
