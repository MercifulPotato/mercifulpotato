At the time I was doing freelancing to sustain myself, studying, and also being a funder in a startup with no income. It was a very hard time for me and I didn’t really have anyone close with whom I could share what I was going through.<p>Luckily, I found a very good channel called The Anxiety Guy who helped me so much to understand my anxiety better and slowly heal. It’s been a few years since then and I did a lot of progress. I am still healing, but I am nowhere close to where I was a few years back and it’s all thanks to his channel and some friends who were there for me.<p>Now, why I am writing this… I am a Software Developer and what I realized is that I am not the only one who experiences stress at work. I think I am in a place now where I have learned quite a bit about anxiety and know some tools which work for me and believe it can also work for other people. I would love to share these tools and what I do daily in order to reduce my stress at work.<p>That’s why I started a podcast called The Anxious Developer - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2IPPzzx. If you are a developer like me and are struggling with stress, you are welcome to join me on this journey, so together we can overcome anxiety and build a healthy relationship with work where we feel calm and productive.<p>I just published my first episode - 6 Things you can do daily to lower your stress as a Software Developer! - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3lS5NGP<p>Hope you take something valuable from it. Have a wonderful day, Love you!')
