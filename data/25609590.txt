Our selection process for politicians is driven by how good they are at attracting votes, not how good they are at handling problems. Politicians are aware of this and just exploit it constantly.<p>- our people will not become reasonable. A sizable percentage of the population don&#x27;t believe covid19 is different from flu, another does not want to take vaccines.<p>- corporations want to get the most out of it. A full blown pandemic is in their best interest. All those covid tests and vaccines pile up. Even better if they can convince us the vaccine only lasts one season!<p>So the bottom line for me is: if I am convinced the vaccine is safe and effective, just be careful and dodge the disease as long as I can get a vaccine.<p>There is not much more to it, and I focus my energies somewhere else.<p>Of course if everyone was like me, the pandemic would be over by now. But that&#x27;s not the case and hoping in something that will not happen, like the author does in this piece, is fruitless.')
