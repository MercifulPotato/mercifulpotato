Every file would have different kinds of pure data (e.g. scanned picture and OCRed text), metadata (e.g. title, author, ISBN&#x2F;etc IDs, ToC etc) and user-generated annotations in separate streams. But our actual world is not ideal, we mix everything into one stream for every document and allow the apps modify it every time we view it.')
