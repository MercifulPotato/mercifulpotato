I don&#x27;t know what social media circles you&#x27;ve participated in for the past 5 years, but it seems clearly the opposite case to me. There is an overwhelmingly large group of people online who equivocate Mike Pence with Nazism, and they regularly call for punching and killing of anyone who has that label. Last August, a Trump supporter was killed at a Portland BLM protest, where afterwards into the microphone the organizer yelled &quot;I am not sad that a f*cking fascist died tonight. He was a f*cking Nazi. Our community held its own and took out the trash.&quot; Many young people praised this. I do not believe the remarks would have been different if it were Pence in the same situation.')
