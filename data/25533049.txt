Illuminants B and C are attempts to approximate daylight by putting a colored liquid filter in front of the black body radiator (or incandescent bulb). Illuminant B is a simulation of tropical noon daylight, while Illuminant C is a simulation of average daylight at a higher latitude (more contribution from the sky, less from direct sunlight).<p>Illuminant C was widely used in colorimetry, but it didn&#x27;t match real measured daylight spectra especially closely, so the D illuminants are a replacement based on some physical measurements taken in Rochester (where Kodak was based) and London. Colorimetric applications that previously used illuminant C mostly switched to D65 instead.<p>(Note that real outdoor daylight spectra vary dramatically depending on place, time, and weather conditions.)<p>For details, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Standard_illuminant" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Standard_illuminant</a><p>&gt; <i>reason D65 is chosen for the sRGB white point is that it is fairly accurate, in other words it&#x27;s pretty close to the actual white point of the monitor I&#x27;m looking at now (Dell P2415Q).</i><p>There is also influence the other way. Monitors have a D65 white point to match the spec.')
