Wikipedia (which gets true&#x2F;false questions wrong half the time) says (emphasis added):<p>Uranium-232 (232 U) is an isotope of uranium. It has a half-life of around 68.9 years and is a side product in the thorium cycle. <i>It has been cited as an obstacle to nuclear proliferation using 233U as the fissile material, because the intense gamma radiation emitted by 208Tl (a daughter of 232U, produced relatively quickly) makes the 233U contaminated with it more difficult to handle.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Uranium-232" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Uranium-232</a><p>PS, HN, Y U NO blockquote?!?!')
