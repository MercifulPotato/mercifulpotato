I just ran a game and pinged the instance that was streaming (120.37.116.136), funny enough it ping was worse (8ms) than the ping to stadia.com (3ms). Also the IP is no longer pingable once you stop streaming the game. MTR shows something like 20 nodes inbetween me and the instance compared to 6 with stadia.com.')
