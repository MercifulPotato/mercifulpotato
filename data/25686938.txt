I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll convince others with that tact. Dominion has yet to dispute any of the findings in this report, despite the Michigan judiciary giving them an opportunity to do so before its release in December. But this is exactly the nature of the discourse:<p>Group A: Group B has no evidence, they&#x27;re trying to undermine the integrity of our electoral process, etc.<p>Group B: Here&#x27;s some evidence. Maybe we should investigate? Just to make sure everything is on the up and up?<p>Group A: Your evidence is from person X, which my news source has already conveniently done their best to discredit. My news source has already debunked your claims as well. Group B has no evidence, undermining integrity, etc.<p>Sadly Georgia has not yet ordered a forensic analysis of their voting machines. However, in that report I linked to, there was an exceptionally high ballot rejection rate for that Dominion voting machine in Michigan requiring ballot adjudication. When you have a state like Georgia, which just relaxed rules regarding signature verification and ballot curing, this poses a real problem in verifying the chain of custody.')
