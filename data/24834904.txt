For those, even Rust is not always a good answer.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t use C++ as the backend for your marketing site, or some simple crud backend where a JIT runtime with GC will do.<p>Hell, if you&#x27;re even building a small compiler today a JVM language or Go is a better choice.<p>But if you need to allocate memory yourself, C&#x2F;C++ is very hard to beat. Games and systems dealing with huge chunks of memory will always go this route... and just (most likely) copy the dependencies into version control and deal with things that way.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if the majority of applications are web applications. That doesn&#x27;t make C++ less relevant because that was never the target audience.')
