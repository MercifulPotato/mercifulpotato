This is where people get their news. It is kind of like to taking a TV station off the air due to their political leanings. Tbh I&#x27;ve tuned out the news in the last few months for my own sanity so I might not have all the info to hold a strong opinion. Always good to default to freedom of speech though, the most sacred thing we have.<p>Looking back on the last few years, the most disappointing thing in society is the intolerance and tribalism. I bet if people were to state their own opinions, without any outside influence, we would all be at each other&#x27;s throats given the current state of affairs. You don&#x27;t agree with me on X so fuck you, where X &gt;= petty. I have friends with varying political leanings but we seem to be the exception -- when did the slightest differences in political opinion become devastating deal breakers? You don&#x27;t support BLM? You&#x27;re an awful person. You want to ban guns? Burn in hell. These could otherwise be nice people that you could be friendly with. Has it always been this bad or has the internet underscored the black-and-white nature of politics?')
