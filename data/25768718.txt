Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=[25770088], score=None, time=1610576246, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25766625, text='<i>triggered me due to my hypersensitivity, assumption of ill will, and inability to handle issues which may require nuance</i><p>That&#x27;s often part and parcel of things like racism and sexism. Most such things do not get openly painted as &quot;I don&#x27;t like you because of your skin color or gender.&quot;<p>Metafilter is a great example of this. When I was there, it was not only a cesspit of ugly classism, it was horribly misandrist in ways that I found just pure evil.<p>But of course no one there described themselves as <i>misandrist</i>. They described themselves in amazingly wonderful and glowing terms as woke, pro women&#x27;s lib, welcoming of the LGBTQ community, etc.<p>But rather than being pro women or something, it was mostly a space where it was okay for women and the LGBTQ crowd to be openly hateful to men.<p>One guy posted a question asking for support to help him cope in the aftermath of his wife&#x27;s rape and one of the comments nailed him to the wall for supposedly &quot;making this about him&quot; because of him seeking support for himself separately from and in addition to supporting her recovery from this awful incident.<p>I left a long and helpful comment that moderating staff deleted and when I asked why, I was told it was &quot;tangential&quot; and &quot;not providing resources&quot; -- a test not applied to the long comment handing him his head for seeking support on the grounds that he was clearly some misogynistic piece of shit of a human being who only treated his wife as a sex object, clearly, as that could be the only possible reason he would ask such a question.<p>I kept a copy of my comment and posted it on a blog of mine in hopes he would find it somehow. He messaged me a few hours later and was very thankful for what I had to say on the topic because the comment handing him his head for asking the question (which had like 80 &quot;likes&quot;) had him just losing his shit. It was a poisonous message delivered by people who simply hate all heterosexual men and I just don&#x27;t know why any men participate on that site, it&#x27;s so openly hostile to men. Meanwhile, a lot of them parrot the party line about it being all woke and wonderfulness.<p>Being openly hateful to men is not and never will be pro women&#x27;s rights. Kicking the shit out of men does not redress the lack of status for women. Kicking the shit out of heterosexual men for the crime of being in a hetero relationship does not make the world a better place for the LGBTQ crowd.<p>What helps them is...helping them. Weird as that may sound. That&#x27;s what helps them.<p>And it&#x27;s a shockingly hard message to try to get across. About 99 percent of the time people seem to think &quot;I know! The answer is: let&#x27;s find some man to lynch!&quot; when what I would like to see is, oh, more money in my bank account or something.<p>Me watching men get lynched doesn&#x27;t fill my belly.')
