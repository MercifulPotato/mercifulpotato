The author discusses feminism as &quot;a memeplex that provides a bunch of pattern-matching opportunities where a man is in the wrong and a woman is in the right&quot;, but feminism is about analysing the power dynamic between the _classes_ of &#x27;man&#x27; and &#x27;woman&#x27;. Any system of class-based power analysis can be abused by supposed adherents to attack _individuals_ in a given class, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the system isn&#x27;t itself valuable as a critique of power dynamic that exists between the classes.')
