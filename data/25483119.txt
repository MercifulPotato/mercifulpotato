One of the proposed benefits is that it makes end to end testing easier because each service only interacts with a couple other services, so each service will be easier to write integration tests for. But in the monolith, those services communicate over interfaces, and are currently tested as unit tests! So we&#x27;re replacing unit tests with integration tests and calling that a win because our integration test coverage is higher.')
