Item(by='naravara', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605819354, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25153564, text='&gt;  This is not possible for any subreddit centering on a topic which is not famous enough to have entire departments of universities about it, such as, for example, Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Nintendo GameCube.<p>This was a fun thing when Starcraft 2 was new and it seemed like literally everyone on the &#x2F;r&#x2F;Starcraft reddit page was &quot;high Diamond&quot; league. (Diamond was still the highest league at the time).<p>Considering that only 25% of all players are in Diamond league and the game has no way of telling you whether you&#x27;re low or high within the league, this was clearly bullshit. But everyone on the forum very desperately needed to validate their whining about &quot;balance&quot; by putting a veneer of being &quot;skilled&quot; on it.')
