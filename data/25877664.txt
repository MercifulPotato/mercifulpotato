Objective-C was actually introduced just prior to C++, and both languages were effectively solving the same problem in different ways: C was the dominant language, and both language designers were trying to graft the OOP paradigm onto it.<p>Objective-C is a thin-layer on top of C, adding Smalltalk-inspired object support. That&#x27;s pretty much all there is to it. C, with some new syntax for objects. In the context of a world where C is the norm, that&#x27;s pretty appealing. This is before Java existed, too.<p>The &quot;NSWhatever&quot; stuff, as far as I&#x27;m aware, isn&#x27;t part of the language. That&#x27;s all in the frameworks Apple&#x2F;NEXT developed <i>for</i> Objective-C. (Note that the base object is called Object, not NSObject, and the integer class is Integer.) NSString is probably named that way because Objective-C doesn&#x27;t include a string class (nor does C, as a string is just an array of bytes until you write a wrapper to get fancy) and NEXT made one. They were just namespacing the NEXTStep classes.')
