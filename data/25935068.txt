Besides... a car battery isn&#x27;t actually worth 15k$ to a thief. Not much to part out (PCBs are custom, casing ain&#x27;t gonna fetch much in terms of scrap metal, and there&#x27;s not much of a market for used li-ion 18650&#x27;s with the exception of ecig hobbyists so swapping them out for lower quality isn&#x27;t worth the effort), if it&#x27;s an exclusively rent model there is no market for a stolen pack.<p>Wear and tear also isn&#x27;t that much of an issue as Tesla proved.')
