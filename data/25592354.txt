Unfortunately it seems nobody in the traditional Linux ecosystem outside Red Hat (and perhaps Canonical&#x27;s Snap) is really interested in meaningfully improving UI application sandboxing.<p>Flatpak is often met with outright hostility and then some ranting about how OpenBSD&#x27;s <i>pledge</i> already solves all problems. Sure, Flatpak is not perfect yet and too many Flatpaks still have to use <i>filesystem=home</i> (which usually caused by the application or toolkit not being friendly to sandboxing). But the Flatpak folks at least try to gradually improve security.<p>Disclaimer: I mostly run Linux on the desktop. But application security is definitely a blind spot for the Linux community. Many people still seem to think that UID 0 is the ultimate goal. We are mostly protected by the fact that Linux has ~1% of the desktop and is therefore not an interesting target yet.')
