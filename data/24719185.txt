But in the case of our VDI workstations the way the company has it it&#x27;s not something you can turn off. They&#x27;re trying to put software on all our laptops which would make SSL inspection a reality on our laptops as well but I&#x27;m avoiding it like the plague. It&#x27;s just too hard to teach all the applications that I use to use a certificate chain that they&#x27;re not interested in using.')
