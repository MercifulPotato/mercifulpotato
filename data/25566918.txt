I don&#x27;t think the threshold should ever be 0. We should always allow at least some free transactions.” -Satoshi Nakamoto<p>The p2p electronic cash system I signed up for in June 2010 is not working “how it is supposed to work”. $7.77 average transaction fee?

And do you really think an asset currently worth $500B needs to incentivize people to keep it working?!<p>“I would never spend $100&#x2F;yr to validate&#x2F;store  transactions and keep my Bitcoin investment working unless I can make a profit on that $100&#x2F;yr on fees!”')
