So much, I&#x27;ve spent a reasonable attempt at one distro or another every year. It&#x27;s always had a range of hardware&#x2F;software compatibility, or UI issues.<p>Error messages, crashes, graphical anomalies, hardware kind-of working. There are often fixes, but how much time are you willing to spend trouble-shooting? When you get a new computer or reformat, will you remember what you had to do?<p>I&#x27;ve experienced this class of issues on a range of hardware and software over 2 decades.<p>My best guess: Too much design-by-committee, and losing track of emergent concepts - like responsiveness, how the overall ecosystem affects performance, and how the various parts (designed by different people and teams) work together.<p>Another potential root cause: The way software dependencies and linking works, and the expectation to compile software on your machine.')
