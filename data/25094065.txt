It’s not uncommon for people in consulting to be making $500k-$1m annually by the age of 40. If you’re a partner, compensation can be significantly higher than that; in the $2M-20M range.<p>I think there was a golden era of startups capturing value from the old guard, but that era is largely over IMO. All of those tech darlings are hiring consultants to help build corporate functions and product strategy — turns out there is significant value in knowing how to manage a company of 30,000+ employees and revenues in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Even a fraction of a percent gain in efficiency translates to enormous sums, which the consultants capture some percentage of in fees. As the unicorns continue to evolve into mature enterprises, more of that value will shift into the consulting &#x2F; finance realm.<p>If I were graduating in 2020, I would not go into tech as an engineer if my goal was to get wealthy. It’s still a great career and you’ll be able to live a very comfortable life regardless, but if building wealth is your goal you need to follow the prestige (aka political power).')
