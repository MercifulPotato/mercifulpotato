It&#x27;s not like HN where we are all older and generally a crowd who really likes to tackle problems from an intellectual angle and try things out to get the data on them. That subreddit kinda has to stick to the lowest common denominator which is just following the standard advice.<p>Very interesting to hear of your experiences in this thread though. Maybe we need an r&#x2F;ADHND for all us ADHDers on HN :P')
