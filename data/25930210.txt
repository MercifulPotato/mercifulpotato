The literature is always in flux and inherently unreliable as discoveries are claimed and over decades, proven true or false. Taking a snapshot of the literature at any one time is to accept that a proportion of the claimed truth will be false. Unfortunately the laymen doesn&#x27;t get this, and they believe that published=true.<p>As a layman, you should be looking to sources of information that have been vetted for truth, like textbooks. Textbooks are made to distill the most reliable information from the literature by a team of experts.<p>One paper isn&#x27;t truth, a dozen independent papers, all pointing to the same thing is. That is what we call the &quot;scientific consensus&quot;.')
