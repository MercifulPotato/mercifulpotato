When CPUs are manufactured, this is what they mean by the &quot;yield&quot;. It&#x27;s the percentage of the product that can be kept, with the rest of the wafer discarded.<p>Chef&#x27;s Gallery had a scene that actually shocked me a bit -- this award winning chef was making this deep-fried puff thing that was absolutely perfect. They showed his process, which was to make dozens of them and then plate just the best one for the customer. He <i>never had a knack at all</i> for making them perfect! He was just throwing out 99% of the puffs that he made, using the same technique as anyone else would.<p>You just have to change your perspective: You&#x27;re the product. You&#x27;re the deep fried puff.<p>If you&#x27;re an outlier, you <i>will</i> be discarded. You&#x27;re the bent piece of framing. You&#x27;re the slice of the silicon wafer that failed the test.<p>Nobody feels the slightest bit bad about rejecting a faulty product on the production line. No tears are shed. No phone calls are made to the product to see if there&#x27;s anything the manufacturer can do to fix the situation.<p>This is Google and by extension YouTube in a nutshell. They&#x27;re an advertising company manufacturing ad impressions and ad clicks. Viewers are their product.<p>Viewers on 1 Mbps or 1 Gbps are equally outliers. Both are too weird to cater to, less than optimal, unpredictable, difficult to advertise-to viewers.<p>Rejected.')
