They would have lost their jobs, gradually had their banks close the accounts (with no alternative), had their landlords gradually unable to continue the tenancies (each renewal would check), and if they were sick, found themselves rejected at hospital.  Someone died due to cancer treatment being stopped.<p>Some other people who were resident did the decent thing and supplied the tax office with minor tax corrections after their accountants made small errors.  This was encouraged by the tax office, we&#x27;re all supposed to do that and it&#x27;s quite straightforward.  For that good behaviour they got labelled as having bad character and kicked out, because... any excuse to.  That&#x27;s a doubly-harsh label as it limits their rights in other countries in addition to being kicked out of the UK.')
