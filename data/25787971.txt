The last major programming I did was in Turbo Pascal and Delphi for Windows, in the early 1990s. So, I know how to code, but not in anything current... I regret that.<p>I also regret not embracing networked applications, and multi-threaded programming back in Windows 3.1 days.<p>[Reconsideration &#x2F; Update]\nMy biggest regret is not actually building the idea&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had bouncing around in my head for decades. Even a little bit of work, once a week, on each of them, and they would have been done before Y2K.<p>I&#x27;ve started doing it... the hard part is not talking about it before you&#x27;ve got a minimum viable product to show a friend, so you don&#x27;t have to hand-wave.. but can just show something rough that works.<p>Things I&#x27;m proud of\n  Once I figured out how to dual boot Unix&#x2F;MS-DOS... because I was told it was impossible.\n  I wrote Forth&#x2F;2, in assembler, for OS&#x2F;2, because I was told it wasn&#x27;t possible to write for OS&#x2F;2 in assembler.\n  I wrote code that did cooperative multitasking inside of a Turbo Pascal program, in MS-DOS... and used the heck out of it.\n  I built a machine that levitated light bulb filaments while they were annealed, using the Lorenz force, that got used in Production.')
