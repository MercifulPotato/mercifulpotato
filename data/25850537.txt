Item(by='professoretc', descendants=None, kids=[25851262], score=None, time=1611169751, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25844368, text='&gt; No, it mostly affects execution time.<p>That&#x27;s what I was thinking, too, but most of the time (even if the index is not static) the -1 can be eliminated by just modifying the <i>address</i> at which the array is assumed to start. That is,<p><pre><code>    arr[x]\n</code></pre>\ncompiles into an access at address<p><pre><code>    (arr - 1) + x\n</code></pre>\nSince the address of arr is statically known, arr - 1 is, too, and the address of &quot;one before the first element&quot; will be what&#x27;s written as the base for the memory access.')
