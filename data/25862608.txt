Became of of the regulars at the Derby and other LA spots ( Satin Ballroom, Moras modern rhythmists on mondays). I met my wife there then and we are still together after all these years. I miss those hey days!  Got to see Frankie several times, and the nickolas brothers, and all the old timers from the OG LA scene  from the Balboa ballroom in the 30s and 40s, Hal Takier, Bart). Such an amazing time. Got to dance for the last time right before the lockdowns. Glad I live with my dance partner. I feel for you all who don’t!  Doing swing outs with the doorknob on an open door was one way I practiced back in the day. That’s still COVID friendly!')
