The Boundary worker node (which proxies traffic) would need to be able to make a network connection to the end host, and the client in turn would need to be able to make a network connection to the worker node.<p>This indirection provides a way to keep your public and private (or even private and private) networks distinct to remove &quot;being on the same network&quot; as a sufficient credential for access. At the same time, it ensures that the traffic is only proxied if that particular session is authenticated.')
