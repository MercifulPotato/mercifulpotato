At 36x, I&#x27;d guess that&#x27;s more likely than not—I&#x27;ve been stopped on foot by the police once that I can remember, and I&#x27;ve probably jaywalked thousands of times.<p>In my own anecdotal experience, the most dangerous way to cross the road is in a marked crosswalk with a signal—as in, this is how I&#x27;ve come closest to death by car the most times in the city where I&#x27;ve been living for a few decades. Intersections with these crosswalks often have traffic coming from multiple directions, and you have to really understand the local traffic patterns to cross safely without exposing yourself to a vehicle running a red light or taking a hasty left turn without checking for pedestrians.<p>I would be interested to know how many of the pedestrian deaths in the statistic you quoted were due to jaywalking.')
