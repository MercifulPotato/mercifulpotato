My intuition is that there’s truth to both explanations: cosplaying as a military makes police more violent, and intrinsically violent departments are more likely to seek out military equipment.<p>And frankly, the second conclusion scares me more. If the causal relationship is “equipment —&gt; violence”, we can solve it by simply banning the use of military equipment by police. If the relationship goes the <i>other</i> way, though, we still have to deal with violent cops who want to hurt civilians.')
