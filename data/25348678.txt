It continues to be one of my favorite pieces of music, since first hearing it 12 years ago. There&#x27;s a vitality and a sense of energy to it that keeps me coming back. It&#x27;s also large enough in scope that I&#x27;ve been able to spend a long time chewing it over and digesting all of it&#x27;s movements.<p>I think a unique quality of it is the contrast between it&#x27;s simplistic harmonic content and it&#x27;s constantly modulating structure. The simplicity of the tonality (one key center, very slow chord changes, non-florid counterpoint) allows the listener to focus on the modulating phrase lengths and the texture of the stacked rhythms.<p>This is an interesting inversion of something like, say, a classic bebop tune, which might be melodically and rhythmically complex or divergent, but keep it&#x27;s structure predictable with 4 bar, 8 bar, or 32 bar chunks of time.<p>I think the effect in it&#x27;s fast movements is like being in the middle of a massive rush of water. It&#x27;s uniform in texture, but it has an intensity and sense of turbulence that is overwhelming as it passes you.')
