Neither of those lead to any sort of fulfillment in my opinion, so I don&#x27;t know why you would limit yourself to those options.<p>Also the idea that if you don&#x27;t win the competition and reach the top of the corporate ladder you&#x27;re doomed to a life of failure and misery is just pure nonsense. By definition, the vast majority of people will not reach the top.<p>Life is not a constrained game like the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma, you aren&#x27;t limited to &quot;lie&quot; or &quot;confess&quot;, you can also tunnel out with a spoon, bribe the guard, find a loophole in the law, etc, etc. You&#x27;re only limited by your imagination.<p>&gt; billionaires can optimize for the sake of optimizing, rather than to keep their head above water<p>No, I would imagine billionaires optimize for the sake of being better able to do whatever made them billionaires in the first place, not just for its own sake.')
