So one curios engineer decided to brute-force the trained model with all possible inputs like 2^20 inputs to see what the model does. he found for the problem we were solving only 4 of the 20 parameters had effect on results. the remaining approx 16 parameters do not affect results.<p>So he replaced the model with a single line of code with one boolean expression made with those 4 parameters connected with logical operators.')
