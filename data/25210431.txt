I&#x27;d call it corrupt and crony capitalism, among things, but doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s illegal.<p>And this get to one of things I really hate about US politics.  They write the rules, but don&#x27;t seem to have to abide by any of them.  There is always a loop hole or connection to save them.  Pathetic.<p>Regarding Tucker, his show is the only show I watch every night.  I think he does a great job at bringing light to the under belly of Washington. &#x27;The sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.&#x27;  Now, do I think he&#x27;s perfect, no.  Nobody is.')
