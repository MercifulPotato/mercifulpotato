The PDP-11 &#x27;add&#x27; instruction sets the &#x27;C&#x27; bit if there is a carry from the MSB; the Z bit is set if the result == 0; the N bit is set if the result &lt; 0; and the V bit is set if there is arithmetic overflow (both operands were of the same sign, but the result is of opposite sign).  By simply making these bit available as, say, special names that could be tested (e.g. C N Z V) after an operation, you could determine what happened (if appropriate) and take action.  HP&#x27;s SPL had such a feature (used on the HP3000 series).  C is not a well-designed language, but an improved &#x27;lifeform&#x27; along the way.   Today, I would like to see a c-like language developed specifically for RISC-V; especially one that had many many fewer edge cases.')
