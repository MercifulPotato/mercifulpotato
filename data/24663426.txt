There is already a case with LinkedIn where courts are allowing data scraping even though LinkedIn disallows it and forced LinkedIn to stop blocking it.<p>I feel like this is a case Facebook should lose. Facebook wants complete ownership of the data from Facebook for marketing purposes because obviously if they&#x27;re the only ones that have the data they have a monopoly. But preventing others from gathering competing data seems to be a breach of Antitrust. And Facebook execs will openly admit this is what they&#x27;re doing. They&#x27;ve shut down multiple influencer related companies who completely backed down from a cease and desist from Facebook. And they&#x27;re refusing to allow anyone to grant influencer agencies access to their data. This is Facebook telling people who they can give their data to. As well as Facebook saying companies can&#x27;t scrape public information and then sell the statistics. And statistics can&#x27;t be copyrighted.')
