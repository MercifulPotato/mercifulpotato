Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=[24779424], score=None, time=1602694052, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24777667, text='&gt; There is no need to equivocate the criticism that &quot;what Zionists are doing to Palestinians is similar to what Nazis did to Jews&quot; to a very different claim that &quot;the Holocaust and the Nakba are wholly the same.&quot;<p>I think they are in the same area of related-to-reality-ness. Are civil wars usually bloody and terrible? Yes. Is it reasonable to compare that to the holocaust? No.<p>&gt; We are horrified that Israel would commit ethnic cleansing against another group of people. It is especially horrific given they did so immediately after having been dealt the same atrocity at the hand of Nazis.<p>Is it? It&#x27;s not to me. Quite the contrary: having just barely survived the murderous intentions of somebody who was aftery our life will probably have you very vigilant and possibly overly defensive against the murderous intentions of another group that&#x27;s after your life.<p>&gt; You can narrowly criticize Israel for these historical and present-day actions, and you gain credibility by standing firmly on that point.<p>You can totally criticize Israel for the treatment of the Arabs. Yet when you fail to criticize others for similar treatment of other Arabs (or the same Arabs, even, in the case of Fatah and Hamas), it suggests that your issue with Israels treatment isn&#x27;t a question of ethics, but of ethnics. That is: had mass-immigration to Palestine from Turkey happened, and had these Turks declared a new state and everything else had happened exactly the same way, you wouldn&#x27;t criticize them, because they aren&#x27;t Jews.<p>And if you would: why would you limit your criticism to Israel, and not apply it to all offenders? &quot;Oh, but you must start with one&quot;, sure, sure, but why start with the smallest one that offends much less than others and focus on decades ago instead of today? And why join ranks with terrible governments in doing so, who mock the very idea of human rights? That just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me in a way of &quot;I&#x27;m really equally against all bad things, I&#x27;ve just chosen to be vocal about this particular one for no specific reason whatsoever&quot;.')
