It is fine in moderation.<p>I know I can finish an entire pound of pork belly tonight \nif I am given the opportunity. I&#x27;m not going to do it, because I know that&#x27;s not &quot;in moderation&quot;.<p>The amount of nutrition you get from 1-lb of pork belly will be miniscule compared to a properly balanced meal. But its so damn tasty that you really can just keep shoving that sort of thing into your mouth.<p>Anything in moderation is healthy. Saying &quot;X is healthy in moderation&quot; is almost not useful at all. That&#x27;s why serving sizes and yes, religious dedication to weighing foods and portion control is a thing that serious people do when they&#x27;re seriously dieting.<p>Oxycodon in moderation is healthy. That&#x27;s how unhelpful that &quot;in moderation&quot; statement is for dietary health.<p>----------<p>As for &quot;Pork Belly&quot;, I&#x27;m really saying Lechon kawali, which is a particular Filipino preparation of Pork, which is probably the best tasting pork in the world. Its very good stuff. I just don&#x27;t think the general English-speaking audience will know what &quot;Lechon kawali&quot; is, so I&#x27;m using a rough translation.')
