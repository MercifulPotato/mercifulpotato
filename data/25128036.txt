All of the east asian countries did radically different things.<p>Taiwan slammed it’s borders shut before cases got into the country, and hasn’t done much else.

Japan hasn’t tested much at all, kept offices and restaurants open, and never even came close to “stopping“ the virus. And yet, even there, the fatality level isn’t nearly what we’re seeing in the west.<p>It isn’t unreasonable to hypothesize that something else is going on.')
