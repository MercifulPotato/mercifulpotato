They fall apart when you try to move on from it towards Swift &amp; co.<p>Granted, _finding_ the ObjC old docs can be a pain in the ass, but it&#x27;s possible. I&#x27;ve literally found answers to some of my questions in OS release notes and nowhere else; part of being an AppKit&#x2F;etc developer winds up being simply knowing how to search.<p>Another complaint I have: depending on what era of documentation you need, you often have to qualify your searches differently - e.g, OS X vs macOS.')
