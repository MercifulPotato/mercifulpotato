If the frame to be rendered is CPU bound rather than I&#x2F;O (because of heavy scenes), the whole project would be farmed out to the works, so they have a full copy of what&#x27;s to be rendered, then resize which part of the frame to be rendered by them. Normally this would happen locally, and if you have 8 CPU cores, each one of them get responsible for a small size of the frame. Now if you&#x27;re doing distributed rendering, replace CPU core with a full machine, and you have the same principle.<p>Obviously doesn&#x27;t work for every frame&#x2F;scene&#x2F;project, only if the main time is spent on actual rendering with CPU&#x2F;GPU. Most of the times when doing distributed rendering, CPU isn&#x27;t actually the bottleneck, but rather transferring the necessary stuff for the rendering (project&#x2F;scene data structures that each worker needs).')
