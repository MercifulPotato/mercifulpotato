In a lot (but not all) of cases, it literally comes down to wealthy landowners vs. young non-landowners, and the former group typically skews conservative in every sense.<p>edit: And it also comes into conflict with political progressives for essentially not being progressive <i>enough,</i> since it allows for new housing to be built that some people are still priced out of. So I think the angle that they&#x27;re trying to hand-wave zoning deregulation as being &quot;good&quot; by using the word &quot;progressive&quot; is doubly misguided.')
