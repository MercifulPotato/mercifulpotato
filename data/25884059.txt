Users can collect all sorts of attributes in their IRMA app, and then selectively disclose any subset of those attributes, as appropriate to the use case. This includes authentication like OpenID Connect (e.g. the user could disclose a username attribute), but also other use cases such as indeed proving that you are older than 18, or anonymously proving membership of a group (using unlinkability, see below), or providing authenticated personal data such as your address or date of birth.')
