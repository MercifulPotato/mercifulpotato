Like most things on the Internet, that&#x27;s a bubble - the bubble of users who visit statcounter-infested websites, and are able to run their scripts. And the point of the original post is to think outside the bubble. Not in all cases - if you&#x27;re a B2B service, or selling T-shirts with slogans on them, CanIUse is likely a good enough source to base your choices on. But if you&#x27;re a government website, or providing critical Covid-19 data for example, it&#x27;s irresponsible to ignore these long-tail of users who fall outside expected and easily visible patterns. There&#x27;s a spectrum between these two kinds of websites, and it&#x27;s worth thinking about where you fall on that and how many you&#x27;re comfortable with denying access to your website.<p>It&#x27;s a tradeoff between security and accessibility, and we should at least be thoughtful about the implications of our decisions.')
