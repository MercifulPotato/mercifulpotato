Item(by='xnyan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607960569, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25412902, text='&gt; switching USB takes as long as it does to switch video inputs<p>High-end KVMs get around this with virtual usb devices. Instead of switching the actual USB devices between computers A and B, they instead create a separate virtual USB device for each computer that always stays connected to each computer and is never switched. When you push the button on the KVM, you are not actually switching between computers, the KVM reads the USB input from the device and then recreates it on the appropriate virtual usb output device.<p>These KVMs are pretty costly. There are some complicated DIY solutions involving arduinos, but a software &quot;KVM&quot;  (really just the KM, no V) like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;debauchee&#x2F;barrier" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;debauchee&#x2F;barrier</a> in most situations works just as well, and if the computers are connected via wired ethernet, is rock-solid and adds no perceptible latency.')
