Item(by='giantg2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605492688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25105977, text='&quot;...keep in mind there may also be 100 others in your social circle taking statins without any side effects...&quot;<p>Not 100 (I don&#x27;t have that many friends), but true. I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s tons of side effects or that they are common. I was just saying that I know of 3 examples that make me question some things related to the study. For example, if I know 3 people with seemingly true side effects and they are part of the 10% of people with side effects, so that should mean I should know 30 people with side effects. And then I should know how many people taking statins? Even if 50% have side effects, then I&#x27;d need to know 60 people taking them in my fairly small (and young) group of family and friends. Maybe my group is too small to have a valid sample size, the study could be questionable (like the one on statins and longevity that recommended prescribing statins to basically every elderly person), or there is some other issue I&#x27;m missing.<p>It would be nearly impossible to tell if someone was lying. I don&#x27;t know that person very well, but from what they said it shouldnt be an issue. I would guess his flight surgeon investigated that as a possible cause since they are pretty strict about what medications you are allowed to take (the statin was prescribed by a different doctor and that caused some drama).')
