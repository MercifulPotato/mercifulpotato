Exchanges can partially alleviate customer concerns by providing periodic proofs of solvency. We describe MProve, a proof of reserves protocol for Monero exchanges which can be combined with a known proof of liabilities protocol to provide a proof of solvency. It is the first protocol for Monero which provides address privacy by allowing an exchange to hide its own addresses within a larger anonymity set. MProve also provides a simple proof of non-collusion between exchanges.&quot;<p>See also:<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;1210.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;1210.pdf</a><p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ee.iitb.ac.in&#x2F;~sarva&#x2F;monero&#x2F;mprove-slides.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ee.iitb.ac.in&#x2F;~sarva&#x2F;monero&#x2F;mprove-slides.pdf</a>')
