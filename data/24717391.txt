There are some accounts that I&#x27;ve enjoyed following and even after leaving the platform I still use the RSS feed of nitter.net for these to browse these posts. No doubt that if I&#x27;d sign up again even with an intention not to post myself and only to lurk, I&#x27;d get sucked into toxic discussions within less than a week. nitter gives me the distance I need to consume the content (on my terms) without risking addiction or potentially contributing to the toxicity myself.')
