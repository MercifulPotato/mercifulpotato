It&#x27;s one thing to say &quot;Obama applied hard power more than was expected&quot; as opposed to &quot;He was worse than Bush&quot; which is completely unjustified. There is absolute no equivalence between drone usage and the two ground wars engaged by Bush. The 2 week Shock and Awe campaign in Iraq dropped more ordinance and killed more people than 8 years of drones. And the drone campaigns were mostly carried out with the private consent of the nations with targets. And saying the Libyan Civil War was &quot;US-led&quot; is just a complete lie. It was most directly lead by Libyans, but the air campaign was led by France.')
