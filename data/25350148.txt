Photoshop in the pre-Cloud days was a $600+ program depending on where you got it, with upgrade pricing in the $150â€“200 range. Today, you can get a &quot;Photography&quot; Creative Cloud subscription with Photoshop and Lightroom for $120&#x2F;year.<p>I&#x27;m not in love with &quot;everything is SaaS,&quot; but I recognize that a lot of software businesses really want recurring revenue rather than a rush of orders -- many of which are lower-priced upgrades -- when new releases come out, then a trickle until the next for-pay release (which a subset of your existing customers won&#x27;t upgrade to). And, in an era where a lot of people have come to see upfront prices of $99+ for applications as outrageously high -- and worse, have been trained by app stores to expect free upgrades indefinitely -- the old model may just not be sustainable.')
