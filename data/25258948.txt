If your artificial sequence aligns with others, there&#x27;s a chance that it will fold like them, depending on the quality and accuracy of the multiple sequence alignment. Since multiple sequence alignments are built under the assumption of homology (all sequences have a common ancestor), it&#x27;s a matter of how far from the &quot;sequence sampling space&quot; your sequence is located compared to the others.<p>I understand that similar sequences may fold similarly (although as length increases, I highly doubt it, but IDK). I&#x27;m talking about aligned sub-sequences within one chain and their ultimate distance from each other in the final structure. Co-evolution suggests that aligned sub-sequences are also proximal. But manufactured chains did not evolve, therefore the assumption is no longer useful.')
