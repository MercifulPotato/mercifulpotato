The Algorithm has a well-earned reputation for being capricious, but there&#x27;s also a ton of good-sounding bullshit out there.<p>Theories abound, but most&#x2F;all of these platforms don&#x27;t have to provide an explanation, and the end-user has little to no recourse on the natter: so far its been youtube, patreon and facebook none of which have followed up. Here is Josiah on an alt platform (odysee) explaining the situation through his eyes [0].<p>It&#x27;s sad to see a pioneer of Biohacking dismissing p2p solutions like torrenting and even Bitcoin in order to bypass the censorship, but I think a lot of this just has to do with the clunky nature of its former or perhaps even current UI&#x2F;UX for people with limited time or attention or familiarity with tech solutions, especially since it was so easy to use Youtube to distribute your content with just a simple click.<p>I honestly could have him up and running in a day or two with a solution just in case Paypal does in fact shut him down, that would interface with Fiat&#x2F;CC payment upfront and convert into BTC if needed: the reason BTC is needed is because paypal or bank accounts can shut you out of your funds if you are already a target. It would mainly be a settlements network and only be slightly more steps than what he is used to, as well. But he is right about volatility as that cannot be helped as of right now.<p>I kind of want to reach out, but I&#x27;m dealing with more than I want at the moment due to COVID in my family, but its something I&#x27;m considering because Josiah is such a massive inspiration to us Biohackers that deplatforming from the big platforms should be the canary in the coal mine. They even shut down his Patreon!<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odysee.com&#x2F;@BiohackThePlanet:3&#x2F;biohack-the-planet-with-josiah-zayner-3:1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odysee.com&#x2F;@BiohackThePlanet:3&#x2F;biohack-the-planet-wi...</a>')
