Better tooling, (pretty good) type system; not without its warts. Main concern I&#x27;d see ahead is the 2 -&gt; 3 transition, which has the potential to be as difficult as the Python 2 -&gt; 3 transition. That said, Scala 3 looks nicer to me as a language, with top-level functions, significant whitespace (more concise code), and better ADTs.')
