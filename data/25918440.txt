Never went to any form of physical therapy, but I started going to a psychotherapist (psychoanalyst to be exact). Little by little, my bruxism, neck and back pain went away. Another thing that helped was learning proper tongue placement. I still grind my teeth while asleep sometimes, but only during more stressful periods of life and it can be avoided by tiring myself physically (going for a run, etc).')
