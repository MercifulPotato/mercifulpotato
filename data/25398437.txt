You hire one employee over. They say &quot;Oh gosh. We were doing the same thing.&quot; It&#x27;s hard to keep that sort of thing secret.<p>Warrants are granted to law enforcement, not in civil suits between corporations. The word is subpoena, and if you knew even the basics of what you&#x27;re talking about, you&#x27;d use correct terminology.<p>Legal discovery usually doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;very high burden of proof,&quot; because there are very reasonable ways to compartmentalize information. Legal discovery usually leads to a ton of transparency, at least to the legal teams on both sides (and a firewall, so that can&#x27;t go over to the engineers).<p>MOST executives are diligent about responding to subpoenas. Judges have broad discretion for contempt-of-court, up to and including prison. If you&#x27;re the CEO of BioCorp, and you can:<p>1) Respond promptly, completely, and accurately. Risk: You might wipe $200 million off of your books and cost each investor $2<p>OR<p>2) Stonewall the court or lie. Risk: You might get thrown in prison.<p>Which do you do? Most executives pick responding promptly. Not all, but most.<p>Most companies are super-careful not to infringe patents that they know about, because it&#x27;s not fun. Unless it&#x27;s a case of mutually-assured destruction. There are whole industries where everyone infringes, and no one sues anyone.')
