I thought these regulations were all about commercial trade, to protect local producers against (supposedly unfair) outside competition. I don&#x27;t really see how demonstrating a production process harms that.<p>In fact, considering the PDO protection local producers enjoy, it might just as well be argued that there is no need for any ban on the production of the same goods elsewhere, since those can already not be sold because of the PDO.<p>Did I just misunderstood the PDO doctrine, or is this just overreach (if not abuse) of it?<p>A case of wanted to have their cheese and it it too?')
