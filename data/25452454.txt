I have the Wahoo he mentioned and it works perfectly. I also grabbed chest heart rate sensor so it actually displays in the Peloton app, but it really isn&#x27;t necessary unless you&#x27;re very focused on staying in zones. I&#x27;m at about 150 Peloton rides and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It&#x27;s slightly annoying to not be able to compete with the leaderboard (since the app doesn&#x27;t know resistance), but generally I&#x27;m watching the recorded classes so I&#x27;m fine save ~$1500 plus the higher monthly Peloton fee. I&#x27;m interested to test out how Fitness+ compares!')
