Growing cannabis just doesn&#x27;t scale very well - you can&#x27;t just double the nutrients for the same amount of water and expect to feed 2x the plants, in a similar vein you can&#x27;t double the number of plants for a given space either, because the yield typically depends on the amount of light available. Even assuming you can double the amount of light, you can&#x27;t automatically assume your yield will double as well, there&#x27;s techniques required to maximize that return, which ultimately requires (sometimes significant) human interference. It&#x27;s a remarkably fascinating plant in that sense, you can have two clones identical in every way, and they will still grow and flower slightly differently.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, automatic trimmers have come a long ways in recent years. A coworker at my previous job had purchased one for personal use, he had a ACMPR license for up to 35 plants. He said where it used to take two or three hours to trim a single plant, he can knock 7 or 8 off in the same time. Of course it doesn&#x27;t come anywhere near the quality of a hand-trim, but you can get 90% there with almost no effort. To the older generation like him, it&#x27;s still orders of magnitude better than whatever you could get just 10-15 years ago.<p>And yes, 10 brownies for $30 is a reasonably good price, even here in Ontario. Assuming they contain a reasonable dosage of THC (say 50mg), anyways.<p>[0]: Personally I use the General Hydroponics 3-part; two 1L bottles of &quot;Bloom&quot; and one bottle of each &quot;Gro&quot; and &quot;Micro&quot; is roughly $90 CAD. Using just those three nutrients and some pH adjusters I&#x27;ve been able to harvest roughly 25 lbs across 14 plants over the past 4 years. It&#x27;s likely I will need another bottle of the bloom and micro components before starting another grow, but the Gro bottle should last another two or cycles easily.')
