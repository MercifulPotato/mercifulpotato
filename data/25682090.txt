They try to only make stuff that works really well; as a result they don’t make inexpensive stuff.<p>But they don’t make very expensive stuff either, the type of stuff whose status is independent of its function, like the equivalent of $800 jeans. They’ve tried a couple times (gold Apple Watch for example) and it did not catch on.<p>So, I think it’s fair to ask what unique functionality Apple will bring to a car to differentiate it from all the other cars.<p>And from an internal perspective, Apple leaders have repeatedly said that they are only interested in new markets when they think they can have a transformative impact. So again, I think it’s fair to wonder what that impact might be. There’s undoubtedly more to their thinking than just slapping an Apple logo on a Hyundai.')
