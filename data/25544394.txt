I think a better analogy is architects vs. construction workers. Any decent architect will have a pretty strong understanding of the realities of construction, and an experienced construction worker who has moved around through different trades could probably design a decent house. But you&#x27;d only trust a trained architect on bigger, more complex projects, and you&#x27;d want disciplined, experienced construction workers doing the work on anything that is meant to last.')
