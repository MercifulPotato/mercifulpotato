The arrogance of thinking, sure, we (or another &quot;nation&quot;) could have built this, and the arrogance of thinking that in the enormous universe, there&#x27;s no other life that could have figured out more than we could have.<p>In this case, it&#x27;s another type of arrogance, that these patents couldn&#x27;t work because it seems to violate &quot;what we know&quot;, which is arrogance that &quot;what we know&quot; encompasses &quot;everything that is.&quot;<p>Arrogance can be comfortable, but it&#x27;s not scientific. It seems there&#x27;s a reflex to insist that sky ships &quot;can&#x27;t be alien&quot; and &quot;weird propulsion&quot; can&#x27;t be possible. I think this reflex is crazy. Just keep an open mind, because &quot;there&#x27;s so much we don&#x27;t know.&quot;')
