Its work is on high-performance computation and scientific machine learning (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sciml.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sciml.ai&#x2F;</a>). We are looking for individuals to help the lab&#x27;s development activities.<p>We’re looking for a new devops and MLops engineer to work with the Julia Lab. You’d be in charge of keeping all of our systems running and creating new schemes to accelerate Julia development. Julia’s Base CI, the FluxML, SciML and GPU resources are managed by this position. Automated benchmarking tools 10, automating the installation of Julia in R and Python packages, helping improve Julia’s setup for compute clusters, building tools to make it easy to manage ML training in Git repositories, etc. are the kinds of problems that are encountered. If you’re also interested in technical computing and interested in splitting time between ops and work in this domain, that can also be arranged. This is more of an entry level position, great for students who have just graduated (or are graduating soon), and great for individuals looking to have a year devoted to getting a good PhD program application together.<p>Can be remote, but working in Boston at MIT is preferred.
