I had a user ask me to include ads in exchange for paid features.<p>- and yet people still distrust you. Once I proudly posted a new feature to Show HK and the first response was &quot;How does this post not qualify as &#x27;spam&#x27;?&quot;. Some people automatically think you&#x27;re a bad guy since you sell something.<p>- without advertising, how do you get the word out?<p>I rely on word-of-mouth, since it carries much trust, and news articles. This means it&#x27;s a slow game.<p>It is very hard to find mutual respect (both ways) between user and maker. Most relationships start with distrust or &quot;what is in it for me&quot;.')
