Then again I buy all sorts of things used—probably 10x more than I buy new. I don’t see why a good’s manufacturer should expect to skim profit every time one of their goods changes hands, and I resent the lengths (DRM) some of them go through to try to do so. I should be able to buy used and to sell to someone else when I’m done with it.')
