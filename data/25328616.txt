Item(by='cgriswald', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607305961, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25327448, text='Although for loops might all be while loops at heart, I think the distinction is more than just syntactic. Properly used, the use of a for loop conveys particular information: the code block is intended to run a set number of times or over a particular group of objects. This allows while loops in general to be used specifically for running the code block an indefinite number of times until the criteria is met. (Certainly both types of loops can be misused and abused.)<p>It also splits apart two different <i>kinds</i> of criteria. &quot;Has this run ten times&quot; is a different sort of question than &quot;is the error within the given margin&quot; or &quot;does the temperature now read 60 degrees&quot;. (At least, if you&#x27;re <i>intentionally</i> running the thing 10 times. If it&#x27;s running <i>incidentally</i> so you don&#x27;t even know if it will run 10 times then it can be the same sort of question, but in that case I&#x27;d argue you should use a while loopâ€¦.)<p>&gt; You save 1 or 2 lines and have ambiguity on wherever &quot;each&quot; is.<p>Like the sibling poster, I&#x27;m not certain what you mean by this.')
