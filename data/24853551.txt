Reciprocating engines are better, but even they can&#x27;t get much above 50%. There&#x27;s still lots of heat there even in the most efficient engines.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right about the efficiency being <i>just fine</i> -- especially when you&#x27;re a pipeline company and you just pull fuel for free out of the pipeline to run the turbine. That&#x27;s a big reason why these companies haven&#x27;t built these plants already.')
