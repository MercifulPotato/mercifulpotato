Their conclusion is that most papers write about the neat things you can do with a new technique and don&#x27;t always include a section on societal impact.  It&#x27;s more an absence of politics (I&#x27;ve got GPT-2 ready with your reply to this sentence ;)).<p>It&#x27;s also worth taking into account that given their methods involved a bit of subjectivity, what bias did <i>they</i> bring.  That said, it&#x27;s easy to believe lots of papers were like &quot;here&#x27;s this thing i did!&quot; without including a section on societal impact.')
