It&#x27;s true. The earth is round and we don&#x27;t control the solar input, the oceanic cycles like the AMO, ENSO, PDO, NAO, etc, the cloud cover albedo of the planet is largely out of our control...the volcanism and deep sea geothermal venting is completely out of our control...etc etc. Before you click downvote, ask yourself how much you actually understand about the subject and go learn more if you care about it. Go deep. Stay skeptical.')
