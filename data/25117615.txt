Rather than having police have to deal with hours of interaction (and police report paperwork), send in qualified health workers, i.e., those that have been trained for years to deal with this rather than a rookie cop with 6 months at the academy.<p>This would prevent cops from having to handle all kinds of other stuff, especially situations where they are not at all qualified to handle.')
