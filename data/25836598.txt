The key idea behind it is to give developers access to design data outside the interface of design tools so they could build and automate workflows at scale. We enable you to convert any number of design files, regardless of their file format, to one unified and easily readable JSON-based format Octopus.<p>Using the Octopus format, you’ll get unified access to all design data like layer styles, text content, colors, or layout coordinates. With this data, you can easily replace manual tasks in your Design Process and Design Ops with automations like: switching styles at scale, connecting design data with code, generating localized design versions, auto-updating image assets in code, converting design formats, and more.<p>You can check out the documentation through the link above.<p>Please AMA, I’d love to hear your thoughts or questions.')
