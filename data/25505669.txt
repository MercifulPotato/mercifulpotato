There&#x27;s no misleading advertising here - the resolution is exactly as promised ,at the size promised....what&#x27;s the problem? If the resolution isn&#x27;t high enough for you....then buy one where it is? There are 5K monitors out there, maybe even 8K? Or just get a 4K one but in a smaller size?<p>I&#x27;m so confused by your comment.')
