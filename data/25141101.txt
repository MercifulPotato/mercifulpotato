Certainly not adopting the first generation of a new processor architecture on a machine I use for work.<p>However, render time in FCP and number of channels in Logic Pro cannot be understated if they&#x27;re really this good. It&#x27;s crazy to see a sudden uplift in what&#x27;s capable there. A lot of what I&#x27;ve read even indicates that general system use (windows opening &#x2F;closing, scrolling, system animations) are noticeably faster on the M1.<p>Plus, I&#x27;m happy to take Apples word as they were totally right with the A12z in the iPad Pro. That thing outperforms most windows laptop in creative workflows.')
