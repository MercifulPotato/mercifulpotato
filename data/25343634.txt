Steam still crashes every time I start SteamVR (restarting Steam afterwards works though). There is no official way to play VR videos. Half-Life: Alyx has enough bugs that Valve still does not advertise that it supports Linux on the store page. SteamVR and Half-Life: Alyx have both not been getting many updates on Linux. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong and there are fixes coming up but honestly it feels kind of like whoever at Valve got VR running on Linux lost interest.')
