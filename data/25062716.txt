But they were quite low spec, so i sold them and bought a small htpc instead, quadcore, with 16 gigs of ram and 512Gb nvme.<p>Also using RKE, it looks like the best cluster &#x27;distro&#x27; around.<p>I used longhorn but found it a little slow, putting it on SSD was a bit of a waste. I tried ceph, it was much faster but i just do not understand how it works, etc. Well enoguh to fix anything if the cluster goes wrong.')
