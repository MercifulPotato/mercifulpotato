Item(by='wobbly_bush', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602808229, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24795557, text='&gt; You signal your intelligence when you show blatant disregard for the rules&#x2F;law...There are so many reasons why people do this (not knowing any better&#x2F;not believing they work comes from lack of education), but it all stems from lack of intelligence (in my opinion)<p>Coming from a country which had low enforcement of laws even before the pandemic(one of the reasons why it&#x27;s still under &quot;developing&quot; category instead of &quot;developed&quot;), I doubt the disregard of law is due to lack of intelligence. On the contrary, the more intelligent&#x2F;shrewd someone is, higher is their chance to get away disregarding the law(in these places). They are more selfish than stupid.')
