There&#x27;s always a monthly passion post about how flawed they are.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unfair to say that Google and FB are considered to have strong engineering talent. So the interview process has to have _some_ hand in that success, even if it&#x27;s also turning away some would-be strong performers.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the interview process shouldn&#x27;t be criticized or that it&#x27;s beyond improvement. And, yeah, it&#x27;s a little silly to go memorize a bunch of algorithms so you can recite them on the stop. Furthermore, so many interview questions are posted on leetcode... and there&#x27;s so many more flaws to be pointed out, but in spite of that, they still manage to have a high engineering bar.<p>But if you only read HN you&#x27;d think it&#x27;s a total failure.')
