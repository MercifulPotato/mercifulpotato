Would those areas remain low COL? Would the existing inhabitants become a sort of underclass?<p>You&#x27;d see something like that, but keep in mind that outside of dense urban cores, you mostly don&#x27;t have the same constraints on available real estate that drive existing residents out by rising prices (and the SF Bay Area&#x27;s lack of housing inventory is largely self-inflicted, unlike, say, Manhattan).<p>So, yes, some competition from well-heeled newcomers will drive prices up a bit (encouraging new construction), but without a constraint on housing inventory that drives the newcomers to compete with <i>each other</i>, what you get is just a bit of urbanization, rather than gentrification per-se.')
