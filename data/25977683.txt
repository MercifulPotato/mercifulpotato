You really need all the measures mentioned in the grandparent comment.<p>Kind of no point having the population get tested now in the US. Without contact tracing and quarantine a positive result arrives too late to help anyone.<p>First you need to lock down the entire state until the daily infected is only 1% of the testing capacity. 4 weeks of level 4 lock-down would do that. Then with contact-tracing you can start to get ahead of the virus by quarantining infected people (close contacts of the positive test) before they even transmit Covid further.<p>Also, I&#x27;m sorry that you are experiencing life in a state as infected as Florida. It sounds terrifying. I hope you get well soon and stay safe.')
