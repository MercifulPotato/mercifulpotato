Are you really that na√Øve as to not even question why one party would insist on counting the votes unilaterally in secret and are you that much of a simpleton to think that people wouldn&#x27;t cheat for a hell of a lot less?<p>There&#x27;s also that whole constitution thing that says election rules are set by the state legislature, not the Governor nor the Supreme Court. The will of the commonwealth never intended to need interpreting because it&#x27;s the literal republic representation that this country is founded on. Democracies always fail when people learn they can vote themselves more money by going into unlimited debt until its no longer unlimited one day.')
