Past events, it is argued, have no objective existence, but survive only in written records and in human memories. The past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon. And since the Party is in full control of all records, and in equally full control of the minds of its members, it follows that the past is whatever the Party chooses to make it.&quot;  - From George Orwell&#x27;s 1984.<p>What&#x27;s weird is that this was meant to shock, but here we are in 2020 and this seems to be a good idea to a lot of people for some reason.  1984 was influenced a lot by Orwell&#x27;s observance of Stalinism, where they would edit out people from old photos who had been executed and so forth.  Stalin took a close interest in editing screenplays, editorials and even fiction produced in the Soviet Union to make it fit the narratives of Marxism.  Why did he spend so much time on all of this?  You have to make the whole ideology hang together if you want to transform society.  The ruler must remove all contradictions everywhere so that all voices sing in unison one unifying vision and that includes popular art and media.  There must be no contradictions!')
