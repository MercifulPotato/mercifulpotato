My wifi is one of those dedicated mesh router things that is as solid as you can buy. And it mostly works... but still has occasional jank and even more occasional bad days where it never stops working but noticeably drops resolution a lot.<p>It&#x27;s just too easy for an otherwise functional home Wiki connection on its own to eat all the latency budget or more for that style of gaming. And the companies <i>really want</i> you locked into more subscriptions, not owning your games, and streaming everything if at all possible, so I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll continue building the hardware for it. Ethernet is cheap; not so cheap you can&#x27;t save a lot of money over several million consoles, but so cheap that it&#x27;s a no-brainer for this purpose; retaining one marginal customer on the cloud service that works on ethernet but not on their wifi pays for hundreds of ethernet ports, if not thousands.')
