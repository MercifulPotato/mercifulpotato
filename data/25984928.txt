I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m familiar with snoozing email, so I had to look it up: it&#x27;s basically a way to remind yhe iser to respond to a message later.<p>Given that, I would say that no, snoozing an email and archiving it are different things, regardless of the snooze duration. With my workflow, I archive any email that no longer requires my feedback, so anything that is still in my inbox would probably be the same as one that has been snoozed anyways.<p>If you&#x27;re snoozing messages forever, you may want to reconsider your approach to managing your inbox. Snoozing a message over and over seems like a lot of wasted action. Why not just leave it in the inbox if it&#x27;s short-term or set up a calendar reminder if it&#x27;s long-term instead?')
