You do need to deal with the explicit ownership semantics in Rust when you&#x27;re first implementing those tools, but that&#x27;s a probably minor inconvenience up front and afterwards things mostly just work like the equivalent data structures in any other programming language, but with the added safety guarantees from the ownership system and borrow checker.')
