Did any one else, perhaps not as high profile, make any comments which could be agreed as worthy of a CoC violation? What happened?<p>Jeremy Howard has done a LOT for the machine learning community  and the world because he really has democratised machine learning and made it extremely accessible for people. Not just with free lecture videos, but by buiding and releasing tools that continue to give people an on ramp into a complex field.<p>Jeremy is also relatively high profile, in an &quot;if you know you know&quot; kind of way.<p>This really seems like a bit of an attempt for the confrence to do something slightly edgy and controversial to boost their own profile.<p>Edit: i should have said &quot;enabling a whole community to build and release tools for free&quot;. Obviously a LOT of people are contributing to fastai so i dont want to take anything away from the community. Jeremy is clearly instrumental to that movement.')
