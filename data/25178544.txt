Probably sooner than later.<p>Listening to Horace Dediu (Asymco) alerted me to 5G&#x27;s impact. (I just didn&#x27;t care enough, so wasn&#x27;t paying attention.)<p>The 5x5 CriticalPath episode recapping the iPhone 12 launch. I don&#x27;t understand Dediu&#x27;s analysis well enough to repeat it. But the punchline is Apple put everyone on notice that 5G is the next thing.<p>The rationale is something about renewed partnerships with carriers, the return of carrier discounts, and giving the 5G guy so much time on the soapbox.<p>FWIW, I definitely want cell baseband in my future laptops. Using my phone or pad hotspot sucks.')
