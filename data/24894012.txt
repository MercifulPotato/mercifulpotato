Worst case some compile time optimizations wouldn&#x27;t be possible.<p>Any single macro isn&#x27;t THE killer macro, but giving all of them up is a big deal. Similarly replicating semantics of a single macro in some other language may be doable but getting many of them to compose would be tough.<p>Most popular languages tend to get new keywords, operators and other forms of syntax over time implicitly acknowledging limitations of the &quot;user space&quot; syntax. You don&#x27;t see that as much in LISPs since most such things can be implemented as a macro.')
