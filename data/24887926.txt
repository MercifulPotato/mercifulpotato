It makes it really easy to have easy to develop monoliths--Go will scale (vertically and horizontally) and can easily handle doing everything.  There are some annoyingly verbose and not DRY parts, like adding instrumentation or context, but it leads to less weird side effects.<p>The tooling is also very good, though I wish more of golangci lint would move into stdlib so I could just run golint.')
