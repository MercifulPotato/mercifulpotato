Item(by='calvano915', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602132823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24714551, text='Its on the north end of the Strip in a pretty run down but slowly improving area. Its far from all the more popular and attractive resorts starting at Wynn and all the way south to Mandalay Bay.<p>Vegas is moving away from theme type properties and moving toward modern (CityCenter, Wynn) and cultural&#x2F;experiential (Resorts World). The Enterprise would&#x27;ve been more likely to be successful in the time it was being considered, when families were the primary target and more extreme themes like the Strat, Excalibur, and Circus Circus were attractive to that demographic.<p>I personally feel that Vegas will slowly become irrelevant to regular people over time, unless they keep bringing in more big yearly events to sustain tourism like EDC. In two words, event exclusivity. The focus for the last decade or so has been on just that, building more arenas and venues like MSG Sphere to host events in ways and capacities that are mostly unmatched elsewhere.<p>Everything else that worked like gaming, clubs, Cirque type shows, restaurants, and some conventions are slowly becoming bigger draws elsewhere over time. Vegas still has all these and is a leader, but they have been in decline IMO. Other destinations have been able to compete because Vegas resort corporations have price gouged to extreme levels like resort fees, parking fees, and $400&#x2F;night rates. Historically, Vegas was cheaper for those things with better perks for gaming or staying at certain resorts.<p>Anyway, it makes sense to me that the Star Trek Experience happened at the scale and timeline that it did. It was pretty well done but couldn&#x27;t really advance or be revitalized in any way worth the investment. You&#x27;d be more likely to see $ spent toward something involving  Marvel or Star Wars but guess who bought those up already and doesn&#x27;t operate in Vegas.')
