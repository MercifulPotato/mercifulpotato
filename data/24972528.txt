Item(by='kingsloi', descendants=None, kids=[24973916, 24974804], score=None, time=1604347448, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24972066, text='I ran a little one man band shop in the UK for a few years, my accountant provided me my own FreeAgent (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freeagent.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freeagent.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;</a>) account, which I really loved.<p>I&#x27;d track my time, attach it to a contact, create an invoice for said time at <i>x</i> rate, download it, send it to them, and when the $&#x2F;Â£ was received, I&#x27;d mark it to that invoice. I&#x27;d have automatic bank feed, so I&#x27;d have my business bank transactions imported daily, I could then attach a payment to said invoice, and any difference in money (invoiced $500, received $475 - transfer fee, currency conversion, etc), FreeAgent would automatically select the correct reason for the discrepancy. Everything was categorised, my accountant could pull reports&#x2F;taxes from FreeAgent.<p>This was a few years ago, I only imagine it&#x27;s gotten better since. I&#x27;ve recommended it to people in the US, and I think it integrated well with the US way of doing things (taxes, forms, etc).')
