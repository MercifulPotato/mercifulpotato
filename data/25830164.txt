You get faster when you realise that the level of discomfort that stopped you the last run could actually be so much worse, and yet somehow you can still run faster.<p>I agree that suffering for its own sake probably isn’t worth it, but if you want to run faster&#x2F;farther, getting used to suffering will let you improve.<p>Don’t over train, but don’t always listen when your body wants to stop, unless it’s joint pain :)<p>For people who enjoy the suffering itself; well that’s a different hobby than running, and I won’t judge.')
