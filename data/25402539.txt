With RHEL, it&#x27;s possible to stay in a minor release for longer while in CentOS you always have to migrate to the next minor release. For instance, according to the graphic at the middle of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;access.redhat.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;policy&#x2F;updates&#x2F;errata" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;access.redhat.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;policy&#x2F;updates&#x2F;errata</a> with Extended Update Support one can stay at RHEL 8.2 until the middle of 2022 (so RHEL 8.2 has a full 2 years of support), while with CentOS, you had to migrate to CentOS 8.3 this month if you want to keep receiving updates (so CentOS 8.2 had only 6 months of support before being replaced with CentOS 8.3).')
