George Soros famously did the same thing with the British Pound but the issue with the British Pound is that it is a fiat currency that can be devalued at the whim of a handful of people controlling the system itself regardless of market forces (aka the participants in the system). When Soros or that bitcoin whale &quot;manipulate the market&quot; they are still acting within the system.')
