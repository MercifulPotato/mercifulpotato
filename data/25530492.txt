Upon reading this comment, I immediately put down my iPad, ran (not walked) to my desktop, swapped babel-loader for esbuild-loader in a work project and a spare time project and benchmarked the results. For full production builds with minification etc., the work project went from 40 seconds to 20 and the spare time project went from 64 seconds to 20. Merry Christmas indeed.<p>I really don&#x27;t care if my compilers are written in JS, Go, C, Dart or INTERCAL. If they do what I need them to do I&#x27;m going with the fastest one. And unless further testing reveals a huge drawback, that means esbuild.')
