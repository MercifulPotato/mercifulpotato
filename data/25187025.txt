It is an OSS equivalent of what DexGuard can offer to prevent credentials harvesting.<p>It uses a combination of obfuscation techniques to do so :<p>- secret is obfuscated using the reversible XOR operator so it never appears in plain sight,\n- obfuscated secret is stored in a NDK binary as an hexadecimal array, so it is really hard to spot &#x2F; put together from a disassembly,\n- the obfuscating string is not persisted in the binary to force runtime evaluation (ie : prevent the compiler from disclosing the secret by optimizing the de-obfuscation logic),\n- optionnaly, anyone can provide it&#x27;s own encoding &#x2F; decoding algorithm when using the plugin to add an additional security layer.')
