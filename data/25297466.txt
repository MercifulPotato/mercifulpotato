But when other major browsers reject it as a standard, the API is usually deprecated.<p>I&#x27;m sure there exist instances of vendors not waiting for agreement, those are rare exceptions because it essentially breaks the standard. Web fragmentation was a big problem for a long time and the major browsers have largely willingly agreed to avoid that. Apple&#x27;s participation is de facto mandatory, they control a major browser and other major browser vendors won&#x27;t ship something that Apple has openly declared they will never support.')
