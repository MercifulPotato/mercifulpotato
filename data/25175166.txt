I am using a J2ME enabled feature phone with Opera Mini to access the internet. Most websites requiring &quot;modern browsers&quot; are out of reach from me. Thanks to all the people who maintain the websites that are functional without JS or upto ES5.1 (last JS version supported by Opera&#x27;s server rendering powered by Presto) or less. Only Google Search and Gmail works in Opera Mini, other Google services don&#x27;t.<p>So I am out of luck! Anyone out of luck like me?')
