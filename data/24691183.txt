It took one instance of actually falling asleep at the wheel for a few seconds to realize &quot;oh, that&#x27;s the difference between tired and falling asleep at the wheel.&quot;<p>I definitely recognize it now and never let it happen now (stopping and sleeping, trading out for someone else to drive, etc), but the point is <i>I didn&#x27;t think I was close to that level previously</i>.  Experience is something that we can&#x27;t expect all people to have and exhibit the wisdom of, and unfortunately some things learned through experience are much harder (or nearly impossible) to teach without doing, and for dangerous things that&#x27;s a problem for normal people.<p>As a much much more extreme example, I&#x27;ve heard that&#x27;s why Navy Seal training keeps candidates up and physically and mentally exhausted for days at a time.  Partly to see who can handle the pressure, and partly so they have experienced that condition before and understand it in themselves and others.')
