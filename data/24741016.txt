Item(by='boznz', descendants=None, kids=[24741478], score=None, time=1602356098, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24736106, text='Delphi programs are still mainly compiled for windows desktops, I have noticed the binary for the 120K line MPR system I developed for my client has creeped up from about 8MB to 20MB since 2007. My current delphi 10.2 takes 7.2 seconds to do a full compile or about 2 seconds if I just hit the run button and it only has to re-compile the modules I was working on, this has remained pretty consistent over the 13 years since I first wrote it, despite improvements to the hardware.<p>I think people can read too much in to your statement about the stupid source code the compiler generates (which I cannot confirm or deny), as the final exe binary is lightning fast without any optimisations, all performance issues I have ever encountered in Delphi go back to network calls such as REST APIs, MySQL libraries, printing, network drives, etc, good multi-threading can hide most. There are optimisation levels on Delphi but in 20 years I have never felt the need to go off the default.<p>As a developer, I will take near instant compilation over optimisation any day.')
