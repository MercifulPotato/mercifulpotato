I moved to the Bay Area in 2010 with a bank balance of 10k which were basically my savings from my part time job in University. I started my first job and have been saving monthly  since then. I don&#x27;t own a house as it is too expensive. In the decade since, I met my future wife, married and had a child. I have close to 450K in savings + some stock. I am mostly frugal but spend for my wife and child.')
