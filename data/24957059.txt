There was a time when papers, books, resumes, contracts, etc. almost always came as Word. Does anyone else remember getting a book as preface.doc, chap1.doc, chap1a.doc, chap2.doc, subchap2a2.doc, and so on, and a mess of jpegs and gifs and trying to figure out how it had to be assembled, and discovering something was missing, or that one chapter was newer than the others. That&#x27;s one reason I really like PDF -- it&#x27;s one file, self-contained, and linear.<p>On the other hand, I really wish it was more diff&#x27;able. If for example a credit card company changes one word in their terms &amp; conditions PDF, it  seems like 90% of document changes at the binary level. I know that PDF diff tools exist, but there must be tremendous internal complexity in the PDF format for tiny changes to alter the whole structure.')
