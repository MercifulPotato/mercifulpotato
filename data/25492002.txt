The utility of this media is to increase worker morale and make them more docile and less interested in &quot;the hunt&quot; or &quot;playing the game&quot; of mate discovery&#x2F;signaling&#x2F;courting. The mind&#x2F;body during a viewing session is idled (not going anywhere) - tapping the reptile brain as a shortcut around the ancient accountability driver that is sculpting the self for mate approval &amp; selection (sting of rejection inspires adaptation).<p>Imagine the need to sneeze but never feeling the release. Backlogged desire for energy exchange nearly satisfied by staring out of a one way mirror (search results, Ex Machina) into an ironic public display of intimacy.<p>An advanced society is romantic. Leave something to the imagination - construct metaphors to describe the act if it becomes so urgent that it must be advertised.<p>Sometimes I will hear explicit lyrics allowed to project into public spaces. Are we baboons or humans?')
