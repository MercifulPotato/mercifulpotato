As if Windows and Linux running machines don&#x27;t have cases where they keep running on shutdown?<p>macOS&#x2F;T2 has bugs like all software, but this is not some general state of macOS&#x2F;T2, which runs fine without &quot;crashing on shutdown&quot; for hundreds of millions of other people (including those with MBP16).<p>How about it&#x27;s some particular production run &#x2F; unit, and or some particular app?<p>(Which can happen for any vendor &#x2F; OS)')
