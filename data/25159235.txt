If you use a language with := for assignment and = for comparison (or something similar), sure, making != appear as ≠ might make sense. But if you’re using almost any C-family language, you’ve already broken the mathematical model of what the equals sign means. After that, I side with nicoburns and say that now you’re obscuring what it <i>actually</i> means (in favour of something that’s more or less incorrect in mathematical notation).')
