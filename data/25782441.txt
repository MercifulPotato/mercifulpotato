Your reference study merely shows that the phenotypical traits have a strong correlation with the behavior traits (in at least foxes). This selection requires offspring but its seems the parent is referencing a hormonal change due to social behavior.<p>I agree with the premise, that social and environmental norms can influence hormones, but the fox study is a different phenomenon altogether.')
