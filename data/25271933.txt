In list view you can click and drag anywhere to rubber band select, but if the whole row were an active click region for the file, you&#x27;d be dragging the file instead. (I just tried this in PcManFM, and it does indeed behave this way).<p>I agree it&#x27;s inelegant to have shorter file names be harder to select, but on the other hand they all have a great big icon; the text being clickable too is just icing.')
