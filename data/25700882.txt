Biden can be relied upon to not e.g. flip-flop as Trump did on North Korea or petulantly ask what the point of a long-term alliance is, and therefore is much better for those countries in Asia who want to resist China but want their major ally not to behave so erratically. In fact, Trump seemed to think of China as a counterparty with whom a ‘deal’ could be struck for his own political purposes:¹ he had no actual ideological objection to e.g. the camps in Xinjiang; Biden, like most members of the blob, at least pretends (probably even to himself!) to consistently and resolutely oppose that sort of thing (the obvious examples of e.g. support for Saudi Arabia notwithstanding), which means far more consistency. And consistency is good for alliances.<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;116th-congress&#x2F;senate-bill&#x2F;1838" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;116th-congress&#x2F;senate-bill&#x2F;183...</a><p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;21&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-uighurs-china-trade.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;21&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-uighurs...</a>')
