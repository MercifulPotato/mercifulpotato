Where are people reading this?<p>If someone stops paying for private data hosting, then I&#x27;d expect them to lose private data hosting -- in full.  I don&#x27;t see how the &quot;<i>private</i>&quot; in &quot;<i>private data hosting</i>&quot; could be seen as severable without explicit agreement to such a provision.<p>By analogy, it&#x27;d be like if someone requested a plumber come by to their house to replace their toilet.  Then when cancelling the request, the plumber said, okay, we can cancel, but you must accept the free version of this service: they&#x27;ll come by and take your old toilet away -- because this is a free service, you cancelling the paid version merely cancels them putting in the new toilet.  They still get your old toilet.<p>I mean, it seems to me that a customer who cancels something shouldn&#x27;t be forced to accept a substitute service.  It&#x27;d seem reasonable for the service-provider to <i>ask</i> if the customer wanted the substitute, but language implying that the customer <i>must</i> accept it seems wrong.<p>But, is that what&#x27;s happening here?')
