And of course nothing beats a hand written text. It&#x27;s just a pain in the a<i></i> to type the whole thing after. But for me it wasn&#x27;t until using Scrivener that I managed to write more than a dozen pages before giving up. Scrivener just makes it easy for me to write piece by piece. While a long Word or Pages document just gets too much and demotivates me eventually. But yeah, everyone needs to find their own tool :)')
