We already have major issues maintaining the infrastructure on our roads. Fully transforming them will take a lot of time and money. I really think a more holistic approach is needed because self-driving cars will be solving a lot of problems, in hard ways, that are much more simply solved by (essentially automated) train, subway, trolley, and bus systems. Going all in on self-driving cars seems to be the wrong goal. We need to be thinking about how to transform our infrastructure and urban design to have the right solution in the right spot. I do think self-driving cars have a place in this, but simply slapping self-driving cars onto our existing car and road culture and design is not the right solution.<p>I really worry about the U.S.&#x27; nature about letting corporations dictate where society goes. We&#x27;re in this mess to begin with because of car corporations destroying public transportation in cities and requiring the new city designs to be built around cars. I think we&#x27;ll continue to see corporations create solutions that generate more problems.')
