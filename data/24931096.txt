It&#x27;s the zero-tolerance that&#x27;s harmful.<p>In the case of both the imaginary school and the imaginary code-of-conduct committee, the task is to square the unsquarable circle of human diversity. That takes nuance, emotional intelligence and flexibility. You can never get that 100% right, and the mistake is thinking you can. That&#x27;s where flexibility is important. Zero-tolerance is proudly anti-flexibility.<p>Either you put in the effort to construct a humane environment or you decide that it&#x27;s OK to throw the out-group under a bus (easier when you can dehumanize them). The latter takes a lot less work.')
