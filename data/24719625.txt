The total number of cases is probably 5-10x that.<p>I live in the Deep South, and honestly I suspect that our curves have fallen simply due to a &quot;limited&quot; herd immunity effect (i.e. the groups of people most likely to catch COVID have already done so in large enough numbers).  I certainly haven&#x27;t observed any significant change in behaviors since the July peak, yet the numbers are falling like a rock regardless.')
