Nokia&#x27;s vast majority of sales were in price segments where the iPhone didn&#x27;t even compete.<p>The iPhone destroyed its North American competitors at that time, Blackberry, Palm, etc.<p>Nokia was clearly destroyed by Android. Surveys at that time found Nokia customers mass defecting to Samsung and other Android vendors.<p>&gt; I think Elop&#x27;s strategy was to win over the American carriers&#x2F;market<p>A foolish plan, something Nokia never had accomplished even in the heyday of Symbian, when it dominated the rest of the world..')
