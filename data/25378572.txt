CyberPunk didn&#x27;t really anticipate how cheap solar and wind power would become, and a lot of the 1980&#x27;s projections expect rising energy costs. Beyond that, just look at things like the mRNA vaccines rolling out this week. The technology behind it is something you can almost work with in a home lab, but was unimaginable 10 years ago, and will save millions of lives.<p>&gt; Pollution is rampant<p>This is true in place, but it&#x27;s getting better. China is starting to clean up, and India looks to be making moves in this direction. The US is far cleaner and greener than it was in the 80s. The famous smog over L.A. is nearly gone.<p>&gt; crime is rampant<p>Crime until 6 months ago in the US had been declining for 30 years.<p>&gt; social and economic inequality is just accepted<p>People are making plenty of noise about this, and just this week the FTC, and EU regulators are taking on tech giants. I&#x27;m keeping an eye on this topic.<p>If we can get our shit together on CO2 emissions and how we utilize the ocean, the future isn&#x27;t looking all that dim.')
