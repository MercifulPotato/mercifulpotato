This issue will get traction on HN and maybe Twitter<p>2. Facebook engineers responsible will apologize, tell us they meant no harm<p>3. Facebook will change the name of the project and give it back to it&#x27;s rightful owner, maybe even reinstate their Facebook account (although unlikely)<p>4. In 3-6 months the very same thing will happen and we&#x27;ll go back to step 1<p>Hopefully at one point the engineers at Facebook (at least the ones that hang around HN) will realize what their employer does to the open source ecosystem and finally leave the company. This is not the first case, and will not be the last case of similar things happening. But when you&#x27;re getting a large salary that is hard to get elsewhere, I guess it&#x27;s really hard to leave.<p>Edit: HNers please! Don&#x27;t fill the issue with any more comments as it&#x27;s likely to be locked and not really achieve anything more than that (specifically looking at you &quot; dsignr&quot;)')
