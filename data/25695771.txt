But forget about Trump for a minute.<p>If I recall correctly, for years all these internet giants — Twitter, Google, FB, etc. — protected themselves from any legal action pretending they are not mass-media, because they don&#x27;t do any censorship and serve just as a middleman between content providers and consumers. Now, we all know that this obviously wasn&#x27;t true for at least a couple of years, but we also know that governments are slow and lazy, and it takes some time for them to adjust. So it wasn&#x27;t that surprising that there was no real consequence.<p>But over the last year all boundaries were so ridiculously, so mindbogglingly crossed, that I wonder if something has to change now. Or do they really have so much power now, that there&#x27;s zero reasons to be careful of government?')
