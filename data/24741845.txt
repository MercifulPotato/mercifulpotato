Maybe more so - learning algorithms come and go, but real-world data is always going to be inherently messy. The difference is in that we have a beautiful mathematical theory for backpropagation but not for data cleaning. So the courses that teach the former but not the latter are akin to the proverbial drunkard that searches for the lost keys under the street light - beautiful mathematical theories are easier to lecture on so they teach them instead of messier (but not less fundamental or useful) topics such as data cleaning.')
