Item(by='kevingadd', descendants=None, kids=[24726620], score=None, time=1602214032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24726430, text='&quot;union bureaucrats that don’t do anything except complicate everyone’s lives&quot; is an interesting assertion to make in this case where the union hasn&#x27;t even had an opportunity to do anything bad yet. Why does unionizing have to be treated as &quot;hardball&quot; if the union hasn&#x27;t even made any demands yet? Does the status quo <i>have</i> to be &quot;employees have to do what I want, no questions, even if it&#x27;s illegal&quot;? Lots of employer misbehavior is widespread in the US - wage theft, for one, is absolutely rampant - and unionizing is one possible option for combating it because it allows you to collectively bargain to resolve your grievances with the employer instead of dragging them into court or trying to get law enforcement to go after them. It&#x27;s interesting to me that the mere act of unionizing is somehow justification for an employer to get out the baseball bat and go to town on your knees &quot;because you took your benefits for granted&quot;. If things were really so good, why did they unionize?')
