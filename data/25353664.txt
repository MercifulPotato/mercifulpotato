Any time my partner and I search for anything on Etsy it becomes very quickly evident that many (if not most) of the products are coming from factories in China. Nearly any time we&#x27;ve bought something, the tracking is usually strange, the shipping process takes several weeks, and sometimes reveals Chinese import&#x2F;export intermediaries. Occasionally there is Chinese branding on the box or contents. Some sellers are much more careful to conceal the products origins than others.<p>To be fair it isn&#x27;t always low quality or terrible, but it&#x27;s clearly not all made by some lone artisan chiselling away in their workshop either.<p>Anyway Etsy appears to have a much worse problem with this than even Amazon. The cynic in me suspects that given how much revenue these factories generate for Etsy, they probably aren&#x27;t too interested in cracking down on it anytime soon.')
