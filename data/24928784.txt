In the UK I&#x27;m now in the highest risk area and still allowed to walk and cycle from home and travel around my county by car. That could easily be a 20 mile walk or 50 mile bike ride from home if I had time on my hands. I could take a mask and buy takeaway food from a shop or cafe. Just trying to compare the rules in different areas.<p>Harshest lockdown in the UK was probably in Scotland where you were restricted to not be more than 5 miles home which could still easily allow a 10 mile walk.')
