A review is an opportunity for a user to give their honest feedback to any prospective user and (incidentally) to the app developer(s), so a bunch of reviews bombing an app into oblivion has the potential to be wasteful and harmful (unauthentic negative ratings from competitors, like you mentioned). But on the other hand if Firefox mobile has average reviews and I don&#x27;t leave any kind of review since I&#x27;ve been fairly satisfied with my experience with the app for the eight or so years I&#x27;ve been using android, then they release Firefox Daylight and completely ruin the experience for me, preventing me from doing things I&#x27;ve been able to do for years and fundamentally tanking the experience, should a five star review from 2017-18 be considered more relevant than my 2 star review from 2020? And the other thousands of 1 star reviews flooding in after the update? What if a company has a bad app, changes their process from waterfall to agile (sorry, had to inject a little humor here), overhauls their app, and gets a huge influx of positive reviews the same day as the release. Do the negative reviews left over time have more relevance than the positive reviews left after the update?<p>I&#x27;m not trying to take a position on what the right approach is, I&#x27;m hoping to understand a perspective that&#x27;s different from mine :).')
