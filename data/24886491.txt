Planet Ebooks are based on Australian public domain laws, so you can’t actually legally download <i>1984</i> in the US from them.<p>(On SE we have a warning that you need to check your own jurisdiction’s public domain laws; you aren’t legally allowed to download <i>Peter and Wendy</i> in the UK for example.)')
