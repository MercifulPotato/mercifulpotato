But there is also a good reason to limit the length of lines for readability and indeed in typography the practice is to limit lines to ~50-70 characters. Personally I try to stick to that when I code because I find it more readable, and it&#x27;s not the same as automatic line wrapping.<p>In addition, unless you have heavily nested branches or loops with big-ish indentation, you don&#x27;t often get to 80 characters anyway, which opens another discussion on whether code with 10 levels of nested &#x27;if&#x27; or extra long sequences of boolean operators begs to be refactored.')
