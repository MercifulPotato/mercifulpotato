For example, if I needed to create a daily sales report every night, Airflow would be great because I could set up a timer to kick off a reporting process every night. Then I could do things like rerun the last 5 days of reports if needed, etc.<p>I was more interested in event-based tasks though. For example, a sale happens, and then a report about that individual sale gets generated. At the time, this seemed to require some Airflow hacks and would cause me to miss out on some of its features. Is this still the case?')
