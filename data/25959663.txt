And they are projecting that as far out as 2050, gas will remain the dominant source of energy for transportation.<p>However neither seems likely to me.  I believe that we will see a permanent shift towards more remote work.  That cuts out both a lot of commuting.  It also cuts out a lot of motivation for business travel.  (Bill Gates estimates a 50% drop in business travel.) Both suggest a permanent drop in demand in the short-term.  And in the long-term, the transition to electric vehicles seems likely to go much faster than the gas industry wants to believe.  We are already seeing places like Washington State pass laws that all new cars must be electric by 2030.  This suggests that the transition to electric will be eating into gas revenues fairly quickly.  This is not a small issue - use of oil for personal transportation is somewhere near half of all oil usage in the world.<p>So you say that &quot;nobody thinks that Exxon is about to go under&quot;.  But I&#x27;m looking at it and I think that they are a company that structurally has financial trouble, in an industry that has market trends against it.  No matter how big a household name they are, I would be very happy to take a bet that they go bankrupt in my lifetime.')
