Few GUI toolkits can easily be used from Ada, for instance. Ada has excellent support for interfacing with C code, but making decent bindings is never trivial.<p>I think lack of hype might be part of it too. Ada is seen as a stodgy and boring language good for writing autopilot software, whereas Rust and Zig are seen as new and exciting general-purpose programming languages. I&#x27;m not saying Rust and Zig bring nothing new to the table, of course, as they both do, but in terms of safety and programming with an emphasis on correctness, Ada has a lot to offer.')
