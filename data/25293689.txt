The Firestorm cores in the M1 are 3.1X faster at SPECint than the Icestorm cores.<p>In my world, the 3.1 - 4.5X faster sibling makes them very low performance, relatively. In a fully working together scenario, the &quot;8&quot; core M1 is equal in performance to a conceptual 4.5 core Firestorm part (see the Geekbench scaling, for instance). This, again, has positively nothing to do with any other core or part.<p>Bizarre that anyone thinks this is somehow negative or dismissive of the M1. It is an extraordinary chip. But they <i>intentionally</i>, purposefully put 4 very low performance -- <i>compared to Firestorm</i> -- cores because it matches the computing model of users average workload.')
