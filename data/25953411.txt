There was a big thing about it last year, as you recall.<p>Before that there was a thing about &quot;out of control white kids terrorizing a native elder&quot; which turned out to be a total lie as well.<p>Trying to think of any major news story about &quot;out of control black kids terrorizing whites&quot; in any recent decade. Last I know is the Central Park jogger case from the 1980&#x27;s.')
