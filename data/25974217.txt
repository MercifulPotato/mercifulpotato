The worst is Chromium (via QtWebEngine, via qutebrowser), which seems to ignore things.<p>No, I&#x27;m not using XWayland.<p>I edited my comment above after you posted -- the Wayland protocol unfortunately does expose the screen size in millimeters to the client.  I&#x27;m pretty sure Chromium and QT use this, which is why I need to lie to them.<p>Another question: is there any sort of &quot;Wayland socket proxy&quot;?  Like a stupid simple program that offers up a $WAYLAND_DISPLAY socket to a client, opens its own to a server, and then passes all results through unmodified?  It would be <i>really</i> easy to hack a change like this into a proxy like that, but I can&#x27;t seem to find one.  Sort of surprising; the simplicity of the Wayland protocol makes it seem like such a thing should exist.  Sort of like waypipe, but without the cross-network magic.')
