Creating anything collaborative that wasn&#x27;t restricted to a local network was exceedingly difficult as well.<p>The Web fixed all that, albeit at the cost of cratering developer productivity, a massive increase in complexity and higher barriers to entry for new devs.<p>And if you&#x27;re asking me why the number of developers exploded while the barriers to entry supposedly went up, my answer is that the new opportunities that came with unrestricted worldwide distribution of software trumped the narrower issue of writing that software in the first place.')
