As communication becomes decentralized, the ability to accrue a large audience becomes more difficult. This supports the rise of ideas that can gain widespread support on their merit, as opposed to gaining widespread support via having a mass audience to start with.<p>To illustrate: on one side, we have a centralized extreme: Twitter (or Reddit, or Facebook). On the other side we have a decentralized extreme: spoken word. Which is easier to radicalize a country with?<p>If extremists move to decentralized or p2p alternatives to social media, they will shrink in the long run, letting the fringe ideas remain on the fringe.<p>If all social media went the way of decentralization, we would see far less extremism in general, simply because most people wouldn&#x27;t go looking for it and it&#x27;s pretty hard to spread extremist ideas in a one-on-one conversation.')
