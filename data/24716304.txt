Item(by='acituan', descendants=None, kids=[24717307], score=None, time=1602136750, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24716203, text='You parsed the sentence wrong, I am talking about &quot;feeling down&quot;, not &quot;down here&quot;.<p>The title of the advertising blog post is literally &quot;I built an app to fix my depression&quot; and goes on to the details of their situation. Certainly we don&#x27;t have enough data to assess the severity of their n=1 depression but having gone to professionals and used SSRI medication by definition makes them a part of the <i>clinical</i> population.<p>If they were to say &quot;this app helped me with the negative emotions that came with depression&quot;, that would be OK, but they go on to claim that app has <i>fixed</i> their previously SSRI requiring depression, an app they sell a public subscription for. That association is definitely not OK.<p>&gt; Whats the world coming to if someone cannot create an app to help ease negative emotions without being harassed by gatekeepers and rent seekers?<p>It is the same world where people have induced harm abusing people&#x27;s illnesses or desperation in the name of a quick buck. I am not saying this is the intention of the app maker, but the gate-keeping is there for a reason.<p>Look at this way, anything claiming to be potent enough to <i>fix</i> something can also be potent enough to <i>hurt</i> you. We can&#x27;t have it both ways with wishful thinking. That is why we need discrete labels, concrete processes and well evidenced claims when we go about what is an antibiotic or what is a cure for depression.')
