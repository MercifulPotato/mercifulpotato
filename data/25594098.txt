At this point one can&#x27;t use <i>GPLv2</i> or <i>GPLv3</i> code any more, only <i>GPLv2+</i> code.<p>Furthermore, licencing under <i>GPLv+</i> puts blind faith into the <i>F.S.F.</i>; it irrevocably licenses one&#x27;s code under a licence that doesn&#x27;t exist yet.<p>When <i>GPLv4</i> is eventually released, the software is now released under it, and <i>GPLv4</i> might contain provisions one doesn&#x27;t agree with, but one can&#x27;t revoke it now.<p>IT&#x27;s absolutely not a solution.')
