It feels wrong.<p>How My Paid Community Made $5K in Its First Week.<p>May be: How I started paid community for developers successfully.<p>This may seem like good copy but in reality with this kind of &quot;transparency&quot; you are losing a lot of valuable members.\nPersonally I don&#x27;t understand the business model of this product.

Because if you&#x27;r product is access to closed information channel pricing is too high.  As a customer I don&#x27;t understand for what I am paying. There are a ton of resources in any form for topics that you provide, what is differentiation factor?')
