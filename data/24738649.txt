The reason is simple - for my use cases getting a new phone didn&#x27;t add anything - no new functionality, no new design.<p>In the past new phones used to mean some kind of additional function: either colors, or mp3 support, or bluetooth. Now it&#x27;s faster CPU and more pixels in your camera. After you sync stuff from your old phone you don&#x27;t even notice any difference.')
