Item(by='adventured', descendants=None, kids=[25639710], score=None, time=1609794972, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25637946, text='Apple: assembled by Foxconn.<p>If your premise were accurate, the primary value would be in Foxconn and they&#x27;d destroy Apple by competing with them and take their $60 billion per year in profit.<p>Most of the value is from Apple and the other component makers, not the company doing primitive assembly. Further, Foxconn makes nothing in the iPhone, so once again it&#x27;s very obviously not &quot;made by Foxconn.&quot; And that&#x27;s why Foxconn gets such a tiny slice of the profit.')
