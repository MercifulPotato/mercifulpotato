At times it was perceived as an attack on someone&#x27;s work, when it wasn&#x27;t meant to be. Then, I&#x27;d apologize, assuming it was ok.<p>I was experienced, and I thought I was being paid to mentor and oversee as part of my work.<p>I thought that others would understand and sympathize that I ranted because I was under a lot of stress. They didn&#x27;t.<p>They would tell others, and they would not confront me about it, which eventually resulted in a hellish working environment and semi-isolation. I believe at least one was even being unethical in their reaction to me speaking my mind, causing problems for me, probably with the best intention to wear me down, to get rid of the toxicity in their work environment &quot;for the good of the whole&quot;.<p>I now try to think about what I say, even when being direct would solve a problem more quickly. Sometimes that means that when I&#x27;m on calls, others will run over me. To get over that, I also try to act and believe that the other person is more qualified. I don&#x27;t do that with everyone, and it&#x27;s not appropriate for speaking with young children, but it&#x27;s usually good.')
