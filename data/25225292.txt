They&#x27;ve had enough. And now they exert their right to be left alone and not be harassed by a serious number of english speaking idiots. Places ending in -ing hasnt the same grammatical meaning like do<i>ing</i> something, that scheme is really common (Mering, Kissing, Manching, Piding, Peiting, and hundreds more). It&#x27;s the same idiots that beleaguer known instagram photo spots - just a worse kind. And only for some quick silly joke that humiliates the people there. This will hopefully stop the influx of assholes stealing the village&#x27;s signpost, &quot;insta posing&quot; at the village sign and making prank calls. Also note that normal people live there, probably in a closer knit arrangement than you normally would assume (3 digit inhabitants). I&#x27;m rather sure that persons who profit off the infamous name are looked down to (eg. the silly &quot;Fucking Hell&quot; beer brand, &quot;hell&quot; meaning light in that case in german). Dont forget it&#x27;s normal people living over there, Doctors, Engineers, Farmers - and they want to be treated that way :)<p>PS: The pronunciation will not change.')
