Item(by='verall', descendants=None, kids=[25128859], score=None, time=1605641546, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25127011, text='&gt; I feel like this sort of rhetoric is a fine example of the very phenomenon that I described<p>I see your point, that by attaching certain labels (like a logical fallacy), many people write off information without independently judging its veracity (whether the fallacy actually occured)<p>Yet in your case, you still fail to support your key claim:<p>&gt; I was describing how these types of stories can be discredited, by simply attaching a label to them...<p>Obviously some people will never read past the label, whether it is &quot;Qanon&quot; or &quot;socialism&quot;, but plenty of people do read past the label, and independently try to discover what is true.<p>I don&#x27;t think Dominion conspiracy is false because some low quality nbcnews article said it started on qanon - where it &quot;started&quot; does not really matter to me. I think it&#x27;s false because it&#x27;s obviously politically motivated and doesn&#x27;t make any fucking sense. There would be noticable statistical differences between the results of Dominion and other voting machines.<p>I reject the premise you seem to be trying to push, that only conspiracy theorists care about truth. I care about truth and am not a conspiracy theorist. Some conspiracy theories turning out to be broadly true (e.g. nsa metadata surveillance and mkultra) has no bearing on the truth of other conspiracy theories.<p>Conspiracy theorists are a result of modern magic like airplanes and fiat currency being poorly explained in school and bad critical thinking skills. Most conspiracy theorists believe in multiple directly conflicting theories because it maximizes the chance of being correct at some point.')
