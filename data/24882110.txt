Instead of today.<p>In my opinion, it&#x27;s harmful to our democracy that members of the &quot;losing party&quot; feel zero incentive to turn out on election day. It encourages disengagement and disillusionment, not to mention the polarization of the electorate.<p>In Germany, the &quot;crazy parties&quot; get some seats, so their voices are heard. It has a pacification affect on the mainstream parties.')
