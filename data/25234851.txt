I&#x27;ve been using Intercooler for a while now and haven&#x27;t tried htmx yet, but am looking forward to switching over. I really appreciate that you&#x27;re continuing to work on tools that make this approach to webdev easier.<p>I know the post says not to do it, but I&#x27;m planning to convert an existing project from Intercooler.
