I think this is a problem - PCA should really identify maximally different things for the top components. If they&#x27;re not perceptually different, then the PCA is not doing the best job at capturing perceptually relevant variance.<p>I presume what is happening is that the drums all have slight variants in timings, and PCA is not phase insensitive, so sees them as totally different.<p>I wonder if you&#x27;d get better results if you downsampled even more agressively, or did some more sophisticated feature transformation.')
