Pretty much everyone makes the common mistake of not understanding how a 33% chance of winning impacts independent events.<p>People assume that 33% chance of winning, means a pretty such sure fire win after 3 attempts (after all 33% * 3 is approx 100%). But every battle in Civilization is an independent event, so to get a sure fire win (90% confidence) you need to fight something 6&#x2F;7 times (I don’t know the exact number, been some time since I studied this).<p>Having the number of fights you win against an opponent be 2 or 3 times greater than the intuitive number of fights makes people think the computer to cheating. When really they just don’t understand how stats work.<p>To fix this the Civilization games actually skew their stats so they better align with human intuition. So if the game says you have a 33% chance of winning, then that means you’ll probably win after 3 fights. Despite the fact that really you have a 40%-50% chance of winning that fight.')
