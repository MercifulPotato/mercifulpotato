Item(by='scarmig', descendants=None, kids=[24703767], score=None, time=1602016096, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24701510, text='&gt; I&#x27;m telling you that your experience growing up in 1 place doesn&#x27;t give you the ability to generalize a entire region.<p>And where did I do that? I am actually quite happy to generalize, but the only thing I&#x27;ve said in the comment you were replying to is that I experienced discrimination in the South. A simple factual statement that says nothing in general about the South, aside from the fact that at least one person experienced discrimination there. You&#x27;re inventing statements in your head (&quot;he&#x27;s saying every last person in the South is homophobic!&quot;) and attributing them to me, based off of... nothing.<p>All that said, I do think there are accurate generalizations you can make about the South, or any large region. To take an extreme example, if someone said they had left the Middle East because the people around them were homophobic, you wouldn&#x27;t be jumping in to defend the region because Beirut has a comparatively bustling gay scene right now.<p>ETA: And, on further thought, if we&#x27;re going to be stridently anti-generalization, you&#x27;re generalizing about Atlanta. Forsyth County, for instance, is definitely exurban and just as definitely part of the Atlanta metropolitan area. Just because you want to present a rosy picture doesn&#x27;t mean you can generalize and say that every place in Atlanta is a beautiful utopia for LGBT residents.')
