The chain of &quot;cashing out&quot; needs to be maintained for the chain to even exist in the first place.<p>If there were no &quot;secondary&quot; investors, then the only way for an initial investor to reap their returns is via the profits generated, which can be many many years away.<p>But these &quot;secondary&quot; investors are in the same position - they may want to only invest for a set interval of time. So they have to &quot;cash out&quot; by selling to &quot;tertiary&quot; investors. And so on.<p>And as a company becomes more mature, their expected returns are more certain, and also lower (i.e., lower risk). So the tertiary investors are people who don&#x27;t want to take high risks, and want a steady stream of income.<p>The problem i have with a lot of people&#x27;s misconception is that they think that buying&#x2F;selling shares are useless activities, and does not benefit the overall economy.')
