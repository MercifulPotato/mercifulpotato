That is, if your company is not seeking outside investors, not seeking rapid growth, not seeking an &quot;exit&quot;, then it isn&#x27;t a real &quot;startup&quot;.  So, in addition to what you mention about user focus (or lack thereof), I feel that this hurts ambitious entrepreneurs by making them think the VC&#x2F;outside investment&#x2F;grow-or-die treadmill is the only way to get big and escape the &quot;lifestyle business&quot; stigma.  Many of them likely could succeed, albeit more slowly, without the treadmill.')
