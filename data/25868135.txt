I watched the parliamentary hearing live and from what I heard, they insinuated they may not continue &quot;some services or features&quot; if the laws are passed as-is.<p>Honestly though, the idea that Google should pay just for showing article links in results is absurd. Snippets is at best slightly more of an argument, but honestly they&#x27;re making use of the og meta tags that these news sites have put in their website themselves.<p>It sets a horrible precedent if you have to pay others for the crime of linking to their content.')
