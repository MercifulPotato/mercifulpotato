For example, I work at a highly rated company. The company expects you to show more dedication the higher you go. They measure that by the hours you work (even though policy says not to and sets them at 7.5 working hours per day). This is a financial company that constantly pushes technical people to increase financial knowledge.<p>So in order to be given the promotion, you want me to increase my working hours by about 13%. The new position has more responsibilities. You will give me only a 7% raise. Why the hell would I increase my hours, effectively taking an hourly pay cut, for a job with more responsibilities? Hey management, I can see you paying me less to do more. How&#x27;s that for financial acumen.')
