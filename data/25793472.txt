This is very interesting.<p>Also, unsolicited but maybe helpful: if I have a link to a PDF on a site I try and call it out as a download in the description.<p>&quot;A two page executive summary is also available for download&quot;<p>I say this because even though browser settings can be set to NOT download PDF files instead of automatically opening them in the browser itself, for some reason that can vary from site to site. I click a link and all of a sudden I&#x27;m downloading something? Panic!')
