Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604095062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946882, text='<i>&gt; The usual definition of event horizon is from the perspective of the external observer</i><p>Strictly speaking, no, the usual definition of event horizon is completely observer independent: the event horizon is the boundary of the region of spacetime that cannot send light signals to infinity. That region, and its boundary, are invariant geometric properties of the spacetime, independent of any observer.<p><i>&gt; time and space coordinate switch places</i><p>This is a common pop science statement, but it can be very misleading. It would be better to say that, inside the horizon, moving &quot;down in space&quot; (meaning, decreasing the surface area of the 2-spheres you pass through, since the radial coordinate that you are using is defined in terms of those areas) <i>is</i> moving forward in time: the &quot;forward in time&quot; direction in spacetime is <i>also</i> the &quot;decreasing areal radius&quot; direction in spacetime.<p>Even that, however, depends on a particular choice of coordinates. There are other choices of coordinates where it is not true (at least not in the simple form in which I have just stated it).')
