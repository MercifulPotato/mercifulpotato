Item(by='jsmith45', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610381520, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25729759, text='In the US it is illegal to &quot;void&quot; a warranty based on the user swapping a part out with a third party component, or having a third party service the device. There are of course some exceptions.<p>You can void a waranty with respect to damage caused by impropper servicing, or damage caused by the replacement parts.<p>Alternatively you can void warranty on basis of using third party parts or servicing if you provide said parts&#x2F;services for free.<p>Idea was: Warranty void is non-GM parts are used =&gt; Illegal, unless GM provides all parts for free. Waranty void for getting oil changes at a non-dealer =&gt; Illegal unless oil changes are provided completely free at the dealers.<p>While I suspect that most EU countries have similar rules for cars and the like, in the US these rules apply to any consumer good that costs $5 or more with a warranty (there could be some rare exceptions, as the FTC can grant waiver if the manufacturer can show that it is not possible for a third party to provide parts or service that will work properly, and that granting the waiver is in the public interest). Further free parts and services requirement applies to any form of repair and servicing.<p>In the US, if you don&#x27;t provide free screen replacement for a cell phone dropped by negligence, then you cannot legally deny warranty on the battery solely because a third party screen was used, unless you can show the third party screen or the process of installing it caused the battery problem. Of course, if you can show the battery problem was caused by dropping it in the first place, then you can deny warranty replacement.')
