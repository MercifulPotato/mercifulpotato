My address is bJvR8mykuvCyDhsbGum7eJNGkiSrC7uM8g; thanks!<p>I&#x27;m still amazed that it&#x27;s a fully working clone of youtube. Is there any info anywhere about... who made it? How long did it take? What&#x27;s the tech stack like? What were the hardest parts?<p>As a totally minor point, I originally started with the MacOS app, and it had a poor experience due to my own fault: my harddrive was almost full, so videos kept freezing in the first few seconds. I almost unfairly blamed you, but perhaps a warning might be good if there&#x27;s no space for the temporary video buffer. (I assume it&#x27;s streaming to disk.)<p>But, in terms of bugfixes or feature requests, that one probably shouldn&#x27;t be prioritized. ~Nobody is out of harddrive space. Just grasping for straws at things to mention in case it&#x27;s helpful.<p>Rooting for you. Good luck. I&#x27;ll try transferring over my videos, and I&#x27;ll consider linking to LBRY (or is it odysee?) by default for my videos. It&#x27;s a risk -- if your platform goes down, all my backlinks will go with it -- but I like the david vs goliath aspect.<p>That&#x27;s actually a tough decision. Pretty much everybody in the world expects a youtube link for a video, and has integrations for it. I wonder what the embedding situation is like for this... I&#x27;ll try it out.<p>By the way, the odysee front page is far better than any other youtube competitor so far. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odysee.com&#x2F;$&#x2F;tech" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odysee.com&#x2F;$&#x2F;tech</a> is particularly interesting. Keep up the quality, and this might have a shot.')
