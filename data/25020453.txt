Teenagers are, by and large, entirely aware that when adults ask them questions, they are likely to draw conclusions about policy towards teenagers.  They want to sleep later.  How likely is it that they would admit it, if they didn&#x27;t really get any more sleep out of this?<p>Not saying it&#x27;s not true, or that it isn&#x27;t an interesting idea to try to put this &quot;natural experiment&quot; to work somehow, but I&#x27;m not sure this is really enough to draw any conclusions, and I actually already agreed with their conclusion before seeing this study.<p>A better method might be to compare home-school students to public schools, or compare summer-break to school year, and to use some more objective metric than a phone interview.')
