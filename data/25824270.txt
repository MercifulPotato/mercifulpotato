Item(by='isoskeles', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610991642, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25821544, text='This article doesn&#x27;t present a thoughtful definition on what technology, and by extension technosolutionism, is. This is what we get:<p>&gt; Technosolutionism is a way of understanding the world that assigns priority to engineered solutions to human problems. Its first principle is the notion that an app, a machine, a software program, or an algorithm offers the best solution to any complicated problem.<p>As a clear example, the article proposes that contract tracing apps are ineffective unless we are also testing the population at risk. Okay, where does testing come from? Testing is also a technological solution. A human does not look at your sample with a pen and pad and make a decision on whether you have covid. The sample doesn&#x27;t speak to us and admit actually it does have covid.<p>Testing is technology. Vaccination is technology. I&#x27;ll even argue that washing your hands is technology, in the sense that &gt;99% of us interpret the message as to use mass-produced soap with water delivered to your sink through plumbing.<p>---<p>Technology usually makes life easier in some way of convenience. Although it can be unclear if it really makes life easier, as technology will often come at the cost of maintaining it. The invention of cars probably looked like a huge convenience, and out of it birthed an entire industry where people made their livelihoods, and now we&#x27;ve moved on to hating ourselves for inventing cars and ruining the environment, creating another industry that creates technology to make the use of energy have less of an effect on the environment. One day, we&#x27;ll have a problem with that too.<p>My biggest issue with this article isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s against technosolutionism, it&#x27;s that it tries to draw some ARBITRARY line in the sand where the procession of technological progress must end. Sending kids to school over Zoom is where we draw the line? What about the problem where public schools closely model the idea of working at an industrial factory?')
