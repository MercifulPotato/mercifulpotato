Yes in anything that is &quot;serverless&quot; there&#x27;s a server somewhere but you don&#x27;t have to maintain it, you get charged by usage only so no running cost. Now their claim about being deplatform resistant is probably not true though as someone is running that CDN and can just as easily deplatform you. But serverless in the ops community does not mean literally no server is running.<p>For instance Lambda must have a server running these tasks, it mean it is not of your concern and you don&#x27;t pay for a long running process.')
