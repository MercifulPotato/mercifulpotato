It&#x27;s such a &quot;batteries included&quot; framework that if you want to do what Rails is good for, it&#x27;s going to be super easy, but if you want to do something a little bit different a lot of times it feels like you have to almost break Rails to make it work.<p>To some degree I think it&#x27;s a matter of taste, but I would much rather start from a blank slate, with a set of sensible tools to build my solution up from scratch, rather than having an almost finished product I have to carve my solution out of.')
