But that&#x27;s just facilitating a transaction, which is usually not a 30% cut.<p>&gt; 30% is reasonable because that is the standard rate in most of these relationships.<p>Again, standard and reasonable are different things.  And again, the problem is you can&#x27;t choose the type of relationship.<p>&gt; If it wasn&#x27;t reasonable people wouldn&#x27;t publish with Steam, Gog, Nintendo (nintendo lowered the rate if you look at the IGN link to 30% to match other stores).<p>People get pressured into unreasonable rates all the time...<p>&gt; Also if it wasn&#x27;t financially viable with the 30% fee (which has been there since 2011) then people wouldn&#x27;t publish apps there.<p>It&#x27;s always going to be viable for <i>someone</i> to publish.  Even with a 90% fee.  But surely we can agree that 90% would not be reasonable, even if it was standard?')
