This actually worked out great but after some time I decided to jump over and see if I could live with WSL under Windows.<p>Windows is not as nice as MacOS, but WSL1 (tried WSL2 for a few months but still prefer WSL1) has allowed me take advantage of affordable high performance hardware and maintain support for the software I use daily.<p>I may buy a low powered MacBook laptop in future (because there are no Windows laptops with a trackpad that compares) but I don&#x27;t think I will ever use it as a primary desktop environment again.')
