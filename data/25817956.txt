Let me give a different anecdote.<p>When I open up teams, I have one account, I log in and have access to all other things in the account. Basic software behavior we&#x27;re all used to.<p>When I open up Slack, it does or does not want me to login again based on if I&#x27;ve been on this server before. It may or may not want me to make a new account depending on if I&#x27;ve made one on this server before. I try all of my emails with all of my potential passwords to see if login works, if not new account time I guess?<p>Instead of Discord were you can see all of your servers, Slack separates this all out that makes the entire user experience (at least for me) completely abysmal.<p>Then don&#x27;t even get me started with a lack of usernames and having intentionally hard-to-find ID. Again, why not do what Discord does and do Username#6789? Instead I have to search my friend &#x27;John Doe&#x27; and hope it&#x27;s the John I&#x27;m thinking of and not some random other John that I just invited to see all my business&#x27;s internal discussions.<p>To sum up my 2 cents:<p>Teams is about the same as Zoom with some text-based chat functionality thrown in and some neat Outlook calendar integration.<p>Slack is just Discord that is way, way worse.<p>Comparing the two doesn&#x27;t even make sense, but at least Teams does better in it&#x27;s respective category.')
