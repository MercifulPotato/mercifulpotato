Did not know at that moment who he was, but knew he was important. Not physically the guy other guys would think had movie star looks or charisma (say, like JFK), but very confident and looked you straight in the eye.<p>Everyone at that event can tell you what conversation they had with him and every conversation was on a different topic. He was curious, approachable, a sponge of knowledge and never forgot a face and name (particularly if you were attractive).<p>So you can get along with decent looks, a bit of charisma, but a lot farther if you know how to be engaging in conversations and make people feel special&#x2F;important.')
