It&#x27;s impossible for me to find them when I need them. I remember seeing a cool SaaS app that allows us to visually drag and drop Google sheets, Docs, PPTs into different canvas like area so we can see group them and see how they are connected visually. So the end result is like seeing a flow-chart where you see bunch of docs and sheets instead of boxes. \nIt&#x27;s not Notion or Roam Research. Does anyone remember the app I&#x27;m talking about?')
