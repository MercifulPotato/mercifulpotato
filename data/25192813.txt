Most of the city is in an enclave where one of the two major cable providers has exclusive rights. The parts of the city that require both providers to compete are dense, mostly apartments, and the providers get exclusive rights to each building. In most cases, the only other option is extremely slow DSL.<p>I’ve researched my options at every place I’ve lived and I’ve consistently been stuck with Comcast. It’s really a shame.')
