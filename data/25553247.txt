Pre-pandemic there wasn&#x27;t much need of stimulus, and certainly no need of the December 2017 tax cut (TCJA) that was supposed to &quot;pay for itself&quot; per its proponents, given the state of the economy and unemployment rate:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;UNRATE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;UNRATE</a><p>Now that isn&#x27;t the only measure of &#x27;success&#x27;, but if the unemployment rate is (say) &gt;8%, then spending money on &#x27;non-useful value&#x27; work, so that people can pay rent and buy food, isn&#x27;t such a bad thing in the short-term (IMHO).<p>Some certainly argue for full-employment all the time, but that&#x27;s a separate discussion than the general idea of raising aggregate demand to &#x27;induce&#x27; economic activity.<p>&gt; <i>Now, that spectrum has a range of answers. Sometimes you don&#x27;t really care about value, or you take value on faith, e.g. when constructing public infrastructure works. They put people to work, get people spending, and everyone agrees that the country is in dire need of infrastructure improvements right now.</i><p>Yeah:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;15&#x2F;611389675&#x2F;why-its-infrastructure-week-again" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;15&#x2F;611389675&#x2F;why-its-infrastruct...</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;3&#x2F;10&#x2F;21173209&#x2F;infrastructure-week-dead-rebranded-trump-tweets-united-policy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;3&#x2F;10&#x2F;21173209&#x2F;infrastructure-w...</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infrastructurereportcard.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infrastructurereportcard.org</a>')
