It doesn&#x27;t look right to praise C# for resolving the problem when C# merely took that idea from Java. C# came up with the templates part though.<p>What C# didn&#x27;t copy was the idea of turning every source file into a binary file. A library is just a zip archive of those .class binary files. What&#x27;s the advantage for C# to not have .class files and to pack everything into a &#x27;proprietary&#x27; library format? Why haven&#x27;t they copied the zip-idea, too?')
