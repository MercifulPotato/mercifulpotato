As compromises go, it&#x27;s pretty decent.<p>I few other wrinkles I&#x27;d suggest to reduce friction: a copyright registry is being reintroduced[0] here, and this registry must be made public just like patents and trademarks. Registrations and extensions should also be filed a year before expiration (no fair to create a derivative work based on something that is scheduled for expiration only to have the rug pulled out from under you). This gives the creator plenty of time to register a work after publication, minimizing the burden on copyright owners (currently copyright is granted with no notice or registration required).<p>[0] Okay, not really, a copyright registry still exists today, but given it is optional and only affects the amount of damages you can collect from violations and absence from the registry isn&#x27;t an affirmative defense, it isn&#x27;t really comparable to the kind of registry that is needed to make such a scheme work. Nor is it comparable to the functions of the registry as it existed before copyright was made automatic.')
