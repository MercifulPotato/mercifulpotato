Also give us telemetry.<p>Side note: no one cares, but I finally tracked down the cause of a really annoying bug, hibernation due to &quot;thermal event&quot; (CPU &quot;overheating&quot;) in Windows 10: It&#x27;s because of using dynamic disks in mirror mode (perhaps in other modes, as well). Makes Windows 10 hibernate randomly. Converted disks back to basic, no problems. Took me a long freaking time to finally solve this.')
