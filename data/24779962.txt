It is only in part about moving somewhere awesome.  A lot of people I know are just moving home to where their parents live.  So lots of places.<p>For us, a lot of our family actually is in SF or Seattle.  We&#x27;re a skiing&#x2F;biking family and I need to be in SF pretty regularly (but not daily) so SLC was the obvious choice.  Portland was a candidate because it also has short flights to SF but I figured if we were going to move I wanted <i>world class</i> skiing and biking, <i>in my backdoor</i>, not just decent skiing 1.5hrs away.')
