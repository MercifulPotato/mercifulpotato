I&#x27;m not even sure the 3xxx does ray tracing well enough to be worth it and it&#x27;s ~2x the performance level.<p>I.e. just because games on the consoles can support ray tracing now doesn&#x27;t mean they actually support it well. I still think it&#x27;s a generation or 2 away from running well (as a current 2080 Ti owner)')
