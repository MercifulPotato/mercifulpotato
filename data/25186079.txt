It almost magically discovered a pretty much all of my devices (hue+ikea+xiaomi hub) and created a default dashboard for them.<p>But then I wanted to change the dashboard, and stuff just didn&#x27;t work.<p>I wanted to add some scripting, but the WebUI didn&#x27;t let me do the things I wanted (and knew the system could do). And &quot;programming&quot; in YAML makes me puke in my mouth a bit every time.<p>Now I&#x27;m just consolidating all my devices to a simple MQTT-based environment with zigbee2mqtt, some python glue (BTLE sensors to MQTT) and NodeRED for automation and integration. Works like a charm.')
