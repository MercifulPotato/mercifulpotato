That is, if players A &amp; B both chose goats, then the remaining door is the car, and Monty cannot open it without ruining the game.<p>For this reason, both players should be playing &quot;blind&quot;, without seeing the other&#x27;s choices or the door Monty opens for the other player. Anything else doesn&#x27;t make sense for the game.')
