In a notes app, I have a TODO note where I save links and a few word description of what a link is. This gives me one place to maintain a reading list.<p>I also have notes for current projects&#x2F;tasks. I have structure and search to find things.<p>As a life-hack to make better use of my time, I use the Freedom.io service to block all social media and “time wasting” sites so that I can only access them before work, first half hour of lunch time, and after end of work day. In practice what this means is that I scan HN and Twitter early each morning for tech stuff that is useful&#x2F;interesting and add any useful links to my notes. Every few days I edit my notes to discard material.')
