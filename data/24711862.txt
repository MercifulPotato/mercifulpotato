We do have various proprietary tools, of course, but so do other companies.<p>2) The companies employ quite a few PostgreSQL hackers, but if you look at the development stats (e.g. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rhaas.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;who-contributed-to-postgresql.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rhaas.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;who-contributed-to-postgre...</a>) you&#x27;ll see there are many committers and developers in other companies.<p>That being said, I agree with the concerns expressed by Bruce in his blog post. Or more precisely - I do understand why people in the community have those concerns, but I believe (hope) it&#x27;s not going to harm the community.')
