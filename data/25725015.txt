I’m willing to stake my reputation, the president is willing to stake his reputation on the fact that we’re going to find criminality there.”<p>&gt; last summer<p>Sure, there are democrats who turned too much of a blind-eye to violence over the past summer. But I find it fallacious in the extreme to equate reducing a police budget with insurrection. For the particular New York exception, the budget cut to NYPD came to about 10% of the budget, which very closely tracks New York&#x27;s budget shortfall as a result of the Covid exodus from the city (12% budget shortfall) [0].<p>&gt; head-on-a-pike<p>“I’d actually like to go back to the old times of Tudor England. I’d put the heads on pikes. I’d put them at the two corners of the White House as a warning to federal bureaucrats,” he explained, as Media Matters for America first reported.<p>“You either get with the program or you’re gone ― time to stop playing games,” Bannon added. “Blow it all up.”<p>“That’s how you win the revolution,” Bannon said. “The revolution wasn’t some sort of garden party. It was a civil war.”<p>Even when one takes that statement as charitably as you do, it doesn&#x27;t help the level of discourse.<p>&gt; Left leaning celebrities<p>I said upthread, I believe we should be moving corporate moderation etc into a local government due process. IMO the Texas DA (for example) should be able to ask Twitter to moderate a statement like that, and have the moderation heard in court. But Snoop Dogg doesn&#x27;t hold nuclear codes, or hold the ear of the person who does.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;2020-city-budget-police-defunding&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;2020-city-budget-police-d...</a>')
