Some are literally 20 minute fixes,  but ... you don&#x27;t always know that up front, you just generally know it may be pretty small.  2 might sometimes go up to a day.<p>A 3 is assumed to be a day or two.<p>A 5 is assumed to be 3-4 days.<p>An 8 would be 1-2 weeks.<p>Anything higher is backlogged until it&#x27;s broken down into smaller segments.<p>Not sure how well that compares to usages by other teams, but that&#x27;s one data point for your question.')
