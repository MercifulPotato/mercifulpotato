Nice to meet you here! :)<p>Clojure is quite popular at my workplace, however I do use Common Lisp and Scheme for hobby projects.<p>For example, parts of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathb.in&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathb.in&#x2F;</a> (parsing, sanitization, spam alert, etc.) are written in Common Lisp. By the way, the code of MathB.in is old, rotting, and not fully open source. If I can find the time for it, I will clean it up, add HTTPS to the website, and release the complete source code soon.')
