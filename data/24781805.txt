Judging all these acts exclusively through a 21st-century lens is pretty reductive. Saying &quot;Hamlet sexually harassed Opheilia&quot; is fine, as far as it goes, which isn&#x27;t very far.<p>It&#x27;s a tragedy, and he&#x27;s the protagonist of a tragedy, not a hero. His becoming obsessed with the unjust death of his father and fucking everything up is the whole point. Saying he&#x27;s acting like an ass is both obvious and a distraction from the main event, which is to see a great man brought low by his flaws, and to contemplate fate, the human condition, or whatever else you can take away from the play.')
