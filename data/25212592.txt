You need to keep track of the relationships they have with those stores, the conversations they have, where those stores are along the journey to becoming customers. You want to understand how your marketing expenses influence that process. Further downstream, youâ€™ll probably want to connect sales data to those stores over time to understand patterns and manage your operations. These are all pretty common use cases for something like Salesforce and there is a pretty widely accepted data model that most companies adopt to do these sorts of things which Salesforce out of the box is built around.')
