I have one that reliably powers 2 monitors (a 5k and a 4k), 1gb network and powers my macbook.<p>I think the real problem is we get a lot of cheap products coming from China with very little quality control. QC is poor because they have no incentive to build in quality. E.g. you likely don&#x27;t realize how flaky the dongle is until after the 30 day return policy, the branding on many of these plugs is minimal so you don&#x27;t even know which company to avoid for your next purchase.')
