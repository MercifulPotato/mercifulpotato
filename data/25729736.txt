But it appears that monocrystalline panels can be manufactured with some flexibility. Hence my usage of the term &quot;semi-flexible&quot;. Sunpower, for example, claims to produce high efficiency semi-flexible monocrystalline panels that would flex sufficiently for use on a bimini top, for example.<p>It further appears that my statement &quot;high efficiency panels are typically semi-flexible without the frame&quot; is inaccurate- they are typically not reasonably described as semi-flexible, even without the frame and coating.')
