Allowing balances to be negative would be a regulatory violation so what most online casinos do is to first lock and update the balance (or balances since there is also bonus money) while making sure it does not go into the negatives and then log transaction amount plus after balances.<p>So for online casinos I would not say that the balance is cached. And I imagine traditional banking also has accounts which are never allowed to go into the negatives where a similar solution is required.')
