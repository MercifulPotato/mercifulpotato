It&#x27;s not short for no reason. Even a layman can piece together GS business model doesn&#x27;t have much life left and so the stock ought to have downward pressure. Hedge funds are pursing that strategy. You may disagree but it&#x27;s a rational argument with a rational arbitrage.  They may be wrong, but such as life.<p>On the other hand, WSB is basically saying, &quot;So what? We don&#x27;t care about the argument, we don&#x27;t care about the true value here, we&#x27;re just exploiting a market dynamic (probably illegally), and collectively interfering with the ability of hte market to price this efficiently, and we just want the number on the price to move so we can cash out.&quot;<p>The history of financial markets is littered with the bodies of unsophisticated investors participating for non-fundamental reasons. Tulips, .com, real estate bubble.
