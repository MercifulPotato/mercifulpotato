I remember a very good article on control theory which had a hard and often missed point. Which is digital sampling creates far more noise in the phase domain than the amplitude one. For control loops this is important because stability depends on phase. The upshot is you need a higher sampling rate than you would naively think.<p>Bob Pease also had some articles on audio. I think he would agree that open loop analog circuits often produce harmonics that people like. And digital and feedback controlled ones tend to produce harmonics people HATE.')
