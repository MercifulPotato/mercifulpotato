Two of the very large companies mentioned in the article got in touch with me to find out what what could be done to improve the state of data in OSM useful for pedestrian routing. They were conscious that a disproportionate amount of effort went into supporting motorised vehicles, and wanted to improve the situation.<p>Of course, they were doing so out of self interest too, and openly acknowledged this. But they openly shared their own datasets and offered resources&#x2F;advice too.<p>The OSM data is so powerful (and I don&#x27;t mean the map - I&#x27;m referring to the tags, which are a hidden gem). I&#x27;m all for anything that continues to improve this data.')
