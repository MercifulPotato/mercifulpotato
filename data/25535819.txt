I&#x27;m asking more about the corporate culture at Apple and more generally â€“ is this sort of advocacy encouraged or discouraged, does it improve the chances of a new idea, that sort of thing.<p>I mean Apple has to see a good bit of value in prototyping things and letting people come up with new stuff, or they wouldn&#x27;t have job positions with the title &quot;inventor&quot;, right?
