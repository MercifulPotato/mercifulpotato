But Apple&#x27;s integration means that &quot;just works&quot; entails, for instance, automatic switching between devices. So I&#x27;m listening to music on my iPad, I pause it, pick up my phone and start a YouTube video. The AirPods automatically switch from the iPad to the iPhone without me doing anything. Nothing else &quot;just works&quot; like that, and it&#x27;s one reason people like to stay within the Apple ecosystem.')
