Item(by='suncherta', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611086976, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25834941, text='&gt;&gt; Amazon simply out-competes ElasticSearch with their own product when it comes to consultancy, services<p>&gt; You&#x27;re kind of right about this, but it&#x27;s the issue that AWS just has a massive head-start with any client that already uses AWS. They don&#x27;t really out-compete, they just use their existing vendor lock-in to gain an advantage.<p>Can&#x27;t client run his own Elasticsearch inside AWS? By installing and maintaining it yourself (or contracting someone to do it for you).<p>Then I don&#x27;t see vendor lock-in sense: &quot;We choose AWS to host us, now we have no real choice but to use Amazon Elasticsearch Service&quot;. Am I missing something here?')
