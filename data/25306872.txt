He would be correct if all or even lots of the world&#x27;s billionaires were picked by YC, but they aren&#x27;t. Sure, it may be possible to become a billionaire or build a billion dollar company without exploiting others, even as those others do not become billionaires themselves.<p>But is it even worth parsing this out? Income inequality is real, capitalism is fundamentally exploitative at its core, end of argument. YC&#x27;s interview process is... not at all relevant.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ll tell you how it&#x27;s really done, so you can at least tell your own kids the truth. It&#x27;s all about users.
