It&#x27;s the quite opposite. So many popular apps don&#x27;t even get a notice before getting banned, let alone small indie developers trying to get some users.<p>&gt;&gt; why the hell would anyone use it?<p>Not sure about others but I definetly don&#x27;t want a US company to put nose in everything I do online. Plus I don&#x27;t want to give a 30% cut for a regional app that I can publish on some local platform for local users. And I would rather deal with low quality apps than popular apps disappearing every now and then just because Google doesn&#x27;t like them.<p>&gt;&gt; do they have the authority to do that?<p>Yes but it&#x27;s not practical in country like India to enforce it. Free speech and what govt can regulate about internet are different things as far I&#x27;ve seen.')
