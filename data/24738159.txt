Including headers into headers just hides the problem, but it&#x27;s still there under the hood and grows worse the bigger the project becomes until it&#x27;s too late to do anything about it. That how you get hours-long compile times in large C++ projects.<p>Instead use few big headers, for instance one public-interface header per system&#x2F;module which only contains declarations (no inline or template code), and at most one private header for each module (or better none at all). Then keep the dependency tree between modules&#x2F;systems as flat as possible.<p>This is <i>especially</i> important for large projects.')
