(Test requires a machine and between 15min for rapid and O(hours) for PCR.)<p>Giving a vaccine is somewhere between one and five minutes per person. (Paperwork, clean site, inject, bandaid, next.) Plus vaccination is much cheaper to scale out -- you just need a few chairs and a folding table and a volunteer to create a flu vaccination station, for example.')
