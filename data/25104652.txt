And let&#x27;s be real here, it is emanating from right-wing media vastly more than from the left or otherwise. Unbiased reporting of a topic like voter fraud means reporting that Republicans are usually lying. Unbiased reporting of climate change means reporting that Republicans are usually lying. Unbiased reporting on the COVID pandemic means reporting that Republicans are grotesquely disinterested in human life.<p>Bias is subjective and insidious, but misinformation is obvious and unequivocally detestable. Right-wing news orgs are freely peddling misinformation. Networks like OAN aren&#x27;t even biased towards conservatism as much as they are seemingly built to serve the political interests of Donald Trump. It is simply not equivalent and should not be treated as such.')
