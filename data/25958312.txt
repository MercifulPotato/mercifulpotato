Although GameStop is small fries in comparison to other larger stocks, if that many people are willing to get together to vote with their dollars, that should scare wallstreet. And sure, this is &quot;organized&quot; but how is this any different than analysts with large audiences making calls and directing a large number of investors in the direction they want? Or hedge funds publishing their shorts and masses reacting based on that, affecting the stock. The hypocrisy. If they&#x27;re going to regulate the people to this extent, they better regulate and actually enforce the regulations on wallstreet. Can&#x27;t just protect one side.')
