Item(by='GuB-42', descendants=None, kids=[25281122, 25282163], score=None, time=1606937927, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25280001, text='I agree with the cheap launch platform argument but from another, perspective.<p>I don&#x27;t believe SpaceX numbers and BFR (it will always be BFR for me) is still a paper rocket (Raptor looks good though). But it is still cheap compared to traditional launches.<p>The problem is: SpaceX has now plenty of cheap, reusable Falcon 9s but not a lot of stuff to launch. There are not that many companies who want to build and launch satellites: it is expensive no matter what and the cost has to be justified. Falcon 9 rockets (including heavy) are also limited in capability: small fairing space and not the most efficient beyond LEO. Also, it may not be suitable for some sensitive payloads (military, etc...).<p>Ii means that SpaceX has good rockets, they already have the &quot;culture and skills for rapid relaunch&quot; but not enough market for it. So they did the obvious thing: create their own.<p>As for BFR. I made the choice not to take SpaceX communication into account, it is worthless. Same thing with everything by Elon Musk. I only believe what they show, which is already impressive enough.')
