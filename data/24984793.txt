Suppose you want to do some mapping, which is a pretty common scenario for these kind of industrial drones. With a quad, you can easily mount a camera which is mostly pointing in the same direction, regardless of air speed. With a gimbal you can direct it pretty freely.<p>With a VTOL aircraft like your [1], the ground angle would shift 90+Â° degrees depending on airspeed (nose-up hover vs nose-forward flight). It would require a pretty aggressive gimbal to just keep the camera pointed towards the ground, and some angles would be impossible to get in hover mode.<p>But for some industries like AG&#x2F;large scale mapping, range is so important and you are basically always just interested in looking straight down and fly in simple pattern, that fixed vings are a thing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wingtra.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wingtra.com</a>')
