Item(by='baryphonic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608489719, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25487597, text='&gt; Whatâ€™s more frightening is the political corruption that Google and Facebook are enabling. Thousands of newspapers have fallen apart over the past ten years, and over the next three, thousands more will collapse. Aside from killing pro-social institutions like newspapers, these platforms have been inducing significant harms society-wide, from enabling ethnic cleansing abroad and divisiveness in Western democracies, to undermining our economy writ large. The end state is frightening.<p>I honestly laughed at the claim that newspapers are &quot;pro-social.&quot; What evidence is there for <i>that</i>? And while certainly social media reduces barriers against certain awful mob behavior, it&#x27;s hardly reasonable that Facebook or Google are responsible, especially since in the very next paragraph he gripes about YouTube ruling over creators with an iron fist.<p>I despise both of these companies and want to see the world rid of them in their current forms, but this whole article is fairly silly. Openly celebrating an authoritarian strongman like New Deal trust-buster Thurmond Arnold is not exactly my idea of &quot;rule of law,&quot; which Stoller repeatedly appeals to and claims to cherish.')
