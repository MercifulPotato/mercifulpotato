Each week one engineer from the team is responsible for answering inquiries, not necessarily they have to know the answer but they are the ones to be interrupted and handle accordingly.<p>It works pretty well, our devs are capable of assessing urgency to either bring it up on Slack, wait for the next stand-up or call to arms if it&#x27;s something critical.<p>It improves rapport with stakeholders and other teams; it improves morale, it&#x27;s predictable who will be interrupted during the week, alleviating that from the rest of the engineers. And as a side-effect it helps to force knowledge sharing over time.')
