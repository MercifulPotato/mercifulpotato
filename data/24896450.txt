The cure isn&#x27;t just research, it&#x27;s also logistics and there does not exist a capable non-profit to do the logistics part of it in such a short time. Also you underestimate how much it costs to build such a supply chain capable of producing <i>and</i> shipping that many vaccines around the world. Hint: the research costs are just a fraction of the logistics cost, you just don&#x27;t see that up front because it&#x27;s also used to ship other stuff besides vaccines.<p>These things cost money, and you assume your taxes are covering them in full. They don&#x27;t.')
