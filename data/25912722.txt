I said you might be able to extract the radioactive materials by using brute force. You might also be able to extract the high explosives, but so what? There are far easier ways to obtain high explosive materials. The fact that you could conceivably extract the radioactive materials is why the weapons are very well guarded. The point is that if you somehow stole a weapon, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it as designed.<p>The engineering process for these things is highly adversarial. Layers and layers of red teams trying to break them in the conceptual phase, the design phase, the build phase, and the deployment phase. Plus coding extremely detailed computer models of the weapons and their usage scenarios and trying to make things fail in simulation. On the fastest supercomputers in the world.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newswise.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;sandia-weapons-program-meets-safety-design-requirements" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newswise.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;sandia-weapons-program-mee...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hpcwire.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;hpe-strikes-deal-to-provide-crossroads-a-new-supercomputer-for-the-nuclear-stockpile&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hpcwire.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;hpe-strikes-deal-to-provi...</a>')
