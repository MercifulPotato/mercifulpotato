In fact the whole SSD is now an extension of your RAM is a selling point of the new consoles.<p>Is it as fast as having more DRAM in all possible scenarios? No, but with good memory management the real world performance might very well be identical to a system with the same capabilities and even greater than traditional memory systems with larger non-unified pools.')
