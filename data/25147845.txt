That is crystal clear and there is not even any leeway for interpretation about it.<p>It is always a bit amusing, though also somewhat infuriating, whenever somebody writes something like this. It often is a good indicator of what likely is to follow.<p>Truly ironic, that the people who (apparently) know the least about international law are usually the first to mention it. Even more that most of these people appear to come from countries that probably are the biggest violators of international laws, by historical track record.<p>I&#x27;m not even going to argue with you, for you rather obviously take personal convictions over actual knowledge.

One thing I&#x27;m pretty sure of: you&#x27;re not going to like. Don&#x27;t say that nobody tried to warn you, when it turns out that the joke was always on you.')
