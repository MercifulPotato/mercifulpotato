People interested in getting stronger will benefit more from an exercise plan. They still have to exercise, but at least they&#x27;ll know what to do.<p>If your interest is developing your empathy and other social skills, the answer is through practice, as with any other performance-based skills. You can develop empathy with practice, just like charisma, patience, listening, and so on.<p>I teach and coach leadership, having had to learn it from scratch after a PhD (physics) and MBA, only taught me theory, not practice, and starting several companies showed me the value of leadership skills, not <i>how to lead</i>. I wrote a book version of the course that gives the exercises to learn the social skills relevant for leading oneself and others. The preface is on my page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshuaspodek.com&#x2F;leadership-step-by-step" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshuaspodek.com&#x2F;leadership-step-by-step</a>, which develops this concept more. As usual posting about my books here, if anyone is interested in reading it or doing its exercises but money gets in the way, contact me and we&#x27;ll work something out.')
