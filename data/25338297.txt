Uber has a strong brand and loyal customers, and they could make out like bandits even if they have to buy the tech from someone else.<p>Their real problem is if some other company perfects self-driving cars and <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> sell them. Perhaps Uber have decided that&#x27;s unlikely, either because no one will or because a company that isn&#x27;t looking at ride-sharing will.')
