Reading any 1-4 Go lines is easy. Trying to mentally decode a function of 70 lines almost never is. It is verbose as hell. And then you are like &quot;a-ha! this goes through those two collections, filters one of them, maps the other and then combines the results through that algorithm&quot;. But you lost 20 minutes until you got to that conclusion.<p>Compare this with OCaml or Elixir for example where such a function would literally be 10-15 lines.<p>(It&#x27;s not an unique disadvantage to Go, mind you, but we&#x27;re discussing it currently. Other languages have the same problem, e.g. C# and Java.)')
