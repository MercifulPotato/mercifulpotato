There is always risk of some type. Trading at the professional level in virtually all underlying markets has become &#x27;one way&#x27;. There are few, if any, market makers left. Everyone is now a prop trader, aka punter, though some will try to deny it saying they have &#x27;models&#x27; or &#x27;systems&#x27; and not just instinct.<p>Of course, many gamblers also have models and systems and it is not uncommon for professional traders to also be big casino&#x2F;sports gamblers.<p>Less talked about is the ever shorter time horizon of what even still pass as investments.  The shorter the holding period, the more likely the nature of the trade was more akin to a gamble than an investment.<p>To your other point, brokers don&#x27;t &quot;sell&quot; options or other risky products to anyone anymore. The idea of someone calling you up on the phone and suggesting you buy 100 lots of OTM calls on TSLA is quaint at best.  What brokers do do is make available products through their trading platforms that private &#x27;investors&#x27; may trade after signing off on the appropriate paperwork (for instance, an options or futures agreement). Brokers are not going to check too hard to see if you lied about your knowledge of the prodcuts (and hence the &#x27;suitability&#x27;) as it is you, not them, who are going to make the trade&#x2F;investment.<p>As to the financial aspect, brokers today have raced to the bottom with zero commisions on most products in exchange for selling order flow to other market participants. While it is certainly possible that in some cases the revenue from selling options trades is higher than equities, on the whole it is probably on a par. Robinhood averages $0.00026 per $1 of trade value for equities from Citadel.  They average $0.50 per contract on the option side.  So 1000 shares of a $50 stock gives $13 vs say 10 contracts giving $5. While 100 contracts might be more revenue, a 100 lot trade is probably  a very cheap option with narrow(er) spread and not likely to get Robinhood $0.50&#x2F;contract.')
