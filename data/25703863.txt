The Feds have their own communication apparatus and instead foisted onto Twitter the responsibility of being the primary communication channel of the president. He has other options but he fully embraced Twitter and despite profiting from it, it&#x27;s also not entirely fair to them.<p>Same with the Russian disinformation. There is a ton of state sponsored fake Twitter bots that the Twitter staff is fighting constantly. Why is that on them? Shouldn&#x27;t the Federal government be fighting that as part of protecting the country?')
