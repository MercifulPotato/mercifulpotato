I&#x27;d be very interested in reading some of this material if you could link to some.<p>If you take a shitty driver and compare it to an AI, I doubt the AI will perform worse when it comes to preventing accidents.<p>Sure, a skilled human driver will likely perform better than this early stage AI, but if even 1% of the bad drivers out there switch to an AI, that&#x27;s a net positive in my view. Not to mention all the other risky situations involving alcohol, sleep deprivation, etc. where an automated response can save lives.<p>You didn&#x27;t address my main point though. Why is a driverless accident worse than a drunk driver?')
