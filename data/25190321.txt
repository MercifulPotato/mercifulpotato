We have known for many years that common herbicides, for example paraquat and maneb, can cause Parkinson&#x27;s.  Sometimes surprisingly quickly.  In the 1980s we still used cyperquat which is even more closely related to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MPTP" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MPTP</a> which can (when injected) create almost instant Parkinson&#x27;s.  And not only did we use those herbicides, law enforcement specifically used them to target marijuana.<p>So it is quite reasonable that smoking marijuana that had been sprayed with an herbicide could have caused him early onset Parkinson&#x27;s.<p>If the bad batch was smoked on set at Leo &amp; Me, you&#x27;ve got the whole cluster explained.  Or maybe they were unlucky and filmed directly downwind of someone spraying too much herbicide.<p>There are a lot of possible ways that it could have happened.')
