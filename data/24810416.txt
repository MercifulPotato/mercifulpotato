But then I really thought about what you wrote and I think you’re saying that is besides the point, if you have good work life balance and really value that then it’s essentially maybe ok to give up some competitive edge.\nHere I will caution you, that is a trap which I think the article is trying to get at.  I am one of those people who stayed too long at a job where I was losing my competitive edge because I felt like I had a great work-life balance!  And work was fun!  But one day I realized I’m actually being asked to eat a lot of crap so to speak that I hadn’t really noticed before and once I started to look for the exit it was obvious it was going to be harder than it should be because I had stagnated.\nMoral of my story (and this article), is stay competitive, you don’t have to crush it, but don’t lean back too far either.')
