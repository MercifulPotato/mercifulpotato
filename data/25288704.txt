Truthfully, I haven&#x27;t had to write anything that stores passwords for several years, and until now I hadn&#x27;t heard of Argon2.  That&#x27;s frightening to me and shows how far out of the game I am now.<p>Finding a trusted 3rd party who&#x27;s responsibility is to stay on top of it, is definitely the way to go if you&#x27;re not in the security space.   It&#x27;s scary how many people don&#x27;t understand the basics of hashing and encryption that have written authentication systems. When people ask me if we should do something like this, I normally say, &quot;If you&#x27;re asking me, then you probably already know the answer.&quot;')
