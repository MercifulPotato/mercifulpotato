The reason they failed is that they relied on the masses adopting their idiotic ideologies, but the masses simply saw no reason to do that.<p>Then they found each other, and the rest is history.  Each movement could use a grotesquely distorted and magnified projection of the other to justify its existence and power, the power of the nightmare represented by <i>The Other</i>.<p>Each bit (the idiocy, the similarities, the parallel failures, early practice with projections, the finding each other, the magnified projection etc.) is fleshed out in great detail.')
