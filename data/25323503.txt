Assuming some pseudocode with a more common syntax to prune the parentheses question, Common lisp is doing this:<p><pre><code>    function f(x) { print(x) }\n    let a = f\n    funcall(a)(27)  # prints 27\n</code></pre>\nWhereas Scheme is doing this:<p><pre><code>    function f(x) { print(x) }\n    let a = f\n    a(27)           # also prints 27\n</code></pre>\nThis is the fundamental difference between so-called Lisp-1 and Lisp-2 families, depending on whether functions and variable share the same namespace or if they have to be “lifted” from one to another through funcall.')
