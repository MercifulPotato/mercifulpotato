Others have to pay. [1] Basically, I guess more and more people stopped paying.<p>That may well be true.  But as long as it&#x27;s true for NYS residents, that means kids today can do what I did back in the day. And that&#x27;s a very good thing.<p>I wish the American Museum of Natural History had been that way too (it never was) or I would have gone there more often too.  It&#x27;s not art focused, but it&#x27;s a wonderful experience.')
