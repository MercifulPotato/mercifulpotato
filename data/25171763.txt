When I first joined my team&#x27;s on-call, my tech lead was very clear that if I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do, I should just page her or the subject matter expert on the team without hesitating. For each time this happened, we went over the response in a postmortem and added instructions about how to diagnose and fix to the runbook, so the next person to get paged for a similar reason could follow those instead.')
