(Higgs was the other way around but I am optimistic that we&#x27;ll predict much more in future instead of this convoluted observations rigmarole) and I started wondering if you could approximate extremely high precision decimals to fractions in non decimal bases and from there simplify calculations with far greater resolution.<p>How much more capable would Nyquist - Shannon sampling, if we could clock with the precision of infinite decimal fp digits but handle only a short simple &quot;one third&quot; input or do visor?<p>My silly mind wandered off to imagine particles jumping between different base based universes just as a sequential progression through the precision of their infinitessimal steps through space and time.')
