In free trade, both sides benefit; that&#x27;s why they freely chose to trade with each other. It is a myth that one side can unilaterally benefit at the expense of the other side. So if you actually meant &quot;it&#x27;s unethical if the consumer is coming out of the transaction worse than they came into it&quot;, that can&#x27;t happen under a system of free enterprise. (To the extent that you think it&#x27;s happening, you are making a value judgement that a certain side is irrational or stupid to perceive a trade to be valuable)<p>Now, there are absolutely cases where there is unethical profit, but (under my worldview, at least) those are all cases where the state gives a company a special advantage, or literally gives it money. So, the following is unethical:<p>- bailouts of corporations (&quot;corporate welfare&quot;)<p>- government providing an exclusive monopoly to a given company<p>- government de-facto forcing someone to buy a product due to coercion<p>The following is not unethical:<p>- making a product, offering it freely for whatever price people are willing to pay')
