So I did what I do when challenged on the facts and did more reading. It’s not ambiguous. ADHD is directly related to dopamine (reception&#x2F;production) deficiency.

It’s a small but perfectly reasonable stretch to infer that behavioral coping strategies that produce reward experiences which also relieve symptoms are likely producing similar chemical outcomes.')
