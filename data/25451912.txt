I can read PDFs on my computers fine, the screen is large enough. On my eReader I can&#x27;t both see a whole page <i>and</i> have the text large enough to read, even with my reading glasses. I end up zooming in to bring the text up to readable size and then I&#x27;m only seeing part of the page and have to scroll left&#x2F;right&#x2F;up&#x2F;down to read a page.')
