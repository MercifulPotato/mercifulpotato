It results in an accurate appraisal of what is happening to poor people in this country every day. You can find plenty of news stories, just post-pandemic, about people treated similarly by unemployment benefits systems that were designed to be punitive instead of helping people in need.<p>If those realities are uncomfortable for you and you want to dismiss them, that&#x27;s perfectly fine, but these stories are out there in plain sight, across the US, for you to observe.')
