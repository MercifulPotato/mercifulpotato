Something is good, it makes money, they milk it for all its worth until it becomes awful and gets cancelled. That always left me with a bad memory of it as something I enjoyed turned to shit.<p>I switched over to watching shows from Asia where the format is basically only one season by default, it rarely goes to two, and there is a logical beginning, middle and end that follows a proper story arc. If the show was good when it ended then watching it remains a great memory. I&#x27;ve enjoyed so much stuff over the years and it&#x27;s never let me down like the Western model does.')
