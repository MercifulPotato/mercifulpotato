The laggy slow acceleration of a Prius--while smooth--really bothers me, but I could imagine some seeing it as a plus.  For me, in a Prius I feel unable to trust the vehicle to go where I need if anything requires a responsive reaction.  The Tesla is so responsive, you feel very connected to the vehicle.  If you want to suddenly be in some spot in the road you will be there that moment without thinking.')
