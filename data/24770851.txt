And many of those are being challenged or are in the process of being challenged in the court.<p>Where are you getting that he is more authoritarian?<p>This seems like a bit of paranoia, because if he was an authoritarian, he would invoke the insurrection act, and go into Portland or Seattle. He has not done that. If you are referring to the sending of agents into some cities, I think you may not have read closely enough. Those agents are not going out on the street (for the most part), they are doing paperwork and investigations. If you are talking about that &quot;people snatched off the street&quot;, that happened once and there was a court case about it where only two instances found. You could maybe stretch that to say others happened that nobody knows about, but you need evidence of that before claiming this is happening all over.<p>I&#x27;m not a big fan of Trump, so don&#x27;t make me defend him, but Biden is the one who initially pledged to force mask wearing across the country. I think he&#x27;s backed down from that, but that is an example of an authoritarian dictate that should be scary to anyone. Remember, we are still mostly governed by each state government.')
