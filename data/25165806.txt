Apple Silicon is the fixed quantity in this equation, while the software is what is changing to be ready for Apple Silicon, so the construction feels backward. An alternate construction could be &quot;Is <i>it</i> Apple Silicon-ready,&quot; which I suppose one could stretch the title to read as a shortening of, but it&#x27;s still awkward either way.<p>All that said â€“ this is the best UI I&#x27;ve seen yet for an Apple Silicon compatibility list, confusing title or not.')
