I think it works as a deny-all as soon as anything is defined with exceptions for the named resources.<p>Otherwise an &#x27;allow all&#x27; security policy would look like this:<p><pre><code>  default-src * &#x27;unsafe-inline&#x27; &#x27;unsafe-eval&#x27; data: blob;\n</code></pre>\nI think that would be worse than not having any, because browsers use some &quot;sensible&quot; default policies against XSS in case nothing is defined.')
