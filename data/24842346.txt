(So, eventually you have problems with leap seconds.)<p>UTC is better, because at least it is aware of leap seconds, but performing any calculation spanning a year&#x27;s end involves consulting a database of leap seconds.  Notably these aren&#x27;t determined much in advance, so such calculations involving future dates will also involve leap-second errors.<p>TAI is best (for non-relativistic non-sidereal purposes), as it is not adjusted to account for leap seconds.  You can calculate with it without trouble.<p>(All three of the above are based on the atomic SI second, so despite their differences, their seconds tick synchronously.)')
