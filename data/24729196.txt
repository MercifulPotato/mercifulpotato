This is not a new general purpose video codec, it is basically Deep Fake - taking a still image (key frame) and superimposing detected facial expression&#x2F;movement on this key frame (leaving out some technical details).<p>This is an improvement over (not-anymore-)state-of-the-art h264 since transmission of only a few coordinates mapping your facial expression is significantly less data to transmit then a delta of arbitrary video and periodic keyframes (again generously leaving out important technical details of modern video codecs). Trying to reconstruct a moving car&#x2F;background&#x2F;etc. from these facial expression key points will lead nowhere.')
