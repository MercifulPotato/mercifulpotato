At least some of them would&#x27;ve sold while the price was higher and in the best case for them if the squeeze worked it would&#x27;ve been the short sellers who would&#x27;ve made the losses who are mostly not on RH. This move near-guaranteed it&#x27;s their users who took the bigger losses, including those that might&#x27;ve sold today anyway.')
