There is not a lot of documentation<p>2. They don&#x27;t provide any testing guidelines, the best I&#x27;ve found is hand-wavy test-with-a-browser stuff<p>3. Everything is essentially global<p>4. Functions are disconnected from their parameters, i.e. I can&#x27;t tell which bits of data a function is using without digging through a bunch of code.<p>5. Putting state in your HTML is tricky if you also want to modify the DOM.<p>6. Their naming scheme is cumbersome, e.g. data-controller=&quot;using-a--sub-directory&quot; and data-target=&quot;some--nested--target-has-a.function&quot;, that is, the fact that everything is location-in-your-code-file-structure based.<p>And a lot of other small things.<p>Ironically, using Stimulus convinced me to switch to Vue because I liked their value proposition of &quot;Javascript sprinkles for your HTML&quot;, which Vue lets me do, but more intuitively.')
