But there are many more days that aren&#x27;t sunny and calm, and those days they wouldn&#x27;t bring an inexperienced crew member on board regardless how cheap (or free) they are. Depending on where you are and what you&#x27;re fishing for, it can be exceedingly dangerous and having the right experience can literally be the difference between life and death. They&#x27;d probably happily have you fix nets and cages though. :o)')
