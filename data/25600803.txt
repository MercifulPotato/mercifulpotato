Jira effectively has a local cache of user and group relationships for all users who have access to a given blah.atlassian.net Jira, and caches lookup results in a shared cache too. It&#x27;s complicated by having well over a hundred thousand active Jira sites spread over several hundred stateless servers, which does make effective caching a bit trickier.<p>AFAICT Jira Cloud&#x27;s slow feel currently stems largely from the front-end, amplified by the debacle that is modern front-end engineering. It&#x27;s tricky to get 300+ engineers to ship fixes and enhancements in a multi-million line codebase over 15 years old on a good day. Feature creep in design systems, constant ecosystem churn, and poor build tools all conspire to make it that much harder to prevent performance regressing.<p>But even knowing all that - yeah, I wish that Jira&#x27;s performance was 5x better too :)<p>Disclaimer: am still employed by Atlassian but all views are my own, things may have changed a bit since I haven&#x27;t touched any Jira code in ages, etc.')
