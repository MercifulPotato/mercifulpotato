That is, couldn&#x27;t they ship CPUs that fundamentally are not decoding x86 ops, but some different ISA, and then layer a translation layer on top of it?<p>The Transmeta Crusoe used to do this, and I think the NVidia Denver cores did too?<p>I think fundamentally though this analysis highly depends on single-threaded performance being the bottleneck for most apps. A lot of sophisticated workloads are GPU or TPU driven, and so hand-waving away multi-thread performance, and treating single-thread performance as the end-all for client side performance I think is overemphasizing its importance.<p>Also, the &quot;they don&#x27;t control the stack&quot; argument is wrong. Effectively, Intel&#x2F;AMD + Microsoft acted as a duopoly, and if you toss in NVidia, the structure of DirectX and Windows is largely a cooperative effort between these OEMs. If Intel&#x2F;AMD needed some fundamentally new support for some mechanism to boost Windows performance by 20-30%, Microsoft would work with them to ship it.')
