But what about the risks? What if you need to scale down the operation? What if your hardware team ends up costing more? In particular, the R&amp;D department (cloud providers depreciate hardware over 2-3 years, which matches the progress of technology and the speed at which things become obsolete). $35M per year only pays about 50-100 salaries. What if your setup turns out not as good as expected? You can&#x27;t easily jump ship once you sink in the capex. And I don&#x27;t think that already big (in terms of revenue) startups should be adding much to their risk profile.<p>It could also be that there&#x27;s just no other way to cut anything from their enormous opex (for example fire people or buy less ads). I find this hard to believe but may be true.<p>One very good strategic reason to do this, I think, would be to gain independence from cloud providers, who unfortunately happen to be your major competitors.')
