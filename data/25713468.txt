Whether that&#x27;s political discussion or CP depends on the society.<p>If I had asked this question, it would be to gauge how far along the freedom spectrum this service has been designed to operate. There are distribution systems that are capable of even evading the most capable authorities, but their user experience is absolutely horrible.<p>Any system like this will strike a balance, maybe also designing provisions for removing &quot;material that is <i>really</i> bad&quot;. Either out of an ethical obligation, or in order to not risk being shut down wholesale.<p>A system that was truly free and unlimited, would be the tool of an anarchist. Few people wish the implication of such a technology.')
