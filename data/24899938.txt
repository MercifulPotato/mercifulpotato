He mixed weak faith based analogies in too much for my taste but it doesn&#x27;t overly detract from the science. My criticism is not due to an atheistist tilt; the analogies felt forced and contrived, they were poor prose.<p>Overall his description of, &quot;adaptive dissipation,&quot; is pretty solid. Our complex form (life) has developed to increase entropy. Nice discussion of thermodynamics and the flow of energy. We&#x27;re all flames flickering in the light of the sun.<p>It would have been nice if he had touched on morphogenesis, proposed by Alan Turing, which also suggests reasons for complex biological forms.')
