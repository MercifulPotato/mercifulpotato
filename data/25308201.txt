I love those businesses I mentioned. And the 3 you mentioned too. I 100% agree they have added a lot of value to me and the world. What I was trying to say is that to make billions, you need to 1) create a lot of value and 2) have some broken legal system that you are operating in. Maybe for the latter &quot;exploiting&quot; is the wrong word. But the government needs to have created a situation where you can somehow reap a disproportionate reward. Linus created Linux and Git, which have created unimaginable value, but he didn&#x27;t do #2 which was to use the unjust IP system to make billions of dollars.<p>In other words. Lyft is a product of hard work and innovation multiplied by corruption and bad government in the taxi industry. The value created by Lyft comes from the former, but the value captured by Lyft is just as dependent on the latter as well. Nothing wrong with thatâ€”it&#x27;s still a big net win for society, but maybe we could do a better job at refactoring our laws so we can get the value without the unnatural inequities. After all, I know a lot of these people and while they are almost all smarter than me, none of them is 10x smarter than me (well maybe pg).<p>In response to your 3 examples:<p>* Tesla<p>Carbons were subsidized and solar&#x2F;electric better tech. Automotive industry is highly regulated and innovation was sloooow. Elon and company are the best of the best (a shareholder), but still I&#x27;m not going to pretend that the business opportunity would be so great if the governments around the world hadn&#x27;t been creating corruption after corruption (look at the car dealership stuff with the states as a tiny but egregious example).<p>* Twilio<p>Oh man the telecom infra went from magic to just rotten in the past few decades. I don&#x27;t know enough about government here to comment, but I suspect something bad here.<p>* Stripe<p>The amount of protection the finance and banking industry has (and their symbiotic relationship with the government) made me sick so many times. Finally someone had the stamina and determination to solve that. But Stripe isn&#x27;t hitting $100B if US Government wasn&#x27;t letting the finance industry sit on its ass for 3 decades with protective legislation.')
