Travel to and from the earth&#x27;s surface are your actual major cost. (And to be honest, as we all know, the downward leg is almost free; so just the travel up the gravity well to low earth orbit is your actual bottleneck) .<p>If there was already a town&#x2F;colony on the moon, they&#x27;d attract the entire current space industry, because it&#x27;s simply cheaper to launch things into earth orbit from the moon.<p>Specifically from the moon, you can probably upgrade your launch options and get launch costs low enough to compete with earth-surface to earth-surface shipping, in some cases.<p>People somehow mis-estimate delta-v costs. Take a look at the Saturn-V for an intuition. Pretty much the majority of that towering machine was needed to get people to LEO + first leg to the moon (and most of it was fuel), but only the 2 tiny space-ships at the top were needed to get people back.')
