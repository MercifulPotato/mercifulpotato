Item(by='Kalium', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602777200, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24789496, text='&gt; I have no doubt that it&#x27;s easiest to wait, have somebody else develop the market and then buy them. But it also costs a lot of money. Is not having to figure out how to work with M Pesa worth $200m?<p>I think that would depend a lot on your scenario. If you&#x27;re not currently doing business in Kenya, the ability to accept payment through MPesa is probably worth close to $0. If you&#x27;re operating in Kenya, the ability to accept payment through MPesa is probably quite high.<p>My takeaway from this is that the ability to accept MPesa payments is one part of a system that, as you say, <i>can</i> be incredibly valuable and worth lots of money. It&#x27;s just possible that it&#x27;s only worth anything in a context where accepting MPesa is valuable.<p>Regardless, international expansion is not something to be taken lightly. It&#x27;s perhaps not always as simple as the local market being the same as yours modulo a few minor local quirks.')
