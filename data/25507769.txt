You&#x27;re totally right about the experiment in human nature.<p>Depending on which degree you were working on, there was often just way too much to do with the time given. The &quot;academic wing&quot; wouldn&#x27;t coordinate with the &quot;military wing&quot; and we&#x27;d end up having a slew of inspections alongside midterms. I remember getting caught skipping out on military training on a Saturday (which was just a day of lectures, easy to slip out after attendance) to catch up on homework. At the same time, an officer went through the dorms to ensure nobody was skipping. I was caught in my room and spent the next two weeks having to wear an uncomfortable uniform all day and reporting to do drill every morning.<p>Obviously, choosing to cheat academically is way worse than skipping a Saturday of lectures, but if the system is designed to break you, it shouldn&#x27;t be impossible to recover from.')
