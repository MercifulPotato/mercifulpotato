(although the form factor <i>should</i> be good for books, they generally fail for non-tablet related reasons: most ebooks contain DRM, and so you don&#x27;t own them. This is less of a problem for articles or comics)<p>They&#x27;re bad for everything else:<p>---<p>- Typing anything whatsoever<p>- Clicking links. (my thumb is not large, but is still much bigger than the target text I need to click much of the time)<p>- Being easy to hold: most of them are very smooth and slick, which means you can&#x27;t prop them against anything, and have to constantly be holding them. Typing, while holding them is very uncomfortable, and all around worse than typing on a keyboard.<p>- Having physical buttons.<p>- Having a good and consistent UI. (I dislike having new gestures to learn and use every few versions)<p>- Staying upright while you try to watch video<p>- Not invading your privacy every moment of every day<p>- Receiving security updates after one year of ownership (or, if you own an Apple device, this can be swapped out for &quot;being inexpensive or open&quot;)<p>- Loading the desktop version of sites<p>Generally speaking, they&#x27;re worse at everything compared to a laptop, and are only slightly more portable.')
