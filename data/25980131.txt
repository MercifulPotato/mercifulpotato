I made quite clear where I stand as far as the RSS or the farmer protests are concerned. I will say that yet again, RSS has over its history been a silent approver of acts of violence refusing to distance itself from such acts. The farmer protests had sections, possibly govt sponsored, who indulged in violence. The farmer protest bodies have condemned these harshly and distanced themselves.<p>On the other hand you have not yet pointed out where I have called millions of Hindu a terrorist or where I have been inconsistent. Its you who called me names (that I consider millions of Hindu a terrorist)')
