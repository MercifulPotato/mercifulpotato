So you picked up a book or pamphlet about anti-union tropes and spewed them out here. Let&#x27;s refute these statements 1 by 1:<p>- Voting on stuff monthly? Seems to be a really active union. Must be getting ready to strike and if that&#x27;s the case why wouldn&#x27;t they check to make sure they have broad support for one. Also, no one is literally holding a gun to your head. You can vote, vote no, or not vote.<p>- Don&#x27;t know what union this is but dues I&#x27;ve seen are 1-2%. Whoever is getting paid $5000&#x2F;week I&#x27;d like to join that union, too. Fine, maybe it&#x27;s a really good union that charges 5%. I&#x27;d still want in because someone is taking home $2000&#x2F;week.<p>- The word is seniority and this has nothing to do with unions. It&#x27;s how factories from the very beginning have doled out promotions. Job for life and all that. Since most people don&#x27;t want to be working the shit stirring tank how do you get promoted out the shit stirring tank? A simple metric the factories and offices came up and the union workers agreed to.<p>- Unions don&#x27;t control this. But if someone gets fired for underperforming you know who&#x27;s going to get a labor lawyer? The worker who&#x27;s been paying dues to collectively have a lawyer on retainer. You see if I get fired, I get told I was a poor performer with no evidence. If the worker in the union gets fired there lawyer is going to want to see the evidence. And you&#x27;d be amazed at how poorly most companies document this. See the union doesn&#x27;t keep someone from being fired. But it does make sure the firing is fair.')
