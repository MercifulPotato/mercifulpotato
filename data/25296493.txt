It&#x27;s much more secure to simply demand it as rent.<p>Hotels discount rooms all the time for guests they know have a very low likelihood of causing damage.  The probability of a person with a pet causing damage must be sufficiently high that it makes sense to charge extra.  There&#x27;s plenty of competing landlords and hotel businesses, and if there was economic opportunity in doing it the way you said, it would be done.<p>It&#x27;s not just pets though.  Hotels will charge more for wedding parties, who are far likelier to cause noise complaints, damage etc, than a crew of workers who will be sleeping, going to work, rinse repeat.')
