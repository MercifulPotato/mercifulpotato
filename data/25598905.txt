Like, the OP study happened, and it&#x27;s nothing but &quot;wealthy people are less likely to want wealth redistribution, even if they are tall&quot;.<p>From personal experience, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s far from negligible when you put it down on paper. Only people outside the average size (5-95th percentile usually) have to think about these.<p>I&#x27;d go on to say that everything in life is on average 50% more expensive for me (eg. custom bed is 2-3x more expensive than those available in stores of comparable quality, my custom height kitchen-top as well, or baby changing station... But plenty of things are the same price, thus only a 50% increase). For the same amount of money, &quot;average humans&quot; are getting more out of it. If that should not be accounted for when it comes to &quot;wealth&quot;, I am not sure what should. But I guess without properly accounting for all the things I&#x27;ve &quot;had&quot; to pay extra for just to get basic comfort, people are going to continue to claim costs are negligible.<p>Not saying I&#x27;d change with anyone, and I am probably lucky to have ended up in IT (otherwise, my feet would be dangling off my bed :)). And sure, it&#x27;s way better for males to be taller than average than shorter than average in the society today, but there&#x27;s a whole lot of average in there that simply don&#x27;t have to think about any of the things I do.')
