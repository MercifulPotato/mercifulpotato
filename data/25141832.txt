The internal storage is fine if you&#x27;re buying physical copies of games, and while it&#x27;s true that some cartridges require extra downloads, most don&#x27;t, and in fact I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re present in <i>any</i> first party titles. I expect a lot of Switch owners just pick up copies of Animal Crossing, Zelda, and Mario, and never need an SD card. Personally, I bought my Switch at launch, and it took about a year before I ran out of internal space.<p>I also think the JoyCon grips are fine for TV play (In fact I prefer them over the pro controller) and while I&#x27;d also recommend a screen protector, I don&#x27;t know anyone else who has one IRL. The types of scratches picked up by the Switch are usually only visible in direct light, and a lot of people seem to not care.<p>That first-party Nintendo games don&#x27;t go drop in price like most games has been a truism for a very long time. I&#x27;m not sure how Nintendo does it. I generally respect them for itâ€”whatever the proper cost of games should be, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s healthy for games as a medium that they loose a third of their value in a few months.')
