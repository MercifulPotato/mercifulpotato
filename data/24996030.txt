They are alternative media that do not fit neatly into simple buckets.<p>Quillette is part of the so-called “intellectual dark web” that prints articles too dangerous for places like The New Yorker and The Atlantic but in a similar vein. I would categorize it as a classically liberal magazine in the sense it is free thinking but the mainstream liberal press is too orthodox to print anything that challenges them.<p>Reason is the most mainstream libertarian news organization but is increasingly popular for its free thinking politics and resistance to woke trends. Highly recommend.')
