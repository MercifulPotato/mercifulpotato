As others have mentioned, if you have a chase sapphire reserve card, they give you like $60 in credit this year and next, and free dash pass, so it makes it actually decently economical to use.\n Obviously if you do the math, this is just another VC Ponzi scheme with no real path to profit, but as a consumer who already had that credit card, might as well ride the wave and use some rich LPs subsidies to pay for the delivery of my cheeseburgers I suppose.')
