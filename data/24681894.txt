You hope that it generates enough economic benefit to pay for it&#x27;s construction, maintenance, and eventual replacement. A thought is sometimes that bet fails. You end up with infrastructure that doesn&#x27;t generate enough revenue to pay for it&#x27;s maintenance or eventual replacement.<p>I feel like post war the US made a lot of extravagant speculative bets on infrastructure, particularly related to suburban housing development.')
