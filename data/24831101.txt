Create N new empty lists, numbered from 0 to N-1. Divide [0, 1) in N equal brackets B0 = [0, 1&#x2F;n); B1 = [1&#x2F;n, 2&#x2F;n]... BN-1 = [(n-1)&#x2F;n, 1). For each element, determine the bracket it falls in and append it to the corresponding list. Sort each list.\nBecause of the uniformity hypothesis, for n -&gt; infinity, the probability that each bracket contains O(1) elements goes to 1, therefore the running time is O(N) with probability 1.')
