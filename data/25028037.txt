We&#x27;ve had a decade of mainstream Linux based smartphones and it sucks.  Locked bootloaders, bloatware, proprietary hardware drivers that don&#x27;t get updates... this is what mainstream Linux usage  looks like.<p><i>&quot;Year of the Linux Desktop&quot;</i> makes people daydream about a world in which everybody is a console cowboy using and loving FOSS software.  That&#x27;s what I used to believe in, but Android convinced me that&#x27;s a fantasy.  If Linux ever won the desktop it would be a pyrrhic victory, like Linux &#x27;winning&#x27; smartphones with Android or DVRs with Tivo.  Software for the masses would still be locked down proprietary trash, no matter what kernel was used.')
