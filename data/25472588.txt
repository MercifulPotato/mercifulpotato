One of the reasons I loathe twitter and reddit is the conversations and comments in threads are just plain awful a lot of times. This seems to create the potential to amplify that while reading an article or watching a video in real-time, creating a competing interest of consuming media vs opinions.<p>This is critical feedback, but I don&#x27;t think this solves the problem around propagation of misinformation, bad actors, or opinion vacuums. The reason I dislike the modern web is that conversation and engagement are the key drivers for a site, the content second. This has, in my opinion, created the worst-case scenario in which the value of an opinion of statement is so commodified that the only way to create value from discourse is to have a lot of it, and most of it ends up being toxic and terrible because people seem to only create negative discourse en masse, or at least the current system has been gamified to do just that.')
