Item(by='tailspin2019', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610892178, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25808413, text='All of these opinions (from this comment thread) perfectly sum up my view of the Touch Bar.<p>It&#x27;s one of the reasons, aside from performance, that I believe that the M1 MacBook Air is <i>currently</i> the best laptop that Apple make.<p>&gt; I am all for removing the TouchBar. The new MacBook Air with TouchID + physical function keys is a perfect combination of features. There are a few things about the TouchBar I do like -- eg, having a custom one-touch screen lock button that&#x27;s always present. However vast majority of the time I use external keyboard+trackpad+monitor, so the touchbar can&#x27;t be part of my usual workflow anyway. (BluSyn)<p>&gt; while I believed in the initial promise of the touchbar (especially for specialty apps like DAWs, NLEs, etc), I welcome its removal now, and I think most do. (coldtea)<p>&gt; I also can&#x27;t wait for the removal of the Touchbar. This prevented me from buying previous Macbooks because it was just one compromise too far for such an expensive machine. (pharmakom)<p>&gt; I like the touch bar but unless they find a way to make it feasible on a Bluetooth magic keyboard, Iâ€™d rather have no touch bar for consistency. If they are going to kill it they should have killed it with the first M1 MacBooks. (johnwalkr)<p>&gt; The problem with the TouchBar is that it disrupt the flow of attention towards the keys. The cool thing about having just ONE screen is that you can forget about looking your fingers because the content is fixed (not dynamic) and therefore can be internalized. The TB doesn&#x27;t solve any problem (ofou)<p>&gt; the Touchbar should have been a new UI paradigm at the bottom of a touchscreen. I&#x27;d also dig a Touchbar accessory for my keyboard tray. Just saying. But for the love of god, keep it off my F-key row. (acjohnson55)<p>&gt; No Touchbar. I love the idea, but it should be in addition to the Fn keys, on top of it, or in some other way. (maz1b)<p>&gt; If they so wish their touchbars, why not to put them _above_ function keys ?! Make option to turn them off completely if required so they would not disturb at night or stand on the way. They never heard of people with muscle memory? (lovelyviking)')
