And 90% of those million people are poor. In USA, you have social security to fall back on if you don&#x27;t get a job. In India, if you don&#x27;t get that job, you&#x27;re on your own until the next attempt. Being poor in USA and being poor in India are very different.<p>I am in no way encouraging hacky ways for resume grooming. I am just stating <i>why</i> it is a phenomena in India. You&#x27;re doing a good job by not employing these tactics to further yourself. Also, a key difference <i>could</i> be that you&#x27;re maybe not from India. And if you are, you&#x27;re an exception not the norm.')
