You reach into a random one and draw a marble. It is red. If you picked the marble randomly, you now know you&#x27;re more likely to be holding the bag that contained two red marbles than the mixed bag. The red marble you randomly drew provides bayesian evidence for which bag you&#x27;re holding.<p><pre><code>      Marble   1   2\n  Bag\n  2R           R   R\n  BR           B   R\n</code></pre>\nOut of the three possible equally likely worlds (given that you know you didn&#x27;t roll into BR-1), two of them have you holding bag 2R, aka a 2&#x2F;3rds chance.<p>If, on the other hand, you use a red-marble-picking robot, you get:<p><pre><code>      Marble   1   2\n  Bag\n  2R           R   R\n  BR           R   R\n</code></pre>\nNow you have four possible worlds and are equally likely to be holding either bag, ie 1&#x2F;2.<p>So, if our friend Monty opens a random door and you only look at simulations where it reveals a goat... There is a 1&#x2F;3rd chance you initially get the car, but if you do he&#x27;s guaranteed to reveal a goat. So 1&#x2F;3rd of games, you have a car. There&#x27;s a 2&#x2F;3rd chance you initially get a goat, but then he has only a 50&#x2F;50 chance of revealing the goat. So half of the 2&#x2F;3rds of games, the game is discard as invalid, and the other half of 2&#x2F;3rds (aka 1&#x2F;3) you have a goat. As such, the potential outcomes are split 1:1:1 between car:goat:invalid. Removing the invalid cases, it&#x27;s 1:1 car:goat, despite the only 1&#x2F;3rd chance of you choosing the car initially.<p>tl;dr: If he&#x27;s randomly opening doors and you discard any where it&#x27;s the car, those cases are entirely ones where you didn&#x27;t initially choose the car, which introduces some bias. If he&#x27;s opening doors deliberately, no cases are thrown out since it&#x27;s always possible to reveal a goat, maintaining the original 1:2 probability ratio.<p>EDIT: formatting.')
