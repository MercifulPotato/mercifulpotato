The sole reason we might assume is that dexwiz mentions that they &quot;Moved from the Midwest to the Bay Area&quot; with no more detail than that.<p>How much of the midwest, where, for how long; what did they witness firsthand? what did they hear?<p>It&#x27;s a stretch to assume so much without projecting your own assumptions about the midwest.<p>&gt; Have you considered that their experiences may actually be true?<p>We don&#x27;t have experiences, we have conclusions. and without knowledge of the experiences that inform them, it&#x27;s hard to judge their truth. There&#x27;s also the issue of what &quot;the midwest is unfriendly to non-white people&quot; means; taken to either absolute is crazy: &quot;any racism in the midwest means the midwest is racist&quot;, &quot;any tolerance in the midwest means the midwest isn&#x27;t racist&quot;. Clearly, the statement needs qualification to be useful, it&#x27;s not a matter of &quot;true or false&quot; without clear thresholds.')
