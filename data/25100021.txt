I struggled with that thing for years. Programming it required reading a hefty manual. The user interface was near the worst I&#x27;d ever seen (the worst is on my automated cat feeder). I was constantly repairing the lines, the heads, the valves, the control box. I&#x27;d winterize it, de-winterize it. The coyotes would chew on it.<p>Finally I simply turned it off and let whatever would grow without constant watering grow, and the rest died. Makes me a much happier man.')
