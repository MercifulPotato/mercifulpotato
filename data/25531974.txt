How large do you think the benefit is you get from using this specific example over another?<p>What is bad about a company culture where going for maximum emotional impact over a weighted approach causes an uproar? (I&#x27;d be much more wary about one where it doesn&#x27;t, because it tells me employees expect the company to yank their chain, and expect bad treatment from other teams, and know complaining about it won&#x27;t help. <i>that&#x27;s</i> a broken environment.)')
