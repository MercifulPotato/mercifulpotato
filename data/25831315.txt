The discussions that follow a program, between people who watched or listened to it (which could be a significant chunk of your friends or coworkers) is to me at least as important as the content itself.<p>With podcasts and streaming I often find the discussion starts and ends with &quot;yes I listened to an interesting podcast about that...&quot;. Perhaps that will make someone else listen to it the next day, but the window of opportunity for discussion is gone.')
