As I said in the next phrase in the same sentence from the one you quoted.<p>&gt; If what you say is true, gov&#x27;t emplpyees would quit en masse<p>No, if what I said was true, government would (as I said, again, in the same sentence you pulled the quote from) disproportionately end up employing those with noncompensation reasons to choose the particular work, and those of below average competence. Which it does. Government employees would only quit <i>en masse</i> if the below-market pay was a sudden transition from at-market pay.')
