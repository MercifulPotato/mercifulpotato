All the laws that say otherwise are wrong and they have no rational basis.<p>Only the act of transferring copies to a third party can rationally be incriminated.<p>It is absurd to define copyright infringement as making copies and to consider this as a crime.<p>Making copies of any information that you own is a fundamental right, not a crime. If you cannot make copies, then you certainly do not own it. The support of any information will sooner or later self-destruct, so, if the information had not already been copied, you will lose your property.<p>Some people are happy to just rent information for a limited time, but I find that unacceptable. I am not even interested in viewing a rented movie, instead of buying it. I do not want to forget anything, unless I decide to do that, so if the owner does not want to sell it, i.e. in a form that can be copied, then I do not pay money for it in another form.<p>If the information owner claims that he is selling it, not renting it, but the product is copy-protected, that should be considered as fraud. If the law says otherwise, the law is wrong.')
