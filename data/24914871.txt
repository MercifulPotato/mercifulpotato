Wave mechanics are strange. Several effects can produce surprisingly high energies at a distance: constructive interference (nodes) and cavity resonance. Phased arrays are modern ways to produce these effects. These are all phenomena being used for wireless power transfer with EM, I don&#x27;t see why you would doubt on first principles that the same thing with sound (the skull being a resonant cavity). I mean, I would tend to prefer a biological&#x2F;chemical explanation myself, but to say &quot;physical implausible&quot; is wrong, IMHO.<p>And this wouldn&#x27;t be the first time the Russians designed something like this. There is that famous passively powered bugging of the American embassy in Moscow story, where they anticipated RFID technology, in the 60&#x27;s.')
