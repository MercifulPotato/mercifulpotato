I forget most of the details, but his POC used staccato clicks to evade notice rather than supersonic frequencies (a prior unsuccessful attempt IIRC tried modulating the vsync on CRTs in lieu of speakers, which gave me a headache and prompted me to track it down since I could hear it even though no-one else could).')
