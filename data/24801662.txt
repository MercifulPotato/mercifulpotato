For me it has become my central location to manage all my &quot;smart&quot; home devices, and is essentially the glue that holds it all together while providing a pleasant UX for managing it all.\nWith the integration of Node-red, it provides nodes that represent your Home Assistant based sensors&#x2F;switches so you can easily read&#x2F;write their values within your Node-red flow.')
