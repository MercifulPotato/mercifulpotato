Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609957567, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25657664, text='<i>&gt; the basic &quot;no-true-scotsman&quot; argument used to advocate for free markets, also known as the Efficient Markets Hypothesis</i><p>No, that&#x27;s not the basis for wanting more free markets. The basis for wanting more free markets is that, under conditions where a free market is not efficient (and yes, such conditions often exist), the failure modes of a free market are still better than the failure modes of the alternatives. In other words, free markets are not &quot;best&quot; so much as &quot;least worst&quot; (the worst except for all the others, as Churchill would have said).<p>In the particular case we were discussing, you were assuming that a transaction was possible (a personal connection) that both parties would value. That means, in a free market, both parties would agree to the transaction, so it would happen. The problem, as you stated it, was that a market did not even exist for such transactions--the parties weren&#x27;t even aware of each other. And, as I pointed out, the obvious way to fix that is to allow someone to <i>create</i> such a market. Nobody needs to make any decisions about &quot;how social goods are priced&quot; to do that--the market participants themselves will take care of that, by deciding which transactions to engage in and which not. See further comments below.<p><i>&gt; The market is producing disastrous outcomes making life unlivable for huge swaths of humanity?</i><p>No, it&#x27;s not. What&#x27;s producing those disastrous outcomes is the failure modes of the <i>alternatives</i> to a free market. See below.<p><i>&gt; The reality is that not all social goods and goals can be priced, or measured, or even understood and articulated in a way we all agree on.</i><p>Yes. And in a free market, <i>we don&#x27;t have to agree on all those things</i>. All we have to agree on is whether or not to engage in particular transactions. If you and I can have a transaction that both of us voluntarily agree on (and that&#x27;s the definition of a free market, that all transactions are voluntary--nobody is ever forced to make a transaction they don&#x27;t want to make), then it doesn&#x27;t matter what the rest of our values or goals are; all that matters is that we agree to make the transaction.<p>And that is <i>why</i> the failure modes of free markets are better than the failure modes of the alternatives--because the alternatives <i>force</i> people to do things that they don&#x27;t want to do, or that they even think are very bad ideas, just because someone else in a position of power says so. <i>That</i> is what makes &quot;life unlivable for huge swaths of humanity&quot;--people being <i>forced</i> to do what some idiot in power says, instead of what their own intelligence and common sense would suggest.<p><i>&gt; it&#x27;s literally impossible to base your normative system on the idea that we&#x27;ll all just optimize for outcomes when that system is non-deterministic</i><p>You&#x27;re assuming that there has to <i>be</i> a single &quot;normative system&quot; that everyone is forced to abide by. And that, as above, is precisely what a free market does <i>not</i> do, and why our current system, which <i>does</i> do that, causes so much misery. Your so-called &quot;public policy discussion&quot; is all about <i>what normative system to impose on people</i>. Your public policy &quot;experts&quot; never even consider the idea of <i>not imposing things on people at all</i>.')
