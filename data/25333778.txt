If some people have ruined the word and given it extremely negative connotations in the minds of many of my colleagues, why would I insist on using it. For a comically extreme extension of this principle: the swastika used to be a pretty positive symbol, but it was ruined as such. It is not the first time that we as a community have decided that a common symbol&#x2F;word is &quot;ruined&quot; and I do not particularly care where we place the line on what is considered &quot;ruined&quot;.')
