Let me explain why.<p>You&#x27;ve adopted a LTS release which was made public  2 years ago, was already a couple of years in the making, and is aimed at establishing a solid and reliable base system that can be targetted by the whole world with confidence.<p>And knowing that, your idea is to bolt on custom tooling that&#x27;s not installed anywhere or by no one by default and make it your own infrastructure?<p>Unless you&#x27;re planning on managing that part of the infrastructure for your customers to use, your race to catch up with the latest and greatest makes zero sense, and creates more problems than those you believe you&#x27;re solving.<p>And no, it&#x27;s not an infrastructure problem. It&#x27;s a software engineering problem that&#x27;s yours in the making. If you seek stability and reliability then you target stable and reliable platforms, such as the stuff distributed by default by LTS releases such as Ubuntu 18.04. because that&#x27;s what they are used for.')
