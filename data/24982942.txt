[1]. Does that ring a bell, or are you daft enough that you would need data to be convinced that doing so is a sign of wanting attention, and wanting the story to get sensationalized?<p>And why would you do a public forum AMA and then go through the effort to post over a hundred answers to begin with, if you didn&#x27;t want the story to blow up?<p>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re associated with any research or academic body or not, but here&#x27;s a news flash for you: stories don&#x27;t get big on their own, not in today&#x27;s short-attention-span world. The researchers take the just-published work to their organization&#x27;s news outlet and ask them to cover it. The unspoken, and often spoken, reasoning being &quot;this is significant&quot;. If a researcher wants to practice caution, it is super easy these days to do so, just don&#x27;t make a mountain out of a mole hill.<p>Also you and the other downvote sheep, go eff yourself and do your own research about what really happened a month ago (I was there and was telling everyone that these researchers are bullshitters taking everyone for a ride).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;askscience&#x2F;comments&#x2F;itt9b7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;askscience&#x2F;comments&#x2F;itt9b7</a><p>[1]\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;askscience&#x2F;comments&#x2F;itt9b7&#x2F;askscience_ama_series_we_have_hints_of_life_on&#x2F;g5hn5fm&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;askscience&#x2F;comments&#x2F;itt9b7&#x2F;askscien...</a>')
