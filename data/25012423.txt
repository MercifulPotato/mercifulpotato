I don’t like that this plan seems to lock out proof of identity services for people with disability by design.<p>I know this is a real problem because I can hardly see. I don’t have a license. It causes continuous problems in real life.<p>I live in Oz. You are supposed to be able to use a “Photo Card” to prove identity the same as a drivers license. It takes the same amount of proof to get a “Photo Card” from the government as a drivers license. They look the same as a drivers license, even the same holograms, but a different colour.<p>But I have continuous trouble dealing with banks, insurers, government (crazy!), post office, telephone companies, internet companies. I bought a passport mostly because it easier to carry that around.<p>If we get an app that only accepts drivers license and not the official photo card equivalent it means we’ll get told by contact centres to drive (!) to our nearest branch of whatever and bring a folder full of ID and hope the drone will accept it.')
