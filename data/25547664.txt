There is a lot of amazing tooling, a staggering amount of ongoing innovation, all built on solid concepts: declarative models, emitted metrics (the &#x2F;proc equivalent, but with larger scope) and versioned infrastructure as data (a.k.a. GitOps).<p>For someone that is known as the King of Bash (self-proclaimed) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;speakerdeck.com&#x2F;gerhardlazu&#x2F;how-to-write-good-bash-code-using-tdd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;speakerdeck.com&#x2F;gerhardlazu&#x2F;how-to-write-good-bash-c...</a> - and after a decade of Puppet, Chef, Ansible and oh wow that sweet bash <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gerhard&#x2F;deliver" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gerhard&#x2F;deliver</a> - even if all my workstations and work servers (yup, all running k3s) are provisioned with Make (bash++), I still think that K8S is the better approach to running production infrastructure. The advantage to using simple and well-defined components (e.g. external-dns, ingress-nginx, prometheus-operator etc.) that adhere to a universal API, and are maintained by many smart people all around the world, is a better proposition than scripting in my opinion.<p>At the end of the day, I&#x27;m in it for the shared mindset, great conversations and a genuine desire to do better, which I have not seen before K8S &amp; the wider CNCF. I will go on a limb here and assume that I love scripting just as much as you do, but go beyond this aspect and you will discover that it&#x27;s more to it than &quot;thin install scripts that deploy containers&quot; (which are not just glorified jails or unikernels).')
