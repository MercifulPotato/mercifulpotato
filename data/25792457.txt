But my wife is. And she ranted for a while after the first ten minutes of this talk for precisely this reason. I could have provided more scholarly sources. It is an internet forum - I didn&#x27;t think people would call me names if I didn&#x27;t. That historians of science don&#x27;t like the term &quot;The Dark Ages&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly cutting edge scholarship.')
