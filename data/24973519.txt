This is in part because once you run out of logic to lay down in a chip you flood fill the rest with RAM and&#x2F;or FLASH because hey the chip has to be big enough to hold pad landings for all of its pins. This has taken a lot of pressure off the code density thing and now it seems appropriate to look at algorithmic capacity.<p>I don’t agree. I’m working on a chip right now where NVM and RAM is extremely constrained. There will probably be many millions made, so it’s still relevant.<p>On the last chip I worked on, it was perhaps true to some degree. But that chip, even though it was a microcontroller, had a decent cache. Access to NVM is slow. And code density can have a significant impact on cache performance.')
