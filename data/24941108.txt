Some memories are more like pictures, usually accompanied with emotions. Other memories are more like movies, where I visualize the events unfold.<p>I seldom remember what I dream, but when I do it&#x27;s usually right before I wake up in the morning, and it feels like being in a movie. I often get aware that I&#x27;m dreaming and can control the movie (dream) to some extent. I can then get really annoyed when the alarm clock goes off before the exciting part is over.')
