Your windmill is not starved of space to make a big dynamo that uses a lot of copper and is very, very efficient. If the superconducting material is cheap you might be able to do it without using nearly as much material or even without magnets. So it might be cheaper and smaller!<p>The opposite application (generating torque) is already a home for superconductors. The navy has some superconducting motors in its ships. They&#x27;re way smaller and have high efficiency over a much wider dynamic range of operating torque. Those are cryo-cooled though.')
