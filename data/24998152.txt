Coming from Java it made sense but Python is a different mindset once you get into it. I think you’re far better off treating Python as a highly structured scripting language and using an advanced text editor. I’ve come to believe that these very powerful IDEs are a kind of a window dressing that makes the more serious languages easier to work with. With more flexible languages the language itself is the tooling but it’s not so easy to audit at the end of the day.')
