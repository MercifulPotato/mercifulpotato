There might be security updates. However, if once in a while an update itself causes a bigger problem (e.g. is unusable), it&#x27;s logical you shoudl be able to downgrade. A defensive attitude (&quot;I better not upgrade as it can break something&quot;) is definitely an option and many people are doing that, but it&#x27;s not the right way to approach the whole issue.')
