Namely, extrapolating that unobserved reactions to a story no one has read are a &#x27;mob&#x27;, and the &#x27;mob&#x27; is  &#x27;outraged&#x27; instead of being concerned about &#x27;the truth&#x27;, and it&#x27;d be better for Coinbase to ignore it.<p>It&#x27;s also striking that this reaction could be addressed at itself.<p>Stealing this from other posts above, apologies friends: under those assumptions, the disagreement you have with Coinbase&#x27;s choice to address it is sufficient to negate your conclusion - if there is no mob, and no story, and the corporation is trying to get in advance of it, it&#x27;s likely the story is damaging enough that they need to, it&#x27;s not pleading with a &#x27;mob&#x27;.')
