Adafruit is, to me, a great provider of breakout boards and gives generously to the community while trying to stay in business. They might be slightly <i>more</i> profitable if they closed off everything they could. I’ve used their libraries on a lot of projects without using their hardware.<p>Their stuff works, is open, and when I used one of their LSM6DS dev boards on a 32-bit micro, it had an underflow bug; because that board and library was open-source, I could fix it the same afternoon I got the package. The fix was simple and obvious, they accepted my pull request, and now no one else has to waste that hour. <i>That’s</i> the power of open source to me.<p>I hold Adafruit and Limor in a positive light and think their “bloatware” is very effective in making electronics accessible to many more people than before, much the same as the $30 Arduino did for the $2 AVR. The ecosystem and accessibility <i>matter</i>.<p>I agree that they’re seeking success of Adafruit, and agree that’s not a bad thing, but I don’t see how they’re going closed. What is “closed” about their ecosystem? The article we’re discussing is about MIT-licensed software on their GitHub.')
