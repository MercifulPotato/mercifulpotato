Those machines are just standing around in their underwear now because the M1 stole all their pants.<p>I think it&#x27;s a bit unfair to lump Linux in there since it&#x27;s been running on ARM and other embedded, low-power devices basically forever, but it is true that few of us run our Linux desktop on an ARM board.<p>But I think the overarching point is true: now desktop and laptop makers can&#x27;t just pretend that having a hot and&#x2F;or slow, clunky, noisy x86-based architecture is just a fact of life.
