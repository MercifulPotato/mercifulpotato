And, the shielding isn&#x27;t perfect -- there are holes for fans, some cases are made out of glass instead of metal, etc.<p>There are regulations, but they don&#x27;t mandate perfect attenuation.  They only specify that your emissions shouldn&#x27;t interfere with licensed users.  Since the licensed users are pretty far away from your computer and the power is very low, it&#x27;s generally not a problem.<p>(As for sensitivity, remember that GPS signals have a power of something like 10^-16 watts at the surface of the earth, and you can receive those just fine.  Radios are very sensitive instruments!)')
