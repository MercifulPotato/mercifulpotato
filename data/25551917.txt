This scarcity manifests in people having not enough. And I’m not taking about your Enough, I’m talking about people having to think about how much mortgage they can afford, whether to buy groceries at Whole Foods, Safeway or Walmart, or whether they can make payment on their car. All of this happens because we don’t have unlimited abundance of everything, and we need to determine how products and services that are produced get distributed.<p>For this purpose, we use money , and the way it works is people can make money by various activities that almost always provide products and services that other people value, and they give you money in exchange. This can be entrepreneurship, but for most people it’s a job one does for wages.<p>Some jobs pay little, some pay a lot, and it seems that your idea is that there are not enough high paying jobs around, and so you want to increase availability of these jobs by having people working these jobs give them up early.<p>This is a well meaning, but terrible idea. The problem here is that its result is <i>less things get produced</i>, so in aggregate, we’re even less wealthy than before your plan. Your plan is strictly negative for the society. It might benefit some people who get to have a better job than they otherwise would, but the society is paying immense cost for this job.<p>A better alternative than destroys less (though still significant amount) value is to just tax the high earners and use the proceeds to subsidize low earners. This way, you can have low earners earn as much as they would have after switching to higher paying job in your “retire early when you have Enough”, but you’d have both high and low earner continue working, so more total value would be produced.')
