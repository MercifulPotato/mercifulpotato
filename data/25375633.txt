We weren’t software engineers and not super interested in how Linux worked, just what we could do with it.  Debian was a chore to install, in the way of getting things done.  Red Hat, on the other hand, was easy to install.  Red Hat was <i>the</i> distro of choice for experimenting with Linux.<p>The other side of it, the business side, is that RHEL met the need of, “see boss, this is fully supported, just like UNIX.”  That had to be a thing before these types of businesses would transition from UNIX to Linux.  Only after that transition would front-line engineers be brave enough to sneak a RHEL clone like Centos into the mix.  Sadly, Debian just didn’t stand a chance in this situation.<p>Fast forward to today and now you see front-line engineers hacking Ubuntu LTS distros to look enough like RHEL for the commercial tools to run on it.  You still have to keep a RHEL box around to reproduce issues before going to support with issues in the commercial tools, but that’s much cheaper than a whole fleet of RHEL boxes.')
