This is not true. Yes, some could take that sort of interpretation of what he&#x27;s saying, and that sort of interpretation being taken by lots of white supremacists regardless of intention, does mean something. But it doesn&#x27;t mean much, at least, I don&#x27;t see why we&#x27;d expect that to be any significant effect. Just to bring an example, at least, ime the most common &quot;but he said..&quot; claim. The &quot;fine people on both sides&quot; quote. Many misunderstand what he was actually saying there and actually what happened - the event started with a wide range of people on the right, a general conservative gathering seeming thing. It <i>was</i> organized by white supremacists, which lots attending did not realize until some time passed and they started getting uncomfortable and leaving, by the time people were chanting slurs and all, it went full on neo-nazi rally. Trump clearly did denounce that, and what happened that night, and was speaking to the normal people who had attended in the beginning and left later.')
