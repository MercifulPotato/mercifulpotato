A little more nuance is useful here as well.<p>I&#x27;ve seen positive outcomes from the criminal justice system. I have literally never seen a CoC lead to a better dispute-handling process than the absence of a CoC.<p>&gt; Every community has its set of guidelines, either explicit of implicit, intended to foster the community&#x27;s purpose. If I go to my neighbor&#x27;s party and behave like a jerk, and insult the other guests, there&#x27;s a very good chance that I won&#x27;t be invited back.<p>Sure - but it will be clear who&#x27;s responsible for that decision. Most likely someone will tell you to your face what you did wrong and give you a chance to defend yourself.<p>&gt; In this case, I have no idea why the committee came down hard on the author. I saw the relevant portions of his talk, and didn&#x27;t hear anything rude or objectionable. I think the committee got it wrong in this instance, but that doesn&#x27;t mean everyone in future should be allowed to be a jerk, and not face any consequences.<p>You don&#x27;t need a CoC to exclude jerks. You need a moderator (not a committee; a clearly accountable individual, who will bear ultimate responsibility even for those parts of the job that they delegate) who will apply good judgement in a visible way. Not only must justice be done; it must also be seen to be done.<p>Based on what I&#x27;ve seen of them in action a CoC is not only useless, it should be a red flag that the organisers have not thought seriously about their dispute resolution process.')
