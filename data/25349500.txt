Not one bit.  I don&#x27;t miss the cord snagging on parts of my desk, or my legs, or the arms of my office chair, or under the casters, etc.<p>Not to mention cord noise on IEMs, which admittedly isn&#x27;t really a problem on over-the-ear headphones anyway.<p>I&#x27;ll probably never buy another pair of corded headphones.')
