Always a free-for-all of such heavy customization on the side of the third-party applications that a Windows look and feel was never really a thing, nor was theming because of the same thing.<p>Then GNOME 3.0 came and they went for the consistently branded experience approach, and you were left with a black and gray desktop environment that at best tolerated customization.<p>And it works alright, but Desktop Linux at most you&#x27;ll get to work alright, the third party app ecosystem is small, without the feeling of ownership and freedom that an end-user can have with their system, customizing not the kernel but the things they&#x27;re actually interacting with, what&#x27;s left? An unremarkable desktop environment with few applications, that you&#x27;ll want to replace with macOS as soon as you have the money.')
