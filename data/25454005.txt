As many people pointed out, these are the same states that tried to overturn election results. There&#x27;s no way this is a coincidence. After all, Google is a powerful anti-conservative force.<p>That said, a large (if not the majority) fraction of liberal folk also strongly dislike Google. So there&#x27;s a good chance for a bi-partisan effort to dislodge Google from its place of power.<p>The real question is how did a heavily liberal institution get so much hatred from the liberal side of the political divide. This especially stands out during these times of extreme polarization, when the principle &quot;an enemy&#x27;s enemy is one&#x27;s friend&quot; is very popular.<p>I suspect the root cause is that Google is torn apart between its liberal beliefs due to its connections to the Silicon Valley, and its conservative tendencies as a for-profit corporation. This conflict causes an enormous amount of internal and external damage.<p>On top of that, Google (and other big tech) became so powerful that it&#x27;s in the cross-hairs of many politicians and activists. This makes it much more difficult to maneuver in the political world.<p>It would be interesting to see whether and how Google executives will attempt to solve these problems.')
