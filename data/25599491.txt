I think if Mozilla dies, either another major sponsor would be needed or we’ll just end up with the web becoming even more Google’s platform.<p>In the absence of an answer to who pays for the development, I don’t see how a new browser will emerge.  Killing Mozilla doesn’t create funding for a new browser.<p>Why I have continued to ask you this question, is because you seem to be convinced that an alternative <i>would</i> arise if Mozilla died.<p>This leads me to think that you must be aware of someone who would be motivated to pay for it.  Perhaps I’m wrong about this, and you just hope someone steps forward to pay for it.')
