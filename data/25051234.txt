Item(by='jez', descendants=None, kids=[25051398, 25053532, 25052614, 25052912, 25052396], score=None, time=1605039247, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25050794, text='Not what you&#x27;re looking for, but I&#x27;ll mention it anyways just in case:<p>It&#x27;s possible to set the default touch bar display to only ever show the expanded control strip (System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboard &gt; Touch Bar shows: Expanded Control Strip). In that mode you tap volume up and down instead of using a volume slider.<p>Again, I know you&#x27;re looking for physical keys (aren&#x27;t we all) but it&#x27;s better than nothing.<p>I&#x27;ve been using the MacBook Pro 16 (with a physical esc key plus a touch bar) and I think it&#x27;s a pretty good compromise between me who wants physical keys and apple who wants to push the touch bar.<p>The other thing that kept happening to me: I would accidentally tap the brightness button when reaching for ESC. For that, you can &quot;Customize Control Strip...&quot; and remove individual buttons, so that there&#x27;s a big gap on the touch bar near the ESC key so that stray taps near ESC don&#x27;t change the brightness.')
