The bumper was not damaged. The driver wore no seatbelts. The inertial reaction, which should have thrown him onto the hood, did not ocur. The stopping distance was only 16 centimetres. Impossible? Yet hundreds of people in, and  the stadium, and millions more on television. The use in all vehicles of the absorber of the energy, &quot;Ecollision&quot;, can radically improve automobile safety.&quot;</i><p>Regardless of the mechanism of energy absorption, if a vehicle is decelerated from 45 kph to 0 within 16 centimeters, there needs to be a way to remove the kinetic energy from the driver inside as well (seatbelts). If not, they will simply continue flying along at 45 kph, through the windshield. If the driver in this case was not wearing seatbelts, it&#x27;s quite likely that the vehicle was not going that quickly.<p><i>``Lagiewka says, &quot;The technical idea behind my buffer can be used in very many practical solutions. Another invention which I showed experimentally, is the brake. Connected to the axis on a Mercedes, the car stopped in one-quarter of the distance usually required&quot;.&#x27;&#x27;</i><p>When braking, the limiting factor is usually not the brake mechanism itself (e.g. the disc brakes), but the interface between tires and the road. That&#x27;s why cars have anti-lock systems.')
