One part stood out a bit though.<p><pre><code>    def myview(request):\n        SomeClass.id = request.GET.get(&quot;id&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nIs this pattern common in Python projects? A coworker and I were discussing solutions to a tricky problem the other day and one solution that involved a step like this was immediately dismissed as likely to cause a huge mess. We&#x27;re far from world class Python developers and would definitely struggle with the other issues outlined in the post, but this one seems pretty clear.')
