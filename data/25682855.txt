For me, this would defeat the purpose of having my dogs my our life.<p>Having worked in robotics quit a bit this is a common trap.  There are plenty of things that we can think of for a robot to do, but most of them would require more concessions, programming and maintenance time than it takes to just do the task, or hire folks to do it.  The areas where the value prop holds up it really works well, but these kind of low value, high complexity applications like walking a dog around the neighborhood without dragging it by it&#x27;s collar if the dogs knee hurts and it walks slow that day.<p>A $75k robot arm with legs is not a completed application.  We can already buy robots with the needed mobility to do things like walk dogs for far less.  This is a classic hammer nail situation.  I think this is the issue that BD keeps running into, they have an amazing team, amazing tech, amazing capabilities, but are still searching for that killer high value application.  There are over 400k industrial robots sold every year, its a huge market.  They sell well because it relatively straightforward to program and integrate them into workcells and factory lines to create value.  To program and integrate one of these robots to do something so complex that it would necessitate a BD robot and not a standard industrial robot would be a huge development effort.  It just doesn&#x27;t hold up when we have folks that need work.  The cost of one 75k robot plus two person years of engineering labor is 4 or 5 years worth of traditional labor.  The value prop just isn&#x27;t there until our ability to control, program and integrate these complex robots (cobot stuff) gets better.')
