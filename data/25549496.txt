No matter how open the HDL of that hardware, it has to be manufactured on a process we can&#x27;t replicate.<p>I really want to see more people focus their energy into building an enthusiast-friendly fab. The idea alone gets so readily dismissed because people focus on how extreme top-end fabs are without considering that there might be alternatives if your priorities&#x2F;requirements were different. But I think it&#x27;ll still happen, some day. Free the base layer! Make open source eternal!')
