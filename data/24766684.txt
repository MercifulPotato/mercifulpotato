Item(by='masklinn', descendants=None, kids=[24767189], score=None, time=1602603960, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24766608, text='&gt; Bit of a weird comment from Chrome. &#x27;XML&#x27; doesn&#x27;t generate &#x27;security bugs&#x27; - sloppy development practices do.<p>That&#x27;sâ€¦ only true in the sense that C doesn&#x27;t generate security bugs either. There are environments, systems and standards which are much more bug-prone than others, for various reasons.<p>And XML <i>is</i> one of them. Not only does it literally specify and embed security issues (so you have to break the standard to fix some of that stuff), it <i>is</i> a pretty complex standard, and because it is a somewhat inefficient format implementors are more likely to need to optimise the pipeline, which is difficult, and leads to more security risks.<p>By all measures, XML is very error prone and its history is littered in security bugs in way few formats even compete. It&#x27;s not the worst (I&#x27;ve heard a lot of bad things about ASN.1, which is made worse by ASN.1 generally having to be parsed in security contexts) but as a shortcut &quot;XML generates security bugs&quot; is completely fair.')
