Item(by='ncallaway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612128832, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25953310, text='&gt; How would you conduct this assessment?<p>The same way the IRS conducts income assessments. Some additional forms that you have to fill out declaring your wealth at tax-time.<p>For the vast majority of people you could add a form on the IRS-1040 that is a single check box.<p>&quot;Check this box if you have less than $100,000,000 in total assets&quot;. If you have more than $100,000,000 in assets, then you have to fill out an additional schedule(s) detailing your assets.<p>If your assets are over $200,000,000 then you&#x27;re taxed on your assets that exceed that amount.<p>&gt; Now that you have figured out the legality of your position<p>I actually am not 100% convinced of the legality of the wealth tax. I think we&#x27;ve figured out the practicalities of it. I think it may be an open question as to whether a wealth tax is presently constitutional.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s obviously unconstitutional, but I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s <i>obviously</i> constitutional.<p>&gt; why is this moral to do?<p>I&#x27;ll play if you will. First, you explain the moral position of allowing people to starve, and to die of the elements when others have more money than they could ever spend in their lifetime.<p>Once you explain the morality of a national with the resources such as ours allowing people to die in the elements, then I&#x27;ll go ahead and take a pass at the morality of the wealth tax.<p>Which is to say: I think it is immoral <i>not</i> to have such a tax.')
