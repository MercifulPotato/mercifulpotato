Let me raise several concerns.<p>If you are a politician, are you comfortable with a few tech CEOs holding the power to destroy your campaign? Especially when the CEOs live in the same region and contribute to similar causes? Wouldn&#x27;t you seek to rein in the power of companies that have the power to destroy you? Or seek to use this power against your political enemies?<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t attempt a coup,&quot; you say. Sure. But the stated reason by the companies is generally that Trump campaign encouraged and promoted violence - are you sure that this rational will be narrowly applied going forward? Especially when there&#x27;s an effort by some to redefine hurtful language as violence?<p>If having active&#x2F;robust moderation is a hard requirement to exist as a viable app, wouldn&#x27;t this prohibit new social media companies from going viral? FB&#x2F;Twitter spends millions and employs an army of contractors to moderate their platforms. Can a new startup that&#x27;s growing exponentially build moderation before they&#x27;re shut down by Apple&#x2F;Google&#x2F;AWS?<p>On a related note, does it concern you that the last two social media apps that seriously challenged FB&#x2F;IG&#x2F;Twitter are Tik Tok and Parler, and the American government forced a sale of the former and private companies collectively decided to boot the latter?<p>Hey, I&#x27;m just being paranoid. I&#x27;m sure these monopolistic companies will use their power perfectly going forward and never make any mistakes. I&#x27;m also sure that government will respect their reasonable use of power and leave them alone.')
