But they&#x27;re forcing Stream as a replacement, hence all the pushback. Let&#x27;s be honest, most people just want to run a gratis released RHEL, not run their betas.<p>My guess is that Stream turned out way less popular than their sponsored hoped (who cares if it&#x27;s developed in the public eye if it&#x27;s entirely RH curated anyway). So CentOS 8.x had to die.')
