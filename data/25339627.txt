The one who seems to know what their doing on all the coding tests. You hire him thinking he’s great. Gets right to work , cranks out a ton of code, is working weekends etc. Then you look at the code and it’s a crap ton of idiomatic garbage, seemingly clever hacks, etc. The rest of the teams productivity goes to shit because no one can understand Glen’s weird code.<p>I worked with a guy who spent weeks writing a CSV parser. Firstly there are a ton of libraries to choose from. Secondly while CSV is simple it can be surprisingly difficult to handle all possible options. When we got a look at his code it was filled with really odd usage of reflections and dynamic code generation. This was supposed to process huge files so performance was supposed to  be a priority.<p>Or the other guy who complained daily about maven then one day he comes in on Monday right before a major deadline with a big shit eating grin on his face and when someone finally asked what he was grinning about he said he spent the weekend replacing maven with ant.<p>I’ll take someone who can’t program their way out of a paper bag over one of these guys any day. At least when they’re in the paper bag they can’t destroy anything.')
