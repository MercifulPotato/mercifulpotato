Is this related to Gab and the rest? From their earlier post about Fediverse:<p>&gt;Some parties in the Fediverse demand “self-censorship.” Especially when we talk about particular services or products, individuals contact us and demand that we delete our posts. “We shouldn’t talk about the topic,” so other people don’t start to use these “evil” services and products. In our opinion, such demands contradict the claim of being an “open-minded community.”')
