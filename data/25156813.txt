He&#x27;s a programmer who, along with web designer Mark Otto, created Bootstrap, free software that the pros use to make their sites look spiffy. If you&#x27;ve ever noticed that a lot of websites have the same big chunky buttons, or the same clean forms, that&#x27;s likely because an estimated one-fifth of all websites on the planet use Bootstrap.<p>I don&#x27;t <i>blame</i> Jacob, but man the WWW would probably be better without Bootstrap. Again, it&#x27;s not Jacob&#x27;s fault, he made a product that was so good everyone wanted to use it... so everyone used it. It feels like the Demolition Man future, where Taco Bell is the only survivor of the Franchise Wars.')
