Want to shove the most cars through per hour?  Remove the speed limit.  Accelerate and brake like every intersection is a drag race.  Leave absolutely no distance between cars.  And dump any notion of polite lane changes.  NASCAR was right:  Minimize unused pavement.  The most efficient way to move large numbers of cars down a road is at 200mph with only inches between each car.')
