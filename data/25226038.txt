The data and operations done on it are a single file. A datum is in a cell, and a formula is in a cell. You can move formulae around like you can move data around. You are viewing and operating on the data&#x2F;logic in the same context. When you open an excel document, what you see right away is the culmination of all analyses done on the data.<p>With julia, the data and logic are separate entities. You have to first import data[1]. The result dataframe is created by explicitly running cells&#x2F;scripts on the import. When I view the dataframe, I cannot just point-click-edit it. Any edit I make is a separate line of code to run. Then the whole script is run again over the whole dataframe to get the new result. This is opposed to excel which creates dependencies on a cell-level and live-updates the spreadsheet with each edit, but without processing the whole spreadsheet.<p>Since logic is its own entity (script) in julia, it is easier to write long and more complex processes: things you cannot easily do in a single-line formula parallelized over cells in excel. Also, since the processing and editing are explicitly spelled out in a script, it is easier to keep track of changes and reason about logic. So they both have their advantages.<p>[1]: You can even do that in excel. Import csvs, databases etc.')
