Item(by='alexpetralia', descendants=None, kids=[25966361, 25963216, 25964035], score=None, time=1611956600, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25962752, text='(2) is false.<p>You can&#x27;t offer &quot;inferior prices&quot; to customers. It&#x27;s called the Order Protection Rule of RegNMS. You must price improve the customer, by law. If a bid-offer is 23.01&#x2F;23.02, Robinhood (but actually Citadel&#x2F;Two Sigma) _must_ transact with a buy order at 23.0199 or less (the subpenny rule only applies to quotes, not actual trades). The reason Robinhood sells this order flow is because Citadel&#x2F;Two Sigma would rather collect a spread of almost 1 cent (23.0199-23.01) from \n_you_ rather than a hedge fund, who may conceivably move the market against the market maker. They are &quot;paying for order flow&quot; (PFOF) - much less than 1 cent - to collect the 1 cent spread from you.<p>Robinhood is in trouble with the SEC for a failure to disclose this relationship to customers, _not_ for having the economic arrangement to begin with.')
