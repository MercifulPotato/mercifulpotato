Seems impressively good at preventing machines from booting, polluting the filesystem namespace (who wants 100 lines in every df?), doesn&#x27;t seem to handle versioning or garbage collection well.<p>Server side isn&#x27;t open, and Canocial repeatedly claims wide industry support ... despite not having it.<p>I recommend the first step in any Ubuntu system you use is to disable snap.  Use something portable like flatpak that does at least have some support, is open source, and seems to have a healthy eco system.')
