(I don&#x27;t really want it as a toy&#x2F;secondary phone, would just be a paperweight I think.)<p>It is my &#x27;dream phone&#x27; though really I suppose - Linux &amp; hardware repairable. OS is cool, but honestly I&#x27;d be happy just to see more Linux and designed for repair phones.<p>(Yes Apple phones are not the worst in that regard, but only because of sheer volume. Also, using multiple screw shapes, sizes, and lengths is pretty hostile&#x2F;&#x27;authorised only&#x27; compared to Pine&#x27;s single screw type.)')
