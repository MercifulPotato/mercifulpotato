I think most Mac and iOS apps are going to be hit by this, I think most major projects are using Travis at the moment.<p>Personally, I really like that Travis offers a variety of architectures; I’m currently running binutils on it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;travis-ci.com&#x2F;github&#x2F;saagarjha&#x2F;binutils-gdb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;travis-ci.com&#x2F;github&#x2F;saagarjha&#x2F;binutils-gdb</a>. I suspect this might be a substantial portion of the CI it sees, and it’s been great that it’s been free so far. I am unsure if it will still stay up with these changes. But, I’m sure running these kinds of builds can’t be cheap at all.')
