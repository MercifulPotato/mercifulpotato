Especially in the context of recent BLM activism, their activities in these areas look especially hypocritical. It also makes their activism look hypocritical by their willingness to commit business with people doing slavery.<p>You&#x27;re totally right about cobalt. About every other company being the same. But that just makes it hypocritical for them too.<p>While not unusual, it&#x27;s still reprehensible. No matter how you try and justify it imo.')
