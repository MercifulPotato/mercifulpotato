Especially true in PA, where the legislature specifically voted against implementing the same rules that the court then imposed anyway.<p>Even worse, they ignored Alito&#x27;s court order to segregate ballots. (Which admittedly ended up being a moot point, other than showing general non-compliance.)<p>So yes, I think the rule changes are a reason to disqualify either votes or an entire election.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s naked anti-democratic BS, attempting to masquerade as a valid concern.<p>That&#x27;s a political opinion, not a legal one. Which makes it the legislators decision, not the state court&#x27;s.')
