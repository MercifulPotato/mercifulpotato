I feel it&#x27;s a perspective reached after spending those decades in the hustle; you reach a point where it&#x27;s just a job (that doesn&#x27;t have to be negative).<p>The grass is always greener as the saying goes - I&#x27;m going to do the same work at company X vs company Y (my specialty), so long as I&#x27;m being treated fairly with compensation, tasks, rewards, management, etc. and I believe enough in the core mission of the company, I&#x27;m satisfied. Leaving at 5pm to go work on a loved hobby is now more important than some ephemeral career goal. :)  I think a key is financial stability though, it takes that hustle to build an investment reserve in the early years.')
