Orange and door use the FORCE vowel in their first syllables. Syringe doesn&#x27;t; it uses NURSE, and this is enough to prevent the words from rhyming.<p>(Perhaps you view orange as using the START vowel in its first syllable. That&#x27;s still not NURSE and still doesn&#x27;t rhyme with syringe.)')
