Again the same politicians often can support two different policies, one invaluable and one abhorrent, with no physical requirement that they are linked.<p>And US manufacturing post NAFTA has been stronger than ever, so stop repeating that old saw. If you thought NAFTA would create gumdrops rain showers and candy coated roads in Mexico, you are mistaken. NAFTA brought many better jobs to Mexico, but it can’t solve the war on drugs, bring back circular migration, eliminate governmental corruption, or reduce the stifling influence of the Catholic Church.<p>And while Smedleys book is a classic, free trade isn’t responsible for mercantilism, they are literally polar opposite philosophies.
