But there&#x27;s pretty much no other way to read the last few paragraphs in <i>this</i> particular essay. The author came within a hair&#x27;s breadth of calling Martin an &quot;ignorant racist&quot;, and he probably didn&#x27;t say so deliberately.<p>In general, this article is by far the preachiest in the series, and is thus the least enjoyable. &quot;Barbarian couture&quot; is great, though.')
