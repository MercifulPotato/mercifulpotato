The guy went all directions, after like 15 minutes he pressed cancel. Cool, called an other one. It just went into the complete opposite direction, after 5 mins &#x2F; 1-2 kms watching this I pressed cancel. Called a black cab, guy picks me up alright, then just joined some heavy traffic. I used Waze (that he never ever heard about) and told him which routes to take and did not miss my train to the airport by like 2 minutes.<p>I am pretty sure every other Uber and black cab driver is much more experienced.')
