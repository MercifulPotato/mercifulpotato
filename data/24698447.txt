Item(by='pbhjpbhj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601996924, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24695749, text='Tea ceremony presumably isn&#x27;t about selling specifically (I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s origins, but I&#x27;m guessing they&#x27;re not &#x27;sell tea&#x27;).<p>The crepes thing is interesting to me -- would love to hear of earlier examples, or those from other cultures than UK -- as it turns cheap mass-produced (in house but pre-service) meal items into the highest priced item on the menu. I checked one of the YouTube examples and saw all other puddings (desserts) for £9 but crêpes suzette were £15. Sure it uses 5 minutes of a waiters time (min wage in UK ~60p for 5 minutes) but that&#x27;s still an excellent markup, especially if a table of 4 have the crêpes and you prepare them together.')
