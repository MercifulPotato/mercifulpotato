Streaming and content aren&#x27;t so much the product, the subscriber number is the product and what shareholders continue to tolerate more cash burn for. Netflix will, if it ever hopes to become cash positive, probably have to diversify into other forms of IP exploitation, because otherwise it is hard to see how. They are unlikely to be able to radically increase revenue (though they will absolutely do what they can to increase ARPU with price rises and higher tiers). They are pretty much tapping out in subscriber growth without significant increases in content spend. They have significant competition and long tail content generally performs badly, so they won&#x27;t be able to reduce spend much.')
