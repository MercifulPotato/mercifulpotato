The CO2 equivalent units are in grams&#x2F;mile, so a higher number means more GHGs and more climate damage. For a 2WD 2020 Ram 1500 HFE on the highway, that number is 340 g&#x2F;mile. Unfortunately, motorcycle emissions data isn’t documented by the EPA. This is a real issue, because if the problem isn’t measured you don’t know what to fix.<p>&gt;There are a few independent studies that shed light on the issue, however. One published in 2008 by Swiss researchers took real data from several motorbikes including a BMW R1150GS. The GS highway CO2 equivalent is a stunning 380 g&#x2F;mile (17% worse than the Dodge)! They found that a 1993 Honda Shadow VX600 with only 583 ccs spews a whopping 408 g&#x2F;mile. That is twice as much as a new Honda Civic!<p>&gt;Other studies would suggest the problem is even worse. Global MRV tested out their portable emissions equipment in 2011 comparing 12-motorcycles to 12-cars of varying years (this was featured on an episode of Mythbusters). Motorcycles were almost universally terrible, with motorbikes from the 2000’s producing 3,220% more NOx and 8,065% more CO2 than cars of the same era. California has the largest motorcycle ridership in the country, and in 2008 the LA Times reported that while motorcycles accounted for 1% of all miles traveled, they were responsible for 10% of the state’s smog-producing emissions.<p>Taken from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;autowise.com&#x2F;motorcycle-vs-car-emissions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;autowise.com&#x2F;motorcycle-vs-car-emissions&#x2F;</a> .<p>I&#x27;ve had my M1 since 1994, so I enjoy riding, so please don&#x27;t take this as all negative.  But it&#x27;s important to look at the real data, which is much worse than people think with regards to emissions and pollution.')
