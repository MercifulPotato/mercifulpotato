Item(by='Jaruzel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604852820, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25026303, text='&gt; I have heard banks will take back a car if not paid in full.<p>I can only speak anecdotally, several years ago, I was in a financial pinch, and I called up my car&#x27;s finance people. I told them about my problem, and that I didn&#x27;t expect to be able to continue paying for my car, and that I&#x27;d heard that they would take the car back, null the credit agreement (if car value &gt; remaining amount owed), and sell on the car.  The nice lady on the phone told me that no, that&#x27;s not what they do. They&#x27;ll just wait until I default on X number of payments and then take me to court. Here I was trying to be helpful, and they gave zero shits.')
