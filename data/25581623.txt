Because of this, if the proof of concept works out, astronauts will be able to keep all their communication equipment, like antennas, on the inside of the ship.<p>- When wood burns it decomposes into gases you would already expect to find in the atmosphere.<p>- The goal is to find something to increase the price of wood. Basically, this is a fishing expedition.<p>- Even if this doesn&#x27;t work out, the research might lead to some new applications for wood.<p>- The project name is LignoStella and the satellite will be called LignoSat.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfc.jp&#x2F;information&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;2020-12-23.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfc.jp&#x2F;information&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;2020-12-23.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;univ-journal.jp&#x2F;74704&#x2F;?show_more=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;univ-journal.jp&#x2F;74704&#x2F;?show_more=1</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asia.nikkei.com&#x2F;Business&#x2F;Science&#x2F;World-s-first-woode" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asia.nikkei.com&#x2F;Business&#x2F;Science&#x2F;World-s-first-woode</a>...')
