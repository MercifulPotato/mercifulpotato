You can&#x27;t mess it up. It also eliminates other potential issues (like tortious interference with someone who signed an NDA).<p>Legally, it&#x27;s overkill. It&#x27;s like using a thermonuclear bomb to swat a fly.<p>If you&#x27;re going up against Microsoft, overkill absolutely makes sense; you might be legally right, but it will take millions of dollars in legal fees to show that. Programmers are cheaper than lawyers.<p>In the general case, though, you can just rewrite the old code and be done with it. Yourself. Looking at the old code too, so long as you don&#x27;t borrow it. You want to be a little bit careful since it&#x27;s not just the literal words (you can break copyright on a novel if you rewrite the same plot in your own words; same thing with code), but &quot;a little careful&quot; suffices.<p>It&#x27;s a bit harder to transform a piece of code into something non-infringing, rewriting section-by-section, but most lawyers say that&#x27;s not impossible either.<p>(Of course, clearly, none of that happened in this case)')
