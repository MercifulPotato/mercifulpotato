It’s there to run the negotiations between what the company wants and what you want. If you don’t understand that, you won’t be able to use HR to your benefit.<p>-I like to think of HR as an abstraction layer between management and employees, whose basic function is to shield management from having to interact with the employees.<p>Also, HR receives its pay from the company, not their coworkers - so HR is very much an agent of the company, not you. (Which is fair - after all, their loyalty is with whoever pays them, which is not unreasonable)<p>That being said, there is good HR and bad HR out there - just don&#x27;t think that HR is there for you; they&#x27;re not.')
