You&#x27;re relying on coins being lost (unknown amount) to counteract rewards and closing there&#x27;s no inflation due to that.<p>This also assumes that miners will be holding enough bitcoin that price increases alone will not only pay for their operations but also cover a reasonable interest in their holdings.
