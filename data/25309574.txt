At Intel we called it &quot;badge on the table&quot;. It&#x27;s a statement of complete commitment (and I&#x27;ve been the beneficiary of someone going &#x27;badge on the table&#x27; at least once, under circumstances I can&#x27;t disclose).<p>It doesn&#x27;t imply that if a manager or VP or CEO concedes the point at issue once, then the person can now go around &quot;putting their badge on the table&quot; and getting their own way over and over again on other issues; probably making a habit of issuing ultimatums (ultimata?) will get you fired PDQ.')
