Who are we to imagine that intelligent life has to resemble Homo sapiens?<p>In Indian astrology, Jupiter is teacher..the keeper and distributor of all kinds of wisdom. Venus is his colleague and peer..Venus is also a teacher but while Jupiter is guru of the gods..Venus is the guru of the demons. They could be planetary computers running earth simulations. Just saying.<p>If astral energy and planets can affect our lives and this can be seen through our horoscopes based on the time and place of our birth, we could all just be snippets of code.<p>Distributed processing between 5 planets, sun, moon and the two (imaginary) lunar nodes. That’s what I want to believe.')
