Item(by='shakna', descendants=None, kids=[25817589], score=None, time=1610927339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25813523, text='Whilst the efforts to create something are not nil, and I do want to acknowledge that, there is a problem with the contrast being so low.<p>Low contrast webpages do appear to be all the rage with newer designers so perhaps I can point out the problem with that with two small anecdotes.<p>I, like around 1% of the population, am &quot;blue-black&quot; colour blind. Not something that generally affects me in day-to-day life, but the colours I see are darker and less contrasting to what everyone else sees. 1% of the population is not an insignificant proportion of the world. The lack of contrast is such that all the bylines dissappear. Worse, clicked links also dissappear. Yet, because the from-domain text is higher contrast, it remains visible.<p>As for the comment box&#x2F;button... Almost felt like it was deleted. Took me a moment to confirm it wasn&#x27;t hit by a display none.<p>Second anecdote. Everything except .title has a font-size set relative to the browser, which is good. Optic neuritis makes things noisier for me, so the base font-size of my browser is set a little higher. Which, unfortunately, makes that 24px decleration stick out like a sore thumb. It doesn&#x27;t scale like everything else.')
