But rewriting messy projects from scratch is often a pitfall, and I would be very cautious about taking that route (especially given &quot;I feel that I&#x27;m in way over my head&quot; and &quot;I feel competent enough in ... but not in creating a feasible architecture&quot;). The last thing you want is to spend months creating a new project that ends up being not much better than what you started with, a scenario that happens all too frequently.<p>I would consider using this as an opportunity to learn and refactor a large code base. That&#x27;s an extremely valuable skill, and it&#x27;s hard to get it without situations like these (whereas anyone can get practice creating a new project on the weekend). You might have to spend a lot of time staring at the code, feeling like you&#x27;re not making much progress, but it&#x27;ll (hopefully) be worth it.<p>On the other hand, it is possible that the code base is just horrible and should be nuked, so use your own judgment :).')
