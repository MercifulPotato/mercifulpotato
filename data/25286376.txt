It also depends on your role.<p>I&#x27;m not quite sure how much Apple shared publicly, but there was an iOS version that caused huge performance hit for older phones (honestly, it&#x27;s kind of common with new major versions, but this was an outlier). They had a .5 release that tried to improve performance. My understanding is that, like you said, developers had been developing on the newest hardware. Apple seems to be more sensitive to this and it&#x27;s not because performance for phones have plateaued, but I&#x27;ve noticed specific regressions here and there. I remember one iPhone specifically demoed how fast the camera launched. After a few OS updates the performance was as miserable as the phones they had been mocking.<p>I know console developers deal with this, too. Their SDK hardware has more RAM than production hardware, but their tools generally have big flashing alarms when you exceed the memory used in production.')
