Though, I don&#x27;t know, if this is the guide how to tell the story- it did not work for me at all. I could not focus on the outcome as was distracted with the ultimately long mix of images containing text and blocks of text. \nI prefer to consume stories either from pictures&#x2F;slides only, or from a structured article with text, containing text-less images (or diagrams at worst), but this was too much.<p>But I hope it will find its audience.
