The best printer I ever had was an HP in the late 90s.  THE LATE 90S!<p>Since then printers still jam all the time, have ridiculously expensive ink, don&#x27;t work worth a damn (or at all) with my devices (lots of Linux and Android), and all sorts of other issues, and lately they seem to have some sort of DRM that when I took our printer offline for a few months, it never came back.  The internals seem completely seized up.  Some Googling has shown that many suspect it bricked itself because it couldn&#x27;t reach the backend service it reports to.  Speculation of course, but still absolutely enraging.<p>I haven&#x27;t printed more than a handful of pages in 10 years but my wife prints all the time.  Part of me wishes she would either stop printing (not likely as she loves paper) or print enough to justify spending more money to escape the consumer printer space.  In the mean time I wish I&#x27;d kept that HP from the 90s.  Donating that and thinking things would only get better with time was a huge mistake.  D-:')
