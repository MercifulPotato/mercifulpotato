Make a schedule and KEEP TO IT. No exceptions. You can build rest days into your schedule, but if today is leg day, don&#x27;t skip it for anything except illness or injury.<p>I personally run at least 15 minutes per day every day, averaging a 5K per day. I do this first thing in the morning. I wake up, I put on my running stuff, then I walk out the door. I find that the hardest part of exercising is getting out the door, and the hardest part of getting out the door is putting on my running gear, so if I make that literally the first thing I do, then I might as well walk out that door, too. I used to hate running in the morning, but I discovered that it had always been just an excuse. Don&#x27;t let it be an excuse.<p>I cross train on alternate days, changing it up between core, chest&#x2F;arms, and cycling. I take my dog on 20 minute walks twice a day.<p>I also don&#x27;t own a car (technically, my wife has a car, but she commutes to work which leaves me at home with no ride), so if I leave the house, I&#x27;m walking.<p>I recognize it&#x27;s not always possible in suburban&#x2F;exurban areas, but if there is anything walkable to you, like your local Starbucks or your local drugstore or lunch places, I would really consider walking. I would consider anything less than 1.5mi&#x2F;2.5km walkable, which should take you about 20-25 minutes each way. I used to live in suburban Atlanta and commute an hour each way, and then I moved to the middle of a city, and within 6 months of just walking to work every day, I had lost 30 pounds. No other physical activity or diet changes at all. Don&#x27;t underestimate just walking. (Note: if you don&#x27;t walk much, one mile will hurt your feet -- but within a week or two, your legs will be much stronger, and before you know it, walking 3 miles is nothing at all.)<p>Hope that helps.')
