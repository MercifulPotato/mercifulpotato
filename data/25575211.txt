Driving a FWD, especially when climbing, shows how limited the grip of FWD is.  AWD distributes the power to twice as many wheels (often 3 times actually) and loses grip less often.<p>Sure both cars would descend the same, but you can always lower your speed to decrease the amount of traction you need.  When climbing there&#x27;s no such options for FWD.')
