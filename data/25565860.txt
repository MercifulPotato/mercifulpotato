Objectivism? Marxism? Freebasing Solipsism?<p>Not OP but I assumed this was a version of nihilistic error theory that led to the &quot;no such thing as morality&quot; and then from there erases all idea of ownership or rights or anything. From there it&#x27;s all just a dog eat dog jungle view of all of the world and maybe you sprinkle in some Hobbesian views of the social contract.<p>I&#x27;ll pass but there&#x27;s at least potential consistency in this morbid view of the world!')
