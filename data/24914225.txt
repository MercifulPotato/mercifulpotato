My point is that by whatever measure pure maths is worth studying (i.e. those measure beyond &quot;practical&quot; applications) also obviously applies to HoTT.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve talked to a lot of very good mathematicians<p>You&#x27;re an anonymous person on the internet, this is such a strange thing to fall back on. There are pretty standard ways of talking about how well-regarded&#x2F;important certain subfields are in mathematics, &quot;I&#x27;ve asked around&quot; isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not just regurgitating what he says there<p>His comments express a <i>substantially</i> different point to yours.\nHe does not say that HoTT is a waste of time, or that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t have much content&quot;.')
