FDA certification enormously drives up the cost of medicines and medical devices; government bureaucrats have no incentive to balance safety with time to market, price, availability, supply, or diversity of sources; most of these represent risk to the people making the decisions.  Most US consumers don&#x27;t pay for their own medical care, they pay for insurance that pays for their medical care.  Often their employer pays some of the costs of insurance.  Insurance usually fixes the cost that the consumer has to pay, e.g. a $10 copay.  So there&#x27;s little incentive for consumers to shop around for medical care, meaning that consumers can&#x27;t drive prices down with normal market decisions.  States and the federal government put enormous restrictions on insurance, driving up the cost of insurance.  Health insurance doesn&#x27;t function as in other sectors, where payouts are rare- most insurance is a bet - I&#x27;ll bet you $3000 a year my house burns down - I&#x27;ll bet you $400000 it doesn&#x27;t.  Health insurance is more like a discount plan, kind of like a CostCo membership. AMA and insurance companies lobby for limiting supply of doctors and hospitals, respectively, which drives costs up. They do this under state licensure laws purporting to improve quality or safety.  Bottom line is that almost every single aspect of the US health care market has had government intervention effectively disable any market based control.  The situation would fix itself quickly if we deregulated EVERYTHING regarding healthcare, and restricted insurance to catastrophic event coverage.  Businesses would quickly come up with ways to serve the market in a market-friendly fashion.  Worried about pre-existing conditions?  We&#x27;d see businesses like &quot;diabetes maintenance organzations&quot; where you pay a monthly fee and you get all the treatment you need related to that condition.  Accidents would still be covered by insurance.  You&#x27;d pay privately for things like doctor visits for the flu, etc., but supply and consumer choice would drive those costs down, e.g. if I have a sprained ankle I could just use an app on my phone to summon a military vet who was a battlefield medic to treat it, rather than pay for 15-30min of time of someone with 24 years and half a million dollars worth of education.  What about quacks&#x2F;frauds?  We know how to deal with them - reputation (AngiesList, Consumer Reports, Google Reviews) on the front-end, courts on the back-end.')
