I don&#x27;t like censorship, and as they say: you should legislate as if your opponent is the one that will apply the law. You can apply censorship to take care of one &quot;good&quot; reason, but eventually censorship will be applied for a &quot;bad&quot; reason.<p>What I wanted to focus on is that it is not true that free speech is the solution to all democratic problems, it&#x27;s not an absolute good. We limit speech already, you can&#x27;t advocate for the killing of other people, races, etc...<p>Also, about free speech, if you can say what you want but there are very large entities controlling who gets to hear what you say, then in a way censorship might be already happening. In this case non-arousing messages are being suppressed because they don&#x27;t make money, so we all feel like everybody is either pro-this or against-this, and they&#x27;re all really mad and or dangerous.<p>This is not an easy problem to solve.')
