Item(by='Supermancho', descendants=None, kids=[25552769], score=None, time=1609090243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25552415, text='Inflation has already taken hold in some areas of the markets, eg commodities and consumer goods (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;CPIAUCSL" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;CPIAUCSL</a>). That&#x27;s why the world govt&#x2F;banks (as if the govt&#x27;s understand much of this) have enacted deflationary forces of 0% interest rates and bonds of sub 1% and it will fall until the bond market drops out and starts the cascade of defaults. That just manages to slow the current debt bubble and until the debt defaults start, inflation doesn&#x27;t shrink it. The equity prices have never changed into an increase in consumer liquidity (people are still getting paid the same) while the purchasing power of the dollar has been halved since 2010. Eventually the equities will default or mature (depending on structure) and who has the cash to cover that? Institutions will continue to become insolvent as they are unable to collect on debt, to pay back debt. It&#x27;s possible (like in Venezuela) the biggest and baddest will survive to remove a couple zeros and declare &quot;the big reset&quot; making it all reasonable again.')
