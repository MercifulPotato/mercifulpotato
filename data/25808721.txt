There is absolutely no way that there will be a Mars based self sustaining colony in that time period. Real life and Hollywood are both able to surprise us but only one of those two dabbles in self sustaining Mars settlements for the foreseeable future.<p>When the moonlandings first happened the papers and popular science writers (and SF writers) were all over what would happen next. What happened next is nothing. Sure, we have the ISS, it&#x27;s been a neat little testbed and good PR for space development.<p>But colonizing another planet is a lot harder than it may seem. I&#x27;ll challenge anybody that believes that this can be done to 10 30 ton semis full of gear, food and oxygen, then to set up shop right off the coast somewhere and prove that within a decade they can be self sustaining. That&#x27;s many orders of magnitude easier than doing the same thing on Mars and it is still very much this side of impossible.<p>The &#x27;self sustaining&#x27; bit is the nasty part here, as long as you can ship in food, oxygen, water, toilet paper and whatever else you think you might need on your faraway planet you&#x27;ll be fine within your little environmental cocoon. But another planet without a breathable atmosphere is so incredibly hostile to life that your first mistake will be your last.')
