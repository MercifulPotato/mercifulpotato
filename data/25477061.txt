Things like open sourcing Tensorflow &amp; Keras, then turning around and selling a bunch of ML optimized GCP products - commoditize the specialist ML software labor, which is the complement to the cloud vendors offerings.<p>Software engineers really have to watch out for these situations and walk away from places trying to treat them as a commodity.')
