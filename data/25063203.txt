From the article I got the impression that an interested party could actually know that devices were rigged and pour disinformation into the channel.<p>From the main article [1]:<p>&gt; The engineer, Peter Frutiger, had long suspected Crypto was collaborating with German intelligence. He had made multiple trips to Damascus to address complaints about their Crypto products and apparently, without authority from headquarters, had fixed their vulnerabilities.<p>&gt; Frutiger “had figured out the Minerva secret and it was not safe with him,” according to the CIA history. Even so, the agency was livid with Wagner for firing Frutiger rather than finding a way to keep him quiet on the company payroll. Frutiger declined to comment for this story.<p>So not only Syrian customers discovered the vulnerabilities and complained about them, they actually got them fixed and then the engineer was fired for that, so things likely got ugly. Possessing the knowledge about a compromised system that you know was sold to dozens of governments, is itself a valuable diplomatic asset. I have hard time imagining it was never acted upon by no one. Which makes me think that the customer who&#x27;d actually done his homework could discover a lot of suspicious stuff.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;world&#x2F;national-security&#x2F;cia-crypto-encryption-machines-espionage&#x2F;?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;world&#x2F;national-...</a>')
