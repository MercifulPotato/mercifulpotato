In fact, the entire M1 chip is designed to excel at machine learning, with ML accelerators in the CPU and a powerful GPU, so tasks like video analysis, voice recognition and image processing will have a level of performance never seen before on the Mac.&quot;\n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;uk&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;apple-unleashes-m1&#x2F;<p>The ANE is powerful where it comes to dealing with matrices, which are also used within games dealing with physics like collision detection or even real-time ray-tracing. \n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hollance&#x2F;neural-engine<p>The unified memory also makes it easier for the ANE and GPU to work together, instead of the GPU graphics pipeline or CPU creating bottlenecks.\n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.nvidia.com&#x2F;gpugems&#x2F;gpugems&#x2F;part-v-performance-and-practicalities&#x2F;chapter-28-graphics-pipeline-performance<p>Gaming has always been an area that macs have somewhat lacked in compared to High performance gaming rigs, Microsoft Windows, Microsoft DirectX, GPU choice, drivers and compatibility.<p>Could Apple integrate the ANE into Metal to give ios&#x2F;mac game developers their own version of DirectX offering an increased edge over their pc competition; providing increased complexity for games, superior graphics and frame rates utilising the CPU, ANE and GPU working together over the unified memory?')
