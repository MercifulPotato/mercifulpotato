Note than in US you can give up your house and your mortgage goes away, but that doesn&#x27;t work this way in Europe. The bank sells your house and if it doesn&#x27;t cover the mortgage you still owe the rest<p>Also if you sell too early after buying, you&#x27;re losing money because you pay more in transaction fees that you would have in rent (unless there is a big spike in prices).<p>Anyway, for a long time real estate have been steadily appreciating and people (especially boomers) got used to it, to the point that all their reasoning about real estate is that it&#x27;s appreciating faster than inflation. It was true for a long period but that&#x27;s no longer the case.')
