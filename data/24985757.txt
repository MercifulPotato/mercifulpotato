I lead a group who does analysis of other people&#x27;s codebases by scraping data from the game, as a way to identify unique codebases (and players who use open source bots). The admins went through logs and we all poured through the game history looking for anything that might match up.<p>The problem is that it looks like he may never have played the MMO. Besides having the shared server the game is also open sourced. It&#x27;s extremely common for players to run either in the simulator or on their own private server while testing out their codebase. Looking at his journals (and a journalist did share copies of everything they had with us) I really feel that he was in the early draft phase thinking about the game but not actually playing yet on the shared server.')
