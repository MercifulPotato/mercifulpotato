What we call waste today is really just fuel that we have extracted about 2% of the available energy from. The other 98% of the energy is still in there, waiting for us to decide to use it. The only reason we don&#x27;t use that energy is that we didn&#x27;t build reactors that can use it, and these days it&#x27;s basically impossible to build new reactors. Too much politics, too many rules, too much NIMBY.')
