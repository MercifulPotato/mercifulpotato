Most houses have something like 100 amp service from the power company. At 1000kv that&#x27;s only 10 amps. 10MW for 10 min is about 1500kwh or enough to charge some 15 teslas approx to full.<p>The power levels you&#x27;re talking about are big compared to household stuff, but kind of a joke compared to industrial processes.')
