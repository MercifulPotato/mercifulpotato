My leadership and I battle with HR constantly on this. And again personally I don&#x27;t even put much stock in resumes - especially when they come from a recruiter because the recruiter will beef up the resume so much. But the reality is that when you hire someone who&#x27;s got a lot of specialist knowledge that more often than not they are just filling a gap until something better comes along. I don&#x27;t expect my hires to be devoted to my enterprise for life, but I need to know upfront that they&#x27;ll stick around long enough to justify the hire. And when you&#x27;ve got a guy that did 3 years at Google trying to get a job as an email developer...well...that guy may want to break into the email game but most likely he&#x27;s just waiting until bigger fish come along.')
