You don&#x27;t like the question? Ignore them. You don&#x27;t feel you have the time to support them right now? Ignore them. It feels like they are entitled? Ignore them.<p>I don&#x27;t think people asking others to work for free is anything new. The recent outrage about others asking you to work for free is relatively new though.<p>You&#x27;re publishing open source code because you feel like it. This also means you can run the project however you want. Tell people to fuck off if you don&#x27;t like them. Or don&#x27;t tell them anything if you don&#x27;t feel like it.<p>You&#x27;ll feel much better as a maintainer once you act exactly like how you feel like it, no more and no less. Don&#x27;t pay too much attention to what others say. Time is much too limited to be outraged at everything. Calm down, and ignore people you don&#x27;t like.')
