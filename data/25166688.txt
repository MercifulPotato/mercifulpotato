Just from the shifting codebase, build up of complexity, “legacy code”, etc. that no one is probably looking at.<p>If there was, for example, easy to use developer tooling that automatically identified bottlenecks, the opportunity cost scale could tip towards optimization vs having to pay for and manage more servers.<p>But the opportunity cost insight is great;  optimization only wins if the cost to optimize is low and the amount that gets optimized is high.')
