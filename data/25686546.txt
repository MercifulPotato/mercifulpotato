It is really clear that Facebook is finally getting around to just implementing this feature of effectively having &quot;hosted clients&quot; for companies to be able to more easily--and yes: less securely--build chat bots (a mechanism that I appreciate is maybe less than ideal to encourage, but frankly just doesn&#x27;t feel <i>that bad</i> and certainly isn&#x27;t a surprise: Facebook has been taking about this for a year or two now); and all of the &quot;changes&quot; this week have been directly because of this, including the Privacy Policy update... the key article about which even explicitly said:<p>&gt; The move, the spokeswoman said, is part of a previously disclosed move to allow businesses to store and manage WhatsApp chats using Facebook&#x27;s infrastructure. Users won&#x27;t have to use WhatsApp to interact with the businesses and have the option of blocking the businesses. She said there will be no change in how WhatsApp shares provides data with Facebook for non-business chats and account data.<p>And yet, somehow, everyone is just in complete hysterics over all of this, claiming Facebook is evil and undermining the feeling of security people have in WhatsApp, with lots of talk of switching not only to reasonable alternatives like Signal, but also to <i>less secure messaging protocols</i> like Telegram (or, frankly, Matrix). People at my supposedly-smart privacy company--Orchid, building something akin to &quot;incentivized Tor for general VPN use&quot;--are even panicking about this news, and it is really frustrating how no one even seems to want to analyze this carefully... &quot;bUt FaCeBoOk Is EvIl!!&quot; :&#x2F;.')
