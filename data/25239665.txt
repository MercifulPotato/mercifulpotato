Item(by='gst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606590457, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25238608, text='&gt; IntelliJ is working on porting the JetBrains Runtime to Apple Silicon. The apps currently work through Rosetta 2, however building via Gradle is extremely slow. Gradle creates code at runtime, which seems a particular bad combination with the Rosetta 2 ahead-of-time translation logic.<p>Java does not need to be run through emulation. Azul already published ARM64 Zulu builds for OpenJDK (here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.azul.com&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;zulu-community&#x2F;?package=jdk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.azul.com&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;zulu-community&#x2F;?package=jdk</a>) and they work great on the M1. I&#x27;m currently using IntelliJ running in emulation mode (an official release for the M1 was originally expected by the end of November) and but build&#x2F;run my projects on a local Zulu JVM with ARM64 support.')
