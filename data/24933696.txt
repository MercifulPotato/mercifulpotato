I took it for about two weeks, and sure enough I started feeling that I was getting much better sleep, which in turn made me feel like I was much more fresh and &#x27;recovered&#x27; when I woke up.<p>I did some research on it and there was no data to backup the claim that the ingredients do anything useful. There was contrary data that some supplements can cause your kidneys to work harder to filter out the excess junk in the formulation. I stopped taking it because of fear of damaging my kidneys. Now, I can&#x27;t explain why it worked, but I just know that it did help. I&#x27;ve heard that quite a bit from others, who seem to think certain supplements helped when, when there is zero data to support their claims.<p>I think we&#x27;re going to unlock a large amount of human performance, both mental and physical, when we finally figure this stuff out.')
