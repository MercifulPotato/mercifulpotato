Because your online applications that need low latency access to features won&#x27;t tolerate the latencies provided by existing data warehouses. The online app that has an operation model that makes predictions is one client of the feature store. For the other client - a data scientist who is browsing features and creating train&#x2F;test datasets - yes, that is similar to a data warehouse, except that you get APIs in Python and your data has precomputed statistics that make it better for exploratory data analysis than a traditional data warehouse.')
