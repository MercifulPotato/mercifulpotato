It being none of the courts&#x27; business, and the exposure threatening national security, are two different arguments.<p>Other forms of executive privilege that protect autonomy are easier to invoke, and easier to challenge. State secrets privilege cannot be used lightly. It&#x27;s used all the time now, and there is reason to be suspicious that it is used fraudulently.<p>The courts really need to figure out a way to in principal allow US citizens bring a case in situations like this. You have to prove now, in essence, that your name is on an invisible piece of paper. I agree that the nomination procedure is extremely sensitive, but I think there is some room on the yes&#x2F;no presence of someone on the kill list, given other supporting evidence. The danger is that we reveal to someone that we&#x27;re trying to kill them -- but again, we&#x27;re talking about a citizen, and if they have supporting evidence and are in court then they already suspect that.')
