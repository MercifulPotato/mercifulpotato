Some research is considered &quot;safe&quot;, whereas others risky. IN a properly balanced portfolio, perhaps 80% of funding should go to safe work and the remaining 20% to more risky, but potentially high-reward studies. However this isn&#x27;t how funding agencies usually operate.<p>At least in the context of the U.S. government, funding agencies are terrified of being seen as &quot;wasting&quot; funding, because that is a sure way to have funding cut by congress. The &quot;Golden Fleece&quot; awards, a congressman&#x27;s attack on perceived frivolous spending, have routinely been targeted at specific research funded by the NSF and have helped make the agency afraid of being attacked by congress.')
