If you believe that policy has no effect on infection rates, and you believe you can better control for the latter set of variables, then CFRs make a better metric for judging policy effectiveness.<p>I should point out this is all predicated on a statement I believe to be false. (I suspect policy does meaningfully affect infection rates.)')
