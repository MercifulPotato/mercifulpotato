On the other side, some doctors, scientists and public health officials are questioning the wisdom of this approach in the face of massive unknowns about their efficacy and in light of the clear and growing evidence that such measures may not be working in some cases, and may also be causing net harm.<p>It&#x27;s very hard to dissent against the current narrative because any dissent can easily be framed as &quot;killing people&quot;. I blame technology for our current predicament. If we didn&#x27;t have computers and a global internet, there&#x27;s no way we would be shutting down everything. We might be wearing masks and washing hands, but I would bet life would be largely the same.<p>But because technology dangled the carrot of &quot;we can save lives by doing everything virtually with computers&quot; we are charging down that path optimizing for lives saved without giving fair consideration to other side effects of that (loneliness, depression, suicide, homelessness, civil unrest, economy). In some ways, taking a one time &quot;excess deaths&quot; hit as we have done with past pandemics <i>does</i> have measurable benefits in other ways, but you&#x27;ll get shouted out of the room if you bring up that position even as a hypothetical.')
