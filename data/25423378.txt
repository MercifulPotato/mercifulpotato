In my experience, this is easiest to achieve when Slack channels are closely aligned with teams who are working together.<p>The model tends to break down when Slack is used for communication that is better served by e-mail, calls, or meetings. An easy rule of thumb is that if it crosses department boundaries and&#x2F;or is something that needs to be formally communicated to an entire team, it&#x27;s better to direct it to e-mail or a scheduled call.<p>&gt; Speaking of the example in the article, there is absolutely no reason clients should have direct message channels with your company&#x27;s employees and expect to get a response 24&#x2F;7.<p>Strongly agree, but it&#x27;s not just clients.
