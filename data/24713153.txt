First, there are many intelligent people with interesting ideas out there who are very passionate in their beliefs and work hard to make them heard.<p>&gt; The quality of such work is usually excellent, and so it&#x27;s easy to get swept away by whatever they say. I think this can be a good thing - we should listen to smart people when they talk, even if what they are saying contradicts our own beliefs.<p>&gt; The problem in such cases is that people can often get carried away by an idea or concept without stopping to think whether it&#x27;s actually true, and then they will defend their position with everything that they have.<p>&gt; In my experience, this leads to a lot of unnecessary conflict, where people are too proud to admit they might be wrong. This is especially true when the ignorant masses take sides with one group or another and start spewing hate at each other on the internet.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not just about &#x27;PC Master Race&#x27; vs. console peasants - those are the least of our problems, really.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s much bigger than that. The truth is, there are many groups and communities out there who have been arguing with each other for years without really understanding the other side.<p>If this was really a GPT-3 bot, it passed my turing test.')
