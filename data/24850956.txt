Just some months ago a team I was working with lost almost a day on a misbehaving software module. After serious detective work it all came down to whitespace in a YAML configuration file.<p>I remember being pretty excited when I discovered YAML and even pushed its use in some projects trying to avoid the verbosity of XML. These days I will never trade accuracy for conciseness, in particular if its form relies on whitespace and there is not enough redundancy in the specs for consistency checks. Yes, syntax matters.')
