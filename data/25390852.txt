You are looking for trends and fine differences.<p>I am comparing the Y values for multiple points with the same X values in different series.  I&#x27;m only looking for course differences.<p>For my purpose, it makes sense for the scale to start at zero.<p>At a glance, the week of April 12, 2020 looks like it has four times as many deaths as any other year since 2015.  In reality, it has roughly 1.5x as many.  That&#x27;s still a huge difference, but I had to check the scale and do some quick mental calculations to figure that out - which is more than I would have had to do if the graph&#x27;s vertical scale started at zero.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that all graphs must start their scales with zero.  I&#x27;m not even saying that this is a bad graph.  It&#x27;s just not as effective for the kind of analysis I want to use it for.')
