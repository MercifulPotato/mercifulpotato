For example, in C++ you can return a locked mutex-locker from a function:<p><pre><code>    std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; foo();\n</code></pre>\nThe unlocking of the mutex is then tied up with what you do with the returned mutex locker e.g. if you ignore it then it will be unlocked at the end of the current statement, if you assign it to a local variable (and don&#x27;t move from that) then it will be destroyed when leaving that enclosing function, or you return it from that enclosing function to extend the length of the lock still further.<p>You also can&#x27;t compose those mechanisms so easily. For example I could make a class with a std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; and a pointer to the data it protects and pass that around.')
