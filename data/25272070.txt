Item(by='bigiain', descendants=None, kids=[25273970, 25273433], score=None, time=1606870481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25271832, text='I had 3 Pebbles, and a Kickstarter pledge in for a fourth that they cancelled and refunded me when they sold out.<p>I spend the refund money on a small but fun collection of old soviet mechanical watches. The kinda ubiquitous Vostok Amfibia, a &quot;Big Zero&quot;, and a pretty poor fake of the Sturmanski Yuri Gagarin wore.<p>I get much &quot;more joy&quot; from these - even the fake Yuri watch - than I ever got from a &quot;smart watch&quot;.<p>My usual story about smart watches was that I jumped on the very first Pebble Kickstarter, because I thought it&#x27;d be useful while riding a motorcycle to be able to see who&#x27;s calling&#x2F;texting my phone when it was vibrating in my pocket, so I could decide whether I wanted to stop and answer it. Turns out, the answer was _always_ &quot;No!&quot;. Even if it _was_ someone I&#x27;d normally pick up for, I was either gonna arrive at my destination in 10 or 20 mins and would deal with it then, or I was on a trip and wasn&#x27;t gonna be stopping until the tank was empty - possibly at a place with no reception - and I&#x27;d deal with it late that evening or in a few days when I got back to town.')
