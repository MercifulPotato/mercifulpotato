And I&#x27;m saying that after trying dozens of alternatives.<p>Now, maybe things got changed in the last five years, but something where Jira still shines IMHO:<p><pre><code>  * Self-hosted, free for small teams, you get access to *every* release they made. All these cloud-hosted solutions sound nice until they close the shop.\n\n  * Almost infinitely configurable. Going from Jira to enter-your-favorite-simple-tool feels like going from Emacs to the chalkboard. Your CEO likes workflow X, sure. Your designer wants workflow Y, no problem. Your plumber used to Z, done. Irreplaceable when you work with the teams from different fields.\n\n  * Bazillion plugins, integrations, name it. You are still missing something, go and write a plugin in any JVM language you like. It probably will work for all Jira versions with small modifications.\n\n  * Management, CEOs, even front-end desks like it. Easy to sell, no matter the price. I had a harder time selling Zimbra (which is free) to CEO than Jira, because every CEO knows about Jira :D\n</code></pre>\nRight, it got slow over time (I believe the main reason is clunky UI), but you have to pay the price for all those features. If I&#x27;m Atlassian, I&#x27;d probably add some optional light add-on UI, as Jenkins did with Blue Ocean.')
