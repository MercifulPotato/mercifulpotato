At-will means that employees can quit at any time for any reason and employers can fire employees at any time for any reason (except certain things like race, religion, etc). Salaried means you get paid $X per year and the amount you work depends on the company; could be 35h&#x2F;week, could be 80h&#x2F;week, but it doesn&#x27;t change how much you get paid.')
