Vet clinics look a lot like US medical centres, including the state-of-the-art equipment and corresponding prices. Meanwhile the limited for-profit medical services are (mostly) affordable because they do general procedures with relatively low barriers for competitors. Generic drugs are dirt cheap when available; non-generics cost as much as the US. Dental care is all over the map from very affordable to ridiculously overpriced.')
