You&#x27;ve got options available to you. One I didn&#x27;t mention (though likely unappealing to you given you don&#x27;t want to use a custom extension) is to hire someone to write it for you. (I suspect if you reached out to Crunchy Data, the host of this submission, they could do the work, or put you in touch with someone who could.)  There&#x27;s also the possibility of successfully getting the extension included in the core distribution. Some current features started as extensions.
