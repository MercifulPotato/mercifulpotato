There are diseases that are airborne, but most aren&#x27;t spread by rotting organic matter. It also ignores the other routes of infection (eg. food&#x2F;water). The only thing it got right was &quot;disease can spread through air&quot;. The magnitude of the effect is probably off too. AFAIK the miasma was thought to extend at least a few hundred feet (ie. encompassing entire neighborhoods), but I don&#x27;t know of any disease that can spread that far through the air.')
