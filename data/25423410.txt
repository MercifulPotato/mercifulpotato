But it sounds pretty easy to write a cracker for it: Just rewrite the machine code to jump over the check. Or did I miss anything?<p>Nope, you did not miss anything.  Many of these old DOS game floppy protections could be bypassed by a single byte change to the exe (or com, depending on the game) file.  The time consuming part was working out exactly which byte to change.<p>Source: I cracked most of my DOS games back in the day, using nothing more than DOS&#x27;s supplied &#x27;debug&#x27; tool, so I did not have to go find, and insert, the floppy in order to play the game.  On many of them, changing a single JC to JNC or a single JE to JZ  (or the reverse) was all it took to bypass the copy protection.  A few others took a few more bytes worth of patching, one had to convert a conditional into an unconditional branch or otherwise nop out a small code segment.  The one that required the most effort was MicroProse&#x27;s Apache helicopter simulator.  They used the &quot;weak sector trick&quot; but the contents of the &quot;weak sector&quot; was also a small bit of the overall game code.  So for that one I created a loader that hooked the disk interrupt and when it detected the weak sector read, it returned the sector data and the proper &quot;disk read error&quot; state for the rest of the game to work with.')
