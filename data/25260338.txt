How am I supposed to get people to care about some images and text that describe a product that they can&#x27;t use? Where would I even post such materials?<p>More generally, I suppose, how is one supposed to test product-market fit without a product? I&#x27;m really not sure how I should be interpreting and acting upon this advice.')
