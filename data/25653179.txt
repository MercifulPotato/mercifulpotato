On the other hand, I&#x27;m still wary of buying anything from one of the world&#x27;s most anti-consumer companies. I&#x27;m not the least-bit confident that Apple won&#x27;t later rescind the ability to boot other Operating Systems. This kind of benevolence is entirely uncharacteristic of a company so fond of walled-gardens.')
