Consider the Arab Spring, largely held with cellphones most of us would consider heavily outdated. Citizens were still able to communicate and plan protests against the will of their governments despite the fact that their governments obviously had the capital and resources to invest in better technology than existed in consumer hands at the time.<p>In a civilized world, the only thing stopping rapid equalization of technology in peoples&#x27; hands is intellectual property law, preventing thousands of copycat companies from ripping off the new iPhones until the price is so violently driven into the ground that you can find them at dollar stores. In a world at war, IP laws don&#x27;t apply, and the only thing stopping the &quot;other side&quot; from standing up their own robot army is the will to invest in and support that technology. We may consider it to be secret government technology now, but all you need is one hardware hacker with some JTAG wires and one disabled unit for all of their secrets to spill out onto the open Web.')
