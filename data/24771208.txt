You&#x27;re already going to have to rewrite it all in this proposed alternative language... this header is the least of your worries.<p>Strikes me that AMD have supplied everything required: all the driver code in the preferred form for modification of the driver, i.e., a bunch of C files.<p>Some of these C files are a big long list of slightly opaque magic number defines that relate to the hardware, perhaps generated by some unreleased tool, who can say - it&#x27;s all speculation at this point - but that&#x27;s OK! The hardware is not the bit you&#x27;re going to modify. As far as the people modifying the drivers are concerned, those numbers are never going to change. This portion of the driver is fixed.')
