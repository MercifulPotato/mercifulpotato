A king who wanted to relinquish responsibility while holding on to the benefits of his position. Blinded to the duplicity of his two opportunistic daughters who tell him what he wants to hear, persecuting the daughter who truly loves him and tells him the truth. Similarly blinded, Gloucester is only able to &quot;see&quot; the truth once his figurative blindness is made literal &amp; his eyes gouged out.')
