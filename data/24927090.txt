My application is low volume, probably would order in runs of ~100 depending on pricing. But it is revenue generating so I’m not swayed with these dollar amounts. I’m already at ~$300 before the actuators and my impression is that I could get that down a bit by improving the design. I’m also concerned with serviceability and I’m not great at soldering. I’ve come this far on breadboards.<p>Seems like I might hire a design service then utilize JLCPCB for production. I can’t tell if this sparkfun service is essentially combining those two actions. Although I think the DIY requirement is still a bit high based on my interpretation of the service description. I’m in a spot where I want to show someone what I’ve built and let them be a professional&#x2F;specialist to turn it into a real device&#x2F;controller')
