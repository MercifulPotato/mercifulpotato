At no point can my license be revoked if I always pay all the tickets.<p>So getting back to your analogy, if I use speech to make false claims about a product I will get a hefty fine, but there is nothing physically stopping me from doing exactly the same thing tomorrow.<p>The speech isn&#x27;t actually prohibited or &quot;denied&quot; anymore than me parking illegal is, there are just consequences if I choose to do it.')
