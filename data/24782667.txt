I&#x27;m convinced this company is actually an experiment on how far someone can let a system go unsupervised before it falls apart.<p>It started with Uber Eats spamming me with coupons through at least 5 SMS a day that I the app wouldn&#x27;t let me use. When contacting support, they shrugged me off.<p>Then,months later, I was out for errands and with no mobile data. I called my girlfriend and asked her to call an Uber for me. After waiting for an hour of drivers literally not even moving, or canceling while still 3 blocks away, I gave up and called a cab. When I got home she was in a fight with support, because apparently the passanger wasn&#x27;t wearing a mask and that could get her suspended. Needless to say, that was complete bull because I was never even 500m of any Uber driver.<p>I don&#x27;t know what this law is, but as petty as it sounds, I hope doesn&#x27;t pass and this company dies.')
