Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=[25956781], score=None, time=1611924920, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25956653, text='&gt;<i>I find it reductionist to the point it loses it&#x27;s meaning. Actually the whole human body is constantly growing, not just cancers. I&#x27;m am growing new skin cells as we speak, approximately every x3 weeks I shed old skin cells so need new ones.</i><p>That objection is already covered in the very title used by HN (&quot; If the purpose of a company is merely growth&quot;). It&#x27;s also covered extensively in the article.<p>And your counter-analogy is wrong anyway: the whole human body is not &quot;constantly growing&quot; (it does this only or mostly for its first 2 decades, about the same time we stop getting any taller).<p>It&#x27;s constantly renewing (in your words: &quot;I shed old skin cells so need new ones&quot;), which is different from growing (even if we say that we have to &quot;grow&quot; new cells - we also have to grow new plants to keep a farm going, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the farm itself has to grow - much less to endelessly try to find new profit avenues. It&#x27;s the latter sense the article uses).<p>&gt;<i>If they don&#x27;t then they will die, the same way I will die if my body stops growing new cells to replace the old one.</i><p>Which is neither here nor there, since &quot;growing new cells&quot; to replace old ones is not the same as growth in the commonly understood sense and the one used in the article. In the &quot;growing new sells&quot; sense, businesses without a &quot;growth-above-everything&quot; mission still &quot;grow&quot; (renew) lots of things: their stock, ocassionally introduce new products, find new customers, and so on.<p>And of course the examples the author gives of companies without &quot;growth&quot;, have survived more (e.g. the Japanese companies operating for centuries), than companies that get gigantic and whose purpose is to maximize shareholder profit...')
