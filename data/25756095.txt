Iâ€™ll wait.<p><i>Civil War...</i><p>The Civil War occurred at a time when actual physical war was the predominant way that societal differences were settled.  That is no longer the case, except perhaps in the minds of some of the idiots that stormed the Capitol.<p>But on an intellectual level, this event with Parler is akin to an act of modern civil war.  When you endeavor to kill an organization, are you not in a sense declaring war on them?  Further, was this action not designed to frighten others into getting in line with the ruling party, lest they suffer the same fate?  While no guns were used, those seem very similar to the actions normally taken by those engaging in civil war.')
