I wonder how you arrived at this point. You can&#x27;t, for example, truncate a UTF-8 byte array without the risk of producing a broken string. But this is only the start. Here are two strings, six letters each, one in NFC, the other in NFD, and their byte-length in UTF-8:<p><pre><code>    &quot;Åström&quot; is 8 bytes in UTF-8\n\n    &quot;Åström&quot; is 10 bytes in UTF-8\n</code></pre>\nIf your software tells the user that one is eight and the other is 10 letters long, it is not &quot;less correct&quot;. It is incorrect. Further, if searching for &quot;Åström&quot; won&#x27;t find &quot;Åström&quot;, your software is less useful than it could be if it knew Unicode. (And it&#x27;s sad how often software gets this wrong.)')
