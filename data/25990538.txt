We have vaccines for many diseases that still exist today - influenza, varicella, etc. Even polio has proved tricky to globally eradicate, and vaccines for this have been in existence for over 50 years. The diseases that have been essentially eradicated, such as smallpox, is something that does not require vaccination on a continual&#x2F;annual basis.<p>Covid has been mutating and spreading to other species. It is also believed that immunity is short lived, about 1 year.  The virus will be endemic (if not already) in global wildlife and agricultural animal populations indefinitely. This will mean that you can&#x27;t eradicate it and what yearly vaccinations will be required. This also presents the potential that new mutations will continue to emerge and that one or more will not be protected against by the vaccine.<p>These concerns don&#x27;t even address that parts of the population will refuse to get the vaccine. Or that the vaccine does not completely protect against infection&#x2F;transmission, as seen in it&#x27;s effectiveness being measured as preventing severe symptoms (which is part of why you still need to wear a mask after vaccination).')
