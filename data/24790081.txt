It&#x27;s been in development for so long, and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be particularly stable. Granted, it&#x27;s a difficult project, but I also struggle to see a valid use case for it. Why would I want to use this when I can use WINE or a virtual machine? And if it&#x27;s aiming to emulate windows xp, surely this use-case gets less and less relevant over time?<p>Then again, the fact that it exists just makes me feel good in ways I don&#x27;t completely understand.')
