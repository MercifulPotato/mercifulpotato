I think the medium has fully matured at this point and is no longer that interesting.  There was a bit of a revolution when adult movie fare moved to TV 15 years ago and ideas&#x2F;plots&#x2F;characters were given hours of fleshing out instead of 2-3 hours but that has seemingly run its course.  I think what we are seeing now is just tail interests being served by the explosion of content, more so than TV quality being better than ever.<p>Edit: With more thought this might be the same thing to the consumer actually.  They don&#x27;t care how good the average TV show is, just how engrossing the hours of TV they watch every day is.  With so much content it&#x27;s never been easier to make those hours engrossing to you, even if it feels like the average &#x2F; median TV show isn&#x27;t really improving and possibly getting much worse.')
