It&#x27;s a physical fact that has been observed since the stone age. The Java API is huge. It&#x27;s not a mere physical fact, nor even a collection of method prototypes. It&#x27;s everything covered in the JavaDocs: what happens in error scenarios, thread safety rules, how objects are combined to get different effects, what you can subclass and what&#x27;s not, what security permissions things need. It&#x27;s enormous and every decision in that was a &#x27;creative&#x27; decision, in some sense.<p>From a plain reading of copyright law it&#x27;s obvious APIs far smaller and simpler than Java <i>should</i> fall under copyright. The idea APIs don&#x27;t is a convenient consensus-quo for the software industry that benefits competition and should probably be preserved, although there is the counterbalancing factor that the non-protectability of APIs probably has invisible side effects we can&#x27;t see (e.g. under-investment in API design). But the Supreme Court won&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t care about any of that because it&#x27;s a political debate. The question before them is about what the current law says, and on that, Oracle probably have a point. Also, it&#x27;s going to be even more fashionable to hate on Oracle if they do win, but the current situation has always been legally fragile. Sooner or later <i>someone</i> would have observed the apparent skew between the software industry&#x27;s approach to copyright and what the law really says. We may be at least somewhat grateful that it&#x27;s a fight between two well resourced firms and not e.g. a patent troll firm type of situation, where the defenders are threatened and have to pay up because they&#x27;re too small to fight it.')
