If your CDN is only caching your css and jpg files, then every page load still has to go back to your main server and talk to your database. This is how &quot;standard&quot; Cloudflare caching works. It&#x27;s pretty good, but a page load from Australia would still have to travel all the way to your PHP+MySQL server in the US and back again.<p>To speed it up further, you can tell Cloudflare to cache your HTML pages. Now you&#x27;ve eliminated that round-the-world trip (for most visitors), but you&#x27;ve also lost some of the dynamicness of your site. At that point, you&#x27;re basically building a static site by different means.')
