This is mostly about integrating and optimizing clustering (hierarchical and graph-based) packages into tools for data analysts to use.  Quite a bit of that is actually literature review - reading and keeping up to date on the latest academic results in this space.  Usually, there are packages already developed in C&#x2F;C++ with Python or R wrappers.  I occasionally develop parallel algorithms in C++ when there are obvious multi-core performance advantages not available in a package.<p>I have BS and MS degrees in computer science.  Almost all the RDBMS, SQL, ETL, and reporting tools are self-taught skills that I picked up professionally after leaving graduate school.<p>I <i>love</i> the high performance computing work but I have found it hard to build a career solely on that work.  Lots of research projects don&#x27;t have funding to support a full-time programmer for that effort and other internal teams support installation and administration of standard tools.<p>I am really not paid for the HPC work - it is just a nice option available because I am relatively efficient at all the traditional IT work and my workplace is happy to have a little &quot;extra&quot; help on the HPC stuff.')
