The soviets really doubled down on missile boats.<p>The range of the Lun’s missiles out ranged its radar, which was a problem that missile boats of that era also had. Nato imagined that a forward Lun would act as scout for the rest etc with lots of coordination.<p>The Lun’s problem was that by the time it entered trials the soviet missile boats were being fitted with a over horizon radar that the Lun couldn’t carry.\nThat, and the end of the Cold War, of course.<p>The coordination idea is interesting; the last generation of soviet “carrier killing” anti-ship missiles were designed to do coordinated attacks where one missile would pop up to identify and allocate targets to its cohorts staying down low.  If it was intercepted, another of the low missiles would then go high and so on.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;P-700_Granit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;P-700_Granit</a><p>Of course for missile coordination to work like that, the launcher has to know there is something to fire at in the first place...')
