In the last decade, the biggest innovation has been to add Bluetooth to premium hearing aids. It&#x27;s a total game-changer, but I&#x27;m very surprised that there hasn&#x27;t been more innovation on this front. I&#x27;m profoundly deaf, and my hearing aid gives me so many cool features... but I can&#x27;t help but wonder how much better someone with normal hearing would feel with those features as well. I&#x27;m practically a cyborg at the moment, with technology augmenting my crappy hearing. Why wouldn&#x27;t a normal person want to be a cyborg too, and have tech-augmented super-hearing?!<p>Like many other things, I guess the demand just isn&#x27;t there. And even though Bluetooth devices have made having things in your ear all the time way less stigmatized than they were when I was growing up, there&#x27;s still a bit of embarrassment about having something like a hearing aid in your ear. It&#x27;s a shame, really.')
