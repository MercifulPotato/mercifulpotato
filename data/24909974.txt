SpaceX had planned to use parachute for 1st stage recovery but switched to the current solution after it became clear parachute wasn’t viable. Likewise, they switched to stainless steel for Starship once they figured carbon composite wasn’t suitable for what they wanted to do. If Tesla hasn’t adopted Lidar, that wouldn’t be because Musk didn’t want to admit he was wrong.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t believe that. He ultimately has to be anti-LiDAR because putting LiDAR on every Tesla is simply not feasible nor compatible with his plan to mass gather training data, so he has to justify it somehow.<p>Why is using Lidar not compatible with mass gather training data?<p>Also he recently said they wouldn&#x27;t use Lidar even if it&#x27;s free. He didn&#x27;t leave the door open for when the price goes down sufficiently. He could be wrong obviously, but I don&#x27;t think he is in denial.')
