For example, if I want to inspect the .deb file and accidentally type &quot;dpkg -i&quot; instead of &quot;dpkg -I&quot;. Or if I am examining logs on a server, and mistype &quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&quot;.  Or if I typed &quot;make install&quot; and failed to set PREFIX to a local directory.<p>It also helps a lot as a voluntary &quot;logging&quot; solution -- if you collect syslog on your servers, this can record which commands got run and why things got worse. It is not security solution, you&#x27;ll have to make a &quot;social convention&quot; to never do &quot;sudo su&quot; or invoke ! in your editor, but it helps to detect accidental mistakes.<p>As for secure console, you can do this today! Make sure &quot;k&quot; is enabled in magic sysrq flags, and then you can switch to VT1 (alt-ctrl-f1) and invoke SAK with alt-sysrq-k. This&#x27;ll kill everything on the current VT, and give you a clean login prompt which you can safely log into.<p>Finally, even with a single user, the privilege separation can help a lot with data protection. Just set up a backup process to run as root, into local directory where only root can write to. Then at least your data won&#x27;t get deleted.')
