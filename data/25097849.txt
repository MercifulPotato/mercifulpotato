I grew up in India in a middle-class family and my father always went through unimaginable hardships just so that he can buy us chocolates and pay our tuition.<p>He was still young at 65 and there was so much that I wanted to see and share with him. Realizing that this is not ever going to happen itself kills me from the inside.<p>I&#x27;m doing okay now compared to a few weeks ago but I keep having breakdowns and depressing episodes every now and then.<p>I now know that I need to continue to live and be strong and do things for him and raise a family and spread love just like he did. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to living like before but I feel happy with the idea that I&#x27;ll be taking it from here, keeping him in my thoughts every day, doing things he would do, talking and acting like he would, pass on his genes and finally go away like he did one day.')
