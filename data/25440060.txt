What has changed is that FB users in the UK will be agreeing to terms with Facebook Inc in California rather than Facebook Ireland.<p>I suspect this is because the UK has a data sharing agreement with the US, but when Brexit kicks in there is not a legal mechanism in place for easy transfer of data from the EU to the UK (which makes your life hard if you&#x27;re a company based in Ireland and you need to send data to the UK.)')
