Obviously, the purpose of before&#x2F;after is to produce a visual effect; then why produce pseudo-content if CSS is oh-so-great a language for presentation? But IMO that&#x27;s par for the course for CSS which starts out by migrating rendering properties that used to be HTML attributes into their own <i>syntactic</i> category that&#x27;s neither here nor there, then postulates a structure&#x2F;presentation dichotomy after the fact. When actually markup attributes are intended exactly for the purpose of holding rendering properties rather than some elusive &quot;structural semantics&quot; bs. Going from there, it feels like CSS heads got lost in their maze of separation of concerns story, which in any case has never needed new syntax, let alone a thousand micro syntaxes.')
