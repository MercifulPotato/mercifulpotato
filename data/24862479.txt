If they are not working one day do not go back there and buy ice cream.<p>There are few employees who are trained to maintain and clean those thing at McDonald&#x27;s. \nIf they get gross they usually just turn them off which cuts the cooling and then it gets very very nasty.<p>Getting a bellyache is the bear to hope for.<p>Disclaimer.
