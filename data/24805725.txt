Congratulations on your positive response and recovery.<p>Our goal is to enable the same response in others who may experience side effects and may have to forgo treatment because of it.<p>Doxorubicin, also nicknamed red devil or red death, is notorious for its side effects. In addition to the bone marrow toxicity common to most chemotherapies, a person cannot receive more than 6 doses of doxorubicin in their lifetime without increasing their risk of heart failure. So when patients respond to doxorubicin, but more doses are needed, the patient and the doctors face a difficult choice: risk of death from the cancer or risk of cardiac failure. Shasqi is trying to change that equation for solid tumors. We are not focused on lymphomas yet.')
