Item(by='djsumdog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607561693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25367324, text='&gt; Do you think Trump is throwing pardons around just for shits and giggles?<p>Well he gave Flynn a pardon because Flynn was railroaded by Sullivan. I doubt you understand this case, because Flynn&#x27;s original attorney had a conflict of interest with the prosecutor. Powell, via discovery, found text messages of FBI agents trying to find something, anything, to entrap Flynn with. They went after his family, his kids!<p>When all this came to light, the prosecutors said they would dismiss. Sullivan said they couldn&#x27;t. In an unprecedented move, Sullivan assigned an americus (friend of the court) to see if they could prosecute Flynn for perjury because he plead guilty when he was really innocent.<p>Let that sink in. Sullivan wanted Flynn prosecuted for perjury BECAUSE HE PLEAD GUILTY WHEN HE WAS ACTUALLY INNOCENT. It&#x27;s in the brief, which I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve read. This is the definition of a Kafka trap.')
