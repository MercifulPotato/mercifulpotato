I did an internal team transition at a company several years ago, and while it gave me a pretty good salary increase, it was not as big an increase (percentage-wise) compared to my wife&#x27;s job hopping during roughly the same time span. I hopped jobs a couple more times a few years later and currently make three times more than I did back then. Some of this is attributable to differences in pay levels between cities but there&#x27;s generally just a lot more room for negotiation with a new company than there is within the same company. I know many colleagues that left a company because of the ease of negotiating better offers outside of one&#x27;s company.')
