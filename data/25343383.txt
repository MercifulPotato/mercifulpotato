I don&#x27;t think they were very successful (maybe for the managers that pushed for a new department to be cobbled together from consultants and self-employed folk), because the problem was not well-understood and they over-engineered towards e.g. microservices and&#x2F;or everything into an event bus before understanding the problem and the consequences of their decisions.<p>At one project, I&#x27;m convinced the decision to rewrite was political (the existing application was a C#&#x2F;.NET application, the new manager Decided to have the new stuff made in Java on AWS. Oh and for every IT system to be migrated to AWS as well. Then the army of consultants and self-employed folk Decided to go for a microservices architecture linked together on an event bus (AWS Kinesis, for some reason), spent two years developing only to realize that hey, having a separate &#x27;order&#x27; and &#x27;inventory&#x27; microservice is kinda tricky when you actually have to check inventory to make an order.
