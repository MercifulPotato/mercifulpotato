Item(by='WWLink', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602485306, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24749989, text='I recently bought a couple of Alienware AW2521HFL monitors that are 8-bit IPS and do actually run at 240Hz. They don&#x27;t even use FRC to achieve that 8-bit color! There&#x27;s also the MSI MAG251RX which uses the same panel but adds FRC to get 10-bit color!<p>The downside to them is that they&#x27;re 24.5&quot; and 1920x1080. I&#x27;m ok with that because I paired them with my 34&quot; 3440x1440 screen as side screens. However, it&#x27;s a really low pixel density to use as a primary monitor.<p>That&#x27;s the part that sucks. A nice 4k or 5k monitor like the LG Ultrafines will only do 60hz.<p>All that said, the Alienware screens seem expensive until you look at how much the other 240hz IPS screens cost. At the price, they also come with a nice 3 year warranty and a really good stand. The part that irritates me is they don&#x27;t calibrate them. One was way off compared to the other, so I&#x27;m waiting on a warranty replacement just on the basis that I think that one is not going to be easy to correct.')
