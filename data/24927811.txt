Item(by='u801e', descendants=None, kids=[24931430], score=None, time=1603952364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24927670, text='&gt; I&#x27;m guessing one disadvantage is the method of diff is hard-coded into the patch. It would be good to switch to word-diff, or ignore whitespace, but I&#x27;d imagine these could be applied as transformations on the generic format.<p>The plugin I use in Thunderbird can switch between unified, context, and side-by-side diff views based on the same email.  Adding the transformations you mentioned could be done.<p>But one limitation that email has over other review tools is the lack of ability to expand the view of the context within the client.  The only way I could think of is to have git format-patch generate the diff with the entire context included and then have the client limit the display of that context.  But that not have a reasonable fallback for those using clients that aren&#x27;t capable or configured to do that.')
