Seems like every time 1984 is mentioned, you get a comment about &quot;Smith and unreliable narrator&quot;?<p>&gt; Real regimes don&#x27;t mildly torture problematic people and then keep them around at length<p>&quot;Mildly torture&quot;? Did we read the same book? The torture in 1984 was as systematic and torturous as possible. Of course it&#x27;s fiction, but nothing mild about it. Also, death squads are used by regimes that are unstable or fighting for power. Like in afghanistan. The totalitarian state described in 1984 was the opposite of afghanistan - completely secure.<p>Also, Smith wasn&#x27;t in the &quot;real world&quot; with a &quot;real regime&quot;, it&#x27;s fiction. I hope you realize that. He is narrating a fictional world. So it&#x27;s rather absurd to claim that he is an unreliable narrator because he isn&#x27;t narrating the real world. By that logic, every narration in fiction is unreliable and as a consequence makes the claim about unreliable narration absurd.')
