It hasn&#x27;t helped me when i&#x27;ve misunderstood something in our domain. It hasn&#x27;t helped me release &#x2F; distribute a product easier or faster or cheaper. It hasn&#x27;t helped me navigate team dynamics or how to work effectively with others. It hasn&#x27;t helped me write better technical texts.<p>So for some very specific cases, in my career (and i suspect for many business application developers) set theory has been the most useful thing i learned in CompSci. How much of a real world day do i spend using that knowledge? 0.0something% on average.<p>In fairness, It has sometimes helped me get a product finished sooner but this is tenuous at best because i can point to far greater influences from learning how to use specific tools that have helped me get to &quot;done&quot; sooner.<p>The difference between real world developer and CompSci isn&#x27;t necessarily in more effective use of CompSci.')
