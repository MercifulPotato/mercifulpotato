Also, as I understand, it&#x27;s not an uncommon belief among physicists that singularities may just be an artifact of GR being incomplete, kind of like a divide by zero error in the math which doesn&#x27;t necessarily exist in reality.<p>So I don&#x27;t think that poster was questioning established science; I believe there&#x27;s still a lot of open debate and uncertainty about if black hole centers contain infinitely dense singularities or just something that&#x27;s incredibly but finitely dense. No one knows.<p>There is indeed a common form of arrogant layman skepticism that confidently and ignorantly assumes scientists haven&#x27;t thought about [some thing], but I don&#x27;t think this is an example of it.')
