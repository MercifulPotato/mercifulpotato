You&#x27;ve excluded subsidiaries, but what about companies which aren&#x27;t controlled by the larger corp? They can buy hosting from whomever from companies they don&#x27;t control in the slightest, and if there&#x27;s a market for your software it seems likely those would spring up on their own. What do you do?<p>(1) Ignore the problem -- your license has no teeth.<p>(2) Hold the larger corp responsible for payment anyway -- pretty sure this can&#x27;t be accomplished purely within copyright law, and if it can then it&#x27;s still not great because implementation details of the hosting company now matter in terms of the larger company&#x27;s liabilities.<p>(3) Hold the hosting company responsible -- fine enough, that can probably be a valid term in your license. Suppose another company inserts themselves in the middle though; does your license exclude them because they&#x27;re transitively connected to megacorp, or do we again find that your license has no teeth? The first case is an issue because now you&#x27;re exposed to risk from your customers&#x27; customers, over whom you have no control.<p>Not every piece of software can be meaningfully hosted and resold by a chain of corporate entities, but it&#x27;s not exactly an uncommon behavior in the wild either.')
