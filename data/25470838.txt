It seems very hard for them to get good history, climate, science etc info. There&#x27;s a ton of lobbying and targeted marketing and political propaganda to keep the average person non-thinking. To all the above, including diet, it looks simple (just read a book, just Google this and this), but if you don&#x27;t know what to trust because you&#x27;re confused so much at the very foundation and you&#x27;ve been told so much distorted and selective truths and straight up lies, what can you do? People believe homeopathy, pyramid schemes, that it&#x27;s patriotic to go invade the middle east again, that universal health care is communism and free tuition equals gulag, that workers rights are anti business and so anti American, that the Bible is literally true, that a televangelist deserves your money, that drugs are bad mkay, that sex ed is evil etc etc.<p>The food you are fed is just one small way you are exploited.')
