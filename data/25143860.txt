The results are a little different but IMO pretty similar content-wise, nothing jarring. I do see the 5th result you mentioned on yandex missing on google&#x27;s front page, but all of the google results seem pretty relevant, and the link you mentioned seems to be hosted on vice.com, so I&#x27;m not sure if I buy the idea that they&#x27;re trying to hide that link. Has this guy recently done something controversial? Searching his name on both engines he just seems like a regular guy? Why do you think google would be censoring him?')
