Item(by='jlongster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611341518, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25873029, text='I built an app (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;actualbudget.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;actualbudget.com&#x2F;</a>) that uses a local sqlite db and syncs changes, and that&#x27;s exactly how it works. It takes quite a different approach though, using CRDTs to represent changes and those are synced around. When a fresh client comes into play, it downloads the latest sqlite snapshot from a server and then syncs up.')
