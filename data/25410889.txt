Brave passes the content through a privacy-respecting CDN.</i><p>Yes. Brave [EDIT: the company] is unilaterally putting itself between the creator and the consumer, usurping the task of serving the RSS content without the permission of the content owner. Among other problems, this destroys the ability of creators to get even basic readership metrics for people who might choose to use Brave.<p>Imagine that Brave [EDIT: the browser] started copying and serving your entire web site in your name without your permission, rather than just your RSS. Does that help you understand why this is a problem?')
