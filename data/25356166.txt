I can literally have an idea, find the category, identify the specific part, and complete an order in about twenty seconds. (I&#x27;ve done this during a phone call. In the time it took my coworker to articulate the part he was looking for and finish his sentence, I was able to reply &quot;It&#x27;ll be here tomorrow.&quot;)<p>HomeDepot on the other hand sometimes takes 20 or 30 seconds to render the page to the point that I can see prices.

I honestly don&#x27;t understand how a web page can take so long to do anything.')
