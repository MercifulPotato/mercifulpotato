I&#x27;ve found that maintaining synapse is a nightmare. Overall I like matrix, but I have rage quit running it multiple times over the years.<p>I have a 256mb vps. It is running inspircd, atheme, znc, bitlbee, ejabberd, mumble, biboumi, and xmpp.js. Plus some non-communication stuff. I ssh in maybe once a year? I have to actively remember to go check on it because it never gives me problems.<p>I have a 2gb vps that runs synapse. There is always something wrong. Using all of my cpu. Using all of my ram. Using a ton of network. Generally slowing down everything else on the vps. Sometimes synapse crashes or doesn&#x27;t come back up after an update or reboot. I gave up trying to dig through the gigabytes of log files that are produced. Why am I out of disk space? There is a 25gb table in postgresql for synapse that is... I dunno typing events or something. Don&#x27;t worry though there is an api endpoint that might fix it. Good luck. I have 5 users.<p>A year (maybe 2) ago I gave up on federation and I&#x27;m just running synapse with sqlite. There are a lot less but not zero problems.<p>I&#x27;ve actually considered the idea of trying to set up bifrost to log into my xmpp server to use biboumi to connect to bitlbee running purple-matrix so I can join the matrix and synapse rooms on the matrix.org server using my matrix.org account. That fact that I&#x27;ve even thought that is insane. As crazy as it sounds I really do (sorta) actually believe that it might be more stable for me.')
