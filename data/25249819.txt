One, huge thermal capacity for absorbing short bursts of massive heat. Two, the great flexibility of not hanging the radiator directly off of the heat source â€“ which means you can spread the heat across (many) long radiators and they can be cooled by fans running at much lower RPM (that IS quieter than running 1-2 fans at high RPM which is what you get on a tower cooler), you can share the cooling capacity between CPU and GPU, you can have <i>lots</i> more capacity (and without putting stress on PCBs).')
