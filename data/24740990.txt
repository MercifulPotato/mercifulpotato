Painless, and much less hassle (I&#x27;ve been manually building the whole of GNOME on Slackware, after Slackware dropped that a few year prior).<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve reinstalled my workstation&#x27;s Arch instllation ever since (just kept rsyncing to a new drive, when the old one was morally outlived). So Arch itself is great in this respect.<p>The distributed software itself breaks from time to time (it&#x27;s bleeding edge, so that&#x27;s expected), but that&#x27;s not really on Arch Linux, and largely depends on your choice of software. (my DE never failed to run, I use i3wm)<p>The most annoying thing about arch linux is kernel updates remove the currently running kernel&#x27;s modules from the filesystem, so if you hotplug a device that needs a module to be loaded, you&#x27;ll have to reboot first. The systems that keep the previous kernel version installed are a bit better in this respect.<p>So now I load modules for all devices I expect to connect on boot. This makes it less painful.')
