For many speculative investors, the crazy volatility from factors like these is what makes crypto attractive. I see a deeply undervalued long-term value proposition for cryptocurrency, where the big risks for today involve the minefield of manipulation issues that have to be survived to get to the other side where the assets appreciate hugely due to a true valuation mechanism, no longer wanton speculation.<p>In other words, I’ll be happy if bitcoin crashes from Tether (I believe it will, probably to well under $20,000) - that is nothing more than a huge buying opportunity.')
