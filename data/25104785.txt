Screw natural. Nature does a lot of terrible things. People dying in hurricanes or at the hands of murderers isn&#x27;t OK because its &quot;natural&quot; - its just not OK. We have the intelligence to influence our environment (and that intelligence is also a result of nature). Trying to categorize natural vs unnatural (whatever that means) is a fools errand and not a productive one in my view, since my ethics aren&#x27;t based on &quot;it&#x27;s ok because the volcano was natural&quot;')
