Maybe someone can fill me in.<p>To me, Uber seems more like a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers of a particular service (rides).<p>If I sell something on eBay, should eBay consider me an employee and give me benefits? What about if I sell my service on Fiverr or Upwork? How is that Upwork any different than Uber?<p>As an aside, I fell like the whole idea of benefits being tied to employers is a horrible anti-pattern. It reminds me of the old days when you got paid in company dollars to spend at the company store.')
