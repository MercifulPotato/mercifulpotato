I have changed with age; surely the flexibility, inventiveness, and power an individual can constructively wield on his own is highly impacteded by age. Half-dead men should retire, not take office, or consult, at the utmost.<p>This fact is more illustrative of whatever divide the US is under than anything else. It&#x27;s generational conflict. And face it, the American president is <i>not</i> of any generation that has yet to build their future. A waxy president who is full of thought and reflection might not be the wise emperor who is still mighty enough to control the backstabbing theatre that is politics.<p>Effectively, in terms of foreign policy, I think nothing, absolutely nothing will change. From a non-American point of view, Trump did nothing too different from what Clinton would have done, and a Biden will not do something too different from what a Trump would do. Or do what he is told, for that matter.')
