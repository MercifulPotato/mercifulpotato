I&#x27;m the kind who is willing to spend lots of time and a&#x2F;b testing on my campaign (since at the end of the day it&#x27;s the source of my money), but no matter what I do it costs me between 3 and 20 times more on facebook than on google to get the same number of end game sales.<p>It&#x27;s a terrible ad network. When I dabbled in adult toys sales a while back I had to deal with adult networks ads and even THEY were better. Honestly it&#x27;s impressive to me how bad it is.<p>(ads are purely textual and non retargeted, real products or services with great reviews)')
