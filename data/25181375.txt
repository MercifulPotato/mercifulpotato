It&#x27;s precisely the daily commuters not interested in bike mechanics who would need and appreciate the most a physical workshop.  Not the sporty types!  For example here in France there is the Cyclable line of stores [1] that are very explicitly <i>not</i> targeted towards the sport of cycling (you won&#x27;t find any lycra shorts nor carbon frames), but to cycling as a means of transportation.  They seem to be doing quite well.  The bikes that they sell are also quite high-end.  I tried to go there this summer but  the first time I was turned down as I did not have an appointment!<p>[1] www.cyclable.com')
