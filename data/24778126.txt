We hope to address this in multiple ways:\n1) trying to incorporate objective forms of information such as digital and biological data that theoretically should be less biased\n2) giving back to the community by supporting providers who serve underrepresented communities (we provide our software for free or significantly discounted to these community practices and are working with a number of them already)<p>And yes, we aim to incorporate various types of demographic information including social determinants of health.')
