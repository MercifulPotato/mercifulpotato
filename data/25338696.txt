I think you meant &#x27;semi-autonomous cruise control&#x27; as there is no Tesla car that is fully &#x27;self driving&#x27;.<p>As for Uber&#x27;s situation, they had no chance. Mounted losses everywhere caused by the pandemic, government lockdowns and drivers who are now classified as Uber employees make the costs of it all unsustainable for them to justify keeping a &#x27;self-driving unit&#x27;.<p>The only certain and sustainable long term players in this &#x27;self-driving&#x27; or &#x27;cruise control&#x27; game are Tesla and Comma.ai.')
