It&#x27;s very common in academia that many professors spend their entire lifetime in 60-80hr work weeks their entire life.<p>&gt; but the majority of professors would spend most of the midday break meeting each other<p>Spending 60-80 hours in meetings is not &quot;work&quot;. Attending lectures is not &quot;work&quot;. Work requires either mental or physical effort to which all humans have limits. People in academia like to think they work hard by quoting useless hours like this. But that&#x27;s like people billing their bosses for the 2 hours they spend in traffic. From my time in academia, my impression is that most grad students have 1 to 2 hours of productive work per day. They will tell you that they spend 10 hours at the office however.')
