Particularly making the high-tech, fuel efficient ones that are the things airlines actually want, at a unit cost that is not very expensive.<p>Airbus A350 program cost was â‚¬11 billion. Boeing 787 Dreamliner was $32 billion. Bombardier threw in the towel this year and Embraer almost sold to Boeing. Russia has tried to build an airliner for export and failed. So has Japan. You can throw a lot of money at the problem and still never come out on top. And even for the big two times are tough; the 787 program needs 1300-2000 planes to sell to break even. Depending on how you do the accounting Airbus A380 never broke even.<p>Which leads to the other problem; product market fit. Airlines are notoriously fickle and it&#x27;s hard to figure out market fit, particularly if a requesting airline changes its mind after reviewing their strategy or the aircraft&#x27;s characteristics once in production. McDonnell Douglass had to merge with Boeing because the MD-11 was not performing as expected and then nobody wanted to buy it. Lockheed exited the civil aviation business because it nearly bankrupted them after they couldn&#x27;t build a plane to the promised spec. Convair stopped making entire planes after the failure of their 880 and 990 because it turns out &quot;slightly faster but smaller&quot; wasn&#x27;t a real market niche. Everyone got cold feet around Concorde and the various SSTs. And even Airbus almost folded; its first aircraft did not sell anything between December 1975 and May 1977.')
