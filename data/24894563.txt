It&#x27;s hard to see the difference compared to a place like Belgium, although the latter has been dealing with it for longer, and found unique ways to cope with their situation.<p>The race-based division in the U.S. also heavily reinforces differences in culture that would be seen as purely class-based elsewhere, and thus mitigated in many ways - we see this when broadly pro-social cultural values end up associated with so-called &quot;Whiteness&quot; in the U.S., it&#x27;s hard not to see that as a problem.')
