Although bitcoin is somewhat less noisy than it used to be, it is still a volatile and extremely high-risk investment. Whatever merit bitcoin might have on the long-term economic fundamentals, right now bitcoin is mostly a speculative instrument, or an investment on computing technology.<p>You do not want to put your savings into something where the price has repeatedly dropped &gt; 60% in a single week.
