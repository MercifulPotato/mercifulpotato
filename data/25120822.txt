Engineers that have no concept of encapsulation and use globals all over the place. Engineers that have no concept of perf. Engineers that can&#x27;t ship and noodle the same piece of code for weeks that others would have finished and moved on in a 1&#x2F;10th the time. Engineers that are all talk no work.<p>That last type sticks out where the engineer would basically walk around and stop at people&#x27;s desks and talk their ears off but never actually finish any code. People complained. The boss said &quot;they have a family so I don&#x27;t want to fire them&quot;.  I don&#x27;t know how to answer that.')
