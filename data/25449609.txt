Emacs works great under XWayland but Chromium HW video acceleration doesn&#x27;t.<p>Emacs is a community project whereas Chromium has billions poured into it. Even Wine&#x27;s getting Wayland support now and that ran under XWayland fine.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that unfair. Firefox on Linux is just better.
