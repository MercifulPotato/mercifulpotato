(Actually there&#x27;s no problem generating YAML either, but I suppose it&#x27;s easier to think about.)<p>Example: I changed my own configs to use .yml.in and .yml and it worked on both Travis CI and sourcehut.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;.builds" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;.builds</a><p>Some brainstorming here on this feature:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Config-Dialect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Config-Dialect</a><p>The benefit would be that it would validate your syntax and possibly your schema locally, not remotely.  Some services have command line tools, but I&#x27;m sure they don&#x27;t validate your shell, only the configuration.<p>Another benefit is the ability to reuse code and configuration.  For example, my .builds&#x2F; dir has a fair bit of redundancy in its configuration, and that could be &quot;factored&quot; with a real language.  YAML has a limited &lt;&lt; reference mechanism that does some of this.<p>I&#x27;m looking for feedback on Oil, as well as the YAML + shell replacement idea.  I hope that Oil can be a flexible language that will let people write these sorts of front ends for many cloud services, i.e. &quot;distributed shell scripts&quot;.  And eventually enable portability across clouds too.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Where-To-Send-Feedback" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Where-To-Send-Feedback</a>')
