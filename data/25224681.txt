That&#x27;s something that can get picked up at code review and taught. Not everyone is going to code by default at the style of a company but they can learn to do the things the company wants.<p>&gt;Then there is the obivous, lets test people for things they aren&#x27;t going to do. Google and co made this the in thing and the fact we now have books upon books just designed so people who are good at tech can pass a tech interview is a sign in itself that there is something rotten.<p>So which is it? Should interviews be related to the work at the job or not? The Google type interviews evolved precisely from the philosophy in your first paragraph I quoted: that a lot of domain knowledge can be learned easily and that it was most important to test for more fundamental knowledge and abilities as well as general problem solving skills.<p>Ultimately I think it&#x27;s a lot easier to criticize the interview process than to come up with a good alternative, as well as establishing some basic criteria about what should be selected for and against. Not that I think Google style interviews are perfect or anything, mind.')
