I would rather spend my time implementing functionality than regenerating and recompiling code from proto files. The large projects you mention often have something most projects don&#x27;t: a well-defined data model and interface that has been heavily iterated and evolved over time. At that point things like backwards compatibility, auto docs, and performance become more important, and gRPC can be more useful.<p>You only get a certain number of complexity tokens and IMO it&#x27;s not worth spending any here.')
