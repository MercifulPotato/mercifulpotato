If the youtube-dl author is not from the USA (I think he&#x27;s from the EU), that would expose him to legal risk.<p>(As a non-USA person, to me this is the most evil part of the DMCA take-down system: even a defective DMCA notice leads to a dilemma, either you keep the content offline, or you risk being sued in a foreign jurisdiction you have no control over. This is also why I believe one should always prefer to host in one&#x27;s own country, so that any dispute can be resolved by the local courts.)')
