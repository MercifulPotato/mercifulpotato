SQLite is built-in, of course.<p>One key feature Wapp is that identical code can be run as<p>+ CGI from Apache<p>+ SCGI from Nginx<p>+ As its own stand-alone webserver<p>So, for development work on your desktop you run it as a standalone webserver.  It even pops up its root page in your webbrowser automatically when you launch it.  Then, once you get things working there, you &quot;scp&quot; the one small source-code file that implements your application up into a CGI-enabled directory of you server, and is just works.')
