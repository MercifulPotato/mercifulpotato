We&#x27;re getting lost in the technicalities here but private companies providing services doesn&#x27;t displace public infrastructure or eliminate the need for state ownership and oversight.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that a single state-run provider isn&#x27;t a great model for most things, even critical things like utilities. The state can own the rights and build the things that only the state can, while the rest can be leased, shared, operated and maintained by multiple private organizations that compete to offer the best service without the regulatory incumbency.<p>Allowing use in return for upkeep and updates is a well-known model in many industries, especially real estate. It can be applied to the public sector easily. We&#x27;re slowly seeing things change as private enterprise finds new ways like hyperlocal co-ops and distributed infrastructure like solar power, but there&#x27;s still much more progress that can be made.')
