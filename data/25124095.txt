Ideologically, it&#x27;s cousins with Qt.<p>I don&#x27;t think Swing&#x27;s MVC strategy worked out. It was worth trying. But maybe 40%-50% of the framework could be safely removed.<p>Some kind of DSL would be nice. JavaFX ain&#x27;t it. In my own noodling, Swing&#x27;s UI component hierarchy needed to be refactored to be fully composable. By the time I created enough shims to make Swing truly composable, I wish I&#x27;d started from scratch. (I haven&#x27;t done Swing work in ages, so maybe this happened.)<p>An event loop is the biggest thing missing from Swing and other UI toolkits of that era. Meaning all modifications are handled by the framework, no client code (or non event loop threads) can modify the UI. My bestie George Smith&#x27;s Juipeter (?) took the Win32 API approach, preserving the Swing API and all dispatch was handled under the hood. This is kinda how a browser&#x27;s event loop is implemented. I much prefer an exposed event loop and Command objects. (It&#x27;s easier to stepwise debug. Every desktop app I&#x27;ve ever created also had Undo&#x2F;Redo; so you&#x27;re gonna do Command objects one way or another.) And then make the framework pretty with some kind of DSL over the top.<p>Sadly, though inspired, I think Swing&#x27;s LookAndFeel plumbing proved unnecessary. Sun believed everyone who said it mattered. Maybe it did for a while. But the world moved on. I still have no firm opinions on how I&#x27;d make an app reskinnable. (I should probably look to see what Qt&#x27;s doing these days.)<p>Edit: I didn&#x27;t mention AWT&#x2F;Swing layout managers. Just peeked at Google&#x2F;JetBrains Compose. Meh. I like that it uses Kotlin; less syntactic vinegar than Java. Alas, Compose repeats the mistake of not separating out the layout code. After doing way too much layout code -- some Australians did a hysterical GridBagLayout rage meme video, back in the day -- The Correct Answer[tm] is custom layout managers. Still include some stock managers in the JDK. And make the layout hooks API easier to implement and debug.')
