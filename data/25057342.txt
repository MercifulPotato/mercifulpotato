This is a lot of money for mere mortals like us, but small potatoes for the CEO of a major multinational company.<p>I find hard to believe he would risk an insider trading lawsuit over this amount, so my conclusion is that this was simply a prescheduled transaction. Have in mind that the increase will stick around for some time (stock still up ~8% since last week) so he would have benefitted anyway selling many days afterwards, or even weeks.')
