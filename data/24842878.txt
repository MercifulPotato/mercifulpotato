Item(by='HeyLaughingBoy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603232077, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24835055, text='&gt; I think it&#x27;s a slap to the face of a lot of teachers doing their best, as well as their students, to say that kids in disadvantaged districts learn nothing other than how to sit still and listen to authority<p>I have to agree. In fact, I was explicitly told as much by my high school Physics teacher after I openly said that I thought the school&#x27;s &quot;Excellence Program&quot; wasn&#x27;t particularly challenging.<p>His take was that he realized that it was easy for me, but there were some teachers who were trying as hard as they could to give the students a good education while the rest dismissed us as being a bunch of unreachable ghetto kids that they were wasting their time on. Sure, I was a 17 year-old punk kid but he was right: I was basically crapping on the people who were trying to make a difference and at the same time putting down a lot of my classmates who were working as hard as they could to get good grades, many of them in very difficult life circumstances.<p>I guess I don&#x27;t have a point other than to say I agree with yours :-)')
