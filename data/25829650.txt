Steppers are cheap and ridiculously easy to interface and get good positional control out of. As long as they don&#x27;t skip steps. And they <i>always</i> do. So you end up running at 1&#x2F;10th of the speed your tool could move at to avoid that, and even then you&#x27;ll end up tossing workpieces because you lost synchronization somewhere along the line.<p>For 3D printers they work fine because there is no pushback (&#x27;loading&#x27;) from the extruder. But for anything that cuts servos are the way to go if you want half decent speed and quality cuts, as well as long tool life.')
