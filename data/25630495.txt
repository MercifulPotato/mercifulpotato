I don&#x27;t think so.<p>Maybe Zoom and MS Teams offer(ed) a better fidelity. For one thing, Zoom lets you share desktop audio along with the screen. In fact, apparently these days, Jitsi can do that too, that definitely wasn&#x27;t possible when I tried it early last year. At that time, at least, the experience OBS -&gt; Jitsi was definitely much better than just Jitsi. (And note that all of this was in Linux.)')
