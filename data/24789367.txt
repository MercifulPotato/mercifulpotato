If you haven&#x27;t done the experiments, how do you know the safety of the vaccines and the likelihood of becoming infertile or dying?<p>I&#x27;m not saying most of that isn&#x27;t misinformation, because I don&#x27;t know. What I <i>am</i> saying is that I don&#x27;t trust YouTube to make that determination.')
