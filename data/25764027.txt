It&#x27;s much lower level than this, in that it is actually implementing your design in real hardware (consisting of lookup tables &#x2F; logic gates &#x2F; memory cells, etc. all &quot;wired&quot; together.<p>As such, they can be useful not only for implementing some custom bits of glue logic (e.g. interfaces which need high speed serialization &#x2F; deserialization of data), or accelerating a particular calculation, but also for anywhere you need to have really deterministic performance in a way that isn&#x27;t easy or even possible to do in software &#x2F; an emulator alone.')
