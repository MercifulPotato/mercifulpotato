I wasn&#x27;t in charge of desktop support, but I knew the guys. They didn&#x27;t care for it either, it was policy from a high level in a company that, as a whole, did look down on IT.  One of my coworkers actually went through the whole process of talking and negotiating to try to get a Win2K laptop instead of having W95 forced on it. No luck.<p>And, if anyone has been wondering, yes, there was hardware in the brand-new laptop that W95 didn&#x27;t support. It &quot;worked&quot; with a generic fallback driver but lost some of the functionality that made the laptop worth buying.')
