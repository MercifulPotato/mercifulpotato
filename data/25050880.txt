An actual <i>discussion</i> occurred rather than a congratulatory twitter echo chamber.<p>I&#x27;m actually a really disappointed in Josh&#x27;s response. I thought that his open stance on what he&#x27;d been doing would mean he&#x27;d being open to people criticising what he&#x27;d done. He doesn&#x27;t need to agree with that criticism, but dismissing the whole site as toxic based on that disagreement just feels flippant.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen and participated in, the discussion mostly centered around whether this was a good deal for everyone involved and whether or not a greater proportion of a company&#x27;s success should be attributed to it&#x27;s employees.   At least in my eyes very little of it focused on Josh personally.')
