If you would like to make an impact in the &quot;buy for life&quot; arena, I suggest you carefully select your vendors to actually produce items that <i>are</i> worthy of that label. Quality builds a reputation over time via word of mouth, not via online reviews.<p>(This might still be a workable approach if you can give trusted reviewers a platform to highlight what they consider the best &amp; most reliable, but you&#x27;ll still need to vet those reviewers carefully)')
