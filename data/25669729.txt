Item(by='incrudible', descendants=None, kids=[25670484], score=None, time=1610017922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25666469, text='&gt; Your entire analysis is a guesstimate based on sociology&#x2F;behavioural economics&#x2F;anthropology&#x2F; and not medicine.<p>The analysis that simple cloth masks &quot;work&quot; is a guesstimate based on physics and not medicine - or at least it was at the time.<p>Absent scientific data, the best we can do is to use reason to effectively make a guess.<p>&gt; WHO has no competence whatsoever to judge on that basis, and as far as I know they haven&#x27;t consulted with anyone who does.<p>That sounds questionable, epidemiology certainly does have human behavior as a component of study.<p>&gt; If they had bothered to consult with actual experts, they&#x27;d tell them that humans can be communicated with if one picks the right words.<p>I find the &quot;appeal to anonymous experts&quot; argument unconvincing. What kind of experts are we talking about? Communications experts? PR people? Isn&#x27;t it their <i>job</i> to make you believe that communication is possible? To sell you a workshop on how to talk to people?<p>Speaking from personal experience with at-risk individuals, it took a lot of effort to <i>presumably</i> convince people that simple cloth masks do not protect <i>them</i>. People are desperate to hear that a low-effort intervention will save them from peril. It&#x27;s a strong confirmation bias effect.<p>&gt; Even now, in no place with a mask mandate has there been an increase in human contact.<p>How would you be able to tell? What&#x27;s your baseline? Even in areas without a mandate, people are free to wear masks or hold the belief that &quot;my mask protects me&quot;.')
