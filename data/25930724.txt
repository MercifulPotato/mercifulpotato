If I buy an option, I actually intend to exercise it or hold it until expiration, not hedge with it.<p>If I bought a GameStop put today, for the pricing in my post above, it would be because I was willing to make a strong bet that GameStop&#x27;s intrinsic value in November would remain below $60&#x2F;share and that I was fairly sure the market would return to its senses by then.  How the option-seller reaches her offering price is entirely irrelevant to me.<p>It is true that much of the pricing of options comes from volatility, but for me, as a buyer, it is perhaps irrelevant.<p>Thanks for your perspective, though. I&#x27;ll read your link with interest.')
