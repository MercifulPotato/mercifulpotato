These are reasonable choices. I haven&#x27;t cherry picked them, e.g. I included Germany and excluded Czechia.<p>This is 335M people and 2331 deaths.<p>That is AT LEAST DOUBLE the current daily death rate in the USA.<p>There are many other ways of grouping European countries to achieve the same outcome, which is to show that contrary to the original commenter&#x27;s position, <i>right now</i>, the USA is <i>not</i> the <i>worst hit</i> place on Earth, if you measure the problem by the <i>number of people who are currently dying every day</i>. I live here and that is the number that matters the most.<p>Here is my original comment, which is totally consistent with the numbers above (with the exception of Germany as an individual nation, but this is irrelevant as it&#x27;s now in the aggregate):<p>&quot;This is not correct. If you adjust for population size, most of highly-developed Europe is doing much worse than the USA right now. That includes Germany, Switzerland, etc.&quot;<p>Of course you can select many other ways of grouping the data and many other ways of choosing the numbers to achieve the outcome you want. That is not relevant to the point I have been making.<p>Thanks for the discussion.')
