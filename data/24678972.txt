We can see stars across the galaxy (and, indeed, in other galaxies), so by using some large fraction of a star&#x27;s energy this should be possible.<p>We&#x27;re not far from having the telescope technology that enables us to spectrally sample the atmospheres of extrasolar planets to detect gases that are associated with life (as <i>we</i> know it) and even of technological civilizations (e.g. chlorofluorocarbons). This is a form of SETI too. Using such technology, an alien civilization could beam signals to selected planets that show such signs and save the energy of broadcasting omnidirectionally.<p>The purpose of SETI is not necessarily to confirm such possibilities (my opinion is that civilizations like us are really rare at this stage of the Universe&#x27;s evolution - maybe less than one per galaxy). But at least to rule them out.')
