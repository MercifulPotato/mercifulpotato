Most people will never know - they just consume TV, radio or tabloids and believe everything they hear&#x2F;read.<p>- If you don&#x27;t institutionalize independence, it is <i>gone</i>.<p>- People in Germany and even more so in Austria have no idea how valuable public stations are. In Austria in particular it is a growing trend to criticize and even <i>ridicule</i> public stations - and this sentiment was gladly picked up and fueled by populists. They regularly demand that ORF is defunded - simply because they cannot control their unfavorable reporting on them - and they would like to. They were in the last government and they put &quot;their guys&quot; in every possible position to ensure control. They are still there and undermining the principles from within, trying to slowly destroy the ORF as a whole - either from incompetence or malice, who knows?')
