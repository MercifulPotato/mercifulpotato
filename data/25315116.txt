Here&#x27;s a quick attempt:<p>Track record: 8888 has been running for more than ten years.<p>Popularity: It appears to be incredibly widely used; e.g. a research paper from 2013 claimed it was serving 7% of all end user DNS queries, and Wikipedia claims that in 2018 it answered a trillion DNS requests per day (i.e. 10M qps).<p>Business value: It is true that there is no direct revenue here. But I&#x27;m pretty sure that the original reason for launching it was defensive. A lot of Google&#x27;s networking projects have clearly been driven by trying to ensure that users can connect straight and reliable to Google&#x27;s services with no interference from middleboxes, since every request lost to interference is also lost ad revenue.<p>Crappy ISP DNS servers that serve spam pages instead of NXDOMAIN are a pretty big vector here.')
