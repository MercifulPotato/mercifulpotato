Of course, if you want to be good at maths, you will have to remember things because you can&#x27;t always look up or re-derive every smallest detail (and because you have to become good at pattern-matching at some point). But the memory tends to work best if it&#x27;s activated by deliberate practice. For example, instead of memorising a proof line-by-line it&#x27;s much better to try to remember the key points and then practicing filling in the gaps. If necessary, repeat this process several times. When I was studying for ODEs, I tried to re-derive many of the standard techniques by trying to remember which trick to apply instead of trying to memorise the formula.')
