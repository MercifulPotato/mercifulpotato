It never publishes any good thing about india and belittles any progress made by India. It should appreciate that even passing the farm bill by the govt which is in majority, it is ready to negotiate. This is true democracy where just for the sake of 1-2 states, govt has  put the reforms on hold.<p>People should also understand that there is also foreign funding involved behind these protests for Khalistan movement which has nothing to do with the protests. Western media esp. Washington Post, BBC and NYTimes usually publishes articles against the current govt.')
