Which, yes, is incredibly valuable. I recently adapted my learning process from tutorials to taking a problem I already know how to solve with a different language or tool and solving it with something new. It frees the mind space required to define a problem space, figure out process, etc., and allows me to focus on learning how to do that thing with <i>this</i> tool. Then if I&#x27;m attempting something I don&#x27;t really understand, I&#x27;ll use tools I understand well.')
