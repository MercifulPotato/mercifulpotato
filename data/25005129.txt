Yes it go&#x27;s to homeless shelters and other charities&#x2F;programs. We sometimes forget that not all homeless are chronic homeless which is what most people associate as homeless.<p>Someone may be having hard times making rent and go to a church or other organization for financial help and other services. Battered women, at risk children also exist and may require a shelter with more security or women only shelters - which are funded too. There are many other services that exist that use that funding.<p>I didn&#x27;t see waste. Actually, I would go so far as say most charities that receive federal and state funding rely on reporting to receive those grants and funding and things are very transparent. HMIS is the tech side of things that build the systems to track and report on everything.')
