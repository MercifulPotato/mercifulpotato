Because &quot;public transportation&quot; has never come up in any conversation I have had with an average immigrant.<p>This is an anecdote but I think it&#x27;s illustrative. I met a cab driver in Texas who immigrated from Morocco. He was extolling the virtues of Texas. He and his cab driver friends had been able to buy 3BR houses with pools on their cab driver incomes, put their kids in decent schools, etc. If you go to East Texas, you see tons of working class Latinos who work solid jobs in the booming oil and chemical industries there. It&#x27;s not fancy, but you see brand new strip malls, shiny new pickup trucks, and big families everywhere. Tons of middle class prosperity among the immigrant population.<p>I&#x27;m from Bangladesh, and while my parents immigrated to the U.S. under pretty good circumstances (my dad has a white collar job), not everyone in my family did. And their view of achieving &quot;the American Dream&quot; is very much in line with what this Moroccan cab driver was saying. They want a big house and good schools for their kids. America provides that, including to immigrants. 75% of lawful immigrants have health insurance, mostly through their employer, or through Medicare&#x2F;Medicaid&#x2F;ACA. (The rate is over 90% for native-born Americans.) The median size of a new house in the United States is over 2,600 square feet. (Half of Latinos own their own homes, despite a median age of just 30, over 14 years younger than the median age of whites.) The median price of a new car in America is $38,000. This is what most Americans, and most working-class immigrants to America, consider the &quot;American Dream.&quot; &quot;Public transportation&quot; is something that only a minority of college-educated elite actually think is a good thing.')
