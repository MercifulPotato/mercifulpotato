Then during the shelter in place period I installed a Arch on my desktop (which normally runs Windows for Photoshop, etc) just to experiment a little with ZFS on Linux, etc. Then I started using it more and more and now I rarely use my mac again. (note that I&#x27;m not new to linux, had been using it both on the desktop and the server for a very long time and my work laptop runs linux).<p>However, unlike you, I don&#x27;t use many Apple-only tools mostly just Things and Bear. I haven&#x27;t found replacements for those, but as they never were a critical part of what I do, it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal to just drop them.')
