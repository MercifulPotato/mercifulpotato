Ropes are ideal for editing sessions, where you have a sequence of small edits on a large string. But if the string is small, just storing it contiguously is simpler and faster.<p>They&#x27;re also good for forming larger strings by concatenating smaller ones. But if you can structure your code so that it just appends to a buffer, for example, by threading a mutable string buffer reference through function calls rather than returning strings, that&#x27;s also faster.<p>So, as with most such tradeoffs, it depends on what you&#x27;re trying to do.')
