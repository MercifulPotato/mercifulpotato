If the original inventor doesn’t license or sell the product then owning the patent is literally worthless.  Unfortunately, that requires a skilled patent office to reject trivial  patents,  but not minor but ingenious  improvements.  Which is in practice an unrealistic standard.<p>However, I think the balance generally works in the other direction. 20 years feels excessive, but it’s arguably fast enough that taking something from a lab to mass production often eats up 1&#x2F;2 the time.  Further, many patents that are obvious like asteroid mining are going to expire long before their practical.  On the other hand simply waiting out the clock to manufacture something means being really behind, thus pushing licensing.')
