The monsters are roughly the same, so it isn&#x27;t hard to run an AD&amp;D adventure on 5e. I would argue a &quot;novice&quot; DM could read through an AD&amp;D adventure and do the translation on the fly.</i><p>I would agree you should be able to run the module as-is and insert a monster of the same type from the 5e monster manual, but certainly not use the 1e stats straight up.<p>1e monsters wouldn&#x27;t stand a chance against a 5e party otherwise.')
