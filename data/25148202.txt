Ryzen&#x27;s big advantage over previous multicore implementations was infinity fabric - so clearly there&#x27;s more to scaling than just the actual compute cores.<p>Don&#x27;t forget that scaling up is also not just about frequencies, there are also packaging considerations - the CPU dies have to actually be able to dissipate the heat generated, and the package itself has to be able to do so as well. I&#x27;d expect that this is something AMD and especially Intel have a leg up over Apple with - although, considering they&#x27;ve already tread that ground it makes Apple&#x27;s job a bit easier too.')
