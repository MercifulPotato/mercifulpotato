They advocate their beliefs, still want to reduce human suffering, still consider opposing views with respect.<p>I hate ambulance chase style reporting. So I most like the magazine-style news recap of current events, giving stuff 1-4 weeks to settle down before picking over the wreckage. None of the USA imitators have ever done as well (Newsweek).<p>I don&#x27;t like unsigned bylines, but I get that&#x27;s their thing.<p>With so many poor imitators, their dry wit (editorial voice) now just sounds snarky. I&#x27;m so done with it. As a Gen X, Boomers and my fellow Gen X exhaust me.<p>I canceled my subscription over their support for the second Iraq War. I can carry a grudge. I haven&#x27;t resumed The Atlantic for the same reason.<p>But I&#x27;ve since filled my attention budget with more left leaning content. Neoliberalism had it&#x27;s day. I&#x27;m interested in what comes next. Not becoming a curmudgeon yelling at the kids to get off my lawn. So I doubt I&#x27;ll ever resub to The Economist.<p>I do miss the both special topic and the regional focus issues.')
