Item(by='flavio81', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604001646, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24917642, text='&gt;80% of Common Lisp.<p>So, does it include bit-arrays, custom hash tables, multimethods, method combinations, the condition-restarts signalling system, ability to place items on the stack instead of on the garbage collector, type declarations that enable speed optimizations, saving the running state to disk, and upgrading the instances of a class to a new class?<p>I don&#x27;t want to be smug, but 80% is a bold claim. Again, I think Eslisp is useful and maybe i&#x27;ll try to introduce it to my team (they&#x27;re all JS&#x2F;TS developers) to see if they get the GATEWAY DRUG to Lisp.')
