This solution (if used) was better than flying blind and cost these governments nothing. It&#x27;s not fair to pretend a government would not welcome contact tracing as-is if it helped provide a tool to stop the spread. Not everything a government does is out to surveil you, they have to still provide some other functions.<p>After a lid is on things though - yeah, maybe. Maybe they&#x27;ll try to flip this, but not while their pants are down.')
