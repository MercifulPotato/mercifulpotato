Also lack of sleep causes many ailments in me.<p>I am definitely sad and angry when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, on top of not having enough energy. If I have a headache, taking a nap or sleeping longer always fixes it for me. If I have aches in my thighs and calves, taking a nap or going to bed early and catching 8+ hours of sleep fixes it right up.')
