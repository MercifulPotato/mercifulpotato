Oh, because they had to write around this condition of their granting agency.&quot; The US has tons of public funding as well, but much of it is defence driven, which has more general reusable business applicability than say, &quot;culture,&quot; driven. Not sure what the solutions are, but something we should put words to as that weirdness has been a ceiling on growth and opportunity here for a couple of decades.')
