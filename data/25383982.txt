Try using Google Maps logged out on an Android phone for more than a week. Google will find a way to reconnect you to the default Google account on the device.<p>An even better test:<p>- get an Android device (say, a OnePlus 6T)<p>- create some contacts on the phone, and add a few events in the default calendar<p>- open the Play Store (required to get many of the most popular apps)<p>- you&#x27;re required to logged into a Google account<p>- log in and try to <i>not</i> have your contacts and calendar events uploaded to Google&#x27;s servers.<p>That is not possible, because<p>1. you must be connected to the Internet in order to log into a Google account (obvious)<p>2. Google does not let you enable or disable the sync for a particular item before starting uploading everything<p>3. Google will enable the sync for all possible items (starting w&#x2F; contacts) in the background, and you cannot switch screens fast enough to prevent that.<p>This must have been the default for most Android devices for a decade now. They keep collecting billions contacts details without users&#x27; explicit consent, which is 100% illegal.')
