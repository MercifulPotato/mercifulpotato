It&#x27;s not exactly continuous. I believe it lets me get a glucose reading as often as every 8 minutes. When I had to do finger sticks I would test my glucose an average of 4 times a day. With my new monitor I&#x27;m measuring an average of 20 times a day, without the pain of finger sticks. Inserting the sensor is almost completely painless, and I only have to do it every two weeks. Current CGM devices may not be &quot;revolutionary&quot;, but they are a hell of a lot better than what I used to deal with.')
