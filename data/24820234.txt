Despite their heavy leanings to Democrats, the raw number of votes in these markets and the cost to reach a voter still makes them competitive areas.<p>Such a shift in election method would likely move the &#x27;center&#x27; of the US presidential political system towards issues that dominate the large metro markets. This further alienates rural voters and less populous states, making Senate policy less representative of the US voter.')
