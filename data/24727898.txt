It is a political choice.\nHere a definition of apolitical: &quot;not interested or involved in politics&quot;<p>&gt; Serving coffee is not political.<p>Which coffee do you serve? If you don&#x27;t care, you are apolitical, but you can either serve coffee with child labour or not.<p>&gt; Planning the network installation is not political.<p>So, it will include equipment from Huawei? Or Cisco?<p>&gt; Code reviews,<p>If someone puts in there a &quot;joke&quot;, do you address it? Should you?<p>&gt; cleaning your office, optimizing the VM,<p>Yeah, probably not.<p>&gt; getting a bandwidth deal, negotiating the SaaS pricing, choosing ingredients for the new dish,<p>To which standard do you hold your suppliers? Are they subscribing to any social corporate responsibility standard? Are you? Are you trying to make a vegan dish or not? (Not that I care, I am apolitical there, but I do not think, it is not political)<p>&gt; figuring out how many loads of gravel are needed for the landfill,<p>Probably not.<p>&gt; picking a guy to fix the fence ..<p>Are you rejecting the guy who has a MAGA bumper on his truck?<p>&gt; Google search is barely political,<p>Really? There was just recently a case of republicans complaining about how they are ranked. What about Google in China? Or Hong Kong?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s 100% fine for you to &#x27;work on something consistent with your political views&#x27; but at the same time just &#x27;pick the place&#x27; instead of &#x27;making the place&#x27; inherently political.<p>Here I think, I can understand that you want to say, that all the points I just made, are likely to be unproductive to be discussed at the workplace. And I would agree.\nYou may say, you are tired of hearing those issues, and I can understand.<p>But I would say, one doesn&#x27;t make a place inherently political, it is. Being apolitical doesn&#x27;t make it go away, that decisions have an impact on the public affairs of a country. In a small and intangible way probably, but so does a vote.')
