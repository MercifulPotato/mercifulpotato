TTBA. SSKLR.  URA.  PIIY. What the hell?<p>Both are awful.  Please please please if you are responsible for naming something at your work, please choose something descriptive.<p>E.g. instead of picking something &quot;clever&quot; or &quot;cool&quot; like &quot;Boudicca Project&quot; or &quot;Skylark&quot; or some useless acronym like &quot;CTITT&quot; please call your mundane CRM system something meaningful like &quot;Customer Management Tools&quot; or something understandable without knowing the backstory (e.g. &quot;we called it Team Sofa because it replaced and old CouchDB instance, and everyone used to hangout on our sofa in our office when we did meetings - duh&quot;) and easily searchable.<p>Future users and engineers trying to figure things out will thank you.')
