I would&#x27;ve figured something big would&#x27;ve happened right now with the antics that are up, but here we are - necessary to download an _opt-out_ extension for Google Analytics. This couldn&#x27;t be a more blatant disregard for the EU laws than I could imagine. \nAnd at the same time here in the Netherlands we have the party responsible for enforing laws handing out one, almost disproportionally large fine, to a small organisation each year. Like a 800k fine to a tennis unity because they were too aggressive in their data grievance, while all the big guys are still going at it and then some. Sorry for the rant but it&#x27;s hard to stay optimistic, so seeing something like Github making a good move in the right direction, and seeing the post of plausible.io on the front page, this seems like a good day on the front of privacy.')
