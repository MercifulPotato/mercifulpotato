It&#x27;s in the interest of every firm to pay its workers as little as possible, but it&#x27;s in the interest of the broader economy that most people can afford to buy goods and services. Every employee&#x27;s wage is ultimately some other firm&#x27;s income; keeping the game going requires that enough people are paid enough money to be able to spend it on things other than absolute essentials.<p>Even minimum wage workers have to pay for the basic necessities of life at prices that are largely set on the basis of what the median worker can afford. If minimum wages erode, minimum wage workers can&#x27;t afford to live. This is a both a humanitarian concern and an economic problem because starving people don&#x27;t make good employees, and people who don&#x27;t have money can&#x27;t buy goods and services from other firms. Every person who is pushed out of the economy in this way is an economic loss as they are no longer contributing to economic demand or producing goods&#x2F;services with their own hands.<p>In a society with a social safety net, under-paid workers are also a cost to government as they will not pay taxes and will be due social assistance payments&#x2F;transfers to help cover their costs for food and shelter. Further, underpaid workers may also pose a crime problem (in part because starving people will steal food), which imposes direct costs on crime victims and costs to government for police, prosecution, and corrections.<p>Underpaying workers benefits firms that do it, but the practice harms the overall economy and imposes externalities on others. Preventing this is why minimum wage laws exist and should keep up with the cost of living.')
