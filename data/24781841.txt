Companies, all companies, the &quot;good&quot; and the &quot;evil&quot;, will <i>only</i> ever engage in activism that is not a threat to their bottom line. Given that constraint, it means the activism is incredibly cheap in my opinion.<p>I mean, look at all the recent BLM support from large corporations. I mean, on one hand I&#x27;m glad to see them doing this. On the other, I know the only reason they are doing this is because it&#x27;s pretty easy for them - it&#x27;s largely already supported by their employees and the bulk of their customers see it positively. I can guarantee if it could negatively affect their long term prospects they wouldn&#x27;t have done it.<p>For example, I remember quite clearly that in the late 80s and early 90s you&#x27;d hear nary a peep of support on LGBT issues from corporations, and even some of the more progressive companies had to do it with coded language (language gays understood but straight people were oblivious to). It was only when gay rights were already largely supported did corporations jump on the bandwagon.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying this is totally a bad thing, but I do think it is a cheap, easy thing. And if you know a company is never willing to do the hard thing, why put any weight into its opinions on these topics in the first place?')
