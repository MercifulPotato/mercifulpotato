The <i>Facts</i> AKA barely plausible bullshit is being served to anyone who wants to believe in an alternate yet more interesting reality fitting their own beliefs.<p>Social media has given everyone a soap box, a megaphone and a repeater and the ability to piggyback on other people&#x27;s shouting directly into people&#x27;s ears and eyes.  Do you think this is a good thing?  No one is vetting anyone seriously, no one is being consistently judged on their honesty, accuracy, track record or motives.<p>It&#x27;s not entirely about being dumb, more and more it&#x27;s turning out to be about how much time people are able to commit to understanding what they&#x27;re reading.  This is why people are known as experts in the first place.  Do you really think everyone is capable enough to handle the highly nuanced planning and decision making necessary for governing millions of people on the balance of thousands of existing laws and regulations?<p>Sometimes you can&#x27;t boil information down into something that everyone can understand in a short enough amount of time which would be what is necessary for each person to play a role in democracy.  Just like we pay someone to fix our plumbing we should be paying our politicians to figure this stuff out for us.<p>We don&#x27;t have the time or attention span.  It&#x27;s impossible.')
