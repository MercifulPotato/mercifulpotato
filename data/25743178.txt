Item(by='exmadscientist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610433201, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25742453, text='You&#x27;d think that he&#x27;d be better at interpreting IC markings  by now, though....<p>Part 1 is not &quot;ICFJ&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;CFJ&quot;. The line is the pin 1 marking. This one is the harder of the two; however, if you&#x27;ve been doing this a while, you&#x27;d recognize this SOT23-5 as coming from TI, whose online marking code lookup returns &quot;SN74LVC1G14DCK&quot; in just a few seconds. (Incidentally, that means the actual marking is &quot;CF&quot; with a lot&#x2F;date code marker of &quot;J&quot;; the random-looking lines above and below the text are also a lot or date mark.) No acid needed!<p>Part 2 isn&#x27;t marked &quot;COOR&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;C00&quot; with lot&#x2F;date code &quot;R&quot;. That&#x27;s decodeable by eye as a TI LVC2G00 dual NAND gate.<p>The third part, the one marked &quot;JW&quot;, is <i>probably</i> an ON Semiconductor dual transistor, but those guys are always harder to track down. The fourth one, the SOT-323 (?) marked &quot;39R&quot;... that one will be hardest of all.')
