With the news that Apple&#x27;s M1 chip uses on-die memory that is part of the chip itself, and seeing how amazing the performance of this can be, it stands to reason that other ARM based chips (such as the Ampere Altra and other server-focused chips) might eventually follow. Does this make the traditional memory companies secular losers over the long term (at least in memory-- they also make NAND and other chips)? If so, how long will this transition take?')
