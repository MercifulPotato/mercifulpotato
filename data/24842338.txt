If Python weren’t so slow, there wouldn’t be such a heavy reliance on C extensions in the ecosystem, and consequently it would be easier to optimize CPython and PyPy because there would be less at stake with respect to breaking the ecosystem. Not only that, but lots of other things get better if C-extensions go away: much less need for executable project files which dramatically improves package manager performance (no need to recursively download a package and run setup.py to determine the next level of dependencies just to build the dependency tree), packaging gets dramatically easier (C projects have no standard reproducible build system so every C project including C extension projects must have its own package recipe and it’s often impractical to support more than a handful of target systems), etc.<p>Hpy appears to be the right approach to fixing this, but there needs to be a concerted effort to migrate the ecosystem toward it and then deprecate the old expansive interface. And then at some point in the distant future we can expect things to be as nice as other ecosystems are today.')
