Banning people&#x2F;companies over tweets, urgh. But whereas many westerners view this as a morality&#x2F;value issue (&quot;censorship bad&quot;) I see this as clumsiness, and generally being bad at understanding western perspectives. The way they behave wrt public communications is not in their best interest. They can get what they want without triggering so much outrage.<p>With regards to nationalism, it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s not an all or nothing thing. In general however, I think that many people overestimate the amount of nationalism that they deliberately stir up, as opposed to nationalism that was already there. I think the western understanding of the CCP vastly underestimates the legitimacy that they enjoy, and where that legitimacy comes from. The CCP owes its very legitimacy to nationalism: people chose the CCP over the KMT because the KMT was corrupt and incompetent, and they expect the CCP to do a better job, &quot;or else&quot;.<p>With regards to how China views the world vs how the west does, I&#x27;m hoping that China and the west can move towards each other, rather than it manifesting as a conflict. There is both value and problems in both the western and the Chinese viewpoints. They should understand and learn from each  other.')
