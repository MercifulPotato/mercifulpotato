I had zero knowledge about any web programming. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript is all new to me. Using Ubuntu was also foreign to me, but I tried.\nI started watching videos on YouTube, especially from Traversy Media. Then I joined a few courses on Udemy. Reading books was painful, so I started actual working on code. I am building app to create a portal, giving information about non-profits. (planning to release my rookie code in AGPL license). Having a project in mind really helps. I really liked the simplicity of Rails&#x27; structured way, but there is a lot to learn and it gets overwhelming, but it is fun and I like it. It was also motivating to know that I could learn programming at age 53. Heartfelt Thanks to all those unknown faces on the internet who are selflessly helping others like me learn new things. Now I realized, that you are never too old to learn something new.\nYes, Ruby on Rails is fun.')
