Item(by='gamblor956', descendants=None, kids=[25189886], score=None, time=1606155879, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25189786, text='Yes, I&#x27;ve read that and as a member of the SFWA I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re standing up for more clarity on this. The SFWA&#x27;s job is to advocate for their members. ADF is claiming that he is owed royalties (and it&#x27;s possible he has a contract saying that he is), so they&#x27;re going to advocate for him. It&#x27;s what they do.<p><i>EDIT: Deleted my original second paragraph. Disney is not claiming that they acquired the rights to the novelizations without the corresponding liabilities. The SFWA claimed that on their own. Disney hasn&#x27;t actually made a formal response yet on this other than to say that they want to work this out with ADF. Presumably, that is because they are still trying to find a copy of the now 30+ year old WFH agreement in the Fox warehouses in Century City.<p>The SFWA president is clearly not a lawyer and doesn&#x27;t understand how M&amp;A works in the U.S. What they are suggesting about what Disney was trying to do isn&#x27;t legally possible.</i>')
