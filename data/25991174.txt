The phone&#x27;s native messaging interface is of course inappropriate for safe driving, being primarily visual. CarPlay&#x27;s messaging app only gives you a glanceable list of contacts, and you tap one to dictate a message, which is then also read back to you for confirmation (no message text is ever displayed on the screen). I&#x27;ve had entire text conversations without taking my eyes off the road.<p>For maps and music, the difference may be somewhat less profound, but the same design principles combined with a larger screen that equates to fewer milliseconds scanning for information or steadying your finger to touch a small button, still have a significant effect in keeping driver app use as safe as possible.')
