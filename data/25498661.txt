But at the same time, &quot;abusing&quot; the Jaywalking laws to do so is certainly the wrong way of doing it.<p>I recognize that racial profiling happens, even in urban centers where Police are given plenty of anti-racism training. I don&#x27;t know what to do about that however, aside from making people at least aware of the issue.<p>Police need some leeway to do their job correctly. But whenever its because &quot;I smell weed&quot; or &quot;You were Jaywalking&quot;, that just makes people angry and is counterproductive.')
