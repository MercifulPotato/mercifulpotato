Can&#x27;t you just Google it?<p>I searched for &quot;suicide rates in young people&quot; and found lots of info, including <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5550803&#x2F;depression-suicide-rates-youth&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5550803&#x2F;depression-suicide-rates-youth&#x2F;</a> which cites and links to a study published in <i>The Journal of Abnormal Psychology</i><p>From the article:<p>&gt;Between 2009 and 2017, rates of depression among kids ages 14 to 17 increased by more than 60%, the study found. The increases were nearly as steep among those ages 12 to 13 (47%) and 18 to 21 (46%), and rates roughly doubled among those ages 20 to 21.<p>&gt;Among young people, rates of suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts all increased significantly, and in some cases more than doubled, between 2008 and 2017, the study found.<p>&gt;These findings were based on data collected from more than 600,000 people by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an annual nationwide mental-health survey conducted by a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.<p>&gt;What’s causing today’s young people so much anguish? “This is always a tough question to answer, as we can’t prove for sure what the causes are,” Twenge  says. “But there was one change that impacted the lives of young people more than older people, and that was the growth of smartphones and digital media like social media, texting and gaming.”<p>Note 1: The person quoted above is one of the study authors.
