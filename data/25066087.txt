Item(by='kempbellt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605151807, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25065897, text='I find some media to be actually helpful if it is instructive. I frequent YouTube for how-to videos all the time and there are tons of videos that have saved me time and money by making rookie mistakes that someone more experienced in a particular field mentions off-handedly in a video. It&#x27;s great for software projects, electrical engineering projects (like Raspi and Arduino stuff), and a lot of other miscellaneous things where people with hands-on experience can share tons of wisdom in short video.<p>That said, there is also a lot of <i>junk</i> YouTube content, which feels similar to browsing Reddit, Facebook, or eating donuts for that matter... It&#x27;s a guilty pleasure to watch some videos. Even the &quot;cute&quot; ones, like cat videos, or &quot;funny&quot; fail compilations, or impressive parkour videos. These can be entertaining on the surface, but I find they do the opposite of inspire me. They&#x27;re temporarily exciting to watch, but overall do not any value to my life and in the big picture, I find them to be more of a distraction than anything. Some people have a balanced media diet and can consume it moderately. For me, it&#x27;s too easy to spend several hours in any given week watching completely useless videos - especially with the ever growing mechanisms to try to keep your eyes glued to the screen (auto-play features, suggested playlists, etc).<p>I compare it to a type of drug use. Some people handle it well, others don&#x27;t. Like most things, YMMV.<p>Edit: I also feel like with YouTube&#x27;s insane growth over the past decade, there are <i>way</i> too many people trying to game the system. It leads to some very good content, but also a lot more junk content that just manages to add better keywords for searches, or a more attractive title&#x2F;thumbnail to catch your eye (I&#x27;m sure many people are familiar...).')
