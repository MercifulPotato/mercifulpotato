That’s the whole idea of progressive feature extraction, and the analogy with biological brain. Theoreticians referred to them properly as nnets or multilayer nnets. Later experimentalists simulated them, thanks to the availability of the computing resources, and experimentally verified that a multi layer nnet can be more efficient than a single layer one. They added superficial terms “deep”   and “AI,” “singularity,” etc., which the media and tech industry amplified for obvious reasons.')
