It seems to be something more akin to &#x27;don&#x27;t not moderate content that encourages...&#x27;.  Except it isn&#x27;t quite clear what moderation is considered good enough, as one can look at other sites which hosted and continue to host similar content.  Sure, they haven&#x27;t taken the stance they won&#x27;t moderate, but they haven&#x27;t done enough to moderate the content to remove it.<p>Or is it that stance?  Perhaps that was the defining standard, that they took a stance instead of passively allowing it to remain like other sites do (until called out, at which point they&#x27;ll react based on the size of the call out).')
