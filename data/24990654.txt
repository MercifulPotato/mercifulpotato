Unfortunately, the copyright and license varies from photo to photo. Majority is &quot;All rights reserved&quot;. So the only way to use it is basically to explore it through Flickr&#x27;s website. It would be good if at least it had creative commons licenses, like Xeno Canto has.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;birdguide&#x2F;pool&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;birdguide&#x2F;pool&#x2F;</a>')
