They don&#x27;t do 8-plus hour shifts in your home, or even live in your own home in &quot;servants&#x27; quarters&quot; as is common in places like India, Brazil, etc.<p>In a &quot;servant&quot; relationship involving close physical proximity the servant almost is obliged to care for the emotional well-being of those whom they serve, or to at least feign that care.  The contractor on the other hand is doing a job at your home in one of many such places and aren&#x27;t expected to service the customer&#x27;s emotional needs except as social nicety, and conceivably are raking in more cash per unit-time worked (for independents especially) than those who hire them.<p>The &quot;Cleaning Services&quot; aren&#x27;t servants.<p>edit:  emotional &quot;connection&quot;, relative wages')
