The above is &quot;how you predicted it would be reached&quot;. And to be fair how many others probably did and it might have been the original intention of the phrase even. I definitely thought of &quot;peak oil&quot; as the point after which there&#x27;s just no more deposits we can tap to increase production.<p>History will tell if this was really the &quot;maximum rate&quot; that humanity ever reached. As it will the terminal part of the decline. And maybe this was a local maximum. The article seems to want to predict that this was the global maximum. For now we can&#x27;t prove either. Even if someone else in another article (like has happened before) predicts peak oil because there are no more known deposits to tap, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a global max. New deposits have been found after and were tapped while others hadn&#x27;t run out yet and it turned out to be a local max.<p>Why we reached the max is left open though. Maybe we reached the max now because this is the point at which demand never goes back up to previous levels, who knows. Still meats the definition.<p>Edited for spelling.')
