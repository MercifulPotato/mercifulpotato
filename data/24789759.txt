We&#x27;re using it to orchestrate very large regression test (usually ~40-50k independent processes run as part of the regression testing).<p>I also use conducto&#x27;s predecessor to manage &quot;data science&quot; workflows (simlar to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.conducto.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;advanced&#x2F;data-science" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.conducto.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;advanced&#x2F;data-science</a>) on a large computer. It is miles ahead of the alternatives we&#x27;ve tried (and built).<p>The biggest win we&#x27;ve gotten with conducto comes from the composability. We can ship part of our application as a function which returns conducto nodes. Someone else can call this function an stick it into their own tree (code, not configuration!)<p>Our integration test suite builds a conducto tree ships containing test code from 4ish different libraries (developed by 2 different teams), each of which includes it&#x27;s own tree-building functions. Likewise, we ship many of our applications for the large computer as functions which return conducto nodes. Users just call our functions and embed our portion of the workload into their own trees.<p>Give it a shot!')
