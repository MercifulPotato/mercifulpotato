The courts have been <i>extremely</i> reluctant to charge or convict police officers with crimes for acts in the line of duty. Also, there&#x27;s widespread support for the police in the general public, &quot;blue lives matter&quot;, etc. I would suggest that police unions have only been allowed to wield they power they do because there&#x27;s outside support in the general public for protecting police officers. Even the politicians who are anti-union tend to exempt police unions from their wrath, because those politicians tend to also be &quot;law and order&quot; types.')
