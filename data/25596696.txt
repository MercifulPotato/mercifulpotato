I think it&#x27;s a good idea to discuss the inequities in our economy for sure, and nuanced discussions about the impact of mega-billionaires would be really healthy.<p>But this article doesn&#x27;t really seem to be in good faith. It measures the wealth of billionaires since <i>the stock market bottom</i> in March to today. I thought it was pretty well known that &quot;the 1%&quot; has most of their wealth in stocks. That just means that when the stock market recovered, so did the wealth of people who were invested.<p>Calling out names and showing a cute graphic doesn&#x27;t seem constructive; better conversations would be about why the stock market actually did &quot;recover&quot; in the middle of a terrible pandemic with huge job loss, or how we could get to a world where all Americans could benefit from stock market recovery (401k&#x27;s kind of make this happen a bit).<p>This article seems more like outrage-bait. At least show the graph from Jan 1,2020 to Dec 21, 2020. No need to show headshots in your info-graphic, either :&#x2F;')
