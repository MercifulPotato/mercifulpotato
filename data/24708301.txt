Reversed chirality is simply that, it doesn&#x27;t have a preferential direction of horizontal or vertical.<p>But our environment has a preferential direction in that we orient ourselves with respect to the Earth&#x27;s surface, and the horizon is, well, horizontal. Our body is constructed with vertical bilateral symmetry which means our &quot;halves&quot; are horizontally oriented when in a normal standing or sitting position.<p>All of this causes us to perceive and define reversed chirality in terms of handedness, left or right. Things that we perceive with a left-to-right orientation appear as right-to-left if chirally reversed.<p>If we were spherical beings with limbs and eyes poking out at various angles from our bodies, living in microgravity on a space vessel, we would just perceive the reversed chirality in our mirrors as &quot;enantiomorphic&quot; and not assign a spurious L&#x2F;R directionality to it.')
