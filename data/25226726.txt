High quality productions spanning several disk sides, still pushing the boundaries of the machine and doing things like playing video streamed from floppy, using the SID chip for sample playback with incredible quality, squeezing the last out of every single byte of RAM. It shows how well the authors know the system. Many of them have coded for it for more than 30 years and know every little bit about it by heart.<p>Still, those demos couldn&#x27;t have been created on an unexpanded C64 without the help of modern cross-development: running an assembler natively takes up memory that can now be freed for data and code. The same goes for some of the audio and graphics: using a PC to downsample from a higher resolution yields better quality and those resolutions wouldn&#x27;t fit on a floppy, let alone the unexpanded memory.<p>Some of it could maybe be done natively with a RAMLink and hard drive, but not all of it.')
