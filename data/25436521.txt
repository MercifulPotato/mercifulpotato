Basically just &quot;restaurants&quot; and an easy getaway to outdoors.<p>This wasn&#x27;t my experience in San Francisco when I visited in 2016 - I saw some of the best live music in small bars I&#x27;ve ever heard, went to a couple of awesome free outdoor events, record shopping was quality, just walking around an area like Mission I came across a lot of interesting cafes, shops, bars, street art, and people.<p>I was visiting from Melbourne, Australia - supposed live music capital of the world, ranked worlds most liveable city, and it has a lot of the above - and San Francisco felt pretty exciting with a lot to do.')
