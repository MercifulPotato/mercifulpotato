Item(by='6gvONxR4sf7o', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609876728, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25648710, text='&gt; Its almost like they are moving to PC as a service.<p>I&#x27;d love that offering in a slightly different sense.<p>I do most of my personal compute intensive work on AWS these days. If I am processing a bunch of old files into a different format, or archiving old photos, I might spin up a many cored instance and parallalize it to turn a day&#x27;s processing into an hour (mostly the code, and a few minutes of compute). And I store old junk in AWS for at least an order of magnitude less than dropbox or google drive can get me. I had a personal project where the naive thing to do involved a massive matrix multiply, so I saved myself a ton of time by spinning up a machine with half a terabyte of RAM and did it naively, saving myself an enormous amount of time trying to do something clever.<p>At this point, for my own machine, I&#x27;d love something that amounts to a big battery with a wifi connection (and maybe a teeny tiny cpu somewhere in it). For workloads that can be done over SSH, it&#x27;s all I need. If the rest of my needs could be met that way, I&#x27;d love it. It would be great to just have a remote desktop I can spin up in AWS, changing the size and specs as I want. Basically stadio&#x2F;geforce now for everything.<p>I expect as internet becomes more reliable, this will be a thing. Sadly, instead of being able to install windows or OS X on an EC2 instance with an image that I can pass around wherever, moving to GCP or nvidia whenever I decide to, it&#x27;ll probably be a locked down offering like some services we are starting to see today :(')
