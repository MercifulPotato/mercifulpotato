Item(by='nuccy', descendants=None, kids=[25025226, 25025002], score=None, time=1604833289, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25024820, text='The extra distance for NY&#x2F;NJ-Bristol cables to cover is &quot;just&quot; ~400-500km (extra ~7%), plus if you look at ocean floor map [1] it seems they prefer not to put the cable in the relatively shallow waters of Newfoundland or Nova Scotia (maybe this decreases possibility of a damage by anchors, or they compensate a bit in length by going deeper, i.e. shorter circumference due to smaller radius).<p>The other possibility is that the direct path passes underwater mountainous region with quite variable depths in mid-Atlantic [1], so going up-down or follow the valleys anyway would increase the cable length. The right answer is likely a combination of all these to minimize cable cost, maintenance and latency.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earth.google.com&#x2F;web&#x2F;@41.47661069,-40.80459324,-4414.38010268a,8134630.35540462d,35y,0h,0t,0r&#x2F;data=Ci4SLBIgYjczNzM1Y2E0Y2FiMTFlODhlMTU3MTM3ODRlMDYzMjMiCGxheWVyc18w" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earth.google.com&#x2F;web&#x2F;@41.47661069,-40.80459324,-4414...</a>')
