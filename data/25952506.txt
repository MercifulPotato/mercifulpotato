Very few Robinhood accounts overall have over $25k balance.<p>I guess I can’t see where the risk is. Shares are moving electronically between different ledgers as orders are fulfilled. Shares aren’t being created or destroyed, nor is money.<p>I can definitely see how you could end up with large net cash flows that need to settled over the next 48 hours, if Robinhood accounts are collectively gaining or losing huge percentages of their value from one day to the next. But I don’t see, absent allowing margin or naked options, how they could ever end up owing more than they actually have on hand in their custodial accounts.<p>I would possibly believe that Robinhood didn’t have the technical controls the fix the problem that they were having the “right” way, and had to resort to their “least worst option”.<p>For example they should have the technical controls to flag specific sales to prevent those funds from being reinvested until the particular sale settles. By free and clear settled cash should be able to buy any publicly listed share it wants.')
