Earlier in their comment history you can find them complaining about &quot;South Asians&quot; and justifying casual racism by claiming they &quot;optimise for efficiency&quot;. Another page or two back, and they&#x27;re describing sex as an obligation of marriage.<p>The point being, reactionary bigots tend to out themselves, and that&#x27;s the obnoxious worldview driving by here. Erasure of someone&#x27;s identity in conformance to external expectations is something that - remarkably - remains a thriving and actively promoted idea.  This makes it all the more important to confront and openly, firmly reject.')
