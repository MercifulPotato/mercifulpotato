(With 10+ games and lots of DLC, there&#x27;s actually a lot of songs that were included)<p>There was also a service called jammit marketed to musicians where you could buy multitracks from their partnered artists. There are also artists sharing them in deluxe editions of albums, for example I think Dream Theater did it for Black Clouds and Silver Linings?<p>There&#x27;s also the possibility of just knowing someone in the industry that could have access to them, maybe? I know Rick Beato who does song analyses on YouTube is a producer, so he could get some this way.<p>There was a great channel on YouTube dedicated to sharing these isolated tracks called digital split, unfortunately it got banned from YouTube twice, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s coming back...')
