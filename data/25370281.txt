One person was suicidal, and doing it multiple times per month. I don&#x27;t want to get into details but the shortest way to explain it is the person was psychotic and believed they were part of a cult of dead people and Ayahuasca kept them &quot;alive&quot;.<p>The other person was a compulsive liar and kept on jumping from cult to cult until they landed in an Ayahuasca christian sect saying they were very experienced trip guides. After a few months of &quot;secretly&quot; doing it I assume to understand how it worked to be able to deliver on their promises they got discovered and kicked out.<p>Psychedelic mania or psychedelic psychosis is a thing. I don&#x27;t think any substance that affects your perception in such a way will ever be free from that nasty side effect. There&#x27;s people that actually binge smoke DMT multiple times per week because they really believe they are in contact with spirits and start acting that narrative with life changing consequences. The incorrect social circle or antisocial tendencies will turn that person into a monster living in hell. And if you don&#x27;t know about smoking DMT let&#x27;s say that making sense of the experience requires a great deal of... interpretation. Of the psychedelics it&#x27;s one of the ones that will on most cases hardly create anything that is even mildly similar to reality in the &quot;breakthrough&quot; world.')
