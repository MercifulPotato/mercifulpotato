Differential updates has been a solved problem for many, many years.  Hourly or even daily diffs would be tiny (likely much less traffic than the OCSP checks that occur now), and expired certs could be dropped from the local store, so it wouldn&#x27;t grow without bound.  (Sure, ok, people could turn their clocks back and defeat that last bit, but doing that would break other things, too, like TLS to any website with a reasonably recent cert.)')
