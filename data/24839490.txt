It&#x27;s also a big joke that they have so many ads talking about privacy, when they are just as bad as their rivals. I do understand that not everyone has a choice because specialized software that they need for professional use could be available only in other platforms and that&#x27;s unfortunately.<p>I don&#x27;t expect an utopic world where everything is FLOSS but the OS is too important to be closed. It will only get worse with time.')
