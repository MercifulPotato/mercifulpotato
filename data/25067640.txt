Though in my case I realized that it originally started from myself feeling guilt where I was nagging to myself how I can&#x27;t do whatever fun thing while there was some other work thing&#x2F;project where I thought I&#x27;m behind.<p>So slowly over time that guilt made fun things less fun, and combined with stress started to skew perception of how productive I am, and how long something will&#x2F;should take ...etc. Eventually that skewed perception spilled from work to personal life - so for those things&#x2F;projects that were still at least somewhat fun&#x2F;enjoyable I also started to be annoyed by them taking longer than what I thought they should take.')
