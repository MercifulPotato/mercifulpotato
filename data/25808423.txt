Why be pedantic when you can instead measure how well they would do as a developer?  In an interview you can ask followup questions to see how precise their ability to explain their thought process is.<p>If someone is so pedantic that they would consider the interviewee to have shot themselves in the foot because they said &quot;The big O is n squared.&quot; without any followup questions from the interviewer, that doesn&#x27;t sound healthy to me.  I would worry this kind of culture would extend past the interview and it wouldn&#x27;t be an enjoyable place to work.<p>Can you imagine working in a place where people regularly argue over terminology instead of just making sure everyone is on the same page?<p>(Full warning: I&#x27;m not a dev, so I&#x27;m coming in from the view of another industry.)')
