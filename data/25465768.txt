Facebook&#x27;s concern is <i>nothing to do with</i> &quot;protecting the poor little businesses&quot;.  It&#x27;s <i>everything</i> to do with protecting their <i>own</i> business.  Because they know that opt-in will drastically reduce their ability to track.<p>But they can&#x27;t say that.  They can&#x27;t put out an ad that says: &quot;hey. We&#x27;ve been sucking up your data for years, without your informed consent.  And we&#x27;ve made a ton of money from it.  Now Apple wants to stop us doing that unless you&#x27;re OK with it&quot;.<p>So instead they&#x27;re pulling every lever they can to make Apple look like the bad guy while avoiding the truth.  Hypocracy, exactly as OP says.<p>That they&#x27;re stooping to these levels just emphasises how much they think the change is going to hurt them.')
