Item(by='api', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606854602, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25268995, text='You touched on the core problem with cryptocurrency, and it is <i>not a technology problem</i>.<p>The problem is that cryptocurrency and the community around it is absolutely crawling with scams to the point that it&#x27;s hard to find things that are <i>not</i> scams. Bad drives out good. Even if the tech works perfectly and can be made to scale, if the ecosystem is full of scams it will never be used for anything but scams and black&#x2F;grey market applications. Anyone not looking to scam will run away.<p>Contrast with the stock market. There are scams, sure, but the majority of stocks are not scams. If you bought stocks at random you have at least &gt;50% odds of buying stock in a real and honest business of some kind. If you participate in cryptocurrency stuff at random I&#x27;d say you have a &gt;90% chance of being scammed... probably closer to 99%.<p>All the ad-hoc regulations and institutions around conventional finance are the outcome of a multiple century long Red Queen&#x27;s race between productive economic activity and noise. Noise includes scams, frauds, bubbles, and other forms of undesirable action or emergent behaviors in markets that get in the way of productive economic activity. That hodge-podge of adaptations is almost certainly sub-optimal, but you&#x27;re not going to do better by just ignoring the problem domain and offloading everything onto individual market participants. That means every market participant has to operate their own SEC and investigative journalist outfit to have any chance of not being scammed. Not going to happen.<p>A recurrent fallacy of techno-libertarians and techno-utopians is to vastly underestimate human avarice and opportunism. The people designing these systems are usually fairly honest, so they have a hard time imagining what sociopaths and con artists will do with the things they create. If you create anything that offers even the tiniest chance at making money or obtaining some form of status or power, it will be DDOSed with fraud and con artistry of every kind.<p>Edit: I am not totally bearish on this stuff and I see valid uses for it, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as broadly world changing as its evangelists do.')
