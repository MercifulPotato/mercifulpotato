A murderer is in prison for 10-20 years and a really bad racist joke makes you unemployable for a year or 2.<p>There&#x27;s also a problem with the verb &quot;to rehabilitate&quot; because much of the rehabilitation comes from the subject themselves and can&#x27;t be imposed by society. The murderer who serves time, shows remorse, and studies programming to reintegrate society is different from the racist who doesn&#x27;t apologize sincerely or believably for the bad joke and complains that nobody will hire them.<p>Finally, look at the environment that the rehabilitated person gets put into. Someone who got into drugs and gangs as a teen, went to prison, and then turned their life around is not a threat in an office environment. A racist or sexist  may still cause disruption in a diverse and gender-equal work environment. The ex-gang member can&#x27;t go back to the &#x27;hood, but the racist or sexist has made it much more difficult to work in any office--or with people so that&#x27;s pretty much any job. Though like I said, if they apologize and repent, I think the racist should be given a second chance as well.')
