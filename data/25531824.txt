Would you be able to elaborate on that? What mechanism exists that makes it hard for me to live cheaply but someone else to not? I&#x27;ve lived very poor in my life and this argument that for some people there&#x27;s no way out doesn&#x27;t compute, at least not if you live in the west. I&#x27;ve never met a person that cannot pull themselves out of those traps that wasn&#x27;t caused by discretionary spending and bad impulse control, not in the west. Ive met legitimately poor people in third world countries that are actually stuck due to societal systemic problems. But every person I&#x27;ve met in the US that can&#x27;t seem to make their lives better, there is always some mismatched priority that keeps them that way.')
