Item(by='poletopole', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603319218, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24837200, text='I used to work for a pair of real estate investors involved in a pyramid scheme in my early days as a developer. The investors would pay a lot of money to access a data broker to find houses that were, for example, going through foreclosure, short sale, arbitration, etc. We got some pretty violent phone calls regarding how exactly we knew what we did—your home is usually the last thing you want to lose next.<p>There isn’t any panacea for scrubbing your data from these brokers. All the spam email, texts, calls, or even snail mail most of the time are coming from hydras like the real investors I mentioned, not large companies. Personally, I’m so sick of spam emails, smses, and calls that I’m just going to bite the bullet and start over by making an anonymous email&#x2F;sms&#x2F;voip service with Twilio (I did this professionally for 7 years) and put an end to it all.')
