Item(by='Veen', descendants=None, kids=[25987998], score=None, time=1612178510, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25987427, text='&gt; Buying a mechanical watch is utterly irrational, if you subtract the status, scarcity, and design components.<p>Yes, buying something is irrational if you &quot;subtract&quot; all the reasons people buy it, but I don&#x27;t think your conception of those reasons is accurate. I like my mechanical watch for many reasons that have nothing to do with status and scarcity.<p>It looks good and I appreciate the quality of workmanship. I find the mechanism&#x27;s complexity and delicacy beautiful. I like that it has a glass back and I can watch it work. I like that it is entirely powered by my own body&#x27;s motion, and I never have to charge it or change its batteries. I find its ability to keep time through purely mechanical rather than digital processes fascinating, and a useful balance to a life that would otherwise be dominated by ones and zeroes. I find the history of the watchmaker and watchmaking interesting, and like that I wear an item that is part of a centuries-long story. I like that, if maintained well, my watch will work when I am 80 years old and I can give it to my sonâ€”something that cannot be said of an Apple Watch. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have notifications and doesn&#x27;t track me: it only provides useful information to me and not to the company that made it.<p>It is less accurate than a quartz watch, but I neither need nor want atomic precision from a watch. You conflate &quot;rational&quot; with &quot;utilitarian&quot; or &quot;practical&quot; but they aren&#x27;t the same thing at all. Even if people bought mechanical watches solely for the status and looks, that would not be &quot;utterly irrational&quot; because those are values of importance to them.')
