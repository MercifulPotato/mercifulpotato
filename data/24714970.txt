I really don&#x27;t want any third parties scooping up my address.<p>- The price should have a currency associated with it. You might not do much with it right now, but you could for example integrate with a third party to convert 1995 Yen to 2020 US dollars, allowing anyone to see the price in their preferred currency at this time. Country of purchase would also be useful in this case, since prices can vary a lot across markets and this would enable at least rough translation based on known ratios between countries for different product categories.<p>- The weight unit should be an enum, not a string. That way it&#x27;ll be trivial for you to convert to the user&#x27;s preferred unit (kg for something like 95% of the world).<p>- Searching for &quot;backpack&quot; returned no results, which is weird.<p>- It would be useful to have some help text for the BIFL score, to have a slight chance of people rating using similar criteria. I&#x27;m not sure the BIFL score is even going to be very useful; maybe it would be better to generate it based on how long people have had the item and its condition at submission time.<p>- The front page without any filters applied shows 43 products. After switching to brands it shows 157 results. Are there really more brands than products?<p>On a more general note, if the data is supposed to be community driven it might make sense to also make meta-reviews community driven, like Wikipedia and Stack Overflow.<p>All that said, thank you for building this! I desperately want a site like this, focusing on reliability ahead of cost, packaging, and design.')
