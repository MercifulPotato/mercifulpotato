With social media and the internet people found a virtual friend that always approves their world view. And should something happen that doesn&#x27;t fit the world view a cozy way out is just google search around the corner.<p>And of course: the world <i>is</i> confusing and complex. Stuff that was previously something only crazy people would believe turned out to be true (think Snowden). Given such a world isn&#x27;t it easier to just form some idea in thin air and worship it instead of admitting that you have no clue what is going on? This is what is happening here.<p>And social media is the perfect echo chamber to avoid the cognitive dissonance one would get when the rubber meets the road in terms of an reality check. If there are millions others that share your world view how wrong can you be?<p>Media isn&#x27;t innocent in that sense, politics isn&#x27;t innocent, social media companies and marketing people aren&#x27;t innocent. They are all complicit in this. But saying something among the lines of &quot;people go to apeshit conspiracy nonsense sites because they don&#x27;t trust the media&quot; would be a bit far fetched as well.<p>I think the main reason people do it is because A) they can and B) it feels better than not doing it.<p>The classical media is certainly part of that feeling, but certainly not the biggest part of it.')
