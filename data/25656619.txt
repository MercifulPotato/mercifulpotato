Matomo can never provide that without having a broad range of websites from which you collect data and writing custom code to annotate visitors with your own interest tags.<p>Matomo purely tracks analytics: who visited what page, for how long, from what device, from what location, from what inbound website, and what outbound links did they click. It also provides a log of pages requested per session so you can analyze people&#x27;s flows through your website.<p>It&#x27;s certainly not a replacement for Google Analytics if you use it to collect background information on your visitors. Even though Google&#x27;s information is very broad (you mostly get ranges and the interests aren&#x27;t that reliable), some marketeers use it to make decisions about their marketing strategies. Matomo won&#x27;t help you there, your alternative would probably be Facebook or another big tech tracking solution.<p>It does provide a replacement for the type of tracking that I personally find acceptable, assuming the IP addresses are anonymized sufficiently. Matomo recommends shortening IP addresses to &#x2F;16 after analysis, which I consider good enough, but that&#x27;s a setting administrators can change.')
