You could possibly say that it&#x27;s a function of the current size of the market.<p>But the demand for videogames was always dynamically tied to the quality of the product.<p>The EA update of Sim City was quite a memorable event of a similar class. My personal bugbear was Street Fighter 5. Duke Nuke Forever, and also, possibly Daikatana, were truly legendary death marches.<p>With these commercial failures in mind, The Last Guardian is actually something of a Sydney Opera House - esque miracle. Especially with the purported performance boost it gains on PS5.<p>A bit of a rambling rant. I hope they have a chance to fix Cyberpunk though, because this result sounds like a team of ambitious artists were bullied into rushing their work.')
