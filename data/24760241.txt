Item(by='chki', descendants=None, kids=[24760738], score=None, time=1602542095, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24760062, text='&gt;The Nobel price in economics has much more prestige than two of the &#x27;real&#x27; prices (Peace price and Literature price)<p>Prestige is of course somewhat subjective (as is definitely the very last part of your comment) but I would strongly disagree. Those two prizes are highly regarded and their announcements are widely reported. I can for example tell you both laureates of those prizes for this year from the top of my head but I can&#x27;t name any other prize holder from the other categories. I guess you are projecting your own biases here and there is no real pecking order.')
