Item(by='pydry', descendants=None, kids=[25319331], score=None, time=1607207040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25318593, text='The most convincing argument for job guarantee over UBI I saw was plan jefes in argentina.<p>It started out as a job guarantee, where women were given jobs as caregivers and got shifted to UBI where the women were told they didn&#x27;t have to do the jobs but they&#x27;d still get the money.<p>They still did the jobs when they didn&#x27;t have to. They said it provided them with a social network and social interactions and most importantly, with purpose.<p>One of the things that bugs me the most about UBI is the idea that people would rather just laze at home and do their own thing given the chance and the money to make that possible. I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s true. I think humans have a deep seated need to be part of a community, to have purpose and to leave a mark.<p>The new deal was a spectacular illustration of that. The people who took part in public works projects were justifiably proud of what they&#x27;d done - building bridges, art works, schools, sewers, streets and more.')
