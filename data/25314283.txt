It’s 100% possible to understand exactly how the world works and be poor&#x2F;homeless. In fact if you start out that way in life I’d wager your mental models are likely to be bang on, the world forces you to look at it.<p>Certainly the other upper class person who became homeless had bad mental models (“I understand finance so it’s wrong that I’m homeless”), but that seems more like a psychological defense than anything. Being poor is traumatic, being homeless is traumatic; you’d expect defense mechanisms.<p>The bit about MeFi is darkly funny, but I never spent much time there to say more than that. It certainly isn’t surprising that a bunch of liberal techie types think the world of themselves but actually treat those in need like shit.')
