It is hands down the worst screen I&#x27;ve ever had (and I still have a couple ~ 2006 20&quot; acer lcds pressed into service in various comms closets and shop space in my house).  The brightness on these is appalling and it doesn&#x27;t help that Mint insists on resetting the brightness to 60% on every boot so I feel like I&#x27;m trying to walk through a house of horrors with only a single birthday candle for light.<p>Edit: the joke is that the house of horrors is my code')
