Unfortunately it seems to be too much of a daunting task with today&#x27;s size of the internet to jump in with a viable competitor.<p>I wonder what portion of the internet you have to scrape to be able to have good results for 90% of queries.  An enormous number of my queries end up on Wikipedia somewhere, for example.  A lot end up on Stack Overflow.  The two of those probably constitute the majority of my searches, and almost certainly a majority of the searches where I really care about the answer (and I&#x27;m not just googling whether pirates and ninjas were contemporaries of each other, because why not).<p>If Google&#x27;s results are really slipping that much, you can make up for the lack of data by providing better results on the data you do have.<p>I am curious why something like that hasn&#x27;t gotten more popular.  A search engine that only indexes highly reputable and public sources would be interesting.  Wikipedia, dictionaries from somewhere, reputable newspapers globally, etc.  Is it just too big of a target for abuse to be viable?')
