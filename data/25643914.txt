The main talking point is mmWave and more base stations with their alleged serious health issues that didn&#x27;t previously exist. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s the justification here. To me, mmWave sounds &quot;better&quot; since it cannot penetrate the skin, unlike lower frequencies. And the additional power from more base stations will be balanced out by high attenuation.<p>Privacy and mass surveillance is another talking point. I saw one conspiracy theorist described it as a major threat from 5G and how the government is going to use 5G to &quot;enslave the population&quot;. It&#x27;s a legitimate concern, but the existing cellular network, the Internet, and facial recognition already enabled it. Ubiquitous connectivity and more base stations will enable additional tracking, but it isn&#x27;t 5G that makes a fundamental difference here.')
