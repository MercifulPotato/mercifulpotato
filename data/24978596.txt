Some Australian rural houses have roof mounted sprinklers (exterior of the building), water tanks reserved for fire fighting, and so on. I did some drone work for an insurance company after our last fire season, and got photos of places where the fire had been stopped literally a metre short of a building. Either irrigated gardens, protection systems or fire fighters.')
