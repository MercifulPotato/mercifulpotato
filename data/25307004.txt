That includes a long SWA cable from a buildings&#x27; floor level to the roof-top end point (roughly 40 metres - so that would equal 40x 100v = 4kV).<p>[Edit to add - Longest vertical cable run I have dealt with was 180m &#x2F; 41 floors for a four-core fire rated comms cable]<p>[Double Edit, Sorry.] The only source I was able to find was this &quot;Or, if we suspend a metal object outdoors, weâ€™ll find that it spontaneously charges up to a certain voltage: about +100VDC for every meter of altitude above the ground.&quot; from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Can-electric-current-charge-flow-through-air" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Can-electric-current-charge-flow-throu...</a>?')
