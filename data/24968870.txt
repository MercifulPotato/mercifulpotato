Hard to claim you didn&#x27;t post something if your account is super secure. You can&#x27;t go anywhere without cameras taking your picture. And if someone steals your bitcoin or your smart contract has a mistake, your money is gone. You can&#x27;t argue with an algorithm. And the internet never forgets. (Well, unless it is inconvenient for you, then Murphy&#x27;s law applies ;-))<p>There are many such phenomena but I&#x27;d say they are all related: They mean you have less wiggle room for mistakes, or social deviance. If you are in a situation where you have to break a law, or if you are just having an affair, chances are someone or something is going to see you. There is no anonymity in the crowd anymore, on the contrary.<p>But this deep fake technology, if it really evolves to be undetectable, can be liberating, if it erodes the trust in pictures. At least the social control mechanisms based on cameras are going to stop working.<p>We were living in a very specific phase of human history, where we learned how to produce pictures from real scenes, but haven&#x27;t learned yet to easily fake them. I just think this is going to come to an end, and we&#x27;ll have to adapt. (I hope we&#x27;ll adapt socially, and not just by cramming DRM into our technology like we tend do to; but that is a different topic.)')
