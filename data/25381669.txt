Windy is a particularly good app for these kinds of things.<p>I also run a small REST API service (oikolab.com) that provides location-based forecast data out to 10 days using NCEP service. I started out using DarkSky and Wunderground a couple of years ago but couldn&#x27;t really get the type &amp; quality of data I needed so I ended up creating one from the original raw data.<p>It is a &#x27;re-packager&#x27; in a sense but what we bring to the table is the ability to query the data in a time-series manner efficiently for specific set of end-users. The way NCEP&#x27;s GRIB data is packaged makes it very slow and painful to do this if you wanted weather parameters to feed into other analytical models (e.g. building energy simulation, time-series forecast etc).')
