I work from home, but past experience has taught me that I cannot work if he&#x27;s home.<p>On the rare times he&#x27;s been sick I stay home and take care of him, and don&#x27;t even pretend to work.  Too much &quot;Daddy play with me&quot;, &quot;Daddy look at this&quot;, etc.  Even if he&#x27;s basically sofa&#x2F;bed-bound and sleeping all day I can&#x27;t work.<p>At least in Finland we&#x27;re allowed to have 9ish days of paid leave a year to take care of a sick child.')
