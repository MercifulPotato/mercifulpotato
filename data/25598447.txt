The affiliates all maintain that they are on the up and up, but any of them could be scammers.  The company gets leads and doesn&#x27;t know how they were generated.<p>To see how easy it is, you can create a blog, register yourself as an affiliate for Amazon, and put a link on your blog.  Boom.  Now have your friend click on your link, and go buy something.  Guess what?  Amazon will pay you money!<p>Now suppose that you do that and I do that.  You put up your blog, I put up a blog as well.  But I also put out a browser extension that rewrites all amazon links to come to my site, record that, and then redirect.  How is Amazon supposed to find out that your traffic is real and mine is from a scam?  Our sites look the same.  We&#x27;re both sending real customers who will pay real money.<p>In this scenario if Amazon could catch me, they would.  I&#x27;d be straight up cheating them, making them pay for traffic that I didn&#x27;t generate.')
