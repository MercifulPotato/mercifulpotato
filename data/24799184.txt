And Google assistant has lost all state and no longer shows the 3 results.  And if I &quot;swipe up to see your snapshot&quot; it crashes and dumps me back at the launcher...<p>Did they not even test this?  Being able to do back and forward navigation without leaving the user on a random screen is like app design 101, and you can totally write unit tests for it.')
