More importantly IMO is the fact that we were already expecting room temperature superconductors with this route.  There is a theory of superconductivity which accurately describes these materials.<p>The more interesting materials are the unconventional superconductors which have a high transition temperature.  From the side of physics, we still have no idea how they work other than something involving many body interactions.  Plus with their rising Tc, they might be a route to practical superconductivity.')
