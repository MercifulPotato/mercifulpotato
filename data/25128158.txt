Someone made a mistake. </i><p>Yes, but by explicitly adding the word <i>&quot;someone [...]&quot;</i>, the hiding&#x2F;concealment is <i>calling attention to itself</i>.  It&#x27;s an unusual and awkward construction of a sentence -- or -- the writer was trying to write a mystery&#x2F;crime novel.<p>On the other hand, if the writer doesn&#x27;t want to name the agent <i>without drawing attention to the writing style</i>, the overuse of passive &quot;to be&quot; verbs instead of active verbs is the way to do it.  Passive voice is the hallmark of government bureaucratic reports and they&#x27;re boring and lack punch.<p><i>&gt;Most uses of the passive have nothing to do with being evasive.</i><p>I agree.')
