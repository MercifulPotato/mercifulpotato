Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=[25660207], score=None, time=1609951847, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25659080, text='&gt;why not just buy it from amazon directly? does ebay&#x2F;paypal have looser anti-fraud systems than amazon?<p>Every additional step is an additional level of obfuscation.<p>I don&#x27;t get what you mean by &quot;buy it directly&quot;.  You don&#x27;t want the book and you don&#x27;t want to be buying things for yourself using illegitimate money.<p>&gt;That doesn&#x27;t work because if you funnel a bunch of stolen credit card purchases into that account, it will quickly get flagged for an unusually high chargeback rate.<p>I shouldn&#x27;t have mentioned CCs.  Nobody is buying $500 books with credit cards that are likely to charge back.  You generally use those for drop-shipping scams where you list $5 toilet brushes for $4.95 on another site and then use the stolen CC to pay.  Say you list on eBay and buy on Amazon, the people will dispute Amazon charges but it doesn&#x27;t matter because the happy customers of your eBay account are getting their $4.95 toilet brushes just fine.  $500 books could be an intermediary step where you have $24k sitting in a sketchy account you control (toilet brush business is booming) and you need to siphon it out.  You&#x27;ll be the only one buying the book so no charge-back risk.')
