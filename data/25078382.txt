(There&#x27;s also ray differentials, which if I understand correctly, are a way of tracking how a cone of light would spread out after bouncing off of curved surfaces, if the ray were a cone.)<p>As to why lenses would cause a problem specifically, I don&#x27;t know the path tracing algorithm well enough to say for sure offhand, but it may have something to do with introducing random sampling before you even hit the first scene object.  Usually in ray tracing the first hit is kind of a freebie; you can calculate direct illumination exactly, and it&#x27;s only indirect illumination that&#x27;s approximated.  (In path tracing, it&#x27;s approximated by doing a lot of random sampling.)  So, not having to approximate the first-hit direct illumination reduces the noise quite a bit right off the bat.')
