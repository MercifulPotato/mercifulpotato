Most of them have some kind of invisible watermark I couldn&#x27;t care less about that presumable helps the publisher track down who distributed a book if the user didn&#x27;t remove it, but it being invisible and probably bit-sized, that&#x27;s an okay thing in my book (heh).<p>Now that I think of it, it might have to do with the fact that I read sci-fi almost exclusively, where the authors have some kind of political interest in freedom themselfes and might pick publishers accordingly, but I have no way to back that idea up. The majority of the books I bought are published by Bastei LÃ¼bbe (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.luebbe.de&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.luebbe.de&#x2F;</a>), but smaller publishers usually allowed me to do the same.<p>I don&#x27;t read book samples because I check the reviews for books I plan on reading on whereever I can find them, but I might start if the reviews start failing me. Might have to figure out where those are possible then :)')
