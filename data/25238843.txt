The fact that you constructed an absurd scenario and there’s a clear winner in it does not imply that there is always a clear winner. In fact, my experience is that in the majority of times there is not a clear winner, and terms get completely overloaded or used imprecisely.<p>So, again, your absurd scenario proves to be quite a weak argument when you consider the scope of the whole problem.')
