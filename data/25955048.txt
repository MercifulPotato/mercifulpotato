I really like my Model Y and don&#x27;t really have any complaints but it annoys me when people that haven&#x27;t owned or even driven a Tesla come out of the woodwork saying &quot;That is a terrible design!  Why would anyone do that!?&quot;.<p>These critics end up sounding like someone just introduced flush toilets and they can&#x27;t possibly see how that&#x27;s better: &quot;You mean you have to flush?&quot;.  Or perhaps Doctors washing their hands between patients: &quot;Who has time for that!?  I have people to cure!&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not saying that everything Tesla does or is doing is perfect, or even better.  But to dismiss it out of hand, without even trying it, is mind-boggling.  Case in point, the most recent Tesla 3&#x2F;Y update changed the on-screen GUI quite a bit and a lot of people got upset over it.  Sure there are things that I didn&#x27;t like about it, at first, but I reasoned that there are a lot of pretty smart people behind it and they probably had a reason for the change.  Give it a chance.<p>Tesla has a lot of smart people and there is probably a reason behind this new steering wheel.  I&#x27;m willing to give it a chance.  If it turns out that, in practice, this new design is terrible or dangerous I&#x27;ll join the chorus of naysayers shouting it down.  We&#x27;ll see.')
