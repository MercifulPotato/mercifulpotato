Item(by='vetinari', descendants=None, kids=[25350059], score=None, time=1607450075, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25348159, text='Sorry for vasting your time :P<p>I actually run Steam inside flatpak - I installed Steam from flathub, launched it, downloaded the games and almost (see below) everything worked. Flatpak runtime has all the necessary Mesa drivers (for AMD and Intel, not sure how Nvidia and flatpak works). The only thing I had to configure myself in the host system was udev rules for Dualshock gamepad. That one breaks the otherwise nice experience of everything working out of the box.<p>And wrt the Vulkan requirement: that&#x27;s why I bought The Talos Principle originally. It was one of the first games with Vulkan renderer and I was curious, how well it works.')
