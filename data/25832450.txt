Item(by='mhh__', descendants=None, kids=[25833170], score=None, time=1611056370, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25832392, text='Classical mechanics is ultimately just masturbation compared to the &quot;real thing&quot;, it&#x27;s all a warm-up for the mind rather than teaching you how to calculate stresses on a beam - Full on symplectic geometry is niche but the basics of Noether&#x27;s theorem and symmetries are central to classical and quantum field theories which are ultimately the language in which the cutting edge of fundamental physics speaks.<p>So I sort of agree, but take the two Oxford books on QFT and Statistical physics - they pack in enormous amounts of detail in a 3 or 4 hundred pages. There&#x27;s room to spare if the book is the right shape.')
