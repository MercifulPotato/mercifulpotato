Sure, the Five Eyes and Japan might be asking for a backdoor but I postulate the chance they don&#x27;t already have access to all information they desire is zero. At this point everything is just meant to wear everyone down and increase tolerance until the day &quot;government has access to everything&quot; doesn&#x27;t matter to the populace.<p>Secondly, I think people are really naive to consider any justification for catching bad guys. All funding should be going into making the desire &quot;to be a bad guy&quot; zero. That&#x27;s not going to be done by fear but instead by making a life as &quot;not a bad guy&quot; more attractive. Currently people are living unattractive lives while following the law and society should be making that unattractiveness go away.')
