GP is engaging in the act of forcing intersubjective reality - basically willing this &quot;fact&quot; into becoming an actual fact.<p>This is becoming increasingly common in discourse these days, and noticing it is the key to understanding the various non sequiturs and other abuses of logic made in arguments that try to classify random stuff as offensive. Unlike in the physical world, in the social world, if enough people are forcefully claiming something is a fact, it <i>becomes</i> a fact.<p>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s even more important socially to combat such abuse of reasoning than it is in hard sciences. You can&#x27;t make gravity disappear because you <i>really believe</i> humans are capable of levitating. But you absolutely can make acceptance, due process and individual freedoms disappear if enough people strongly insist some other people are saying the wrong things.')
