If the goal is growth only for the purpose of growth then that&#x27;s pretty comparable to cancer.<p>Possibly even down to the ultimate consequences: Usually it&#x27;s not the cancer itself that kills people, what&#x27;s killing them is being starved by the cancer as they can&#x27;t keep up supplying their body, and aggressive cancer, with enough nutrients.<p>Imho this analogy holds similarly true for businesses that have as their main focus perpetual growth, just like an economic system that&#x27;s based on perpetual growth, while being stuck in a place where resources are actually finite and as such can&#x27;t even realistically sustain perpetual growth.')
