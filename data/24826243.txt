I have travelled a lot in India as well and I find your statement not representative of the actual ground situation.<p>Infrastructure sure is not well done but the electricity bit is not true at least from what I have seen.<p>If you are in a city like New Delhi&#x2F;Mumbai, most homes&#x2F;hotels do have reliable power. For rare cuts most have power through power backups.<p>If you visit remote places, it is definitely worse. They have electrified a lot of places, but power is absent most of the times in the day. Some people rely on solar powered batteries for basic electrification at night. I have never seen a powerline burning though.<p>In cities there are internet providers which do better than others, so it might have been your luck with some bad provider; but they are not even present in remote places.<p>LTE based mobile internet has coverage problem in cities with pockets that get bad coverage, otherwise the provider &#x27;Airtel&#x27; that I have used while traveling does seem to perform well in cities. Remote places have no coverage from LTE providers as well.')
