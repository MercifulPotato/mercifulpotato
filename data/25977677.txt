I assumed they could not imagine how one&#x27;s browser, NYT and the target site could conspire to affect rankings.<p>I explained how this might happen. So Google knows there&#x27;s traffic. Some traffic ranks higher than none, and much traffic ranks higher than some.<p>So, to allow Google to be aware that a well-trafficked site is slating you, is riskier than if it&#x27;s a site with few visitors because that site will now rank higher.')
