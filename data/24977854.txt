Hang out in there. Talk to people who join. Be actually interested in their use cases, and not in your own company.<p>A discord server is useful for far more than most people understand. You can show daily progress; show new features; highlight community contributions; have a centralized bug report channel; and the other users will start solving other users&#x27; problems when it attains critical mass.<p>The nit is &quot;critical mass&quot;. But if you make something that people find remotely interesting, people will join. Broadcast what you&#x27;re doing on twitter, and eventually you&#x27;ll get noticed.<p>Surveys and cold calls are like trying to make fire by banging stones together. Tools from a different era. Sure, they work, but I&#x27;ve found the above process to be far more effective.<p>It helps to make your discord a general topic, by the way, rather than a specific product. Our ML discord recently passed 1,000 users. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.com&#x2F;invite&#x2F;x52Xz3y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.com&#x2F;invite&#x2F;x52Xz3y</a><p>Community building is tough work, and I&#x27;ve had several failed attempts. You shouldn&#x27;t expect yours to take off immediately. You should do it because you like it, and eventually something will work.<p>But it depends entirely on the business. Most businesses don&#x27;t <i>need</i> a community. But I can&#x27;t think of a single business with a community that would have been in such a strong position without it.')
