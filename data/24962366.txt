It should be noted dafny and Verdi are better here. Both systems allow refinement by constantly reproving safety properties over code thats closer and closer to the real implementation including making runnable code. (Verdi does coq to ocaml and dafny does dafny to .net executable generation). Frama C and spark are similar. However there appears to be a philosophical difference: tla+ finds counter examples to the spec. Absence up to the number of states checked shows the code is bug free. Dafny, Verdi seem to proceed by showing the spec is proved through various proof checking (semi) automation. As such they don&#x27;t explore state.')
