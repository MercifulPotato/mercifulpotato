I believe that it&#x27;s just because bureaucracy moves slowly - and the core of Uber&#x27;s strategy was to corner the market and gain sympathy of the riders before local regulators could gear up - at which point they&#x27;d be fighting their own citizen. Basically, pitting people against their local governments.<p>&gt; <i>Imagine the government tomorrow decides to ban shaking hands. Would prosecuting the hand-shakers increase the trust in government and its legitimacy? No: people would rightly conclude that it&#x27;s the government that&#x27;s wrong, and it doesn&#x27;t deserve trust or charity here.</i><p>I get your example and it&#x27;s a fair point - but I must say we generally did just that in 2020 with COVID restrictions :). That itself initially impacted the trust positively, but I guess it&#x27;s easier to imagine the threat of a pandemic than a threat of an underpaid and uninsured driver operating an illegal cab having an accident.<p>&gt; <i>In every city I am aware off, on both sides of the pond, traditional taxis have not been able to compete very well with Uber. Sure, in some places the taxis were less bad than in others, but almost everywhere they were overpriced and untrustworthy.</i><p>I&#x27;m not saying they weren&#x27;t in need of some competitive pressure, but generally, taxis weren&#x27;t able to compete very well with Uber because it&#x27;s really hard to compete with an international corporation that just ignores the law, while subsidizing its offerings from practically infinite VC budget. Whether the existing taxi services in any given city were good or bad or in between, it didn&#x27;t matter - they didn&#x27;t stand a chance.<p>&gt; <i>Have you tried paying with card in a taxi in Poland before Uber came up? Somehow, despite MasterCard sticker on the window, the payment terminal always happened to be broken... Also, try taking a non-Uber cab from the airport in Warsaw or Krakow.</i><p>I am from Krak√≥w, I was born there, and I moved out only ~3 years ago. I&#x27;ve been riding taxis ever since childhood. From my perspective, network taxis weren&#x27;t all that bad (it was common knowledge you don&#x27;t use the &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; that park outside airports and railway stations, you probably even remember a TV show that revealed how they scam you if they think you&#x27;re a tourist). Uber itself didn&#x27;t introduce anything substantial over what iCar did a decade before. And while iCar was also playing a bit loose with the regulations, and there were some conflict with the local taxi networks (I recall articles about some tire slashing), they&#x27;ve ultimately managed to settle it through courts and iCar could deliver its value proposition completely legally. Uber didn&#x27;t even bother.')
