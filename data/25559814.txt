It would have to be benchmarking something other than the code in question.<p>Simple analogy: let&#x27;s say you have a program that has 10 functions in it.  You write a benchmark that exercises one of these and never (no, not once, never) calls the other functions.  The other 9 are truly dead code.  Would you expect the benchmark result to be different between that and a program that only included the one function being benchmarked?')
