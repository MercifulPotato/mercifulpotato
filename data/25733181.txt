I just used the idea that was already validated by others.<p>My daily schedule was like:<p>Variant A:<p>- 8 AM to 11 AM work in a cafe on my side project<p>- 12PM - 8PM work at full-time job at office<p>----------<p>Variant B:<p>- 10AM - 6PM work on fulltime job at office<p>- 7PM - 11PM work on side project in a cafe, then go home<p>So actually I was able to get 3-4 hours for side project either in the mornings or in the evenings.<p>Plus, of course, the weekends were dedicated to the side project too.<p>Regarding validation, as I said, I didn&#x27;t validate my idea, because the idea was already validated by others.<p>Pros: you know people need this\nCons: a lot of competitors')
