There isn&#x27;t an `EXAMPLE` section like there are on other man pages and searching for `example` doesn&#x27;t reveal any commands to run. It doesn&#x27;t describe where you can find an example service (unless you magically know that a &quot;system unit&quot; is a service and there&#x27;s even a gotcha to that: it doesn&#x27;t have a `files` section to describe where files are at (contrast with `man ssh_config` or `man nginx`) and it is <i>absolutely</i> not clear that the directory is hidden behind an obscure `pkg-config` invokation. Good luck discovering other services you can learn from by reading their service files!<p>If you managed to do `man systemctl` [2] you reach equally poor documentation. Again, no `files` section and this time not even a <i>mention</i> of `pkg-config`. There&#x27;s a ton of mentions of environment variables (why does the _system_ need environment variables???). It describes how to &quot;list&quot; units but doesn&#x27;t describe that it _won&#x27;t_ list your user units (or, won&#x27;t list the system units if you do --user). It doesn&#x27;t describe how to _create_ a unit. It doesn&#x27;t clearly walk you through the steps (again, there are <i>no examples</i>) so it&#x27;s up to you to figure it out and hope you don&#x27;t fuck up your system.<p>If you search for &quot;just&quot; `systemd`, you arrive at systemd.io [3]. Again, this site is not approachable to a novice! There&#x27;s just lots and lots of reading. A _lot_ of reading. There&#x27;s a few &quot;examples&quot; scattered everywhere in the form of an example command to run and a description of what it does. But _nowhere_ is there a single example with everything tied together into a single Hello World style solution.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux.die.net&#x2F;man&#x2F;8&#x2F;service" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux.die.net&#x2F;man&#x2F;8&#x2F;service</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man7.org&#x2F;linux&#x2F;man-pages&#x2F;man1&#x2F;systemd.1.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man7.org&#x2F;linux&#x2F;man-pages&#x2F;man1&#x2F;systemd.1.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man7.org&#x2F;linux&#x2F;man-pages&#x2F;man1&#x2F;systemctl.1.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man7.org&#x2F;linux&#x2F;man-pages&#x2F;man1&#x2F;systemctl.1.html</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;systemd.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;systemd.io&#x2F;</a>')
