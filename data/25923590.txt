It was originally 350,000 lines of C# developed by 8 people in 5 years and incomplete. It was redeveloped by 3 people (2 had never used F# before) in 30,000 lines, complete in 1 year.<p>They claim zero bugs in the F# redeveloped system (page 29). This example also gets a mention in a Don Syme (F# language designer) talk in 2018[2] with the PowerGen employee in the audience.<p>The PDF cites a testimonial from Kaggle saying they&#x27;re moving more and more of their application into F# which is &quot;shorter, easier to read, easier to refactor, and because of strong typing, contains far fewer bugs&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;research&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;kenji-takeda.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;research&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kU13g_noAQM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kU13g_noAQM</a>')
