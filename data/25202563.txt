I can&#x27;t claim to be unbiased here.<p>I&#x27;ll just note that, from a Bayesian perspective, &quot;trusting experts&quot; is usually not the worst idea and something we&#x27;re basically forced to do every day anyway. I listen to quite a lot of what some of the experts way, but of course, I am completely unable to independently verify that what they say is valid - without decades of experience in the field, this is simply impossible.')
