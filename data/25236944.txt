It was more than capturing text input in a shell. I was showing things like Vim and tmux workflows, so it involved recording my entire terminal at the application level.<p>What I ended up doing was taking individual screenshots of each frame I wanted in the animation. Most of them were only ~5 frames long.<p>Then if needed, I enhanced each screenshot by adding text labels. Like when I demo&#x27;d Vim splits I wanted to put a &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, etc. on each split to make it easier to see what&#x27;s going on.<p>Then I took all of those individual screenshots and fed them into <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ezgif.com&#x2F;maker" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ezgif.com&#x2F;maker</a> which is an online tool that converts screenshots into an animated gif where I was able to configure how long each frame should stay visible before transitioning to the next one.<p>It sounds like a lot of work but it wasn&#x27;t too bad considering I needed to sometimes add graphics to each frame and control the length of each frame.
