At the end of the day, it’s politicians who make the decision on what to support based on contributions and influence from companies with deep pockets and wealthy backers.<p>Additionally, voting doesn’t happen often enough for that to be at the top of our minds among all the other things we <i>have to</i> deal with that have more immediate and visceral impact. Only a small portion of the American population lives well enough to be able to look beyond next month or even next week. Unlike the EU, we are largely reliant on our own resources for major life emergencies, and we’re gathering (or failing to gather) resources to mitigate them.<p>It will take many generations of work to fix that situation so that people can worry more about long term needs rather than staying focused on the short term. It will also take a <i>lot</i> of money that the middle class can’t afford and the wealthy won’t spend.<p>I don’t expect it to happen in my lifetime.')
