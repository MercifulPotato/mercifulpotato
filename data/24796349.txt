Sendgrids support seems to have gotten considerably worse since they married Twilio. I loved Sendgrid several years ago but they seem to be having more issues now and drastically slower to respond to tickets. Some of their older APIs have suddenly stopped working (no code changes on our end, and supposedly no changes on theirs...) and it&#x27;s taking weeks for support to reply. Years ago you&#x27;d be able to chat with someone online almost immediately, now you submit a ticket and hope they respond.')
