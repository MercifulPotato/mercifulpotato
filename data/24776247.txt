Downvoting ought to be limited to a particular subset of comments that does not include simply ones you disagree with. It honestly does smell like censorship. I read some of your other comments, and I don&#x27;t even agree with all of them, but they didn&#x27;t strike me as worthy of minimization.<p>Back on topic, the institutional investors having a diversification default also occurred to me when I read your comments. It raised a lot of questions in my mind that I don&#x27;t have the answers to. What percentage of the market is represented by institutional investment versus non-institutional investment where at least the investors have the option of selective investment over diversification? Can institutional investors break from the diversification strategy without being seen as picking winners, anti-competitive, or gambling with the money? More fundamentally, how do you take a system which operates on 0% information and transform it into something that has at least 1% or 2% information?<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t expect you to answer those questions. Thanks for the food for thought.')
