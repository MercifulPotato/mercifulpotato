Item(by='xamuel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611201384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25851876, text='&gt;You are replacing the usual meaning of AGI (a machine that can execute a wide variety of tasks in human to superhuman fashion) with a far stronger one (a machine that can complete arbitrary tasks perfectly).<p>No, I never make any assumption about AGIs being capable of completing arbitrary tasks perfectly. Indeed, that would be quite impossible, no agent could do that. The point is rather that the traditional RL agent cannot even comprehend environments with non-Archimedean rewards, but a genuine AGI would be able to comprehend them.')
