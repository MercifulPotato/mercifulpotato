The incentives are still there. The structure is still there. The opposing operating group is still there, untouched, as is the source of &quot;contraband&quot;. We don&#x27;t know how many networks exist; how many remain; how many operate successfully within Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x27;s rules while having the same effect as the banned ones (to extend the drug comparison, these would be the causes of the opioid crisis). On a structural level, I don&#x27;t see how FB&#x2F;Twitter can fix this, and don&#x27;t think they would if they knew.')
