They&#x27;ve mostly graduated into a booming economy, got well paying jobs just as they graduated but that might all change in the next few years.<p>I for one am pretty tired of all the doom and gloom inequality nonsense all the time. I did everything right and am not successful story doesn&#x27;t resonate with me at all for one. Most people who went to college and chose a standard, decent major (business, law, medicine, engineering) are doing pretty well for themselves. Yes we had 2008 and things really sucked just as we were graduating, but so what? Lots of people (including me) have dug ourselves out of that deep career hole. Don&#x27;t blame rich people for your nonexistent career. Even if you took away all of Jeff Bezos&#x27; wealth and wiped out college loans, the career you&#x27;ve built for yourself doesn&#x27;t change.')
