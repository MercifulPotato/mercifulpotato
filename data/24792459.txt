Less than a year old old. Treated with kid gloves. Always kept in a case. Pristine condition.<p>An approved Google software update bricked it. This was, by all accounts, a known issue.<p>The phone was under warranty. I sent it back.<p>They shipped me a scratched up refurbished phone. It ran fine for a week then bricked itself due to the same software update. I sent that back.<p>They sent me another, even worse scratched up refurbished phone. That too bricked after a week due to the software update.<p>I&#x27;ve got $3,000 worth of hold charges on my CC whilst Google are playing footsie with my phones. I sent that phone back.<p>They &quot;lost&quot; it and claimed I sent back a different phone. Then that became that I sent back a phone with a different serial number. Then a different model of phone. I pressed for details but they could never tell me any details about the phone I had allegedly sent back.<p>They wanted me to pay for all the phones, then eventually just the one phone that was missing. Finally Google admitted &quot;we lost the phone but that&#x27;s your problem.&quot;<p>After a month I said &quot;fine, you fix this shit or I am doing a charge back.&quot; They didn&#x27;t fix it. I did a credit card charge back for the thousands of dollars currently on hold on my card.<p>Google decided to disable my Google payments account so I couldn&#x27;t use the Playstore. Or buy groceries using Google Pay. Or process any subscription items attached to the Google payments account. Or access my store rewards cards stored in my Google Pay wallet.<p>Google still owed me for the cost of the original phone that was a brick that I no longer possessed after it was sent to Google.<p>I took Google to small claims, and won.<p>Google decided that wasn&#x27;t to their liking and disabled the Google account attached to the phone.<p>Fuck Google.<p>P.S. Please stop up-voting. This is not a vote-worthy post. It is simply a &quot;this is what happened.&quot; Save your attention for something that is worthy. Save your anger for things that matter.')
