Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25720927], score=None, time=1610305136, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25717401, text='Of course &#x27;it should be serious&#x27; ... but the reality is that politics is 90% theatre, and the current President&#x27;s primary skill is this arena: &#x27;The Apprentice&#x27; is work of masterful reality TV fiction, that is passed of as &#x27;reality&#x27;.<p>Here is an angle that he could have taken:<p>&quot;When I first became President they showed me some things.<p>Very, very interesting things.<p>Things you wouldn&#x27;t believe.<p>Crazy things, that have been going on for the last 100 years.<p>UFOs. Secret Wars. Weapons. China. Russia.<p>... and a lot more.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t even believe me without the facts!<p>I said: &#x27;The American people have a right to know!&#x27;<p>But they said: &#x27;This is classified Mr. President, and it&#x27;s too sensitive for them&#x27;.<p><i>They</i> have blocked me the whole time!<p><i>They</i> are so afraid that you might find out the Truth!<p><i>They</i> have been covering up for decades!<p>You, the American people, have a right to know!<p>But <i>they</i> are going to do everything they can to stop me.<p>The bureaucrats. The hidden apparatus. The press. The Agencies.<p>They don&#x27;t believe you can handle the truth, but I DO!<p>I&#x27;m the President, but I can tell you that I&#x27;m putting my life in danger by doing this.<p>They will stop at nothing to keep these secrets!<p>If you re-elect me, I&#x27;m going to declassify it.<p>All of it!<p>NO. MORE. SECRETS!<p>UFOs. The wars. The &#x27;other species&#x27;. The other side of the moon. The spacecraft - I&#x27;m telling you all of it!<p>You have a right to know!<p>It&#x27;s time for Real Freedom, America!&quot;<p>...<p>So this is much better reality TV theatre because despite the fact there&#x27;s some legitimacy to information clearing, it would be largely, politically benign.<p>But it plays right into a deeply held populist concern in America and that is of course &#x27;all those secrets&#x27; and it&#x27;s a non-partisan issue.<p>It also plays right into his &#x27;Me vs. the Evil Bureaucracy&#x27; populist narrative.<p>It&#x27;s the &#x27;ultimate conspiracy&#x27; with Libertarian shades that even more serious, intellectual types can buy into on some level - I mean really <i>who wouldn&#x27;t want to see all those secrets</i>?<p>It&#x27;s very tantalizing I think to everyone.<p>Most importantly - it&#x27;s not hateful or divisive - a more benign kind of snake oil.<p>Instead of &#x27;Insurrection on Capitol Hill&#x27; - you get &#x27;Insurrection at Area 51&#x27; - which is a nice place to keep the plebes occupied.')
