Item(by='sofixa', descendants=None, kids=[25562451], score=None, time=1609183527, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25561243, text='&gt; It seems the average Big Mac meal is $6 these days. It provides approximately 1,000 calories, and the average person needs approximately 2,000 per day, so we&#x27;ll assume you&#x27;ll need to order two. That puts the food costs at $12 per person<p>Yeah, i assumed so. Eating Big Macs is... let&#x27;s say suboptimal. If you eat only that, you&#x27;ll probably have all sorts of health issues. When counting actual food, fresh and with vegetables and all that, it&#x27;s slightly more expensive than Big Macs. Around here, cheapest option for a decent actual meal is ~8-10&#x2F;eur&#x2F;person.<p>&gt; The average cost to install a kitchen is around $60,000<p>Seriously? In France fancy kitchens are at 10k, &quot;starter&quot; ( recommended if you&#x27;re going to let or for first buy) are at 2k, everything included. I guess if you start from $60k, you need to cook quite a bit more to make it financially viable.<p>And that&#x27;s if you have close to no dietary or allergic restrictions.')
