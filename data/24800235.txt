Scuba tanks are at anywhere from 160 bar to 240 bar. The usual sort of compressor you&#x27;d use for running your tools tops out at 8 bar.<p>Make no mistake, 8 bar escaping from a compressor is no joke. It&#x27;s the equivalent of two elephants worth of air suddenly entering the room. It&#x27;ll rupture eardrums and shatter windows but the building will still be standing. I wouldn&#x27;t be so sure about that when a scuba tank decides to explode though.')
