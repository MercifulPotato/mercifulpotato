Read it as &quot;to regulate them well watch what they&#x27;re doing&quot;. Nitpicking is a great way of showing you hold a crap hand.<p>[from another comment] &gt; I fail to see how regulation of regulators is somehow invulnerable to the same failures<p>It is not, it&#x27;s just more impervious because regulators by design <i>have</i> to work in a more transparent fashion and there is some accountability, even if at the next elections. The players being regulated are usually completely opaque and there is no real accountability.<p>And just because something isn&#x27;t infallible doesn&#x27;t mean you have to throw it away.<p>Looking at all your comments in this post it seems you have very strong opinions and you don&#x27;t let facts get in their way.')
