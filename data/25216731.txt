With the help of some custom components they can do that for a hundred bucks.<p>I&#x27;m slightly hesitant to go into it for mostly ethical reasons, but military technology has always fascinated me if purely because of the toys they get to play with. The amount of gear even a World War 2 aircraft had by the end of still surprises me, i.e. The Mosquito had a primitive version of what we would now call a HUD displaying a radar horizon and a gunsight. Know-how and an unlimited budget go a very long way.')
