I spent a couple hours total mechanically stripping the char. I read this article. I bought the flax oil.<p>I kept putting off actually doing it.  Why?<p>It&#x27;s gonna smoke.  I have a small one bedroom apartment.<p>It&#x27;s gonna take an hour of baking and two hours of cooling for each coat.<p>It&#x27;s gonna need at least six coats. Just the time investment seemed insane on a one-pan scale: 18 hours of oven use, plus applying the coats, plus a risk of starting over if something she thinks is obvious wasn&#x27;t mentioned (this happens to me quite a lot, since &quot;Reality Has a Surprising Amount of Detail&quot;...).<p>A pre-seasoned replacement cast iron pan is like $50.<p>I bought a dutch oven cast iron set and donated the old pan to whomever picked it up in the waste room of my building, with a note on it.')
