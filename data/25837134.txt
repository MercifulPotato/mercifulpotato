This is an interesting story posted on somebody&#x27;s blog. If I tell my friends a cool story, I would need to walk them through the story and drop the punch line&#x2F;conclusion at the end. I also enjoy it very much when somebody tell me a story that way. Not everything, even technical teardown, needs more efficient allocation of effort.<p>Interestingly, this is the second time I see this kind of comment recently and turns out it&#x27;s from the same person.
