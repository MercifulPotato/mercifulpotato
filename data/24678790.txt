I have a negative bias towards psychiatrists myself. Experiences with psychologists weren&#x27;t that great either until I went into therapy with an analytical psychologist. None of this mindfulness stuff, which I practiced myself for years already, but a complete focus on actually figuring things out and understanding why I see things the way I do. \nI don&#x27;t think there is a single answer for everyone (not implying that you think so). The psychologist doesn&#x27;t really stop me from talking about experiences with drugs, but doesn&#x27;t really see it as something helpful.<p>I currently see my illness as existing of two components; genetic and environmental triggers. Stress and drugs, together with past trauma interact with my genetic disposition towards psychosis&#x2F;mania.<p>Drinking less coffee, sticking to a routine, no drugs (particularly psychedelics),  and sorting through my internal web of views with a psychologist, it looks liek that&#x27;s the solution for me. Medication is part of it, mainly to provide some stabilization while I sort things out. It doesn&#x27;t really jive well with how psychiatrists go about things though, in my experience, since they seem to think I have to be on it til the end of time. I would love to have contact with a psychiatrist I trust, so I could make some sense out of the medication part of my healing process.')
