Hell, I even like going to the mall every so often.  It&#x27;s nice to just go and see things in person, especially combining it with a nice beverage&#x2F;snack&#x2F;meal.  I am a dedicated Amazon shopper, but I don&#x27;t see myself giving up on retail anytime soon.  As fast as Amazon is, it is not instant, and that gratification is important to many folks.<p>I think HN commenters aren&#x27;t your typical shopper, so I&#x27;d be wary of believing the echo chamber.  I bet the average HN commenter also doesn&#x27;t fall for &quot;luxury&quot; brands or the related &quot;mating displays&quot; which seem to be so important to many people.  But there are a lot of people who do like those things.  They like to dress up and show off among other members of their species.  Retail may shrink, but it isn&#x27;t going away unless human psychology suddenly undergoes a fundamental change.')
