I spent 9 years of college and then grad school using exclusively either vi or emacs because I believed IDEs were a crutch that weak engineers relied upon. It wasn&#x27;t until I got a real job that I found myself forced to learn a proper IDE (IntelliJ).<p>It blew my mind just how powerful the IDE was and how it massively increased my productivity. Putting aside code completion and code generate, I found it much easier to navigate a codebase using a proper IDE that fully understood the language. When I contrast that to my previous solution, a highly customized emacs configuration with lots of packages and my own functions, the two just don&#x27;t compare.')
