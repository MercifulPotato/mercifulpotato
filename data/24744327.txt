It&#x27;s not fair for an elected representative to stand up for him? How about a 17 year old? How about a person who&#x27;s in prison, and therefore can&#x27;t vote (in some states)?<p>For certain policy aspects, such as national security and defense, it absolutely makes sense to actively exclude and ignore the concerns of non-citizens. They are really not &#x27;true constituents&#x27;. But for most other things, the person who&#x27;s considered a constituent is a law-abiding, tax-paying person, not a persona non-grata (that would be the illegal immigrants aka &#x27;undocumented immigrants&#x27; whose cause is taken up with gusto by both political parties); it is absolutely the responsibility of the elected representative to pay attention to his concerns.')
