It&#x27;s also painless to manage secrets by sourcing in optional files. It also works nicely when you want files living across 2 systems (such as WSL 2 and Windows) where on a Windows box you consider certain Windows files dotfiles even though technically they exist elsewhere.<p>I&#x27;ve been managing my dotfiles like this for a few years and it seems to be working out well not just for myself but others who have want to use them either partially or in full. I open sourced them here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nickjj&#x2F;dotfiles" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nickjj&#x2F;dotfiles</a><p>I purposely broke up some of the commands because I know that not everyone will want a 100% replica of my dotfiles. Folks copy &#x2F; paste only the commands they want.')
