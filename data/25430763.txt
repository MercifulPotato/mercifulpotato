They route all your packets. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it is Comcast at home or Verizon&#x2F;Att on the go. They know where you live and work and track you 24&#x2F;7.

Just like the electric company doesn&#x27;t track&#x2F;sell what I use my electricity on, the ISP shouldn&#x27;t \ntrack&#x2F;sell what I use my data.')
