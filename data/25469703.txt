It&#x27;s not my model.<p>That someone else created the model and you believe it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s true.<p>&gt; You have to come up with a persuasive answer to &quot;Why should I work as hard as I can on this company, rather than go work for Google?&quot; That question is in fact so hard that it (possibly) almost killed YC in the crib, back in &#x27;08. No one wants to work for a startup when they can get paid far more and live an easier life.<p>Actually, I don&#x27;t.  Honestly, you seem kind of set in your thinking, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the effort to try to figure out how to persuade you out of your misconceptions.  There are counterexamples even in this subthread that falsify your model.  It&#x27;s up to you to either be open to them or not.')
