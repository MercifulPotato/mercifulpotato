After spending hours learning tachyons syntax and googling about 17,000 times, I had forgotten the tailwind way. And when I went back to tailwind I had to google every time I wanted to add a style again.<p>Ultimately, CSS frameworks don&#x27;t save you time unless you pick 1, customize it to your needs, and do front-end stuff full-time so you don&#x27;t forget the syntax.')
