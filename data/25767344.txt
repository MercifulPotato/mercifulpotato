But they did - or rather this is a justification, not specifically a defense. I was just adding on to the previous posters suggested reasoning, which is hinting at something more like a cover story for using non-GPL compiler. Of course they are free to do that too, but no need to publish silly comparisons to justify, rationalize, or defend it.')
