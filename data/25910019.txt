If you have a bag filled with a million playing cards, and you inspect 1000 of them and they&#x27;re all red, that&#x27;s pretty good evidence that there aren&#x27;t any black cards in the bag! But blind followers of the &quot;absence of evidence&quot; dogma would say &quot;No it isn&#x27;t! Just because you haven&#x27;t found a black card yet doesn&#x27;t say anything about whether there are any black cards at all.&quot; which is clearly nonsense.<p>The differentiating factor is <i>have you looked?</i><p>I think it&#x27;s reasonable for people to assume the WHO had actually investigated how people contracted covid (otherwise why bother tweeting?), in which case them saying &quot;[we looked but] we couldn&#x27;t find any evidence of human to human transmission&quot; is clearly misleading.')
