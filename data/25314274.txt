As long as people keep rewarding device manufacturers who treat owners as tenants it will progress. I wish people would just stop buying this garbage. They won&#x27;t, though-- they see the features but not the down-side.<p>The next step will be hard-coded DoH server IPs. Sly owners will NAT those to a transparent MiTM proxy.<p>Then device manufacturers will counter with certificate pinning for DoH. That will be &quot;game over&quot;, and the device manufacturers win. (It&#x27;ll be a double-win, actually. It will put a hard &quot;expiration date&quot; on the device&#x27;s functionality when a link in the PKI chain expires.)<p>I believe the owner of a device has right to control the device&#x27;s network traffic (and, more generally, control of the code running on the device). Business models that rely on taking away an owner&#x27;s control of their rightfully-purchased general purpose computing devices are really rental models and should be handled as such.<p>I eschew these kinds of devices, use or create self-hosted solutions where I can, and just do without when I can&#x27;t. It does make me a little sad that I can&#x27;t get some of these cool &quot;living in the future&quot;-type devices, but I&#x27;d be sadder to have my home festooned with manufacturer-controlled surveillance and advertising delivery devices.<p>I wish there was a way to convince the average non-technical person of the merits of owner control. Given the enthusiastic responses in favor of allowing device manufacturers to mistreat owners I see from the Hacker News community, though, even convincing technical people is a lost cause. It feels like most people really want to be subjugated. It doesn&#x27;t seem ratioinal.<p>I do recognize that the Hacker News community also includes some of the people who profit from subjugation of device owners. Their motivation seems rational (if not sociopathic).')
