Sometimes it&#x27;s a tree, a graph, a list, rich text and so on.\nI think it would really be helpful if it was dead simple, to setup a visualization of a class or a group of classes, directly in code (as part of the PL) and have them update in real time.\nRight now it&#x27;s &quot;execute, dump graphviz code, drop it into graphiz&quot;.\nThen hopefully every class has a visualization just like every class (should) have Tests.\nRight now almost all of my classes have a &quot;string Debug() const&quot;, method, to see it&#x27;s content.')
