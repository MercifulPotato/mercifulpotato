Nobody writes 100x&quot;InCel&quot; on a manifesto.<p>Religious morals, if stripped of the whole superstitious nonsense, leaves behind the &quot;everybody gets a chance&quot; pacifier. For all other forms of society its boils down too some feudal harem dropping a few outdated flowers and one is desperate enough to pick from the outdated left-over men-heap.<p>This always was and has been a solid basis for civil war, for if all you got is your life,and there is no perspective for it to ever be good, why not put it as bargaining chip into the ultimate equalizing game - which civil war is.<p>Sorry to say it, but all those nice little social games like ménage à trois are entertainment for those who never came near these problems. And i doubt that a lot of those advocating for this as solution, ever were poor enough, long enough &amp; lonely enough, to not become &quot;clingy and desperate&quot;, aka jealousy. \nWhile we are at it - may i also point out, that the usual - all female secretary pool at headquarters- suspiciously looks like economic opportunity harems and thus a lot of commentary by company owners will be very tone-deaf by nature.')
