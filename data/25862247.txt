It&#x27;s like saying &quot;Ideas that makes sense to the lower class don&#x27;t always make sense to the top 1% net-worth people. For example taxing the rich more. For the top 1% net-worth individuals, _everyone_ meets the criteria and therefore they are unfairly taxed&quot;.<p>How you cluster people is irrelevant for a policy to be fair or not. It&#x27;s petty to chose what gives you an advantage. You should stick to a set of values and agree on policies that better express those values.')
