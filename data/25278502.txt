My friend and I are bootstrapping a startup that would primarily cater to Pakistan audience. We are hosted on AWS and use Stripe for payment processing etc, like most startups. Even if we wanted to host something in Pakistan (which we don&#x27;t), no such infrastructure exists and we are in place to hire any dev resources in Pakistan either.<p>Per the article,  if you are not hosted in Pakistan, Govt will fine you 3.x, which will probably kill our project, but it&#x27;s not clear how Pak Govt can find us if we have no presence there?')
