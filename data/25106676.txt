Item(by='VLM', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605487972, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25099831, text='I have an interesting setup with home assistant similar to your needs<p>Power the bed reading light lamp with a zen15 zooz inline switch which is never shut off but can monitor current and power continuously.  So now homeassistant knows when my bed reading light is on or off based on if the lamp is drawing more than 3 watts or less.  Which means it can control my ceiling fan appropriately AND dimmable room light bulbs AND mess with the thermostat depending on outside temperature &#x2F; mode.  And maybe other options someday in the future.<p>Some effort to set up the hardware, maybe 30 lines of YAML automation code, but it is nice and convenient.<p>I have a &quot;reading desk lamp&quot; in my basement lab that does similar tricks.  Desk lamp no current drawn means my soldering iron and some other apparatus has its power removed.  Improves safety a little.<p>If my youngest kid were not an older teen, I&#x27;ve been thinking about wifi&#x2F;bluetooth presence detection such that my table saw has no electrical power if my phone isn&#x27;t within X feet of the saw.  A kind of similar automation but different opportunity.')
