Were they supposed to know this guy&#x27;s unwritten expectations?<p>I suspect you&#x27;re either autistic or a lawyer being obstinate. Human society is full of unwritten expectations, we learn these quickly as a child or face social consequences. No where in the law is it written that you must say &#x27;please&#x27; and &#x27;thank you&#x27; but it&#x27;s also expected and people are less likely to do things for you again if you don&#x27;t.<p>So consider this situation now:<p>_A person (the dev) did something nice for someone else (a trillion dollar company) and they didn&#x27;t bother to say thank you._')
