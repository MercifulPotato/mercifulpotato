There does not necessarily need to  be some grievous consequences to justify jail - let&#x27;s keep things in perspective, &quot;just&quot; defrauding your customers isn&#x27;t innocuous, it absolutely justifies a criminal investigation and putting people behind bars, not just some monetary fine to the organization.')
