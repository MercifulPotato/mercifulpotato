Item(by='013a', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607445369, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345832, text='Frankly, I&#x27;ve owned several in-ear products from various companies (Shure, Sony, Bose, UE), and none of them hit the sound quality of the Airpods Pro. None of them. Maybe once you get in to $400+ IEMs, but I&#x27;m not spending <i>that</i> much on IEMs.<p>Similarly, the HomePod. I have used a Nest Audio (returned), Nest Hub Max (returned), Echo Studio (returned), a Sony GTK-XB7 (really like this one for parties as it gets very loud), and a UE Hyperboom (also really like this one as it has a 24 hour battery). HomePod has the best audio quality. Are there <i>speakers</i> that are better? Oh hell yes; I have a pair of Mackie MR5s that blow the Homepod out of the water. But also, they&#x27;re five times the size.<p>I would not put it past Apple to do something great with these. In my mind, they&#x27;ve established themselves as being a top-tier audio equipment manufacturer, alongside Sennheiser, Sony, Grado, Beyerdynamic, etc, and I really think the people who don&#x27;t believe this just haven&#x27;t been using their full scope of audio products.<p>I do think one needs to answer whether $500+ is something one is willing to spend on a piece of audio equipment. Its a ton of money, and audio naturally has a rate of exponential decay of return (you can get 95% of the audio quality of $1000+ headphones with a $100 pair of the <i>right</i> ones). That&#x27;s a separate question from whether they deliver value previously only seen in $800+ devices. If they can do that, then these are worth it to some people.')
