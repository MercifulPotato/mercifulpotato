China is totalitarian which the US isn&#x27;t, and the US doesn&#x27;t execute as many people, but still the US locks up a larger percentage of its population than China.<p>The US is better than China, but that&#x27;s a low bar, and in a few areas it&#x27;s only barely clearing that bar.<p>In other areas it&#x27;s a lot better of course. Censorship is the big one. Also, the way China has oppressed some minorities (Uyghurs) hasn&#x27;t happened in the US in decades (black people, native Americans). And the oppression did happen in a different way. But &quot;different&quot; isn&#x27;t always better.')
