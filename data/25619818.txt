This topic is more complex then simply replacing the F-22 with F-35 as most government decisions on multi-million dollar projects with state interests in mind are.<p>The F-22 was cancelled because the military thought that they didn&#x27;t needed to spend the money on air superiority fighters and wanted to use the money elsewhere (drones and bombers). I don&#x27;t think the F-35 was in the discussion that much... they fired the top leaders of the Air Force at this time.<p>Robert Gates killed the F-22 and fired the chief of staff of the Air Force Moseley and secretary Wynne. Since then we knew it was a mistake and tried to restart the F-22 line. It didn&#x27;t make sense for cost.<p>Gates has his own book Duty which references this quite a bit and is a great political read <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Duty-Memoirs-Secretary-at-War&#x2F;dp&#x2F;030794963X" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Duty-Memoirs-Secretary-at-War&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0307...</a><p>And there is another book that argues it was a bad idea.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Air-Power-Abandoned-Betrayal-Americas&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0986320013" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Air-Power-Abandoned-Betrayal-Americas...</a><p>Also:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;the-war-zone&#x2F;20472&#x2F;retired-general-says-f-22-production-was-killed-so-that-a-new-bomber-could-live" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;the-war-zone&#x2F;20472&#x2F;retired-general-...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airforcetimes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;your-air-force&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;10&#x2F;former-air-force-chief-of-staff-talks-rpas-budget-cuts-and-his-regrets-about-shrinking-the-force&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airforcetimes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;your-air-force&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;10...</a><p>This one is funny because they talk about the increased costs of the B-2 due to cutting it early..... as they cut the F-22.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airforcemag.com&#x2F;schwartz-in-memoir-says-f-22-was-traded-for-b-21-bomber&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airforcemag.com&#x2F;schwartz-in-memoir-says-f-22-was...</a>')
