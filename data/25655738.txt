It can be used to fetch data, or play a scenario (sequence of requests), asserting responses along the way. With its textual format, it is aimed for both devops and developers. With its command-line usage&#x2F;simple unique binary, it is aimed for both local dev and continuous integration.<p>We&#x27;ve build Hurl to address our needs of integration tests. We&#x27;ve tried various solutions but all were flawed in some ways: difficult to integrate in a CI, not reliable etc... At the end of the day, we just wanted curl with the possibility to add tests, so we build it. We&#x27;re using Hurl in our CI&#x2F;CD from more than one year and are very happy with it!<p>Currently, releases are available for both Linux and macOS. Though we would like to add more features, our main objective is to keep it small, fast and simple.<p>Let us know what you think!')
