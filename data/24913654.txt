Vitamin D is fat-soluble so your body stores it in fat.<p>Because of this, levels are generally stable over a period of months. Although there are health conditions that cause vitamin D levels to fall (particularly chronic kidney disease), it&#x27;s highly implausible that COVID-19 itself could cause vitamin D deficiency directly.<p>Even if COVID-19 were to cause kidney issues and you didn&#x27;t see sunlight for two weeks, it wouldn&#x27;t move someone with adequate vitamin D levels into the deficient range. The time period is simply too short.')
