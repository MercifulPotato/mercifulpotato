It’s not as bad but similar to the way that the Android watch market dried up when Qualcomm chose to keep shipping 2014 chips which ruled out most of what designers might want to build.<p>This gives Apple complete control of their product direction and especially the ability to build unique features which aren’t easy to match - Dell’s design is limited to the combinations which Intel offers unless they pony up a large amount of R&amp;D and get Microsoft on-board but Apple can customize their integrated chips for the exact thermal&#x2F;size&#x2F;power characteristics they need.<p>That’s a big commitment but it’s something they’ve been very successful at in the mobile space so I wouldn’t bet against them.')
