Maybe it would work this way. Maybe.<p>In reality, your compensation is a function of your negotiating power. Some people, in fact, manage to get the same pay even when working remote, because they&#x27;re &quot;highly employable&quot;. Others don&#x27;t.<p>And let me add: I almost agree that remote work shouldn&#x27;t necessarily command the same pay. A company&#x27;s goal is to &quot;extract&quot; from each employee more value than his&#x2F;her&#x2F;their salary. If a company manages to save on a salary because the employee doesn&#x27;t have much negotiating power, good for the company.<p>This is not to say that a company should do anything it wants, far from it. It simply means that if you accept that you live in a market-enabled society, your salary is at stake, too. You want to pay $2 dollars for milk, instead of $20? That&#x27;s thanks to competition between companies. That&#x27;s market forces at play. You want it there? Accept it on salary negotiation too.')
