The lower limit of human hearing is 20Hz. It is not possible to hear &lt;20Hz noise. It is, however, possible to <i>feel</i> it, if the sound pressure is loud enough and you actually have a subwoofer capable of reproducing those frequencies, but that is rather unlikely unless your subwoofer is a cut-out in your room&#x27;s wall with a fan in it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rotary_woofer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rotary_woofer</a><p>If you feed a 20Hz signal to a typical home subwoofer (or even most club systems) and hear something, you aren&#x27;t hearing 20Hz. You are hearing a bunch of high frequency rubbing noises as the speaker cone moves at 20Hz, trying and utterly failing to couple any amount of energy at that frequency into the air. This is why many songs these days are produced with &quot;bass maximizers&quot; and why modern laptops can sometimes have &quot;decent bass&quot;. It&#x27;s not bass, it&#x27;s a filter that purposely distorts the bass, which your speakers can&#x27;t reproduce, into higher frequencies, which it can and which we&#x27;ve learned to associate with heavy bass played through systems that can&#x27;t reproduce it but distort instead.<p>Just for reference, I believe these are the subs we use at Euskal Encounter. I can vouch for the fact that they can make the floor shake in a massive event hall venue. Low end response: down to 28Hz. No more.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jblpro.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;vtx-b18" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jblpro.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;vtx-b18</a><p>It is indeed better to modulate data in ultrasound since you have a lot more bandwidth - except for the fact that any lossy compression applied to your file is going to completely destroy your data. This is one thing the author got absolutely right.')
