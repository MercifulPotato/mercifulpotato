Two memory allocations should now return different pointers (because the MTE nibble is different) therefore the comparision should fail. Unless ofcourse the application was using this undefined behavior (which would be very buggy since malloc can randomly refuse to reuse the same address even though it was freed and therefore create extremely hard and difficult to track bugs).')
