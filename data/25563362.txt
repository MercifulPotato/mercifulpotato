This is a skill, and it is one that you can learn to be good at.<p>That enthusiasm is just the polite enthusiasm of a sales call. It may require a few minutes of reading and thinking (because tbh I also see a lot of folks who have no idea what a company does when they go in to interview), but it is almost always either a baseline &quot;do they get what we do here?&quot; check (which is what you can learn and practice for) <i>or</i> it is a cult you should avoid.')
