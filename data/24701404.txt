And, because Hanford had some of the first [large scale] reactors ever built, they did not know much about what the requirements of long-term safety and storage would even be.<p>80 years later, we know a lot more, and have a different set of expectations for how to store and handle nuclear waste.<p>It&#x27;s fair to be skeptical, but not fair to condemn them based on past mistakes which have been specifically addressed. It would be like saying modern cars must be unsafe, because cars from the 1940s don&#x27;t have seatbelts or airbags. It doesn&#x27;t follow.<p>You could also say &quot;well, we know about some safety issues, but what about the ones we don&#x27;t know about yet?&quot; but that attitude extends to all of science and engineering as well. We have to proceed with caution, but proceed nonetheless.')
