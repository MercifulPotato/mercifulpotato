Each with its own quirks. Some small, some uncomfortable, some not breathable, some with a weird smell after lying not-used for too long in the closet.<p>I just want to buy 10-15 identical t-shirts, and not have to think which one to wear for what occasion.<p>Are there any t-shirts which fulfill all, or most, of the following requirements?<p>- comfortable<p>- long-lasting (does not stretch&#x2F;shrink too much over time)<p>- not staining other clothes during washing (so, probably some neutral color)<p>- breathable<p>- easy to wash and dry (30-40*C machine-washable, ok for tumble-drying)<p>- non-synthetic (e.g. cotton, linen, wool)<p>Purpose:<p>- wearing at home through the day as base layer<p>- running&#x2F;gym<p>- sleeping (as pyjamas)<p>Color&#x2F;brand doesn&#x27;t matter, but eco-friendly manufacturing process as whole would be a good bonus.')
