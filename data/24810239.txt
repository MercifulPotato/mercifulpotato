Switching between keyboard and mouse already takes longer than typing the usual vim-commands for a simple action.<p>And casual keyboard-commands just don&#x27;t scale well. Moving cursor x chars means you must type the movement-key x times. With vi you just type the number x and the movement, and usually save big time.<p>Aditionally, vi has more knowledge about textual objects, which are all interchangable. So whether you move 3 chars, words, paragraphs, pages or functions, it&#x27;s all the same, just with different letters.<p>Vi&#x27;s command-language is highly composable and thus very dense, so it will alwys be faster than mouse and casual editor-commands. Of course as long as you habit them.')
