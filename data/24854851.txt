It has benefitted me and hundreds of millions of other Indians. I remember the absolute unusable state of mobile data in the country before Jio. Now I literally don&#x27;t notice if my wifi goes out, because Jio&#x27;s network is so good, and they made it cheap enough for everyone to be able to afford it.<p>When regulation gets in the way of public good, it deserves to be circumvented. More power to Jio and Mukesh Ambani.<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t see why telcos going bankrupt implies taxpayer bailout. If that is what will happen, it will be a fault of the government, not Jio.')
