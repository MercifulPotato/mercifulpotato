Unfortunately it is not taught in CS programs AFAIK.  I rarely implement any tree kind of algorithms other than a simple tree visitor.<p>An understanding of time&#x2F;space complexity (Big O Notation) is also relevant to evaluating approaches.  A senior level developer will use this to make high level choices.<p>I also use compiler theory when writing parsers and simple DSL languages.<p>Honestly, never really had to deal much with red-black trees or linked list algorithms.')
