There&#x27;s already something like this in the way some stock options are handled: individuals are taxed at exercise on the difference between the FMV and the strike price, whether they sell or not. I don&#x27;t see why a similar principal couldn&#x27;t be made to work with actual equities, at least for some high-value accounts&#x2F;holdings.')
