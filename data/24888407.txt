We, as humans, know that it would be silly to think that some configurations could happen. We know there&#x27;s no reason to expect Biden to win Alabama outside of him winning nearly every state.<p>A statistical model only has a vague idea of context&#x2F;the real world. It looks at polls (and probably not really that many polls of Alabama or Mississippi or Alaska) and sees that, statistically, Biden should win 3% of the time or so.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have a specific world set of events in mind that would cause that, it just knows that that&#x27;s how the numbers go, and thus may lead to weird circumstances in the grander results because it has to make the world match the numbers in these small corners.')
