Why did you just say that philosophy can help us address a long list of questions if you&#x27;re willing to concede that maybe philosophy isn&#x27;t for answering questions at all.<p>OP wants answers. They want to develop a personal philosophy. They are not looking to &quot;expand their horizons&quot; or &quot;question everything.&quot;<p>&gt; there&#x27;s also arguably no way to &quot;objectively&quot; tell who is right in philosophy, as what that even means or what standards we use is itself open to debate.<p>Then it&#x27;s not going to be very useful to OP, is it? It&#x27;s like using a random number generator to predict the Powerball. &quot;One of these numbers will win. Can&#x27;t say which, though.&quot;')
