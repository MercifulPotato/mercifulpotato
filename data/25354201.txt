They also had a Cassandra database and several servers for their front-end. They were paying $7,000 a month for this.<p>Like, if you&#x27;re paying AWS to host MongoDB on four EC2 machines with 256gb of RAM each and no autoscaling&#x2F;load balancing, you can spend a lot of money. But... why would you do that? Porting terrible architectures to cloud VMs with no rearchitecting costs a boatload, but... don&#x27;t do that?')
