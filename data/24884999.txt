I don&#x27;t really care about that as I mostly listen to music or watch movies, but if lag is important to you (say for video-conferencing or games) then the usb-wireless may be a better route. But I get the feeling that those models don&#x27;t really attempt to address high audio quality.<p>Is there any benchmark out there for bluetooth audio lag vs usb-wireless?')
