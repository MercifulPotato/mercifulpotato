Ammonia is flammable between 15% and 28% and takes 680 millijoules to ignite. It takes much more energy to ignite ammonia and there&#x27;s a much narrower range of mixtures with air where it can support combustion. Ammonia does not form explosive mixtures with air. (Hydrogen is in the explosive range between 18.3% and 59%.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flammability_limit#Examples" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flammability_limit#Examples</a>')
