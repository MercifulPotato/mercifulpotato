The roads and sidewalks won&#x27;t be maintained; certainly not to the original quality.<p>Of course, a major reason why the neighborhood will become low income is precisely because of the aging infrastructure. Middle income home buyers expect brand-new everything. It creates a cycle of sprawl. On the other hand, it does leave in its wake alot of affordable housing.')
