It has to do with power.<p>As a local businessman I can ruin someone’s life by applying the right legal pressure. Likewise, if one of my customers is reliant on my product to run their own business, and I drop them suddenly (akin to what google sometimes does), that could ruin them. But it’s not because I’m a monopoly, only because people rely on me. Monopoly implies there’s no choice, and while that IS true with google and search. It is not implied by “arbitrary, impossible to appeal, and may ruin you”. The two are distinct (though often related) problems that are both exemplified in Google.')
