Working for 2 hours is easy. Working for 4 hours requires a break. Working for 8 hours requires the lunch break, and a few minor breaks. How often can you see people socializing or reading web during the 8 hours? With 2 hours, you would just do your work, and go socializing or reading web during your free time.<p>On the other hand, sometimes you get work-related ideas when not working. With 2 hours a day, you would usually come to work with a very clear idea of what to do. When I work on my projects in my free time, I often realize that taking breaks more often would actually make me more productive, because I would have thought about a simpler solution before having written a more complicated one.<p>Also, people use some of their free time to learn new things related to their craft. Working 15 hours a week would give you a lot of free time.<p>I agree that with 7 times more time you accomplish more, but definitely not 7 times more. Maybe 3 times more. And your private life would probably suffer a lot.')
