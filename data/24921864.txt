Really not much like it.<p>That said, it is probably the game which MOST needs a freemium pricing model. Convincing everyone you want to play with to drop $20 on a game can be a prohibitive hurdle. No problem for other gamers in your life, but non-gaming family&#x2F;friends&#x2F;co-workers...that&#x27;s a huge lift.<p>I&#x27;d be way more eager to pay double, if it meant I was unlocking &quot;host&quot; abilities to start the game, while everyone else could join for free in an app&#x2F;website.')
