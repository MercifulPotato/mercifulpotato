Modern Android and iOS are so insanely complex, it seems impossible to do the simplest things with code. Yes you can root your phone, and you have access to (Android) source code including 3rd party FOSS apps and build tools. However, writing code, building, and iterating on the device is almost non-existent (I don&#x27;t consider termux an ideal fit), not to mention the sandboxing&#x2F;protections that are in place.<p>The hacker spirit still seems very much alive in the SailfishOS community. The community isn&#x27;t big, but people come up with smart ideas that leverage existing solutions. SSH in, write Python code, write QML, zypp install build tools, pip install libraries (inside virtualenv), execute it, see changes on screen, hook into the existing system using xdg standards and dbus, manage services with systemd. It&#x27;s fun to hack on.<p>If I had to characterise it, Android&#x2F;iOS vs SailfishOS, is the equivalent to Java vs Python. The former is well-engineered, secure, perhaps overly architected, and widely used for &quot;serious&quot; and Enterprise solutions. It certainly has good reasons for how it does things. The latter is more organic; the same solutions can be achieved (with certain caveats) but with less hassle.<p>From a developer perspective, Android and iOS have sucked all the fun and creativity out of the devices.<p>* Sorry about piggybacking off top post, I just found that it strongly resonated what I&#x27;ve thought.')
