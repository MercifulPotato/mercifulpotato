In practice, legitimate cash businesses are more and more rare as time goes on, and investigators are really good at noticing when some random nail salon or bar has a lot more revenue than they should.<p>I actually worked for 8 months as an intern at Fintrac, Canada&#x27;s financial intel agency. This was 14 years ago now, but back then they were actually pretty good at what they did, for a group with ~300 people. They just had analysts going through vast amounts of data manually, but with plans to improve the tooling, automate more. I can only guess at how far along they&#x27;ve come now.<p>The reality is, if you&#x27;re moving more money than you should you&#x27;ll get it caught eventually. And the more you&#x27;re moving, the more likely you are to be noticed.')
