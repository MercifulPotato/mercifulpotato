Really happy with both the workflow and the result[1]. I&#x27;ve settled on a pretty simple system with three main files:<p>ideas.org → outline.org → slides.org<p>I start with unstructured thoughts, turn them into a structure of a presentation and then into concrete slides, all in roughly the same format. With Emacs, it&#x27;s easy to navigate between all three files, view them side-by-side, copy&#x2F;paste between them and make high-level structural changes like reordering slides, all in the same editor I use for everything else.<p>As a bonus, the defaults are pretty much the opposite of PowerPoint: the path of least resistance is to make simpler, more consistent slides with less text on each one.<p>I&#x27;d use this for <i>any</i> sort of presentation, but it&#x27;s particularly useful for code. I can easily copy-paste code from my files into slides.org, and I get syntax highlighting in the editor to help catch mistakes. I can use syntax highlighting in the generated slides or not, depending on my needs. I haven&#x27;t set this up myself, but I&#x27;ve seen people write simple Emacs scripts that compile and test the code from their slides—that would have caught a number of typos that made it into my actual conference presentations!<p>This also lets me manage everything associated with a presentation in a single git repo. This is <i>incredibly</i> handy, especially for presentations that have their own code or data.<p>Highly recommend giving a workflow like this a try. Once I got the hang of it, it became <i>far</i> more productive than making slides in PowerPoint, with better results to boot. It&#x27;s easier to write slides in the first place, make structural changes and reuse content between pretty different presentations.<p>[1]: Here are the slides for the latest public talk I&#x27;ve given: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jelv.is&#x2F;talks&#x2F;haskell-love-2020&#x2F;slides.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jelv.is&#x2F;talks&#x2F;haskell-love-2020&#x2F;slides.html</a><p>I turn the controls in the bottom-left corner off for the presentation itself, but I started enabling them on my website after a few people got confused on how to advance the slides.')
