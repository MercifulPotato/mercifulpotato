The event they were attending was named &quot;Stop the Steal&quot;. At some level people there were invested in a tenuous narrative about how functional our elections are.<p>It&#x27;s obvious they did not all commit crimes, but they somewhat tacitly encouraged what brought it about. I generally don&#x27;t feel the same way about BLM activists. There were situations in BLM events where the boundary was overstepped, and inexcusable mob behavior took over. Perhaps I give a big pass because I am sympathetic to the overall aims of the movement, and for the &quot;Stop the Steal&quot; event I see a lot of malice in the lies that caused people to deny (not just question) the outcome of the election.')
