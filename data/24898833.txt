We&#x27;re talking about agency which seems to have lost all humanity in their agents who shackle pregnant women right before and after  delivery - i&#x27;m waiting for some military contractor to come up with and the CBP to buy the shackles allowing delivery while still on. Compare to that some database search without warrant...<p>I mean it is kind of naive to think that illegality and inhumanity can be practiced while confined just at one agency or area of operations without metastasizing across.')
