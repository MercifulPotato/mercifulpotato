China is growing fast.</i><p>The West and China have different goals.<p>China&#x27;s goal is to grow fast at all costs.<p>To use your street example, the West makes a great effort to listen to the views of all the people affected by the project, including people who live near and work near the project. The West will also do a study to make sure the environmental impact is acceptable. The West will also do a survey to make sure nothing of any historical or archaeological importance isn&#x27;t affected. The West will put the project out to multiple bidders and make sure that minority-owned companies are represented in the project. Depending on the project, there may also be other studies and considerations.<p>China just does the project, and if it&#x27;s done wrong or harms anyone, too bad.
