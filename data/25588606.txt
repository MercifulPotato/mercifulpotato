Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609378840, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25586293, text='&gt; I had taken on a cofounder who decided he would rather surf than work on the business development end of our product - without a founder agreement, he was dead weight that scared investors and potential team mates away<p>This is, unfortunately, very common in startup communities. There are a lot of people who attach themselves to startups, discover that they&#x27;re not interested in putting in the work required, and then decide to coast as long as possible when they realize it&#x27;s not so easy for their partners to cut them out.<p>These people are often very charismatic and are experts at inflating their previous credentials. Always do a deep dive on potential cofounders&#x27; backgrounds, including backchannel references. Always establish cofounder agreements and, most importantly, at least a 1-year vesting cliff on any equity, no matter how much you like the other person. If they aren&#x27;t pulling their weight at the 9-12 month mark, do everything to remove them from the company before they have any vested equity.<p>&gt;  In desperation for help, I began working with a veteran who had recently separated from Army intelligence - he had undisclosed mental issues and when our business plan was made a finalist in a university bizplan competition, he accused me of being a spy sent to retrieve classified information from him and sabotaged our meetings with investors, potential hires, and the competition administrators. He withdrew us from the competition and sent out insane accusatory emails to our bankers and advisors.<p>Mental illness is also, sadly, disproportionately represented in startup communities. I think it&#x27;s a combination of factors: People who suffer from certain untreated mental illnesses like you describe are more likely to be unable to maintain a normal career, so they seek out alternative career paths like startups where they don&#x27;t technically have to report to a manager. Certain mental illnesses can also come with bouts of grandiose thoughts, delusions of grandeur, a penchant for risk-taking, and other traits that can easily be confused for confident, ambitious startup personalities.<p>This is a perfect example of the importance of operating agreements and vesting cliffs, as well as due diligence on anyone you might go into business with.')
