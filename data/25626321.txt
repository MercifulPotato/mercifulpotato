Whereas if I want Matlab, it takes about a week to talk through the budgeting and licensing options with my employer, find the right number of seats to purchase (other departments might decide to get in on the purchase, so we need to consult broadly), choose which toolboxes we&#x27;ll pay for, go back and forth on the quotes and POs, and make sure all the licensing really works.<p>But your mileage may vary.')
