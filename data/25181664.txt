Dell ships XPS &quot;developer edition&quot; machines with Ubuntu and Lenovo offers Fedora on a bunch of machines.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think selling such machines to the general public will happen soon, because there&#x27;s not much of a market for it.  Most users hate it when the interface of a single application changes; switching operating systems is probably a non-starter.')
