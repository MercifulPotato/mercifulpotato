I am fond of the Gatsby-Image plugin for an image heavy website because it will generate all the images you need for responsive sizes, plus webp, plus a blurry preview.<p>The downside of this is that the lighthouse profiler currently does not score this setup properly and the blurry placeholder results in a lower score. There was an open bug to fix this last I checked.<p>The other major issue I faced was to setup netlify CMS for my own hosting. This ecosystem seems to very forcefully nudge you to use their infrastructure like Netlify or Gatsby cloud. I didn&#x27;t want that for a number of reasons. The documentation to set it up for your own server is in an absolutely pathetic state. All the steps described are cryptic and I ran across multiple questions and issues filed by confused users. I finally found a blog post which covered a large number of gotchas and I was able to set it up.<p>My customer manages the content on their site on their own. They were happy with the performance upgrade but the prospect of waiting a few minutes for the site to recompile everytime they make an update felt like a big step back to them.<p>I was not happy with seeing enormous json files being generated for what is essentially a website with a homepage and multiple categories with large photo galleries in them.<p>The other thing I was not prepared for is the hardware required to build the site. Small servers were running out of memory to do the build so I had to setup CircleCI to do the builds for me and then copy everything back to my server.<p>Another weird scenario I ran into was that the development version and build version had different outputs. I eventually solved this by noticing an issue with the DOM which didn&#x27;t get picked up by anything in the build tools. Took me a day or two to finally figure it out.<p>In hindsight I am now wondering if I should just roll my own image resizing scripts, switch to a crud web app and cache all the generated htmls on first load and delete the cache when a change is made and prime it. This has been my approach prior to Gatsby, but I was sold on their marketing about how I get all the speed benefits for free and not have to worry about sizing images, setting up webpack for performance and splitting for routes, setting up metatags for prefetching&#x2F;preloading etc. Turns out you&#x27;re better off doing all that on your own.<p>Broadly I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this framework again unless it was for a simple blog or something. The experience has left me quite annoyed. I am probably not going to follow this JAM stack philosophy in the future either. I don&#x27;t really see the benefit. Are people really that afraid of managing servers?<p>I am also considering redoing the entire site in Sinatra the next time I add features to it.')
