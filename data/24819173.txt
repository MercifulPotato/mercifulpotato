It would require precisely the people most hurt by the change (small states) to vote for substantially decreasing their voter power.<p>I&#x27;m not claiming it&#x27;s impossible, but I think it is silly to dismiss calls for more radical action in favor of a constitutional amendment with no path to get there.')
