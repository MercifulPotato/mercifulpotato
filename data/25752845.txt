I would even bring up any weird dev issues or bits of info that I came across that sometimes only mattered to me at the time, but it turned out to be helpful when I would search for those things months (or even years) later.<p>My current job has both Basecamp and Slack. Most of the work discussion happens in Basecamp, which is fine. However, the search is pretty awful, so it&#x27;s hard to get a quick and relevant response back when trying to find out more info about a given setting, feature, piece of code, or whatever else. There&#x27;s a lot of extra digging involved with Basecamp&#x27;s search results.')
