As in you run the generation process once, and then again with the same inputs, and you&#x27;ll get an output that works differently.<p>Now of course you can store the generated asset, which gives some certainty in the roll back case. But roll backs are hopefully rare, what&#x27;s more common is to make small changes to inputs (like source code changes), and hope that the generate asset has only been affected by the intended change.<p>To give an example of how this works where no care has been taken that the process is reproducible, I&#x27;ve seen people try to make code changes to Docker images, and end up with changes that they didn&#x27;t intend (like a different version of Debian in the image, or a different Ruby&#x2F;Python version).')
