A 1846 SciFi story (&quot;Die Gestirne und die Weltgeschichte&quot;) about someone travelling faster than light (and thus being able to observe the past) fascinated him (he eventually would write the introduction for a reprint).<p>On the other hand, established philosophy was very sceptical of his ideas, which collided spectacularly with  Henri Bergson&#x27;s ideas about time, now forgotten, but very fashionable then. This made relativity controversial for a long time (even after Eddington&#x27;s 1919 observation of gravitational lensing during an eclipse) and probably was the reason that he never got a Nobel prize for it, but only for his much less groundbreaking work on photoelectricity.')
