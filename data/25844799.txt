But Robert Sapolsky&#x27;s (one of his papers is cited in OP&#x27;s analysis) book, <i>Behave</i> shows something different: &quot;While testosterone is inextricably tied to aggression, it is far less relevant to aggression than usually assumed.&quot;<p>Instead of asking &quot;What do individual levels of testosterone have to do with aggression?&quot;, he posits a better question: &quot;Does difference in testosterone levels among individuals <i>predict</i> who <i>will be</i> aggressive?&quot;<p>The answer: Among birds, fish, mammals, and especially other primates, &quot;generally no&quot;.  As for humans, it has been extensively studied, and the jury is in (Sapolsky is quoting  a British endocrinologist, John Archer): &quot;There is a weak and inconsistent association between testosterone levels and aggression in [human adults], and ... administration of testosterone to volunteers typically does not increase their aggression.&quot;<p>———<p>The executive summary being testosterone&#x27;s effects are hugely context dependent—this in turn means &quot;rather than causing X, testosterone amplifies the power of something else to cause X.&quot;')
