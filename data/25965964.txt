Also, if you&#x27;re in enterprise land, there could be some weird tool you need to use (or is superior to whatever you can get on Linux) that forces&#x2F;encourages you to use Windows.<p>Also, there may be some weird little ergonomics thing: I recently switched from Windows to a Mac at work.  We use Outlook, and IMHO Mac Outlook sucks compared to the Windows version.  It&#x27;s just missing a bunch of useful little features that I got used to.  I was originally planning on using Windows Outlook in a VM, but got thwarted by new policies set by our new desktop support vendor.')
