Im not sure about its use in humans but it&#x27;s been around in rodent research for like thirty years. This paper was the one to introduce it I think (Millar J. and Barnett T. G., J. Neurosci. Methods. 1988).<p>Its also possible to measure other things using the same technique such as pH and adenosine but as I heard from colleagues that getting good signal to noise ratio in these preps is really difficult.')
