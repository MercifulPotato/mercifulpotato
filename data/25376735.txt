If you see someone dead on the floor and they are next to an open bottle of poison, they most likely died of a heart attack.<p>Now maybe statistically it&#x27;s more likely that someone just happened to have a heart attack next to an open bottle of poison, but Occam&#x27;s Razor isn&#x27;t to select the most likely answer, it&#x27;s to select the simplest answer. The simpler answer is that he ingested poison, rather than he had a heart attack near a bottle of open poison.<p>If a pandemic involving a bat-virus swapping species starts in a city then it was probably just a virus jumping species. If that city happens to be doing active research on how much bat-viruses can swap species, then I think Occam&#x27;s Razor can apply.<p>Obviously there is no objective truth to Occam&#x27;s Razor, and what I think is the simplest explanation may differ from what you think is the simplest explanation.')
