The world is getting wealthier. Money is getting cheaper. We&#x27;ve just printed trillions of dollars this year to keep the good times rolling baby. We live in an era where people would rather pay $549 for a set of headphones than save it in a bank account or save for a house, cuz there&#x27;s no way in hell they&#x27;ll ever be able to afford a house. So why not blow it on experiences and shiney stuff instead of clinging on to a dream that can never be realised? That&#x27;s the mentality of a lot of Apple&#x27;s target market.')
