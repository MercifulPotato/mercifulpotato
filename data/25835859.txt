I&#x27;m not an expert, but my understanding is that one of the takeaways from the M1 success has been the weaknesses of x86 and CISC in general.  It seems as if there is a performance ceiling which exists for x86 due to things like memory ordering requirements, and complexity of legacy instructions, which just don&#x27;t exist for other instruction sets.<p>My impression is that we have been living under the cruft of x86 because of inertia, and what are mostly historical reasons, and it&#x27;s mostly a good thing if we move away from it.')
