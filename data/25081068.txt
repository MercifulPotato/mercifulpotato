Post-collapse, once all the computers break down, that&#x27;s the end of XX-century technology. Nobody is going to make new ones, because to build and maintain machines that make computers you need working computers. Same for mining and refining necessary resources, controlling chemical processes, etc.<p>Whatever technological knowledge survives in the books, most of it will be useless for centuries, as we regress into pre-industrial level of technology and can&#x27;t climb back out - we&#x27;ve already mined out all easily-accessible high-density energy sources that are necessary for reindustrialization.')
