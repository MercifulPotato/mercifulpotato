That is what makes it work in those places but to say it could never work in North America because of that I think is crazy. I think it would connect more sparsely populated areas to the rest of the continent better than the interstate system. If it&#x27;s convenient, people will use it, and if it&#x27;s anything like the Shinkansen, then people will definitely use it.<p>The biggest problem in the USA specifically is not where the population centers are but simply politics. It&#x27;s not necessarily that it can&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s that there&#x27;s a lot of money invested into making sure it never happens.')
