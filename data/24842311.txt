For any position and any field. Software engineering is <i>no</i> different.<p>There is <i>no</i> meaningful data that any hiring process--good or bad--improves the outcome of a hire. If there were, everyone would be using it.<p>Instead, third-party HR monoliths have moved in and snatched up (and more or less created) the &#x27;market&#x27; for screening and filtering applicants. Larger companies sigh, throw up their hands, and say &#x27;well how else can we deal with hundreds of applicants?&#x27;.<p>As if that &#x27;funnel&#x27; of applicants contains what you think you want. As if it&#x27;s just an exercise in reductionism, each applicant a data point to evaluate.<p>Given this, why not hire lightly and fire lightly?')
