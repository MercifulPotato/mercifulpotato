For instance, were any articles framed as [More than X Google workers condemn firing of James Damore], despite that actually being the case? The media, universities and other elite institutions always support the &quot;SJW cultural domination&quot; stance on all these issues and the discussion is always framed from that perspective.<p>You&#x27;ll find similar framings such as [More than X GitHub workers condemn GitHub&#x27;s deals with ICE]. You&#x27;ll never find [More than X GitHub workers condemn removal of meritocracy rug], despite that also being the case. You may not like me pointing this out, but that&#x27;s how it happens. It&#x27;s not cognitive dissonance to see that that&#x27;s how these things go.')
