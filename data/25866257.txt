I guess if you&#x27;re a creative professional, be it an artist, designer, or cake decorator, there&#x27;s going to be some degree of soul-selling you&#x27;d be expected to do where you make a decent effort on a project where you&#x27;d rather not.<p>But forcing people to make cakes they feel morally icky about sounds like a guaranteed way to get some really ugly, half-assed cakes. Whether we like it or not that they feel that way doesn&#x27;t seem to matter because an ugly cake that validates me is still an ugly cake.')
