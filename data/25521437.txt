You need to be licensed by the provincial engineering body to call yourself a P.Eng. An engineering degree from an accredited program is often part of the path to that credential, but is neither necessary nor sufficient by itself.<p>And as to being strictly enforced, IMO, it&#x27;s not really enforced for software people, so long as they stick to &quot;engineer&quot; and avoid &quot;Professional Engineer&quot;. Plenty of firms have job listings for &quot;Software Engineers&quot; that don&#x27;t require the P.Eng. credential, plenty of people have easily discovered LinkedIn profiles holding themselves out as Software Engineers, but there&#x27;s not much enforcement.<p>There was a push by the Professional Engineers Ontario in the early 2000s to regulate Microsoft&#x27;s MCSE terminology, but I think it basically failed. IMO, they&#x27;ve given up on regulating the term &quot;engineer&quot; unless it&#x27;s really egregious, like holding yourself out as a P.Eng. when you&#x27;re not, or actually doing work that requires a P.Eng. without actually having one.')
