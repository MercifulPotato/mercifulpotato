You have this correct, the difference is 0.001.<p>Now reconsider your first statement: that a probability of 0.010 is an order of magnitude more likely than a probability of 0.001. This is true, but is completely irrelevant because it is a completely different comparison. A more appropriate comparison would be to compare probabilities of 0.010 and 0.011. The difference of these is again 0.001.<p>You compared proverbial apples to oranges, and you cannot trust the conclusions you make from invalid comparisons. A difference in probability of 0.001 <i>does</i> mean the same thing no matter what the starting probability is. Probability is &quot;linear&quot; in this way.<p>Now that we know this to be true, I would encourage you to rethink your position on Nassim Taleb. He understands non-linearity quite well, in fact I would argue that his entire purpose on Earth (at least in his eyes) is to remind people about non-linearity as a concept. It comes across in all of his books and most of his public appearances.<p>On the matter of probability, I trust him very deeply. Whether or not I trust him is also inconsequential, because he has serious mathematical literacy and you can evaluate his propositions for yourself.')
