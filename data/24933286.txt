Item(by='lhorie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603994701, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24931352, text='&gt; The problem with this line of thinking — and the Trump administration’s ideological and monetary support for NASA exploring the solar system — is that it perpetuates the myth that, through technological developments, humans are destined to leave Earth and find a utopia elsewhere<p>This seems like a strawman. The myth of flat earth, for example, is also perpetuated by some social media circles. That doesn&#x27;t make it a primary factor for driving policy or anything at all, for that matter.<p>IMHO, the real danger here is the idea that some high priority problem on earth can be solved by just diverting funds from one thing and throwing more money at said problem. Not just because that often doesn&#x27;t work (e.g. the classical &quot;nine women to make a baby in a month&quot; analogy in project management), but also because of the underlying mentality that analytical&#x2F;scientific work is a second class cog that can and ought to be  coerced and discarded willy nilly by the whims of whoever has the reins on financial support.<p>This mentality shows a deep disdain for intellectual endeavor and due diligence, which are critical to solve the very issues the author claims are important.')
