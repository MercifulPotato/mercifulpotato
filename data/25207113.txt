Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606293269, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25205914, text='&gt; How are they to be pronounced? &quot;croissant emoji squared plus girl wearing hat&quot;?<p>I knew a girl named 胡伊人 Hú Yīrén, who for a long time had her wechat display name as three emoji, a tiger face, a hand holding up one finger, and a human girl&#x27;s face. (The intent would have been to read these as &quot;tiger&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, and &quot;person&quot;, 虎一人 hǔ yìrén.)<p>But emoji didn&#x27;t appear in notifications, and my phone was set to English rather than Chinese, so whenever I got a message from her the notification would read &quot;[Tiger][No. 1][Girl] ...&quot;. I started thinking of her as &quot;tiger number one girl&quot;, a bit.')
