I&#x27;m not in the business, but I suspect that sophisticated network filtering equipment even at the high end can have its packets-per-second capacity eaten up before it hits line speed, just like low end routing equipment can.<p>As a result, there are some people whose ability to withstand a DDoS has more to do with packets per second than bits per second, so it becomes a useful metric.')
