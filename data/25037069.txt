I just replaced mine after about a year of intermittent use. I thought that that was fine, but then my wife pointed out that we were replacing the half-capacity cartridge that came with the printer. I expect this cartridge to last a good two or three years.<p>The AirPrint abilities have been a little spotty at times, though that might just be my WiFi.
