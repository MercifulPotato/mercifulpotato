And this is the problem I have with the E-mail: It&#x27;s unclear. The details really matter when the edict comes from the CEO, and there will be senior people in the company that make and enforce huge, sweeping changes to the business that hang on the exact wording coming from the CEO.<p>I&#x27;ve worked at a company where the CEO (and sometimes SVP leadership too) was basically treated as a God-King figure. I mean that in a literal sense: People would walk behind him, writing down every word he said in the hallways and every meeting with him had multiple note takers. Kind of like those guys with the notebooks following Kim Jong Un around writing every word down. If a senior exec said something that wasn&#x27;t clear or didn&#x27;t make sense YOU DID IT ANYWAY because it came from [Person&#x27;s Name]. In E-mail forwards, the words of top leadership would be quoted in a different color, and then scrutinized and interpreted until everyone thought they understood every little nuance of what was said.<p>I don&#x27;t know if SpaceX and Tesla are like that but I have my suspicions :). When an E-mail like that comes from Elon, I&#x27;m positive there are dozens of people who make it their full-time job for the next few weeks to carry out <i>to the letter</i> exactly what he said. So if it&#x27;s unclear or incomplete, there&#x27;s a big problem.')
