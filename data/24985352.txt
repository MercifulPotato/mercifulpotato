I had to set a registry value before it actually consumed CPU and HDD time though. In fact, nxquery.sys is targeted at Windows 7 users (it is a simple driver to read a MSR to determine if NX is disabled in the BIOS). Trivia: Appraiser creates multiple threads, so it is not just one core that consumes CPU time.')
