As far as I&#x27;m aware, there aren&#x27;t any existing languages in this space. There are plenty of &quot;code golf&quot; languages, which optimize for <i>shortest finished program</i>, but that&#x27;s slightly different. Based on the top AoC solvers, the closest thing today is Python -- but we can do so much better!<p>Currently, the language is very immature, but it can solve a handful of AoC problems. But before long, I&#x27;ll need to tackle a very big problem: building an IDE around this thing. See, for a language like this, the syntax is only half the battle. Ideally, when I type something like `| map (*2)`, I should have <i>instant visual feedback</i> showing me how the input is affected by this change. Not to mention more traditional IDE features, like suggesting functions based on the type under the cursor.<p>I don&#x27;t have anything public to share yet, but if you&#x27;re interested in collaborating (esp. on the IDE), feel free to shoot me an email.')
