Like coming up with their own file format that sucks less than other formats in some important ways.<p>Blackmagic RAW isn&#x27;t really &quot;raw&quot; in the sense that it&#x27;s the data exactly as it comes out of the sensor ADC. It&#x27;s ever so slightly &quot;cooked&quot; in the camera, which dramatically reduces file size, but still preserves all the dynamic range and color info that you need for doing fun stuff with it later.<p>Any camera maker could do this and publish a support library, but no software would feel the impetus to integrate it immediately, so nobody would use it, and if nobody&#x27;s using it, no software would feel the impetus to support it ever.<p>But because Resolve is such a competent offering in the software space too, you can enjoy the benefits of the new format immediately, if you&#x27;re shooting with their cameras and editing with their software. And that creates market inertia and people talking about how useful it is, so if other software wants to win users away from Resolve, they&#x27;ll likely have to grab that library and build in support for the format.<p>Just the first example that came to mind.')
