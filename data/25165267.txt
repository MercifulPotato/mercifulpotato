It was a one way transition, ie. I couldn&#x27;t undo it if I didn&#x27;t like it.  I got lazy and never did it.<p>Now I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t, because apparently I&#x27;d be moving back anyway!<p>But the GVoice app and experience is still awful on iPhone.  The only reason I&#x27;m still on it is for the spam protection, but even that isn&#x27;t so good anymore and apparently the built in iPhone one is pretty good now.')
