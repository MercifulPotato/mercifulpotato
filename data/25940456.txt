(The topic here would be &quot;to PC or not to PC, have we gone to far with it etc; which is a conversation that can and should be had)<p>b) whether it&#x27;s ok, while discussing point &quot;a&quot; above, to insist that some words mean something else than what it&#x27;s generally understand in good faith, in order to apply ineffective whataboutism (&quot;what about idiot, it used to be a medical term!&quot;) to the conversation. To what goal? Claim that you can use &quot;retard&quot; because you can use &quot;idiot&quot;? Let&#x27;s not play etymological games, if you want to discuss about PC overreach, discuss PC overreach; there are plenty of good arguments to be had against extreme political correctness and censure that don&#x27;t involve having your readers rolling their eyes at blatant attempts to clutching at straws.')
