Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609873817, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25649517, text='<i>&gt; This argument takes as an unstated axiom that the correct way to organize society is by having everyone in a role that strictly maximizes that system&#x27;s assessment of their economic output.</i><p>No, that&#x27;s not the axiom. The axiom is that scarce resources should be allocated to their most productive uses. If the scarce resource of your time and energy can be more productive at building houses if you have a real job and donate a portion of your income to house building, than if you built houses directly, then that&#x27;s how that scarce resource should be allocated.<p>Note that it is <i>you</i> doing the resource allocation here, not &quot;the system&quot;. It is true that &quot;the system&quot; is very inefficient, but what it&#x27;s inefficient at is <i>providing people with opportunities to choose from to be more productive with the scarce resource of their time and energy</i>. The way to make that more efficient is <i>more</i> free markets and <i>less</i> government regulation; but our society tends to be the other way around.')
