I&#x27;ve never done PHP development, but it only took a few clicks to set it up (install extension and go into preferences and change the language version).<p>Since VSCode is just using LSP under the hood, that means it would also work fine in Emacs, [neo]vi[m], Sublime, Atom, etc.<p>In the long run, I don&#x27;t see how IntelliJ will be able to compete with LSP, as it gets polished up.')
