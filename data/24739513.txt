Item(by='dividedbyzero', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602342951, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24738351, text='&gt; You&#x27;re framing this debate as if apple PR statements &quot;we&#x27;re doing all of this for our user&#x27;s best interests&quot; were true.<p>I thought I&#x27;d made a pretty strong case to not trust Apple&#x27;s PR in my first paragraph. To clarify, no, I don&#x27;t think that is the case, and people should be very miserly with their trust towards orgs like Apple in general.<p>The thing is, no matter their rationale, their product decisions have far-reaching real-world consequences. This particular decision has obvious real-world consequences to protesters in Belarus, and it is a disgusting decision, and definitely makes for a strong argument against leaving them with that much control.<p>On the other hand, however, their security stance works really, really well, as far as I can tell, and it keeps their users quite safe from lots of harm, and that&#x27;s something I keep giving them money for, because I value security highly.<p>Forcing their walled garden free-as-in-freedom wide open will amend #1, but what about #2? Literally hundreds of millions of iPhone users around the world depend on the ecosystem being safe – my mom has an iPhone mostly because they keep their walled garden clean, so she doesn&#x27;t have to get a CS degree to do that herself, and also because it&#x27;s a very nice product that she enjoys a lot, but I&#x27;d advise her very strongly to get something else if Apple&#x27;s security was shoddy. As I&#x27;ve argued, I have very strong doubts that this could be done without breaking much of what makes iPhones so secure.<p>I&#x27;m definitely not arguing that this makes Apple&#x27;s ability and growing propensity to abuse their power a great thing – I think it&#x27;s absolutely creepy in a deeply dystopian way – but right now the only way to build such a safe environment that I know of relies on strict centralized control, and having such an environment is one of the prime things that make this technology manageable for everyone and their mother.<p>If someone comes up with a free-as-in-freedom smartphone that&#x27;s secure, easy to use, has the necessary polish and all the important apps and isn&#x27;t laser-focused on people who live inside emacs, I&#x27;ll be happy to part with a bunch of money for that.')
