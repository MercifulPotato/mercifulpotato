There are few &quot;top&quot; universities if you look at the global rankings, which probably comes from both the lower budgets and the lower incentives to compete on the ranking metrics. But the German universities consistently perform well;  Germany really has no bad (public) universities.<p>The atmosphere is very different and having studied in the UK i see the merits of both: a UK university basically runs like a school with a very strong support system and 1:1 touch with academics. In Germany its really a more &quot;mass&quot; approach in lectures and then seminars with lower ranking staff, not the actual professors. Also less other support e.g. psychologists, tech support,.. To succeed at a German university you have to grow up ;)<p>Also interestingly German universities seem to be much more political places. The UK I experienced as filled with extracurricular stuff, while in Germany there&#x27;s much less of that and in return a much more vibrant political and debate culture.')
