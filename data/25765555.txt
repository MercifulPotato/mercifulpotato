The old car companies are dumb and slow and their industrial design mostly sucks. [0]<p>I think it makes sense, particularly if you model the future as autonomous vehicles and AR as the next platform.<p>People will be in their cars using their Apple devices and doing other things while in transit. The car will be a lot different than today in that future and Apple wants to be part of that design.<p>This is a massive winner take all (or possibly duopoly) market in a way similar to phone platforms.<p>[edit] In the US the dealership model hamstrings legacy car manufacturers from making important changes. These dealerships have legislated their existence and block things like OTA updates. They&#x27;re staffed largely by people who dislike EVs and don&#x27;t really understand the product. This is another big problem for any legacy manufacturer trying to make a big shift.<p>[0]: For an example of dumbness, GM bought Cruise (smart) and then relegated them to a single product at the edge of their line (dumb). They don&#x27;t realize what they have or the existential threat they face. I don&#x27;t hold out hope for any of them.')
