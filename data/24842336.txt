But even if you&#x27;d just have the kernel return and otherwise produce invalid results, the fact that you can then report a bounds error instead of silently corrupting data and&#x2F;or generating a fatal ERROR_ILLEGAL_ACCESS (requiring an application restart) is a significant usability improvement.')
