Item(by='mewpmewp2', descendants=None, kids=[25550765, 25550610], score=None, time=1609071845, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25547716, text='I think that cursor should be used more with realtime data and more stable data like products in an e-commerce shop should use paginated queries.<p>There&#x27;s many UX benefits for paginated queries. It gives customer a clear overview of how many products there are and customer can also navigate faster to get a better understanding of what general prices are. If the table&#x2F;list doesn&#x27;t have good filters, customer can easily act out binary search to find what they are looking for in an ordered list of items.<p>Same with highscores, forums threads and other similar things. Say you are browsing highscores and you want to see what scores are around 10000th position etc.<p>As a user I find having only prev&#x2F;next buttons a bit claustrophobic in this case. I think UX should trump whatever performance gains there are from it.')
