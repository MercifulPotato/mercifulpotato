I&#x27;m currently working remotely at a US client from several locations in the Pacific.<p>I just had a complete auditory workup to diagnose some recent hearing changes that included consultation with a US-educated doctor, and some medication, and the total cost without any sort of insurance was ~250 USD. My monthly insurance premium at home is 400 USD and likely wouldn&#x27;t even have covered half of that, because fuck you, that&#x27;s why.')
