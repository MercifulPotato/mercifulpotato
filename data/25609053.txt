Item(by='musicale', descendants=None, kids=[25609304], score=None, time=1609548542, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25605211, text='I think Apple, like several other notable tech companies, has a ton of great developers and engineers, and a lot of really bad managers (and a few good ones.) As in most tech companies, employees have no power vs. management, and HR exists to protect the company from liability. (And good luck keeping your job if you try to, say, organize a union.)<p>A bummer about Apple as well is that because it is such a popular company, largely due to its well-regarded and often exciting and innovative products, there are always lots of people lined up ready to take your place. As a result, they can get away with paying in prestige (rather than a fair market wage) and demanding excessive (and anti-productive) time commitments.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s changed recently, but the myth of dual career ladders has been a major problem at many companies; basically to increase your salary it&#x27;s almost mandatory to go into management, or to leave for another company. HR and management will point to highly paid individual contributors, but it&#x27;s largely a pyramid with very few people at the upper ranks, and they do their best to hide and obfuscate the pay scale.<p>Many tech companies also love college hires because they usually lack the ability to negotiate pay, have few outside responsibilities such as children or a spouse, and often lack a concept of work-life balance. After they quit due to burnout they are easily replaced.<p>I still think it&#x27;s nuts that Tim Cook wants his team to have calls on Sunday nights. There&#x27;s really nothing that can&#x27;t wait until Monday morning - it&#x27;s just a stupid bit of the culture of anti-productive overwork and demands for proof of loyalty to a company that will never repay it.')
