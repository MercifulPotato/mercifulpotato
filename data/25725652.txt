But here we are.<p>Karma is widely understood in cultures that don’t have a prominent internal representation of it to mean something on the range of “you get what you deserve” to “you get what you put into the world”. But it doesn’t.<p>Karma means “deed”. As in, any action performed. Its philosophical role is that any action is a cause and has effects. When applied religiously, the idea is not that one’s actions and consequences are correlated, and not that one can use good deeds to cancel bad.<p>The idea is that one’s actions have an effect on the world. Sometimes bad actions have negative consequences for the actor. Sometimes the bad actor learns from those consequences. Sometimes other people feel the consequences. Sometimes the bad actor learns anyway. Sometimes [all of the above substituting “good” for “bad”]. Sometimes actions are complicated and have unpredictable effects.<p>The reason karma is philosophically important isn’t to control behavior but to provide a lens to reflect on it.')
