Ethereum&#x27;s layer 2 solutions are far ahead in terms of user experience. The other day I had to settle an election bet, and either I settle it in stablecoin on high tx fees of ETH&#x2F;BTC or try explaining one of the layer-2 solutions.<p>And no, I can&#x27;t pay them in USDT on bch because that requires them to get a new wallet.<p>Raiden network which is Ethereum&#x27;s LN like solution, faces the same problem. Whatever bitcoin folks envision, they will never get LN bitcoins to have the same network effect as bitcoin itself.')
