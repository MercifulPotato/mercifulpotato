What if their application becomes an overnight success and needs to scale up fast?<p>Sure, if it&#x27;s an established company then using their own hardware (and people to set up and manage it) might make sense; iirc Dropbox is a fairly recent big player that made that move. But otherwise it&#x27;s a big upfront investment to make, and you can&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll pay itself back.<p>So sure, AWS can be 2x or more as expensive as renting servers at a company like OVH or building your own datacenter, but it&#x27;s paid by the minute if need be, not all in one go. If your startup or its VC money runs out in six months at least you can quickly scale down and pull out.')
