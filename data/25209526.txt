Nowadays, at least in my neck of the woods, developers almost universally use laptops, and Apple&#x27;s still plenty competitive in the (high end) laptop department.<p>For the most part, the only developers I know who still use desktops are machine learning folks who don&#x27;t like the cloud and instead keep a Linux tower full of GPUs in a closet somewhere. And then remote into it from a laptop. Half the time it&#x27;s a MacBook, half the time it&#x27;s a XPS 13. And they were never going to consider a Mac Pro for their training server, anyway, because CUDA.<p>I couldn&#x27;t speak to power users, but my sense is that, while it meant something concrete in the &#x27;90s, nowadays it&#x27;s a term that only comes out when people want to complain about the latest update to Apple&#x27;s line of computers.')
