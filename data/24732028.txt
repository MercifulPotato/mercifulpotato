We&#x27;re relying on the fox to guard the hen house. They get paid whether the click is valid or not. I don&#x27;t think we should reasonably expect the Google&#x27;s and Facebook&#x27;s of the ad world to spend money preventing fraud when that generates less profit overall. Until we start regulating the industry, no ad company is going to spend money to lose money, especially when there&#x27;s no real repercussions to begin with.')
