Docker&#x27;s own docs state that it&#x27;s better to run containers on the WSL2 backend than the old way (a hyper-v vm just for Docker).<p>Flip the question the other way: what does VirtualBox offer me that I&#x27;m not getting from WSL2? I just need Linux command line tools for software development. This feels like the best way to get them on Windows.<p>It&#x27;s easy to imagine use-cases when a full blown VM are better; not my current use-cases though.')
