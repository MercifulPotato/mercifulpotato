Item(by='andrewfong', descendants=None, kids=[25709536], score=None, time=1610250194, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25708947, text='The funny thing is that Section 230 was added to _encourage_ moderation as part of the Communications Decency Act.<p>The historical context is that prior to 230, imperfect moderation would be used as proof that a service could moderate but chose not to. This created an incentive to architecturally design systems in a way that made moderation impossible (or at least strongly encouraged services to pretend moderation was impossible). So Congress enacted Section 230, so partial moderation wouldn&#x27;t be turned against you.<p>Kind of funny in this context. But attempts at moderation, even bad ones, are very much in line with the history of the bill. And of course, we&#x27;re talking about AWS&#x27;s private right to associate with whom they want, not government action. 230 doesn&#x27;t really enter into it except as a metaphor of sorts.')
