They literally carried out a fake news story about Nick Sandmann without any sort of verification. CNN settled 250 million $ lawsuit followed by Washington Post. Other publications are in the line next. They have zero credibility... especially after causing irreparable damage to a child&#x27;s reputation by labelling him a racist when he was anything but. The real racists at the rally were those who accused this kid of racism.
