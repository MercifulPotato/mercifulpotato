My two cents are that it is because Zig, as innovative as it is, has nothing that other languages couldn&#x27;t copy or assimilate. With Rust it is a different story, because the ownership model cannot be plugged into other languages without changing them fundamentally. My prediction is similar to yours that Zig will be an important research project but not go mainstream. A counterargument is of course that Zig&#x27;s closeness to C will make it win in conservative industries and it wouldn&#x27;t be the first time a more incremental approach wins over the more innovative one. Also  I have to stress that I only have a cursory knowledge of Zig so far. I hope I didn&#x27;t do the language injustice and I&#x27;d like to hear other opinions about this.')
