It&#x27;s quite frankly annoying, although I&#x27;ve lost the last ounce of respect I&#x27;ve had for the Economist years ago so I&#x27;m the idiot for expecting them to be any better.<p>I&#x27;ve gone through pop diet literature like How Not To Die, Blue Zone, and others, but it&#x27;s mostly just people trying to push an agenda in one way or another. I just want the facts, in somewhat of plain as English as possible but I don&#x27;t mind some technical fluff if it will help clarify things. I tend to find in a lot of this sort of literature that the technical fluff is useless to majority of the readership and yet takes up 80%+ of the content, as the authors try to use as many half-baked analogies and metaphors as they can to explain technical concepts that nobody cares about. At the same time, something more substantial than &quot;Eat food, not too much, mostly plants&quot; would be welcome. You know, how does exercise play a part in it. How does ancestry that has also lived to an old age play a part in it. Is it kind of a big deal, or nice to have? How many consecutive generations of people living to 100 does it take before it happens at a regular basis. These sorts of things. Holistic analysis that compares more than just &quot;Wim Hof has slightly more brown fat than most people and that&#x27;s the reason why he is superhuman&quot; level of nonsense.<p>The latest bit seems to be from longevity research where cold showers and fasting are in vogue again, for the Nth time. Oh, but our company is the only one that provides this one unique test that checks your age biomarkers. We didn&#x27;t just name drop the company in there for the sake of baiting you into it or anything.<p>Why is it so bloody hard?')
