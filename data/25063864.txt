Also, privacy concerns since you had to access it via the internet.<p>We ended up going with a generic IP camera - Amcrest&#x27;s 1080p wifi camera, to be specific (would have to go look up the model number if people want to know EDIT: IP2M-841B). You can change just about anything about the settings you could want to (such as adding a timestamp so you can verify it hasn&#x27;t crashed), including disabling access from the internet so you can only access the monitor from the LAN. It&#x27;s been rock solid for ages - there is a setting that will reboot the camera once a week, but you can set the time, so I set mine to reboot about an hour after the kids normally get up so it never bothers us.<p>We just have the feed pulled up on an Amazon Fire HD8 tablet that we got for $60, lets us get a 1080p video stream with an ONVIF-capable camera. The Amcrest app isn&#x27;t terrible either, only downside is that there&#x27;s an option for 1, 4, 9, or 16 cameras - but I only have 2, so I have to waste half my screen (and the app will only play audio from one stream at a time). And if you don&#x27;t want to use their app, once it is set up and connected to the network (which you probably don&#x27;t even need the app for if you are hardwiring with ethernet) you can connect to it via IP address with any RTSP&#x2F;ONVIF app or even via VLC, or once the firmware is upgraded you can view the stream in the browser.<p>It has motion sensor capabilities but I haven&#x27;t experimented with them.')
