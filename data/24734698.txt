Item(by='n3k5', descendants=None, kids=[24734759], score=None, time=1602279481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24732093, text='&gt; <i>they should only know that a certain device with a certain ID likes X,Y topics</i><p>They shouldn&#x27;t know any ID, not even one that gets sent only to that one advertiser and is reset after 30 days.[0] Even that much data shouldn&#x27;t be stored, because it&#x27;s not needed unless you want to do shady tracking-related stuff (e.g. run statistics that determine who gets a special offer with a lower price).<p>The way it&#x27;s ‘done properly’ right now is that advertisers can subscribe to a segment of consumers who recently looked at X-type products from stores A, B, or C, in region Y. Then they make bids on how much an ad impression is worth to them when a match shows up. Kind of like auto-bidding on eBay, except more meta. The problem with this is that there still needs to be some ad platform that tracks user IDs. The better ones have a reputation to uphold, so they&#x27;ll make <i>some</i> effort to protect consumers … from finding out what&#x27;s <i>really</i> being tracked and when there was a leak.<p>I like the idea of giving smaller players a chance, but:<p>You don&#x27;t need <i>any</i> tracking for targeted ads.<p>A lot of the most relevant ads I see are on Youtube, where I have personalisation turned <i>off</i>. Composer explains music theory? Music store. Chef explains recipe? Cooking classes from lecture video site. Formula 1? Expensive car brand. And energy drinks. E-sports? Gaming peripherals. And different energy drinks. Half the time, no meaningful match could be made and I get something generic. Neighbouring Swamponia is beautiful in toad season. These douche-bros will give me totally legit financial advice for free. The insurance I already use has a great product for people twice my age. Founder of local thimble manufactory rambles incoherently for five minutes.<p>In aggregate, that&#x27;s way more relevant to me than ”you recently bought that power bank you needed, so here&#x27;s another power bank”. I skipped 9&#x2F;10 ads after 5 seconds, but now I know which brand makes a 6-string bass that&#x27;s affordable for a guitarist who&#x27;d just like to give it a go for a bit. And I did see offerings from smaller players. So I also learned that the local neo-nazi party is pretty good at folk dancing. Homeland, sweet auto-tuned homeland.<p>I don&#x27;t blindly assume that Google aren&#x27;t tracking anything I don&#x27;t want them to store. But they show me a lot of targeted ads and there&#x27;s never any indication that they know what I did last summer.<p>[0] Oh, and <i>obviously</i> even that kind of ID shouldn&#x27;t identify an entire device. When your offspring borrows your tablet to play Candycraft, do you want them to see ads meant for you? Do they want to see those ads?')
