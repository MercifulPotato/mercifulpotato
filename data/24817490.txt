It&#x27;s doing more work than the other compiled languages so its budget to come in using less watts is really strict (Pascal, Chapel, Ocaml, Haskell, ). It&#x27;s something worth exploring further.<p>In fact in the updated version with Julia added[1] , Julia takes very long to do anything since the Julia warmup is so awful. But somehow even though Julia takes 2.57 times longer to compute results (357%) than Rust and 93x more memory for fannkuch-redux, it&#x27;s using only 23% more energy. All the while doing tracing JIT and rewriting memory segments to set for execution.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.google.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;energy-efficiency-languages&#x2F;updated-functional-results-2020?authuser=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.google.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;energy-efficiency-languages&#x2F;up...</a>')
