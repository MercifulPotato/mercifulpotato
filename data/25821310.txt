If you start going down the eyewitness testimony route then you get some evidence for saints&#x2F;miracles and also ghosts that meets similar criteria.<p>The phenomena reported in eyewitness statements in the 60s-80s at least some seems possible to capture with satellite&#x2F;phone camera. It&#x27;s possible that UFOs more cautious now or government is surpressing this but I take the lack of clear photograpic evidence as a reason to update beliefs.')
