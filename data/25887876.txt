Then regulations clamped down and enforcement was lax - as a result banks were fined. Now banks including non-US banks like DB and HSBC are strict and the US government will see exactly what you&#x27;re doing esp in USD.<p>Maybe some big exchanges like Coinbase follow the US laws closely but mostly crypto is like the old days where most people in the world can do what they want. Its in no way like these big global banks.')
