I definitely would word it differently if I was trying to convince someone.<p>&gt; See, its easier to accuse people of bigotry than look at their actual problems.<p>That&#x27;s true. But I strongly believe that bigotry is the problem.\nBlaming the left for the rise of populism and conspiracies is like blaming the firefighters for the fire. I&#x27;m putting the blame on the arsonists.<p>We should be debating how to fix issues instead of &quot;Is the issue real?&quot;. All the politics who participated in spreading misinformation and dividing the western world should be voted out of their positions.<p>It&#x27;s a systemic failure that brought us here. Our system allowed selfish leaders (from all sides tbh) to get in power.<p>But fixing the systemic issues touches on personal liberties (who decides what can and cannot be said?), so it cannot be done lightly. Additionally, politics wants to be re-elected, so not only they won&#x27;t do anything against misinformation, they sometimes encourage it.<p>I blame the leaders more than the followers, but the followers have a personal responsibility in it as well.')
