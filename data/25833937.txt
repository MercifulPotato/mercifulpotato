If there is a live channel on Youtube showing say a football match, then yes, technically you have to pay a TV licence for watching it, since the same match is broadcast on a TV channel.<p>I don&#x27;t think the policy is <i>that</i> ridiculous, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s one of these where certain edge cases like this one can be safely ignored. You <i>will</i> be tracked and found if you use the BBC iPlayer without having paid the licence, you will <i>not</i> be found out for watching some random live youtube channel. It&#x27;s an imperfect rule for a complex world.')
