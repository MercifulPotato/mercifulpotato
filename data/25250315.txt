For example:<p>- use wordpress as your data backend in next.js<p>- not exactly a static site generator, but you can use w3tc plugin to perform full page caching with very long expiry time, which essentially turns your wordpress site into a static site. You can also do this using cloudflare &quot;cache everything&quot; page rule, but it must be paired with another page rule to skip caching if wp cookie found. Similarly, you can add web app firewall rules on cloudflare to disallow login access except for you.')
