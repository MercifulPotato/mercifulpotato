Item(by='Supermancho', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609979262, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25664761, text='&gt; I mean, the evidence is pretty clear by now isn&#x27;t it?<p>I think the evidence is clear that it&#x27;s endemic to the world (like Tuberculosis still is, with most ppl carrying a latent infection). Things are deadly in the world. As far as pandemics go, this one is about as bad as the modern world can handle...ok, some govts can handle. If economies&#x2F;governments fall apart, it will run it&#x27;s course as well. The bet that the entire world will lock down their borders and get vaccines every 6 mo for the rest of  our lifetimes, is silly. Will corona basically be gone this year? Next year? The year after that?<p>It&#x27;s all hand wringing theater at this point. I think there&#x27;s plenty of evidence that govts are taking advantage of the situation, but that&#x27;s not the same as it being a grand conspiracy to release a virus for transhumanistic purposes (to get ppl used to getting govt injection). That&#x27;s also nonsense.')
