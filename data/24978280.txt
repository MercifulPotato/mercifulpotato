It was a logical step the majority of citizens gladly took to get to this comfy level we&#x27;re at... balancing lockdowns and social&#x2F;economic needs is a tremendous challenge. I dont know a single person who felt put-upon by the lockdowns, but I appreciate that there are people at the fringes who appose any and all restrictions like those of &quot;lockdowns&quot; but I&#x27;d pay that price again for this period of relative normality we get as a reward.
