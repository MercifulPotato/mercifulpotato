First with Hugo, then converted again from Hugo -&gt; Jekyll.<p>I could not be happier with the results (...with Jekyll anyway, less so with Hugo). And there is no npm.<p>The biggest problem for me was mentioned in the article - security. It felt like I was frequently having to babysit updates in Dokuwiki and Wordpress.  Both of the update procedures felt precarious and <i>dangerous</i> - more than once they&#x27;d fail to update and hose something on the server and I&#x27;d need to go in with a SFTP client or SSH and try to rectify whatever the hell happened. I grew to fear the updates and started to procrastinate doing them which was a warning sign. Perhaps they are perfect and flawless these days?<p>And even when I had updated there was always this lingering feeling that there was some unknown&#x2F;unpatched exploit or I was 12 hours too late patching and so someone was &quot;inside&quot; my wordpress running a spam&#x2F;phishing operation without me knowing (happened to me, but perhaps 15 years ago now and was due to the hosting provider so not really relevant... I only found out about that one when a victim of the phishing operation did a whois on the domain and sent me threatening messages. Nice.)<p>These sites that were on Wordpress&#x2F;dokuwiki didn&#x27;t even need to be &quot;dynamic&quot; anyway - they just needed to serve content and provide a simple way for people to edit the content. Github pages does a <i>great</i> job for this - non-tech users just use the in-browser editor and if they accidentally delete something there is the git changelog.  The time &quot;lost&quot; to do a one-time compilation of the site is totally paid back by the near instantaneous loading time compared to the bloated feel of the previous sites waiting for PHP+MySQL to do its thing on some VPS or shared host (I did not have a CDN).')
