This leads to another less-than-ideal situation, where companies are incentivized to spend money protecting their monopoly instead of innovating. Fundamentally this is bad.<p>But it turns out that the capital cost of new technology is extremely high, and it becomes a corollary that anyone who wants to spend their lives developing the next technology should locate themselves in the most favorable funding environment.<p>Europe can avoid being a tech backwater if it can figure out how to provide a favorable funding environment.<p>One technocratic solution would be to make it the governments problem to reap reasonable returns from tech. Offering every citizen the option of purchasing up to 100.000 euros in tech bonds yielding 5% that EU governments become responsible for investing would unleash trillions of euros while exerting significant pressure on unproductive assets.')
