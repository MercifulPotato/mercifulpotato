Modern cars have huge oversized tires with massive friction potentials.  In normal driving we never get anywhere near those friction limits.  It all sits in reserve for that time we need to stop <i>now</i>.  Our cars can stop on a dime in an emergency, far far shorter than current regulations mandate.  Compare any new car today to a classic car from the 60s or 70s (on the old rubber).  Our stopping distances today are half or even a third of previously accepted norms.  The price for that ability: rubber on the road.  It is a choice we have actively made, one i doubt many would reconsider.  Who here would buy a non-polluting tire if it meant your car stopped even 25% slower?')
