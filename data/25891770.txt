Prior to the pandemic our building hosted mixers, Halloween parties, winter and summer parties. Our building is 70% renters &#x2F; 30% owners. The tenants are constantly bemoaning the lack of community. But rather than engage their community most would rather drive back out to the suburbs and spend time in that community.<p>BTW, I was just about to agree with you. But I just realized that we’ve been social distancing for almost a year. It felt like centuries ago since I had more than a 5 minute conversation with my neighbors.')
