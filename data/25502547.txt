An ever changing everything, undocumented everything, tons of languages and frameworks to choose from.  I was immediately turned off by how complex, immature, and ever-changing that everything was.<p>To me, the most important selling point of Ionic is that I can write code once (Ionic UI Framework + Angular or React or Vue), then run it through Capacitor and it spits out a NATIVE mobile app that runs in a WebView (not a PWA, but they support PWAs).<p>I don&#x27;t have to know anything about Android or SwiftUI.  If I want to access native features (such as camera or location) I simply use a Capacitor plugin.  Again, zero native code, the plugin handles it.  There are plugins for things like storage, clipboard, file system, haptics, and more.<p>If you were ever turned off by the complexity of mobile app development take a look at Ionic.  If you know HTML, CSS, a JS framework, and can learn their (simple) framework language you can write a fully functional app without knowing anything about the native coding.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ionicframework.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ionicframework.com&#x2F;</a> &#x2F;&#x2F; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ionic-team&#x2F;ionic-framework" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ionic-team&#x2F;ionic-framework</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capacitorjs.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capacitorjs.com&#x2F;</a>')
