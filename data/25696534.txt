The real slipperly slope is unlimited powers that Big Tech currently enjoys. But yeah you and everyone else will realise in days to come as to why this argument of yours was wrong to begin with. You haven&#x27;t thought it through. You just want a short-term problem resolved immediately: throw Trump out of office asap, shutdown conspiracy theory sites and stifle any expression for the right wing. You haven&#x27;t thought of the long term consequences a.k.a Second Order Effects.')
