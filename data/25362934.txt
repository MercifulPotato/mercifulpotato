Resulting email happened to be on a valid domain I have no control of. There is no validation step when creating member accounts, it is just an API call.<p>- Decided to stop using AWS and close everything down.<p>AWS provides one way for customers to stop using AWS service offerings - by closing all AWS accounts. Account closure is done by signing in as root into every account, which for member accounts requires password reset with new password sent to email. Due to typo in a member account email I can&#x27;t access it.<p>I&#x27;ve been in contact with AWS Support and basically they said, that because I can&#x27;t close account, which I created myself, I can&#x27;t leave and terminate services.  They keep me hostage.<p>Best they could offer is to apply IAM controls to &quot;suspend&quot; everything, but technically accounts have to stay and should AWS introduce new charges for accounts, however unlikely, I&#x27;ll have to pay.<p>Not asking for a leagl advice, obviously, wanted to ask is there anything in law you know of which can be used to end this engagement. I could just cancel credit card and be done with it, but it really rubs me the wrong way and I want a clean way out.<p>I am in Europe.')
