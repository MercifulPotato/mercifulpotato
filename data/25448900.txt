For tech to take off you really need a significant &quot;platform&quot; player to emerge - someone that is able to position themselves as a middleman where the value made by 3rd parties significantly outweighs the value made by the middleman. That is what causes a technology to really bloom and get broadscale uptake. Facebook just isn&#x27;t interested in that. They&#x27;d rather have a smaller pie where they own it all than capture a larger piece of a giant pie but be just one part of it.')
