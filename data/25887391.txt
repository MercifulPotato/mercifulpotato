It&#x27;s not.<p>There are a lot of places where this money has gone that are illiquid though. One would be American property; for most households a good chunk of their wealth is their house. In high-COL, high-property areas the main thing preventing a fall in house price is the lack of supply.<p>Another part of it is China and other countries with large amounts of USD. China has tight capital controls though so none of that money is about to leave suddenly any time soon. but if a big chunk left at once it would probably make the 1998 Asian capital flight look like child&#x27;s play. Some countries like Saudi Arabia are trying to figure out how to spend it; Vision Fund literally created (and destroyed) very big companies in very short order. When Japan had this problem the hangover lasted for a decade, and depending on your view may even be continuing to this day.<p>Of course, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, so these things are mostly theoretical until they&#x27;re not. But no use holding your breath trying to wait for it.')
