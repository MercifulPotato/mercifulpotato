Emulators don&#x27;t give us the insight into the whole stack or understanding on the true reliability of these old systems.<p>As Jonathan says, if our laptops today aren&#x27;t capable of 99.999 percent uptime, then none of the software runnning on it can be either.<p>In the days of the Amiga or the Archimedes, it was quite possible to boot entire app or os&#x2F;app combo and just leave the computer on indefinitely, without it crashing itself even if untouched.')
