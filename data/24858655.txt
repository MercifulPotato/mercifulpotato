As a systems programmer for these devices, I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t have much insight into high-level details like content licensing.<p>However, as a developer of commercial products in those days, I can say that our hands were tied in some ways. For example, showing the electronic program guide as a grid was problematic due to patents owned by TV Guide. I suspect the grassroots projects were able to play a bit more fast and loose with these things, thus leading to the UI differences you observed.')
