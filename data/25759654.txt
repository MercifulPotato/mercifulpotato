On a laptop screen, you can only read a few lines at a time. Especially on apps that add menus and other stuff to the top and bottom, like IDEs, browsers, editors, etc. A few lines more would do a lot of good. It&#x27;s really like you&#x27;re looking at everything through a letterbox opening.<p>In fact, 15 years ago I had a coworker who used two 20&quot; 1200x1600 on their side next to each other. That worked really well for having lots of text next to each other. It&#x27;s basically a gigantic 3:2 screen, which is still a tiny bit taller than 16:10.')
