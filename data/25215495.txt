The only real upgrade I did from Apple was to the 12 core Xeon. Other than that I kept the base 32GB memory, though I did get a 1TB SSD from the 256GB base offering.<p>... then I went to NewEgg and got 192GB of memory for $800ish, rather than Apple&#x27;s exorbitant $3,000. And seriously, why? Same manufacturer, same specs. And convenience factor? It took a good 45 seconds to install the memory, and I&#x27;d wager anyone could do it (it&#x27;s on the &#x27;underside&#x27; of the motherboard, all by itself, and has a little chart on the memory cover to tell you exactly what slots to use based on how many modules you have).<p>And then I bought a 4x M.2 PCIe card and populated it with 2TB SSDs (that exceed the Apple, with sustained R&#x2F;W of 4500MB&#x2F;s according to Blackmagic) for just around $1,100, versus the $2,000 Apple wanted. Only downside is that it cannot be the boot drive (or maybe it can, but it can&#x27;t be the _only_ drive).')
