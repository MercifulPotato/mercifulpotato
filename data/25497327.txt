Just like the iPhone had a few years head start with the iPod. They got into people&#x27;s mind, built a brand, and by the time the iPhone came out, and by the time the iPhone became a beast everyone else was playing catch up.<p>Remember how blackberry was so desperate to make an app store, and it was an absolute heap of shit?<p>Well Apple basically created an ecosystem where engineers were running apple hardware with a decent development environment. By the time anyone else could compete a few years passed, apple was a clear market winner, and all competitors were just trying to not get decimated. Took android a while before it was a real good apple competitor, and still playing catch up in many ways.<p>Tesla is in the same boat. Eventually there will be better EVs for less money for specific needs. But Tesla will always be synonymous with EVs. First thing you think about. The thing you judge everything against. Not to fanboy Tesla. That company has many many problems.')
