It&#x27;s about the <i>Aesthetics of Silence</i>. The more withdrawn an artist becomes, the more celebrated. The ultimate level according to her, is not communicating, and not even creating anything.<p>&gt; So far as he is serious, the artist is continually tempted to sever the dialogue he has with an audience.  Silence is the furthest extension of that reluctance to communicate, that ambivalence about making contact with the audience which is a leading motif of modern art, with its tireless commitment to the “new” and&#x2F;or the “esoteric.” Silence is the artist’s ultimate other-worldly gesture: by silence, he frees himself from servile bondage to the world, which appears as patron, client, consumer, antagonist, arbiter, and distorter of his work.<p>– Susan Sontag, <i>The Aesthetics of Silence</i>')
