There is nothing stopping a developer from supplementing something that the IDE doesn&#x27;t easily support. For example I use PyCharm these days and I when I make a change to a file I automatically want the test associated with that file to run- this is not supported in PyCharm (or atleast I don&#x27;t know how to get PyCharm to do it) so I wrote a script that runs in the background of my shell watching for changes on files on my project and running appropriate tests.<p>The point if an IDE doesn&#x27;t have a quick way of doing something that is necessary for your workflow, it doesn&#x27;t mean that the 20 other things that the IDE does are useless. Any working developer should continue to be able to extract value from the features that the IDE provides and jump back to fill the holes themselves (via shell scripts or what have you) instead of saying &quot;Whelp this means IDE is a crutch now and I must revert to only using &#x27;Unix as IDE&#x27; and only relying on sed&#x2F;awk&#x2F;grep and friends&quot; to aid my development workflow.')
