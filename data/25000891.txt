If you want to buy a modest 1 bedroom in SF for $1M (lol) you can make a $250,000 down-payment via margin loan and take the other $750,000 as a mortgage, so you get the full deductibility of both the mortgage and the downpayment, and you can still see future appreciation in your equity position. YMMV, of course, and subject to your personal risk tolerance.')
