Here are some of the things I&#x27;m looking forward to using:<p>* Generally a more clean language for everyday use, codifying existing patterns like newtypes (opaque types), typeclass derivation and extension methods<p>* Improved type inference &amp; lots of other quality of life improvements<p>* A macro system based on the idea of multi-stage programming. This has a lot of potential for improving both type-safety and performance. An example: beating existing database systems query optimization with ~500 lines of Scala code [1]<p>* TASTY, a new intermediate representation (AST) for artifacts. This means that Scala will have a much better version upgrade &#x2F; binary compatibility story in the future. (e.g. TASTY is used for facilitating 2.13 &lt;-&gt; 3.0 bi-direction upgrade!)<p>* Significant compile time improvements over Scala2 alraedy[2] (and we&#x27;re only at M1 release)!<p>Scala has already been a wonderful language to work with professionally with many great tooling (linting, automatic migration, 2 good OSS IDEs), and I think Scala 3 will certainly push the state-of-the-art forward in many departments in the coming years.<p>[1]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.purdue.edu&#x2F;homes&#x2F;rompf&#x2F;papers&#x2F;rompf-icfp15.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.purdue.edu&#x2F;homes&#x2F;rompf&#x2F;papers&#x2F;rompf-icfp15.pd...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;not_xuwei_k&#x2F;status&#x2F;1323643312230772737" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;not_xuwei_k&#x2F;status&#x2F;1323643312230772737</a>')
