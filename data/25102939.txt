I live in a London suburb and thereâ€™s been a huge rollout of charging points already - within a few hundred meters of my flat there are at least 6 high voltage charging points.</i><p>How many people live within a circle of &quot;a few hundred metres&quot; in London? It averages 4700&#x2F;km^2 across all of Greater London according to Wikipedia, it will be denser in the middle. How many cars is that? TFL says average of 0.3 cars&#x2F;person.
