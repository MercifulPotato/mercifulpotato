The problem is, day-to-day you don&#x27;t have to do all of those things in 45 minutes while several people at the table watch you.  Personally I&#x27;m a fan of a short programming exercise (perhaps even this problem) that you can take home and walk through with the team at a later time.  I know those are detested by some, but I think they&#x27;re fair (assuming the task is not something outrageous; something that can be knocked out in an evening perhaps) and give a much better idea of what an employee is capable of.')
