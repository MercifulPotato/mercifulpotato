It&#x27;s not about being &quot;still in development&quot;.<p>All of our organs (heart, liver, knees, joints, ears) can deteriorate in various ways if we don&#x27;t take care of them or abuse them in certain ways as adults (e.g. ears and loud music, especially on headphones, can lead to reduced hearing). Heart, well, we can have the heart of a 80 year old at 40 if we have the wrong lifestyle.<p>So why not eyes as well?<p>(Not to mention myopia usually rises over time in adults that have it - and they change glass perscriptions etc.), so it&#x27;s clearly something that develops in adulthood too. Not to mention other things related to the eyes and their plasticity etc., like presbyopia, that strike at ~ 40-45 or so.')
