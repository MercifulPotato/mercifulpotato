Item(by='dhagz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603375020, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24854513, text='&gt; Jeff Katzenberg, the co-founder, has been &#x27;making content and selling to kids&#x27; for 40 years to the tune of literally Billions. Star Trek films, The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Shrek, How to Train your Dragon etc. etc. - just huge, monster titles.<p>My argument against this point is simple: few of those were original content conceived by Katzenberg&#x2F;DreamWorks&#x2F;Disney. They were existing stories (most already successful as books). The only things I can see in his filmography that are possibly original and hugely successful are Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Kung Fu Panda, and Madagascar, Road to El Dorado, and _maybe_ Chicken Run.')
