(brick your device physically)<p>The lock feature is implemented via iCloud and the &quot;Find My Mac&quot; page, which is able to remotely shut the soft fuses via BIOS&#x2F;EFI, and in return physically bricks the hardware. Anybody that has control over your iCloud account (e.g. a malicious third party) can potentially do this. See [1], this happened to a lot of companies (customers) that had problems with malicious third-parties getting access to their network.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s incorrect. They sued the company because they were supposed to take the devices apart and recycle&#x2F;recover the parts. Not resell them as manufacturer refurbished.<p>How come that they could only prove that by having more than 18% of devices that were sent to be trashed with active GPS antennas, and active remote iCloud software tracking? [2] Also, recycle is defined as re-cycling, not re-abandoning. The definition of recycling among the population seems to be a different perception than yours.<p>Do you honestly think Apple would&#x27;ve dropped the lawsuit if the devices would&#x27;ve been repaired and given away for free? Also kind of related: The lawsuit that happened in Norway, where Rossmann was called as a witness [4]<p>&gt; They took out the headphone jack because wires are a pain in the ass and the state of the art for wireless headsets is good enough for the majority.<p>Literally a couple months after PayPal and other payment providers were banned by removing the headphone jack in the 8th gen iPhone, Apple Pay was introduced. You&#x27;re making it sound like 2 or 3 tiny low-voltage wires are harder to implement than a Bluetooth antenna wiring... c&#x27;mon, really?<p>&gt; (history of default shells in macOS)<p>You&#x27;re making it sound as if bash was only inside macOS for a short time. bash, for the sake of argument, has been in use since macOS 10.2 which was released in 2002 [3], whereas 10.0 was a public beta and 10.1 was released the same year in 2001. The argument of a tcsh being in use for 9 months, and bash being in use for over 19 years is quite the opposite way around than you seem to perceive it.<p>=========<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT208987" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT208987</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;apple&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;4&#x2F;21499422&#x2F;apple-sues-recycling-company-reselling-ipods-ipads-watches" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;apple&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;4&#x2F;21499422&#x2F;apple-sues...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.apple.com&#x2F;release&#x2F;mac-os-x-102.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.apple.com&#x2F;release&#x2F;mac-os-x-102.html</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repair.eu&#x2F;de&#x2F;news&#x2F;apple-crushes-one-man-repair-shop&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repair.eu&#x2F;de&#x2F;news&#x2F;apple-crushes-one-man-repair-shop&#x2F;</a><p>=========<p>Again, my arguments were to counteract the argument that &quot;Apple is acting in good faith for the people&quot;, because I do not think that anything innovative can happen on a crippled platform.<p>Apple actively shuts down innovation, every time it could be seen as an alternative to their own product, which they will release only once market adaption has been done by pioneers. This was happening a lot of times with hardware, and a lot of times with software.<p>I personally would choose repairability over anything, always, because I&#x27;ve learned my lessons the hard way with financial burdens.')
