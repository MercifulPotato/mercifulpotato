That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you donâ€™t get to hang out with your friends anymore.<p>The mods were moderating.  Discord didn&#x27;t even try to claim otherwise.  The group was just huge and things inevitably slipped past the mods now and then.  That happens in every platform.  It&#x27;s not the server&#x27;s fault.<p>Bottom line is Discord has the power to deal with the individual users but they chose to nuke the server instead.  What a convenient decision.')
