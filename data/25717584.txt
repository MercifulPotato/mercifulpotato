There is greater cultural harmony overall, making it feel very safe and relaxed.  In the cities, there is a lot of isolation despite the number of people, but in more rural areas there is a more relaxed attitude.  While English is taught there from a young age, it may be difficult feeling truly integrated into the fabric of the culture without learning the language.  It depends on what sort of work you do for &quot;work&#x2F;life balance&quot; since Japanese salarymen are sort-of expected to work long hours.  If you work for a Japanese company or a European or US company in Japan, the differences in expectation will be notable.')
