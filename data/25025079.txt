It forced me to completely relearn how to type, and I still am not back to my 100 WPM, with no benefit.<p>If I were to do this again, I would go for a wired split staggered keyboard. I never take it anywhere so I don&#x27;t need the portability, and I&#x27;d avoid all the issues with latency and low battery.')
