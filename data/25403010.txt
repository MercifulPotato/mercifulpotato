We&#x27;ve got a lot more data on COVID than we do on the vaccines.<p>Sure, but we don&#x27;t know much about long-term morbidity tied to COVID infection, or exactly how many people it will get in the end.  Even if I&#x27;ve got it all wrong--- the vaccine is riskier than our current data implies in the age 24-30 group, and fewer people from age 24-30 will get it because things burnt themselves out earlier-- what about the risks of long-term morbidity from COVID-19 infection in this group?  Even that alone dwarfs likely vaccine risks.  A whole lot of people are getting hospitalized, and even only 5% of them ending up with some degree of long term disability is daunting.<p>There&#x27;s big error bars all around, but they largely don&#x27;t overlap, and COVID has profound downside risks.')
