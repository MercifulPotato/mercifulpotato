Yes it&#x27;s a value judgement.  But it&#x27;s a particularly awful value to hold:<p>- Advocating for the death of a million people when it&#x27;s avoidable is abhorrent<p>- It would be more than that, due to the collapse of health services, causing people who would currently survive to die instead<p>- It would be more again due to the increased likelihood of viral mutations when left to run rampant<p>- Also due to the collapse of health services, most deaths would be outside hospitals, i.e. at home, slowly suffocating to death<p>- Some would survive with brain damage due to lack of oxygen at home<p>- While dying, people at home would know if they could get a hospital place they&#x27;d probably survive, and avoid brain damage, but they can&#x27;t get one<p>- It wouldn&#x27;t even boost the economy, because a million deaths is actually quite a drag on the economy, especially when most of them are dying at home with their families staying at home to look after them due to collapse of the health services<p>- It would be horrendously traumatic; a lot of people would struggle to work afterwards after watching their family members, friends, neighbours and people they know die at home slowly from an avoidable cause<p>- It would cause tremendous social division, as many of the traumatised people having watched their family members (&amp; friends, etc) die, avoidably, would know it was caused by the actions of their own neighbours &amp; local community, along with national decision-making to &quot;sacrifice&quot; those million<p>- That&#x27;s just deaths; survivors with long Covid would also be a large drag on the economy, struggling or unable to work, requiring support, and potentially expensive for the healthcare services and their familiies in later life if it&#x27;s long-term organ damage as some fear.  The numbers with long Covid would exceed the current number of official unemployed<p>- Advocating for serious life-long disability for another several million people when it&#x27;s avoidable is abhorrent too')
