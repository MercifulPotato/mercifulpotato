They&#x27;re huge, dense XML files, so trying to solve a merge conflict is a challenge to say the least.<p>It&#x27;s been a long while since I&#x27;ve done much iOS dev but I also recall when learning Storyboards that there were lots of things that just seemed half baked or poorly thought out.<p>For example, the only way to set a corner radius from the UI was to type the key-path of the layer property into a &quot;Runtime Attributes&quot; input, in a totally separate tab from the rest of the visual properties.<p>I also recall headaches over things like setting the colour of the status bar, or titles on Navigation controllers, where the runtime value would often be different to what IB showed for some reason.')
