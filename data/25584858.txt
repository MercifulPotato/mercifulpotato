They say they get the same amount of work done in 4 days as they used to in 5. The business gets the same work out of them by paying 20% less. It&#x27;s not fair on anyone. I think we need to stand our ground and demand the same compensation if our output is the same. Otherwise while you may feel satisfied with a 20% pay cut for an extra day, you&#x27;d be even more satisfied if you could just take that extra day. That&#x27;s what everyone deserves, compensation for their work, not hours on the clock.')
