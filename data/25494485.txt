I find it to be the worst when the piece of work is something substantially new in the team - like developing a new application, different from other projects the company has done.<p>&gt; <i>Even something as simple as &quot;you make this module, you make this module, I make this module and they all communicate through this core interface&quot; is far from trivial.</i><p>Yup. So the other day, we had to develop a completely new GUI app based on customer&#x27;s initial wishlist, and we wanted to split the work along those lines - and I really agonized over that, because at the early stage <i>none</i> of this is stable. Especially not the &quot;core interfaces&quot; - which tend to stabilize somewhere close to MVP. So here I am, trying to wring out some sense out of a superposition of 20 different design ideas in my head, and I&#x27;m being asked to <i>split work</i>. We ended up splitting the project into big subdomains, and designing interfaces along those subdomains - becoming a poster child of Conway&#x27;s law - and I hated it. But we made it work.<p>I could derive two lessons from that project.<p>One, design isn&#x27;t going to be perfect up front - everything will end up being repeatedly redesigned as the project progresses, so there will be opportunities to fix bad decisions. So you may as well pick the least bad split and get the work going.<p>Two, actually, if you instead let a single person mull over that design in their heads for two weeks instead of forcing them to &quot;just split work already&quot; on a project that took a year to get to MVP, maybe this would have saved <i>a lot</i> of redesigns down the road.')
