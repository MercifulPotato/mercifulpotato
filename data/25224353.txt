Item(by='steelframe', descendants=None, kids=[25225061, 25224389], score=None, time=1606433981, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25222166, text='I personally find the concepts that the Mutt UI implements to be amazingly efficient for any task that requires human review of individual items in a set.<p>For example, I am a moderator for a popular subreddit. I&#x27;ve written a Python app that uses the requests module to interact with the Reddit API and displays the items on the mod queue via curses, Mutt-style. I use columns to give me succinct metrics on each element, such as the number of times the author of a submission posted the same URL across other subreddits (that&#x27;s a strong indication of spamming). I move around the list with vim-like key bindings (i.e. k&#x2F;j for up&#x2F;down), and when I want to approve a post or comment, I just hit &#x27;a&#x27;. If I want to remove a post or comment and ban the author, I just hit &#x27;b&#x27;. If I want to dig in to the post or comment to get more data about it, such as view its full contents along with all the reports on the item, I just hit space or enter. From there I can hit one of the usual keys to approve, remove, etc.<p>Since I&#x27;m a huge fan of instant UI feedback, I immediately remove the item from the list once I&#x27;ve hit a keystroke to take action on it. I asynchronously schedule the Reddit API call on a queue that implements the action, making sure to .join the queue on the app quit path so if I&#x27;m feeling especially twitchy about blasting through the mod queue and leaving before all the API calls can complete, I don&#x27;t leave them dangling.<p>Any time I have any tasks at work that require manually making quick-fire decisions about largely homogeneous tasks, I routinely evaluate how hard it is to hack up a similar Python+requests+curses app to mimic Mutt. It&#x27;s addictive. It&#x27;s also mildly infuriating when someone builds a tool and forces you to use their &quot;super special value-add web UI&quot; without providing a stable and documented RESTful API.<p>Even if I can funnel only 90% of the stuff through my Mutt-like app and need to resort to the web UI for 10% of more special-case items, I still count that as a big win for my personal productivity (and sanity).')
