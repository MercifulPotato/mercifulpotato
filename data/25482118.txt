Current population is 330 million. So if the entire population becomes infected thatâ€™s 5.9 million dead.<p>It won&#x27;t get anywhere near that, as it doesn&#x27;t take into account asymptomatic (I&#x27;ve seen estimates in some areas as high as 20:1, which would put the number dead at ~300k) and due to herd immunity not everyone is going to get infected anyway.')
