At the end of the day it seemed like Gebru published a paper that was quite critical of how Google intends to make a sizable portion of their revenue, and anyone should understand that when you do that in a large company, it&#x27;s going to get extra scrutiny. And it could very well be that the whole purpose of Google&#x27;s &quot;ethical AI&quot; team in the first place is to just provide a &quot;veneer of morality&quot; over what are some fairly unnerving practices and consequences of AI. But regardless, the honorable thing then for anyone on that team is to simply resign, say that &quot;I don&#x27;t agree with Google&#x27;s values&quot;, and find someplace else to do your work (it&#x27;s not like these people couldn&#x27;t get highly paid jobs elsewhere).
