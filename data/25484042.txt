Another 10 minutes for nightly prayers as well. Unfortunately all I can say is it honestly has transformed me into a schizoid. It has developed myself into being far more comfortable alone than with others. I&#x27;ve gone weeks without talking to people. I&#x27;ve learned solitary coping mechanisms. I&#x27;ve basically been able to perform therapy on myself and manipulate me individually in a way so that I can achieve desired results. I often feel like it&#x27;s other people who bring about negative results in my life more than the other way around.<p>I also recognize I&#x27;m &quot;wrong&quot; socially in a way that&#x27;s completely abnormal. But, having tried numerous times to be social, I always end up in the same scenario going back to what I know is tried and true. I&#x27;d be curious to know if anyone else has lived a similar way.')
