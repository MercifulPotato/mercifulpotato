All they care is that the game works on the custom hardware and drivers Google&#x2F;AMD provides for Stadia. That is the only platform they will test  that version on. (This is very similar to how console development happens. You have a fixed set of hardware so you just develop for that without a care for anything else really)<p>Sure the distance is smaller then starting with the Windows or Xbox&#x2F;Playstation versions but there is still a lot of work to get it to work on any random pc someone builds.')
