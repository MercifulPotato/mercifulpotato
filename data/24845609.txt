Hell, you could run your own ad server or use on-page links most of the time.<p>But there are some huge markets where this doesn&#x27;t work well.  Generalized local news is the classic problem.  It&#x27;s difficult to come up with a highly relevant ad mix that can be placed against &quot;Mayor Announces End to Glass Recycling&quot; today and &quot;Local Sportsball Team Wins Championship&quot; tomorrow.  Even if you had Google&#x27;s range of inventory, you&#x27;re dealing with content that may not be brand-friendly. (Who wants their ad next to a Coronavirus death counter or a beached whale?).<p>It almost feels like the entire creepy-ad ecosystem is built to service that sort of publisher.  It offers an endless stream of ads which aren&#x27;t lowest-bidder without having to care about content relevance, and it provides an &quot;algorithm said so&quot; deniability when the ads get placed embarrassingly.<p>It sort of works, allowing the tattered remnants of the local newspaper to keep their heads above water if they pile enough ads on the page, but it&#x27;s then projected onto a broader market that probably doesn&#x27;t need it, and where it only provides marginal benefits at high costs (financially, technically, and in privacy)')
