I was too chicken to pirate Photoshop but knew that I needed better tools to do what I needed. I went on to use the GIMP to make Runescape forum signatures (proud member of $clan, $skill in woodcutting, etc). That was the first time I had people PMing me, asking me to make something for them. The first time I “sold” anything. A thrill I don’t experience anymore.<p>I went on to use the GIMP to make textures for Morrowind mods, diagrams and design mockups in college, and my wedding invitations.<p>Today I use the GIMP to design  software architecture diagrams, mockups, and my D&amp;D battlemaps.<p>I don’t mean to beat the dead Free Software horse, but this tool was indispensable for my creative young self. I’m gonna go give them some money now for the first time in 15 years of using the software. Thanks for sharing this.')
