I have social phobia, and I also fear that I am not good enough and I do not even try because of it, it holds me back. I even fear working in groups of strangers online. I really do not know what to do. So I suppose I have performance anxiety (I do not know if there is such a thing), and I have social phobia.<p>I also have anxiety about my health when I notice something out of the place, but that is a different sort of issue. I remember when outside there were construction workers and beneath me the floor moved and I almost had a panic attack because of it. At first I did not know it was caused by them, I thought something was happening to me. It got better when I realized it was just them.')
