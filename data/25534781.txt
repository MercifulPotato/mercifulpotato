It often involves a clock (&quot;my job is to be the receptionist for these 8 hours&quot;) or basket (&quot;my job today is done when I&#x27;ve filled&#x2F;emptied this basket of TPS reports&quot;). The car assembly example from the article is of this type: the job is to fill the (not actually physical) basket with as many cars as possible, in a shift.')
