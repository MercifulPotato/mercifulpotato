I think one of our modern&#x2F;liberal theses is (perhaps) being played out currently.<p>Assuming that &quot;brainy&quot; is not totally unrelated to academic&#x2F;educated, we have ratcheted up the supply of braininess. That does include empty credentialist trends, but it also includes people trained in science, engineering, mathematics and such. We have more of all of these people.<p>A lot of the logic behind producing them (ramping up university enrollment massively over decades) has been that productivity and income are a product of &quot;human capital.&quot; IE, an engineer&#x2F;doctor&#x2F;etc. is n% more productive than a dock worker and therefore earns and produces n% more because education. Educate more people. They&#x27;ll produce &amp; earn more.<p>This was, like most social theories, part economics and part romanticism. People view&#x2F;viewed economic gaps between poor and rich countries this way. IE, besides physical capital, you could turn a poor country into a rich one with education.<p>I don&#x27;t think this was totally untrue. That said, I do think reality has given us some reality check nuances. There are other limits&#x2F;factors on economic growth than education. To some extent, education was a proxy for wealth&#x2F;power.. not it&#x27;s source. Income does not necessarily reflect productivity, and productivity itself can be subjective.<p>To put a blunt end on it... &quot;clerk&quot; was, 50-100 years ago, the entry level white collar job. It came with entry level bougie status &amp; income. Today, &quot;clerical jobs&quot; are very common. Those clerks are more highly educated. PCS are basically clerical super-efficiency machines. Yet, modern clerks don&#x27;t have the modern equivalent of old timey clerk&#x27;s status &amp; income.')
