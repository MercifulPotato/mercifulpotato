Some animals just keep distance. From my observations:<p>East London, 10 days ago (full moon), 3am (safe time to ventilate a bit?) a fox (common here) had run behind my window and I closed it instantly, from far away he was howling (coughing?) piteously _as he ran_ as I never heard before. I&#x27;m not sure if I heard him a bit last night again and if could he be fine?<p>I stop hearing activity of one squirrel squatting my attic - the last of him, I believe, he had troubles breathing and was snotty when moving slowly to one corner..')
