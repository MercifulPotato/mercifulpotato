And that&#x27;s not even figuring in the bits about how old I&#x27;ll be then (and presumably less good looking).<p>I do obsess on how to make that slope more gradual (i.e. offer higher utility to my adult off-spring) without impeding their growth and maturation.<p>Older folks definitely get a second wind when they are once again in need to help care for the grandchildren.  But when these grandchildren get older, the grand parents are needed less and&#x2F;or are less interesting to tweens.  Another empty nest situation to navigation, ahem.')
