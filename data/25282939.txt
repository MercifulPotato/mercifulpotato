Item(by='inetknght', descendants=None, kids=[25285250, 25283258], score=None, time=1606950037, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25282766, text='Ahh well I would say that while Philips Hue (name brand) does work well, it is too expensive for the value provided -- by about 2x to 3x. If they were half their current price then I would recommend them to affluent friends and family. If they were a third their price I would recommend them to even the less affluent friends and family. Even then it&#x27;s significantly more expensive than a plain light bulb (even LED ones) but for that you gain colors and ease of remote use.<p>I have some colored lights from Eria that have about as good color spectrum and integrate with Zigbee base stations. They were about 1&#x2F;2 the price of Philips Hue. But the downside is that they don&#x27;t integrate with Apple Home. Apple Home (and Siri) only recognizes the expensive Philips Hue lights even though the Eria ones are connected to the same Philips Hue base station. So with the Eria lights I just change the colors manually with a third party app on my phone.<p>And as a bonus as a developer: Philips Hue has an API to work with the devices connected to the base station. It&#x27;s super fun to tell coworkers about a script that sets my lights in the office (and visible in video meetings) to red because the server in the living room is having trouble. ;)')
