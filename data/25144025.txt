Ideally they can coexist, but for the libertarian ideal to work, humans have to be rationale. I think we are anything but rational although we like to pretend we are \n most times.<p>&gt;<i>unless they consent.</i><p>That consent, to a certain extent, is implicit on being a willing participant in a free democratic society. It&#x27;s part of the social contract.<p>&gt;<i>&quot;the people are the government&quot; in approximately the same way that individuals cells are a human being</i><p>I don&#x27;t think I agree with this analogy. A collection of human cells cannot volitionally decide for the human being to become something wholly different. A government, by the people, can change it&#x27;s entire makeup to serve it&#x27;s changing values. When I say the people <i>are</i> the government, I mean the people in a functioning democracy have the power to make the government reflect their value system. I feel like you are misinterpreting my statement by reading it through a individualist&#x2F;collectivist lens.')
