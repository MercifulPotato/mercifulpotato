Something about seeing the time makes me go into work mode and I have to get up. I think I&#x27;d like something like a &quot;color clock&quot; so when I wake up early, it&#x27;ll show a blue screen, meaning I should go back to sleep, but if it&#x27;s close enough to when I should wake up, it shows a yellow screen or something.')
