I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me being sensitive or if this is common:<p>Whenever I tried using noise cancelling headphones, I always felt what I can only describe as a high air pressure in my ears. The best I can describe it is the feeling of needing to pop my ears but popping them providing zero relief.<p>Is this common at all? Does everyone feel this but somehow are able to ignore it?<p>Anyway fully agree that good passive isolation goes a long way!')
