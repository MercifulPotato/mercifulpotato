Open source doesn&#x27;t mean that a service is provided free of charge. You can just get the code, and that&#x27;s it, no usability is implied. They absolutely don&#x27;t pull the open source rug, in fact they are shining a light on how NOT open-source your Chromium experience was. \nI agree with one thing though: services are not to be trusted. They, or at least you, should have ways to migrate, as painlessly as possible.')
