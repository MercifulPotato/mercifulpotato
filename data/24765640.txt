There are perhaps 10+ million programmers in the wild if you include those who are not professional or full-time.<p>Someone creates a language because they might simply want to learn. Their friend picks it up, has fun, spreads the word. It either dies after a few months or becomes an edge case language in the stack of a company. Someone writes a blog and then it gets more traction.<p>No one actually intends that everyone should learn 2 new languages. But we live on a large planet, people forget that frequently. The social consciousness that is easily accessible from within US might not be in India. So people here might create a language for some issues that already have a language in the US.
