There are a great marks and they must be quite accurate. The are not spaced evenly; they are spaced logarithmically.<p>To build a cardboard slide rule get a table of logarithms accurate to around 3 digits and layout a &quot;ruler&quot; with marks for the values from 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, ... 10.0. These marks however are placed on the &quot;ruler&quot; at the location corresponding to the log of the values: 1.0 is placed at the start of the ruler since log(1.0) == 0 and 10.0 is placed at the end of the ruler since log(10.0) == 1. In between the over values are placed where their log says they should go, so for example log(5.0) == 0.699 so the 5.0 should appear on the ruler 69.9 percent of the way from the 1.0 mark to the 10.0 mark.<p>Two of strips of cardboard labeled in this fashion will give you a very basic slide rule. Placing them next to each other it is very easy to position the slides so that you are &quot;adding&quot; the logs of two numbers. This is how multiplication is done using a slide rule.')
