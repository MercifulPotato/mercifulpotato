It is the real world application of a religion by any particular adherent that impacts society, not what you happen to think the associated text dictates.  Passages are regularly ignored or reinterpreted by adherents of religions to suit their personal needs or desires.  An Islamic politician who wants to promote literacy can find plenty of support for that agenda in his religious texts.  And a politician who opposes that agenda can also find support for his agenda in those same texts.  That&#x27;s the nature of the beast.  Revising the text itself may be forbidden but that doesn&#x27;t mean the interpretation and practice of the religion are immutable traits, universal to all adherents.')
