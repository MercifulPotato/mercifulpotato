It might be like the cars of the 50s though 80s which rarely made 250K miles without major engine service.<p>Cars used to have 5 digit odometers in miles and it was a noteworthy event to “roll one over”. Now, the worst crapbox you can buy will do 100K easily and many of the Japanese imports will do 300K miles with a few external accessories being changed along the way.')
