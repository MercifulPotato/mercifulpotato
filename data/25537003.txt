It seems to have trouble deciding if there are actually dirty files that need changed. So you can&#x27;t just say, &quot;Okay, go find all the binary files that didn&#x27;t actually get moved to LFS and correct them&quot;<p>Instead you end up with random moments where you want to commit a single file and git instead detects 1000 png files that it absolutely could not go on without doing something about.<p>But then the diff is a disaster so good luck understanding that what it is actually mad about is that it wants to move the files into LFS. The only way I finally figured it out was to manually load the object blob and notice one of them was an LFS pointer file.<p>I personally think git annex handles things more elegantly, but lfs won that battle.')
