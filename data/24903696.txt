But nooo, they&#x27;d sold out for the evening. [1]<p>I had to spend the night in Seoul and try again the next day. Train tickets do sell out in every country, not just in America.<p>[1] they did have a standing-only (i.e no seat) ticket on a 5-hour local train. I had luggage, was jetlagged, so there was no way I would have been able to stay standing for a 5-hour journey')
