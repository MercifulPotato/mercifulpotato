Care to address any of the points made in the article?<p>There&#x27;s a reason why security and features are in constant tension; it doesn&#x27;t really work to just ignore security when it happens to be features that you want.<p>You&#x27;d better hope that your niche hardware isn&#x27;t reprogrammable via USB to become an ethernet device that snoops all of your network traffic and injects attacks.
