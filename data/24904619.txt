I get very self conscious about whether I do the right move, like where should I put my right hand, how about left hand, where do i look, etc. I  hugged a friend&#x2F;girl and without thinking I touched my chest to hers and was tapping on her back while at the same time  realizing it wasn&#x27;t  appropriate and then trying to brush off the awkward feeling. I found myself doing that here and there, especially with someone I am not very familiar with. I feel like others know the social protocol without ever learning it explicitly while I somehow  missed to pick it up along the way. I was a shy kid but was perfectly normal in smaller circles of friends or school.')
