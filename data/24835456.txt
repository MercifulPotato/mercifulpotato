Also I remember having some &quot;specialized&quot; encyclopedias on the CDs - about cats, about Formula-1 etc. It was very interesting to just look around random articles, like Scott says.<p>On the slightly related note - I&#x27;ve found recently that Wikipedia has several lists called Vital articles which compile the best and most essential articles.
