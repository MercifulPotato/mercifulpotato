Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605313961, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25087738, text='&gt; but for better jobs that aren&#x27;t paying minimum wage the threat of losing your job is real and the gap before getting a similarly paying job is real and threatening to a lot of people.<p>But for better jobs that aren&#x27;t paying minimum wage, the rules don&#x27;t really change anything. Most of the better jobs pay salary instead of hourly anyway, and even for the ones that don&#x27;t, if you&#x27;re making non-trivially more than minimum wage then you can negotiate around the restriction anyway.<p>Averaging $25&#x2F;hour because you worked 80 hours at $25&#x2F;hour is the same result as having a base pay of $20 and working 40 hours of overtime at $30. So if you were getting paid $25&#x2F;hour and want more hours, you can offer to work for $20&#x2F;hour, get the extra hours and still average $25, i.e. in practice you can waive the overtime premium because doing so doesn&#x27;t put you under the minimum wage.<p>&gt; Companies are paying below minimum wage, refusing to pay over time, requiring off clock time, etc and employees feel like they can&#x27;t come forward because they can&#x27;t afford any interruption in their wages because of a number of things but chief among them is if you&#x27;re living paycheck to paycheck even missing one week&#x27;s wages can put you in a debt spiral.<p>These are really just unlawful methods of avoiding the negative effects of the prohibition on choice.<p>There exist employers who don&#x27;t do those things, so why don&#x27;t those people quit and work there instead? Because their existing job has some countervailing benefit. Maybe it&#x27;s less of a commute, or has more flexible hours, or the alternative job is higher stress or more dangerous. It&#x27;s not legal to have you work 50 hours and pay you for 40, but when the alternative is that you lose the job because it can&#x27;t actually command that hourly wage, prohibiting that choice (or the equivalent one where you get paid for all your hours but at a lower hourly wage) isn&#x27;t actually helping. Because then you get stuck with the alternative where you work for 40 hours and get paid for 40 hours but spend 12 extra hours a week commuting, which might be legal but does nothing for you than to cost you an extra two hours a week and $150&#x2F;month in fuel.')
