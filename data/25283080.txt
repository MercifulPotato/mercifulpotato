Because at the end he was the one who aproved the important things. Of course I also used to take decision in the field and aprove little things. But if placing &quot;video cameras and AI&quot; could replace 70% of my job at that time and pass the rest of the tasks directly to the senior supervisor to aprove it in a faster way, then the junior field supervisor might not be necessary or might have to be retrainned in other areas.')
