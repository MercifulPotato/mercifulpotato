You have defamation laws, you have copyright &amp; IP law, contract law etc.<p>Freedom of expression is a right that is balanced against other types of rights and freedoms. No doubt the USA puts more weight on freedom of expression over other rights, but it&#x27;s by no means the only setting that confers a functioning democracy.<p>It&#x27;s entirely valid to discuss where the balance should sit.
