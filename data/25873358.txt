Range is king in EVs, new or used. I can&#x27;t think of any EV feature quite like a stick shift in an ICE car.<p>I actually am seeing lots of used EVs here in Portland. Mostly Nissan Leafs. They are dirt cheap to buy and nearly free to operate (especially given their terrible range). If you have a commute under 20 miles, you can&#x27;t do better than an EV that&#x27;s 5+ years old.')
