Wise choice, and hopefully it will work well against this new variant.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2027906" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2027906</a><p>Moderna&#x27;s vaccine was focused on the whole spike protein too.  So even though there are crucial mutations in this mutation, both leading vaccine candidates hopefully will still be effective.')
