Fortunately, I was able to get a job in the systems field and worked there for many years. I was able to get back into machine learning about 8 years ago and am semi-retired now.<p>I&#x27;m not complaining as I was always well paid in my career. But sometimes, being too early in a field can be as bad as being too late :-)')
