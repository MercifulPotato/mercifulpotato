Whether or not you think that the police violence was justified (disclaimer: I don&#x27;t, at all. I think the psuedo military tactics US police demonstrated were the opposite of sensible de escalation strategy) I&#x27;d be surprised if you think that police should have the power to decide whether or not they are filmed.')
