Britain was in basically just in for the economic side of the European Communities, and always rejected or scoffed at the idea of European integration, and with its large economy it allowed other Euroskeptical countries to get out of European projects without risking too much. For instance, I could well see a non-Brexited UK (maybe one where Brexit lost by less than 2%) rejecting the Recovery Fund as currently proposed due to how strongly it ties EU countries together, inadvertently strengthening the position of authoritarian eastern countries like Hungary and Poland.')
