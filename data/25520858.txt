Super pleased to share that Iâ€™ve created a FREE course to help you learn how to make Fullstack Serverless GraphQL Apps with Lambda, DynamoDB, Serverless, React and Vue.<p>Learning how to actually ship a product using these technologies was an absolute nightmare. For the past two years I would spend time writing boilerplates and shipping product with them. So I made this course as an up-to-date reference of how to use them all. I also added more sprinkles by trying to explore some advanced Vue patterns and using Apollo Local State as a replacement for Redux. This course also adds to the little Vue Apollo Open Source projects that are out there<p>What I&#x27;ve learnt most from this project and working with GraphQL for the past two years is that if you learn which scenarios call for GraphQL and REST, it will make you a more versatile engineer. However this is all opinionated and the usage of these technologies makes my life as an engineer more comfortable to bring value to the customers I serve.')
