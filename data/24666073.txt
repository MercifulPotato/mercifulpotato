I had a .5 degree fever for a day (normally I&#x27;m 97.5 in the morning and 98.4 in the evening). I coughed like three times. But the sense of smell was completely removed for 4ish days. I have some eucalyptus&#x2F;tea tree&#x2F;menthol shampoo that smells _very very_ strongly. When I couldn&#x27;t smell that anymore it was the craziest sensation. No other symptoms to really speak of. This also appeared later.')
