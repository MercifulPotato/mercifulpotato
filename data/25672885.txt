This question is also really dependent on your own and your friends&#x27; threat models so general advice is only marginally useful here.<p>Personally I use Telegram because there&#x27;s a distribution of it on F-Droid. If you do you should consider telling your friends to only use secret chats since only those are encrypted end-to-end. Signal has some nice features like not storing your in-app contacts on their servers and the &quot;sealed sender&quot; feature which largely hides who is talking to whom in a conversation.<p>As for the others I can&#x27;t really comment on them. Maybe another option to consider is Briar[1] which works entirely peer-to-peer over Tor, Bluetooth or the LAN and defers sending until both devices are online at the same time (which might work for phones).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;briarproject.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;briarproject.org&#x2F;</a>')
