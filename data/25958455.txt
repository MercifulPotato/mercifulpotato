Also more then idiotic since they caused the whole problem to begin with. Without their greed there would be no short squeez, gamestop would have been at 50-60 or whatever fair market value instead of suppressed 5-6 dollars a long time ago.<p>The only illegal thing initially was hedge funds.<p>They then got punished and went to do other illegal things like wash sales, stopping people from buying, collusion with supposedly neutral market makers.<p>Whatever happens I hope the people above go broke first, investors that got conned go after their personal belongings for breaking fiduciary and afterwards spend a long time in jail.')
