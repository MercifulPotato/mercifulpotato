That may not be a new concept - off the top of my head, I know Orwell wrote a lot about it - but you don&#x27;t even seem to understand what the topic of the article is.<p>You are upset about one sentence in the article, one that I also happen to disagree with. And on that basis, this sloppy dismissal of the whole piece? Lame.')
