If a file was updated incorrectly then you just go back to the last known snapshot that worked.<p>Of course this is only as good as the interval you use for your snapshots.  Fim seems like it would be a lot of extra work to do for every file&#x2F;folder, but I could potentially see using Fim though for important files (e.g. tax records?, password vault?)')
