The broad case is reproducing a real-time mirror of some part of the planet in arbitrary detail from data. Reality running on a computer. Nothing you are talking about addresses that. I know all of this tech, I’ve worked with it operationally across many industries.<p>At its core, spatial computing is about queryable reality. 3D scanning of objects, AR&#x2F;VR, etc are all adjuncts to this.
