Item(by='cmrdporcupine', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603128336, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24827392, text='There is no way I&#x27;d buy anything rural without extensive inspection of well and septic, foundation, property, etc.<p>In the last 15 years I&#x27;ve purchased in both Toronto and in rural Ontario with the full set of conditions; financing, inspection, etc. As a buyer I simply won&#x27;t do it otherwise. We have a 6 acre hobby farm near Hamilton.<p>But I also just don&#x27;t bother to go look at properties with language in the text like &quot;Accepting offers on...&quot;. We won&#x27;t play the multiple offers game. In Toronto maybe this is the only way to get a home, but we were able to avoid it there back in 2005 by just hunting in areas that weren&#x27;t &quot;cool.&quot;<p>My experience is there&#x27;s always almost other places that come up, where the seller has more scruples.<p>We might sell our hobby farm soon. I would fully expect any potential buyer to demand inspection.')
