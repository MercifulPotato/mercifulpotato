Rock-solid. Deploy to prod! Why do you want to waste our time executing it on staging env?! What are you, some kind of a unit-test denier?! There&#x27;s a production issue affecting customers, there&#x27;s no time for that. Anything goes wrong, we&#x27;re just restore the prod DB from the last good backup.&quot;<p>The way I see it... if the vaccine creates some long lasting complications in 0.1% of people who took it, than it is not going to be much better than the disease itself, given that it shifts the problems from the older population to the younger one. This wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if the vaccine was rolled out at a normal pace with plenty of controls to figure out any issues and put breaks on it if any unexpected problems were detected.<p>But it looks like the crowd is already set on mass delivering it ASAP, starting with the kids.
