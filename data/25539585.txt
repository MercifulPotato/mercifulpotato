Automation <i>is</i> the job.<p>We (mostly) don&#x27;t code in assembly anymore because there are compilers. Your can say that writing high level code (merely &quot;configuring things&quot; in your parlance) is more &quot;boring&quot; than say, register hacks, but that&#x27;s a bit shallow. (Also, something something leaky abstractions making the whole &quot;it&#x27;ll only be configuring things!&quot; kind of a moot point.)<p>Consider programmers from the 80s&#x2F;90s or early 00s. The ones that still have jobs today are the ones that have kept up with trends and adapted, or otherwise had the luck of being at a place that hasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s the same for the future. Stagnate on old tech, have your career die on the old tech.')
