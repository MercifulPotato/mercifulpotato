I link the person in each meeting minute so that I get a list for links on the person&#x27;s page.<p>Frequency of access:<p>- For active projects, pretty much each (work) day<p>- For older notes, infrequently, maybe once a month. The older a note becomes, the less likely it is that I will have to access it.<p>I started out with Circus Ponies Notebook, migrated to Scrivener, and two years ago started working on my own app, Life Notes[0] (I really wanted links and backlinks and the ability to keep regular files&#x2F;PDFs next to my notes).<p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kitestack.com&#x2F;lifenotes" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kitestack.com&#x2F;lifenotes</a>')
