Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609477479, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600036, text='&gt;Any fork without miners is instantly unable to transact, making the coins useless and therefore worthless.<p>The incentive structure discourages this. If half the hash power goes off to mine Bitcoin Infinite (the fork with uncapped Bitcoin generation), then mining the original Bitcoin would be twice as lucrative because there&#x27;s half the competition. This gets better the more miners leave. If 95% of miners leave for Bitcoin Infinite, then mining Bitcoin becomes  20x more lucrative. There&#x27;s the matter of the difficulty adjustment, but that has been historically dealt with using emergency difficulty adjustments.<p>Meanwhile, the miners who are mining the fork have real expenses (electricity, equipment), which need to be paid, and if there isn&#x27;t sufficient demand for their Bitcoin Infinite coins, they&#x27;ll quickly go bankrupt. Some napkin math:<p>* If the hash and economic power are both split 50-50, then there will be little impact in profitability, but also little impact on Bitcoin<p>* If 90% of the mining power goes to Bitcoin Infinite and only 25% of the economic power follows them, then the miners can expect to see a 72% drop in <i>revenue</i>. If their original profit margins were 20%, they can expect their profit margins to drop to -66%. If we use the price&#x2F;generation rate of just prior to the last halving (May 2020), then that would represent a loss of $9.9M per day (not including opportunity costs&#x2F;lost profits).')
