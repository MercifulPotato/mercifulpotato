As a company that built a rotating globe years ago to visualize our growing user base around the world using our apps, I wanted to share a link to the demo here. Being that we did this years before WebGL became available in all major browsers, we used canvas rendering and shapes of countries from open databases. It is supposed to work across all devices so try it whatever browser you are on now:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qbix.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qbix.com</a><p>Please scroll down to where the globe image appears and click&#x2F;tap it. Feel free to switch countries and click around. I would love to hear your feedback.<p>PS: We have open sourced all this stuff, so if anyone here wants to put a globe on their website, just load our Q.js from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Qbix&#x2F;Platform" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Qbix&#x2F;Platform</a> and then render the Q&#x2F;globe tool and Places&#x2F;countries selector tool with your own options. Unlike the GitHub globe, you can also have users click on countries in the globe to select them, and if you need you can pull in the flags, languages and all the other stuff per country.')
