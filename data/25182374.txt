I don’t know your age or anything other that what you wrote, so I’ll relate my experience.<p>I saw many of these same initiatives beginning as I was moving through high school and college. Being young and generally feeling like I treated people fairly, I assumed that most of the world treated others the same. Sexism seemed antiquated.<p>Fast forward a couple of decades and the women in my life still get second-guessed, mansplained, faced lowered expectations, and&#x2F;or past over for promotions.<p>Some of it is blatant sexism. Some of it is sexism-light, where not being part of the boys’ club leaves them excluded from the power-clique. They still have a markedly different professional experience than I do, because they are women.<p>Is there a better way to handle this than what you described? Maybe. But I don’t think the need for such support mechanisms has expired yet.')
