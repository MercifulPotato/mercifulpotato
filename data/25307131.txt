Item(by='JamesBarney', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607112698, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25305751, text='&gt; I am in a bubble where I mostly talk to college educated people and people who have educated themselves in a similar tradition or are well-read. Perhaps it is snobbish of me, but I am mostly okay with that bubble for discussion forums.<p>&gt; Conditioning on that type of person, who make up most people on HN, Reddit, and Twitter, HN seems like it is in a right-leaning bubble.<p>If most of the people you talk to are college educated people who live in a city than you most definitely exist in a bubble.  Remember 47% of the country voted for Trump(I doubt Hacker news came anywhere near this number).  Of your friends how many voted for Trump?  As an example I&#x27;m a college graduate in his 30&#x27;s who lives in the city. 0% of the 20 people I talk to most often voted for Trump, and maybe 4% of the the extended 200 people I know, voted for trump.  And of that 4%, 3&#x2F;4ths voted for him begrudgingly.  And I live in a southern state that voted for Trump. So when you look at hacker news and encounter opinions that are different than your own it might seem like Hacker News exists in a bubble, but I think it&#x27;s far more likely your life exists in a bubble that&#x27;s stronger than hacker news.<p>&gt; Your assessment of the median voter is being super distorted by the geographic layout of the US, btw. The median voter did not vote for a republican senator.<p>The median senate voter would have voted for a Republican but that&#x27;s mostly because California and New York didn&#x27;t have senate races this year.')
