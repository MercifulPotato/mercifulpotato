I am glad that it worked out in the end and the customer was not required to pay for the bill.<p>Based on this experience, we decided to lower the default value of &quot;max instances&quot; to 100 for future deployments. We believe 100 is a better trade off between allowing customers to scale out and preventing big billing surprises. Of course, customers can always decrease it or increase it up to 1,000, or even above with a simple quota increase request.')
