The creativity, R&amp;D budget have gone the same way.<p>Then what have Intel, AMD and Nvidia ben doing the last few years? We&#x27;ve got increased core counts, more IPC, massive graphics cards chips with specialised cores for AI, raytracing and fast memory. It started with gaming and birthed the deep learning revolution. Those may not be entirely new paradigms, but the advances, especially recently, have been large.<p>There are now so many new chips launching at the same time (XBox, PS5, Zen3, Big Navi, Ampere, M1) that you can&#x27;t really buy them at reasonable prices because the production capacity has become a bottle-neck, and demand far exceeds supply. This is not what decline looks like.')
