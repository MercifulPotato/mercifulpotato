Android has a craptastic audio stack and only Google can fix it.<p>Google would have to rip the heart out of Android and fix it for real time programming properly like OS X did way back in like 10.2?.<p>However, don&#x27;t get me wrong, iOS isn&#x27;t great--it&#x27;s just at least possible.  The fact that you can&#x27;t actually send a defined packet (just a bag of bytes and you don&#x27;t know how many until the call--&quot;HAH! HAH!  You device decided to prioritize something in the OS and your latency just quadrupled--sucks to be you.&quot;) to the Audio system on iOS is infuriating.<p>However, at least it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> on iOS.  On Android, not so much.')
