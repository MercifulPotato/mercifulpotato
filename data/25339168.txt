I was an early adopter of induction in the 90&#x27;s in the Netherlands but moved back to a wood-burning stove when I moved to Sweden. Yes, wood, in Swedish called &quot;vedspis&quot; (firewood-stove). It warms the house, it works when the power fails - which is does regularly out here in the countryside - and it works wonders with a wok. I still have a few induction plates but I hardly ever user them other than outside when there is fire ban in summer.')
