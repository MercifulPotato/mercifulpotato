There are many good reasons to do so. This just isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>I&#x27;ve encountered ~100% custom codebases that are unmaintainable, and I&#x27;ve encountered ~100% custom codebases that are <i>extremely</i> maintainable, even for a new person joining a team. And we&#x27;re not talking about leftPad-esque libs; entire frameworks made in-house.<p>It&#x27;s rare, and there are reasons to avoid it (locking yourself into your own tech, not benefiting from community innovation, not being &quot;on trend&quot; with common dev conventions). But ease of maintenance is not one of those reasons. If it&#x27;s hard to maintain, that&#x27;s on you.')
