I am personally enthralled by philosophy and I&#x27;d also consider myself a rationalist (and have spent a decent amount of time reading SSC), but I&#x27;m unable to draw any sort of putative causal connection between that and being very successful.  Indeed, delving into this stuff is what I do to <i>screw around</i>, so pretty much exactly the opposite.')
