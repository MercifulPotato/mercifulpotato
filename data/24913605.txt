There are no human rights violations at stake, c&#x27;mon.<p>And the DoJ is arguing that <i>Search</i> is a monopoly, not Chrome. And what do you mean, &quot;cannot customize anything and has to suffer&quot;? My original comment was literally about customizing the new tab page to be different. And who is <i>&quot;suffering&quot;</i> from this? Nobody is dying of hunger because Chrome wants to show an ad.<p>The reason your comment was disrespectful is because perspective is important. Human rights violations and genocide are not comparable to a private corporation -- whether it&#x27;s a monopoly or not -- deciding to show a dumb advertisement.')
