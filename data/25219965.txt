I make no claim this is sensible, but I&#x27;ve been bitten by obscure bugs in large libraries before and this way I find debugging is much easier, because I typically only have to worry about my own code.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend this strategy to others. It very much comes down to a personal preference, and I imagine using an existing framework would be much more accessible to someone starting frontend development. I feel I might get some stick if I were to suggest this to newcomers :) I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t know of any existing write-ups!')
