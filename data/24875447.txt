In such case, it doesn&#x27;t matter if there are also legitimate fair use uses of the tool.<p>And that&#x27;s what the README showed: that youtube-dl was built primarily to violate copyright.<p>EDIT: based on other comments, it turns out the offending evidence was in the unit testing <i>code</i> not the README file, which legally makes it a bit worse than if it had just been in the README file.')
