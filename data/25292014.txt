The cartels are big enough that the government can&#x27;t fight them. This results in 0 regulation and a lot of exploitation of the people that live in the regions the cartels settle in. As long as there are people on Earth that want cocaine, Colombia will have this problem (because they produce most of that cocaine).<p>So unless Colombia&#x27;s military can get a lot stronger over night <i></i><i>and</i><i></i> a lot less corrupt, this problem will continue to exist. They&#x27;ve been trying to fight with force for the last 50 years while the cartels have only grown stronger (by a lot actually). So maybe it is time to change strategies and rethink the problem. Because clearly this one hasn&#x27;t been helping (and many think it has made it worse).<p>Edit: I&#x27;m not saying the cartels are more powerful. I said the government is ineffective at fighting them. Guerrilla warfare is difficult.')
