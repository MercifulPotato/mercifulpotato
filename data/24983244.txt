Although Alaska is separated by boroughs, their voting data is not. Researchers come up estimates for how each borough likely voted, but there can be different estimates depending on the methods used. Because of this, it felt more accurate to go with the concrete data that we had, even if it was not at the borough level. Although, I think there is merit to the argument that borough estimates should be used, even if they may not be accurate down to the last recorded vote.')
