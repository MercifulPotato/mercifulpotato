You can have her rap, have her dab, or use autotune but she still won’t fit in as easily as a Billie Eilish.<p>I look at C++ and wish it had C#’s compile-time attributes, first-class reflection, mixins, a decent syntax for pure virtual functions, and a more logical pointer syntax (it’s illogical and you know it). However, they can’t give me those things without drastically breaking backwards compatibility. At that point it’s a new language.<p>I wish we could just develop a C++ 2 for greenfield projects and stop development of C++ where it’s at instead of Frankensteining more features onto it. I guess that’s what Nim and Rust are for.')
