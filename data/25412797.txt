You slow down to a crawl if they are close to you. Like riding in the bike lane parallel to you. Or even catching to you up from behind. Or standing on the opposite lane of road.<p>That’s what I am trying to say: with kids, even if they are nowhere in your path, you want to slow down anyway, because who knows.<p>This rule does applies less to adult bicyclists. For example, if there is a separate, dedicated bike lane and there is an adult bicyclist there, I will pass him. Not so with kids.<p>See the difference?')
