We’re building the largest repository of data science models, with a one-click execution made possible. We call it the A.I. Cloud.<p>Data Science models, today are scattered, and as an engineer and architect of systems, I’ve personally experienced, there is a lot of time spent on trying out the right models, versioning, collaboration and execution. Not everything works alongside everything. We’ve now made this achievable by running a cloud infrastructure where you can not only explore the DS projects, but also run it on the cloud with 1-click. Collaborate with your fellow team mates and work together on a ready Jupyter ecosystem together.<p>Here are some key things to know:<p>• Explore and run, 1000+ GitHub projects on the cloud<p>• Unlimited open source Cloudbooks for free<p>• We have spent time and effort to curate the top projects that our team and existing users nominated for and tried to keep the UX clean and easy to use. Suggest any that you’d want to see in here, a one-click deployment worthy project.')
