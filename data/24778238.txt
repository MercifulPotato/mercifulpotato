What to do if there is post-surgery regret? Why can a person consent to a drastic and permanent gender&#x2F;sex change operation (the effects of some hormones at certain ages is irreversible) while being unable to consent to sex itself? (this is not an appeal to pedophilia as much as it is one of non-hypocrisy).')
