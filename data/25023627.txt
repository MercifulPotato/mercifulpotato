In the UK, the Labour Party has had to eject several members for anti-semitic views (not just anti-Israel) and had to embark on programs to remedy the situation.<p>&quot;In October 2020, the UK&#x27;s human rights watchdog found Labour to be &quot;responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination&quot;.&quot; [1] From the BBC no less!<p>Most of my childhood friends grew up behind the Iron Curtain (Ukraine, Poland, Czech) or in Communist nations like Vietnam, Cambodia, China. Many family members murdered, starved. My Uncle fled with his mother through a forest across the border, chased by soldiers to escape. Many Serbian&#x2F;Croatian friends who&#x27;s parents lived through a very special kind of hell.<p>Perhaps you can ask one of your workmates from Hong Kong what he thinks about &#x27;Socialism With Chinese Characteristics&#x27;? [2]<p>Please don&#x27;t let us assume that one person&#x27;s history or clan&#x27;s mortal enemies represent the &#x27;big picture&#x27; of anything.<p>Trump is a &#x27;thuggish businessman with authoritarian tendencies&#x27; - not actually an ideologue. The extreme views on either side are toxic and have quit a history of mass murder. If we want to compare &#x27;Deaths Caused by Stalin&#x2F;Mao vs. Hitler&#x27; that would be a futile effort I think.<p>Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are both fairly good representations of either side and they&#x27;re both fine men, if you&#x27;re having trouble grasping why most people would be ok with that statement, maybe spend some time in another part of the country (Utah?) and make some friends there.<p>[1] In October 2020, the UK&#x27;s human rights watchdog found Labour to be &quot;responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination&quot;.<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Socialism_with_Chinese_characteristics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Socialism_with_Chinese_charact...</a>')
