There are still some incredible advances happening, and the move toward fully finished production ready parts is continuing. SLA printing has had recent innovations pushing results ahead quite far, with automakers beginning to use parts in production vehicles straight from the printer.<p>There are heaps of other niche applications, from remote location manufacturing to automating customer configured products that couldn&#x27;t be done with traditional approaches, to parts for small fabricators in a range of industries such as aviation and motorsports. Inconel printing is enabling some truly incredible parts for motorsport.<p>I do agree it will unlikely replace mass manufacturing of cheap products, but I think it&#x27;s role in manufacturing has far from peaked. You are right about Etsy knicknacks, but I think even prototyping hasn&#x27;t reached saturation yet.')
