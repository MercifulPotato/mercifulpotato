The memes were always there, and that community has been glorifying losses for a long time. Mostly around options bets during earnings season.<p>The only thing that has changed lately is that trading options become free. Options used to be prohibitively expensive. Oh yeah and a couple people killed themselves, the irony here being that people stop blaming the trader and blame the broker after the trader self harms? Convincing. But it definitely helped bring the attention from everyone that figured they had slightly better self preservation skills and could understand how settlement works.<p>I&#x27;m glad undercapitalized people stopped gravitating towards penny stocks.')
