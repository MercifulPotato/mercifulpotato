I got a Chase credit card but when I initially did the signup called my brother to ask him if he wanted to be on the account and it timed the sign up session out past the account creation but before finalization.<p>I got the card eventually but now I cannot create an online account with it. I called Chase, got transferred 5 times, and then told I would need to go to a physical bank to verify my identity? to create an account. Absolutely not one of them had any clue what &quot;a broken account exists associated with this card in your database, I can guarantee it, forward me to your technical support team&quot; but thats all above a bank reps pay grade.<p>The nearest Chase bank is 1.5 hours away, by the way. Probably just going to cancel the card after cashing out the sign up bonus.')
