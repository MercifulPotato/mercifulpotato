Of course once this mechanism is in your language you might have multiple &quot;rest of the program&quot; parameters which the function can pick between.<p>I found this old thread talking a bit about the lisp condition system [1] which also mentions implementing it in a typed manner.<p>I used Lisp for a while myself as my favourite language (the condition system was part of the reason) but the problem I ended up switching to Haskell because it has much of the power macros provide coupled with a very strong type system.  That&#x27;s why the potential occurred to me that CPS can probably implement something effectively equivalent condition system.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lambda-the-ultimate.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;1544" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lambda-the-ultimate.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;1544</a>')
