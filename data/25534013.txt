I concede that it may have been true in your experiences, but it&#x27;s a fairly toxic pattern to make categorical statements about &quot;what women want&quot; or &quot;what men are like&quot; when the spread of human character is so broad.<p>Let&#x27;s try not to limit what&#x27;s possible by inflicting on the world what we expect.<p>Specifically, statements like these become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Not only are someone&#x27;s perceptions influenced by social proof - if someone is treated as if you expect them to behave a certain way, they are more likely to behave that way (if I&#x27;m going to catch shit for being dishonest anyway, why not lie?).')
