Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=[24958815], score=None, time=1604227723, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24958293, text='A point for Germany: the current outbreak is <i>much</i> stronger than the one in March, even though we didn&#x27;t have obligatory masks in March (they&#x27;ve been in effect since April; few people had them before they became obligatory). We had very few cases during the (pretty warm) summer (in the county I currently live in, there were zero cases in June). March peaked at around 5.5k on a single day, October peaked at ~13k with most days &gt;5.5k.<p>Given that we have a lot more measures in place now (masks, distancing etc), something else has to play a role. February and March were unusually warm and sunny. I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s relevant, but it seems unlikely that the counter-measures predict the peak - they are much stricter now than they were at the beginning of the year.')
