It&#x27;s made even worse if the syncopated line contains chords, and then even more-so if the note lengths within the chord are not robotically static.<p>Writing that on the MIDI piano roll is slobber proof. But if you take music written that way and view it as sheet music, it is nearly impossible to read because of the many ties that don&#x27;t even necessarily begin or even end in the same place as the others.<p>It all ends up looking like layered sheets of snow sliding off your roof. A ribbon of differently-sagging tie-lines making it not only unsightly, but impossible to read.<p>Why sheet music if you have MIDI already? Because as someone who records, I use MIDI for writing, but I don&#x27;t expect other musicians to follow my piano rolls when recording guitar, bass, vocals, etc. and I wouldn&#x27;t want them ever to sound as robotic as MIDI tends to be.<p>Drums however - that&#x27;s one area where MIDI piano roll to sheet music actually works flawlessly, even if the notes don&#x27;t have the usual x| appearance.')
