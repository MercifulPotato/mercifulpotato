For that, 11&quot; is utterly useless; it might have been acceptable in 2005 for checking something online, reading or sending an email, but these days a phone can do that so there are literally 0 uses cases for an 11&quot; laptop imo.<p>The other use case is a portable desktop that I always plug into a (27-38&quot;)  monitor for serious work or gaming; for that MBA is woefully underpowered. I used to work for a company where you could choose if you get an MBA (mostly salespeople&#x2F;PMs&#x2F;etc.) or an MBP (mostly engineers); there were always jokes about how you could immediately tell who never actually does any work ;)')
