I use to believe in UBI, but I&#x27;m really not so sure now. I think it would be less Star Trek and more The Expanse. You take away peoples&#x27; agency and people degrade. We also haven&#x27;t solved resource scarcity, so you do have to have a production cycle (or find a way to totally close the production to recycling loop) before you can really worry about a work-less society.<p>But I go back to the underlying theme of the original Star Trek series with Kirk and Spock. Countless times they were presented with paradise, only to find humans were not quite ready for it. Even in a Federation which had solved resource scarcity, removed money and harvested limitless energy, the desire to explore and seek out new life, and even new dangers and disaster, could not be quenched.')
