For example, I see many MBAs being rational in their relentless focus on efficiency. Yet, this is reactive (to the market), it doesn&#x27;t follow any value in itself. To attempt to do something that nobody did before, or even to pursue a certain value above other, is inherently irrational.<p>Yanis Varoufakis told a nice story about him teaching game theory. At the beginning of the semester, he offered the class a free pass of the course: Each student would write down the grade they would want and they would all be awarded by the minimal grade that was proposed. But first, they would have to agree on this proposal. He mentions that there always was a person who refused to agree. When he asked them, why did they were against it, they responded, without a hint of irony, there would surely be some idiot that would write down a low grade (and they would not pass).<p>Frankly, I don&#x27;t think this problem has a rational solution. It&#x27;s a paradox - by being totally rational, you&#x27;re being irrational. And I think the same is true for rationalism as a life philosophy. If you apply it to everything, the life will be hollow.')
