I think I addressed some of the points you are making in my response to the user dvt. TLDR, there&#x27;s low-quality research in &quot;falsifiable&quot; fields too.<p>But actually, I&#x27;m having a bit of a hard time understanding what your point is, could you help me? I mentioned a specific line that Paul Graham wrote, then said it was &quot;dumb&quot; for the reasons I outlined. Then, in defense of Paul Graham, you posted links to tweets to snippets of research absolutely without any context at all. How would I know whether that research is good or not? I have no training in any of those fields.<p>I&#x27;m really confused about how what you posted defended Paul. Did you want me to see that someone wrote the words &quot;decolonizing&quot; and &quot;math&quot; together and subsequently think that it is stupid, after all, to write the words &quot;hegemonic&quot; and &quot;whiteness&quot; in the same paper?')
