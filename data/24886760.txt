Are they all possibly facing jail time?<p>Is there a requirement to actively monitor the service for possible Iranians? What kind of actions are required specifically to be safe from jail? Is it a requirement to actively block IPs? Spoiler: These things are not specified.<p>Maybe we should be angry with the US government for the lack of legal certainty provided to its citizens.<p>However, given that no one in a situation like Gitlab has been prosecuted, maybe their hands are bound after all.')
