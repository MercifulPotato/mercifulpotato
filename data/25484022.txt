They are stupidly easy if you decide to create the infrastructure for that. You have industrially cooked food, mostly through automated process, in supermarkets, sold as &quot;prepared food&quot;. and actually, many cheap restaurants will have several microwaved prepared food in their menu items.<p>Automatic driving is a very easy task in roads and cities that are designed for it. Instrument all bus lines with ground wires, put a radio beacon on each crossing and sign, a front radar&#x2F;lidar to detect obstacles and 90s tech is enough to automate a whole city. If it was desired, we would already be there.<p>Now, like you point out, there are many tasks that bring joy and people would do voluntarily. Said otherwise, there is a non-null amount of volunteer productive work.<p>Ergo, the goal of automating a society is not to automate 100% of the work, but to automate (100-V)% where V is the amount of voluntary work available.<p>&quot;But Iâ€™d rather order a meal from an expert chef than a robot.&quot;<p>It would be interesting to make a Turing test for cooking. I am sure that there are many robot-made meals that are undistinguishable from chef&#x27;s preparation.')
