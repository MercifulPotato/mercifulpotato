Item(by='Lazare', descendants=None, kids=[25988836], score=None, time=1612187331, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25988486, text='Hilariously, the company going bankrupt can be even <i>worse</i> for shorts, since a bankrupt company will stop trading, and if it stops trading, the short position can&#x27;t be closed.<p>See, eg, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2018-04-11&#x2F;-go-to-zero-isn-t-great-for-short-sellers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2018-04-11&#x2F;-go-to...</a><p>&gt; Seems like a potential strategy hedge funds can use (and maybe are using)<p>Anyhow, no, doesn&#x27;t work. Even apart from getting burnt when the fraud is finally exposed and the company goes bust before your short position is closed or whatever (which is thankfully pretty unusual), stock borrow costs will eat you alive. Also, you can&#x27;t short more than the float (short interest can be over 100%, but that&#x27;s confusing net versus gross), you can&#x27;t collect more cash than the market cap of the company, and you can&#x27;t really bankrupt healthy companies by shorting the stock.<p>(The way short sellers (like Muddy Waters work is they find a company doing a bunch of fraud, they take out a large short position, then they publicise their research. If the market agrees with them, the uncovered fraud tanks the stock price, and they make a healthy profit. Sometimes the company ends up bankrupt and&#x2F;or with their executives in prison, but the cause is the <i>fraud</i>, not the short selling. Short selling an otherwise healthy company into bankruptcy doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense in theory, and doesn&#x27;t seem to happen in practice.)')
