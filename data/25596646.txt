Prof Srinath gives you a crash course in graph theory and network science while still making sense to people who have never heard of either graphs or networks. The only instance when I felt that I was reading a 14 year old book was while reading about the prevalent USD-INR conversion rates. This makes me come to the conclusion that one of the following must be true: Either the book was way ahead of its times; or we haven&#x27;t made much progress in the last 14 years with respect to communication technologies. Since the latter is obviously false, the former must be true!<p>A absolute must read if you are interested in the working of networks science and how the interconnectedness of the world affects us all!<p>Added points to Prof Srinath for pointing out the defintion of &quot;memes&quot; :-D')
