The standard answer is &#x27;fake news&#x27; but that&#x27;s putting cart before the horse. Maybe the distrust comes first, and once those authoritative sources are gone, &#x27;fake news&#x27; is what fills the vacuum.<p>Look at it from the perspective of a regular mainstream conservative: Mainstream news during 8 years of the Obama presidency had them do minimal work on holding the administration to account, and then promptly ramp up to 11 against the Trump administration - with much of the coverage being outright lies (like the Steele document, which was actual Russian misinformation paid for by Hillary Campaign, and used as a basis for investigating a presidential campaign, and even purposely misinterpreting statements, like when Trump called cartels &#x27;animals&#x27; and news promptly decided that this was a slur against regular Mexican-Americans).<p>None of major news networks had open Trump supporters on staff, and actively shielded Biden and Democrats from any criticism. At the same time, those same outlets were&#x2F;are pushing social networks to ban conservative outlets and label mainstream conservatives as bigots and attack them when they speak on collage campuses. Similarly, public health and government officials either ignored, or actively encouraged large scale anti-racism protests in the middle of the pandemic, while cracking down on Orthodox Jews who attended synagogue, or accosted people who visited their families for holidays (meanwhile officials like mayors of New York, Chicago, Seattle, Portland, as well as Speaker Pelosi, and Gov. Newson, openly flaunted lockdown rules and refused to even apologize for it when caught ... because rules only apply to the others).<p>But this mistrust will be attributed to conservatives, Russian misinformation and fake news, because that&#x27;s easy.')
