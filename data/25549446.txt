I guess most confusion comes from as it doesn&#x27;t explain why traction situation (where wheel speeds up relatively) is different than the actual turn (where wheel slows down relatively). Here, as speeding up wheel gear can not spin the worm gear, power is captured &quot;back&quot; to the other wheel through the outer locking cage. However, first comment at youtube and an another article (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kmpdrivetrain.com&#x2F;differentials&#x2F;torsen-vs-plated-limited-slip-differential&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kmpdrivetrain.com&#x2F;differentials&#x2F;torsen-vs-plated...</a>) states that it wouldn&#x27;t work with 0 traction and can get only the amount of slipping traction torque to the other wheel.')
