Neither is plastic better than Aluminum. What matters quality and usage.<p>Planes[1] without aluminum? Ouch.<p>Cars[2] without plastic? Ouch.<p>I prefer ThinkPads because the use high quality plastic chassis and keyboards. Polycarbonate, ABS or whatever doesn&#x27;t matter to me. Inside the use also magnesium and aluminum. High quality plastics are better when used with skin contact, especially regarding the keyboard and mouse. I regret that phones made with polycarbonate are gone, removable back cover, Qi without glass at back and they don&#x27;t shatter when you drop them like the 800 $&#x2F;â‚¬ stuff from Apple or Samsung. What I don&#x27;t want on my lap is a MacBook. When it get hot, that not comfortable.<p>TLDR  \nWhat looks good in first sight isn&#x27;t good to use or in long term durability.<p>[1] Actually they use a lot composite material within modern planes like the B747-8, B787, A350 and so on :)<p>[2] Excepting the original Audi A2, a great piece of aluminum  :)<p>PS: I&#x27;ve seen people buying keyboards and mice made of aluminium. I cannot imagine something more uncomfortable.')
