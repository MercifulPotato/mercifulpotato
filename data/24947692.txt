But sometimes there are confusing traffic lights in the roundabout:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@37.3911304,-122.0805522,3a,75y,21.18h,90t&#x2F;data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sl0X39UcpPr2C7IJAqtuJpw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo0.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3Dl0X39UcpPr2C7IJAqtuJpw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D17.109371%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@37.3911304,-122.0805522,3a,75y,...</a><p>In New Jersey, on the other hand, sometimes, the subjectively most &quot;major&quot; road has the right of way both going in and out of the roundabout. People already in the roundabout have to actually stop for the major road people to enter the roundabout. If you&#x27;re on the major road you can theoretically pass through the roundabout and not worry about the fact that it&#x27;s a roundabout. A couple examples of this is seen here, where you&#x27;re IN the circle but have to yield to incoming traffic:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@40.5027947,-74.8525293,3a,75y,2.51h,88.11t&#x2F;data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snr3lv9K6Yczbq3zQU5h8LA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@40.5027947,-74.8525293,3a,75y,2...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@40.5761533,-74.6286047,3a,75y,271.87h,82.47t&#x2F;data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sJ4Z2PQW3Oj0yzIvIRF6Yjw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo0.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DJ4Z2PQW3Oj0yzIvIRF6Yjw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D314.33206%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@40.5761533,-74.6286047,3a,75y,2...</a>')
