I use a lot of Plug-ins, and somewhere in the mid 2000s the communication between them stabilized and sped up dramatically to the point that I all but ditched photoshop.  Then I switched to an all mac shop, but GIMP&#x27;s X11 interface on a mac was terrible, so I was back on photoshop.  Then, fairly recently, GIMP switched to all native windows on mac, with tons of new windowing and tiling options that feels as responsive as photoshop, so I&#x27;m back to 100% GIMP.<p>I&#x27;m leaving out a ton of bug fixes and optimizations and new features over the years that were game changing to my processes.  It&#x27;s never stopped getting better.  The only software I&#x27;d say has improved so much so consistently is OBS.')
