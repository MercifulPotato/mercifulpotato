Quite often EV charging spaces are some of the &quot;best&quot; (i.e. closest) spaces available.  Selfish pricks who want to park right by the door don&#x27;t care if it is a disabled space, an EV space, or not even an official parking space at all - they&#x27;ll just park where they want.  Move the EV charging spaces further away from the store and you&#x27;ll solve 99% of ICE&#x27;ings I reckon.')
