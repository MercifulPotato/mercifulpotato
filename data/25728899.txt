Do you think it would be possible to obtain and mount them without a rigid frame? Or even to remove them from the frame? I&#x27;m asking partly because I had considered making some sort of basic, folding, portable solar panel structure- imagine a few semi-flexible panels duct-taped together. (I&#x27;d likely not _actually_ use duct tape).')
