Clearly, Julia has ambitions for greater capabilities.<p>Apparently, Julia now supports some more complicated forms of parallelism: Async, @Spawn (aka: Tasks), and others. But @Thread based for loops are just easier to grok.<p>Overall, Julia is one of the few high-level languages that is explicitly adding in highly-threaded concepts like Fork-join, SIMD, or even GPUs to the language.<p>Yeah, some Python libraries extend these concepts to Python. But something like @Threads for ... end really demonstrates how the fork-join parallelism is a first-class member of the Julia language.')
