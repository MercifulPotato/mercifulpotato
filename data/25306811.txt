That’s about the size of a bond-length.&quot;<p>3. It may be &quot;... more difficult to predict the structures of proteins with folds that are not well represented in the database of solved structures.&quot;<p>4. &quot;... the method cannot yet reliably tackle predictions of proteins that are components of multi-protein complexes.&quot;')
