Item(by='dwohnitmok', descendants=None, kids=[25331957], score=None, time=1607241845, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25318110, text='&gt; Back then, an education was limited to basic math and arithmetic for business, a knowledge of Arabic literature and a study of the Quran, so it&#x27;s very likely that people were very educated in the cities back then.<p>My point is that this is still legally mandated as the standard in e.g. Pakistan and Arabic literacy rates (even in cities I think) still aren&#x27;t very high. Just reading the Pakistani constitution I would&#x27;ve assumed high Arabic literacy rates which isn&#x27;t the case. I think government decrees are weak evidence in favor of higher literacy rates, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough to conclude &quot;with near certainty&quot; that literacy rates among the general populace would&#x27;ve been significantly higher as a result.<p>&gt; Even during Dutch rule, Arabic was used to announce royal decrees, until Malay took over with a sense of national identity.<p>An analogous situation held in Medieval Japan and Korea with respect to Classical Chinese and IIRC scholars don&#x27;t think the general population was very literate in Classical Chinese as a result.')
