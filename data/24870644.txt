Undervolting <i>could</i> break specific instructions in undetectable ways and the only way to be sure things haven&#x27;t broken would be to run something like sandsifter [0] multiple times. Because I, and many others who would have the technical know how, write software on these systems it&#x27;s not very much worth the headache. If I had a seperate system I built just for gaming or doing a specific task and I wanted to reduce how much I spent, or the power usage, etc undervolting would then shift out of headache -&gt; super worth it.<p>The last thing I want to have to do is run every piece of code I need through godbolt and pray there&#x27;s no AVX instructions that &quot;may&quot; be fishy.<p>I think this is largely why cloud providers don&#x27;t do things like this as aggressively. They do it to some extent with custom off-roadmap chips but not controlled dynamically in userspace. If we can get something like this original post into the kernel that would be a massive win for everyone.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xoreaxeaxeax&#x2F;sandsifter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xoreaxeaxeax&#x2F;sandsifter</a>')
