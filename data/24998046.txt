It used to be farmed but hadn&#x27;t been for a while when I bought it 12 years ago.  My initial idea was to grow produce to sell but it didn&#x27;t work out.<p>Here are some of the problems I encountered:\n1.) Deer - we are overrun with white tail deer.  If I don&#x27;t surround anything I grow with 6ft welded wire fence, it doesn&#x27;t last a week.  I have set up electric fence wired in many different configurations, but the deer seem to figure it out.  Usually just as I think I found something that works.\n2.) soil - we don&#x27;t have quality top soil and amending the soil take time and money\n3.) rodents - initially we had great success with raised beds (4ft x 8ft) but after several years they eat the roots (really bad in terms of carrots and potatoes) and pretty bad for aquash and beans.  We have cats, but they can&#x27;t kill the rodents fast enough.\n4.) time - working full time and trying to pull everything together is really hard.  When a crop is ready it needs picked and doesn&#x27;t care that you are trying to meet a deadline at work.  Especially for crops like peas where it seems you have a three day window to pick them at their peak. \n5.) time2 - I have equipment so that I can use diesel fuel instead of muscle power.  This allows me to get a lot more done, but there are two type of equipment, broken and about to break.  I find it impossible to have the time to fix everthing.  My back hoe has a broken hydraulic line for over a year now.\n6.) selling produce - nothing in more annoying than the customer at the farmers market that comes at the end of the day and tried to buy whatever you have left at a huge discount.  Also, there is a fine line between collusion and competitiveness when it comes to pricing at a farmers market.  There seems to always be a guy that buys a stall once because he has too many tomatoes and sells them at a price I would lose money at if I had to match it.\n7.) seasonal animals are easier than crops because you have more control.  We lost all of the produce this year because of drought, but did well on eggs and free range chicken.  I&#x27;m thinking about a small number of pigs or lamb next year.  We don&#x27;t keep anything but egg layers over winter.<p>One thing to mind is that I work damn hard at physical labor.  My parents are in good health in their eighties, but I don&#x27;t see me getting there.  The toll on my body is very evident to me. I really hope I don&#x27;t live that long as it won&#x27;t be pleasant.<p>I do love growing things though.  we have a beautiful orchard of pears, apples, plums, and cherries.  Rasberries and blueberries that I can pick at any time.  Probably the highest quality chicken and eggs you can find.  Great parties when the sweet corn comes in.')
