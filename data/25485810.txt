That&#x27;s ultimately why good frameworks are developed. When React came out many called it a fad but it solved really nasty problems in Web development, that&#x27;s why it stayed. Also I&#x27;m quite sure K8S is here to stay because it removed this whole VM complexity layer and makes integration and testing of services a breeze. On the other hand there are fancy frameworks that don&#x27;t solve such problems or the understanding is not good enough (yet) to solve them reliably. IMHO a lot of web frameworks that promised in the past to remove the boundary of frontend and backend suffered from that. Also the early NodeJS ecosystem to some degree.<p>It&#x27;s fun to use a framework, get to it&#x27;s boundary preventing you from getting things done and then discover a framework that actually crosses that boundary. Speaking of server-less, I never came into the situation where it would have made things easier for me so I never used it but YMMV...')
