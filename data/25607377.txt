How does doctors, mechanical engineers and space flight engineers get interviewed and assessed ?<p>As have already been reiterated in each and everyone of these threads (about leetcode&#x2F;hackerrank&#x2F;whiteboard coding) this is what the companies seem to think is the most proven, and produces most consistent results.
