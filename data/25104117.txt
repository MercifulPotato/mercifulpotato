At the same time, you should have been investing in tech stocks all throughout the past decade. I invested $25k into FB at ipo, no need to say what that position is worth today. Other companies: Twilio, AMD, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Cloudflare, etc. have also brought massive gains that make a value investorâ€™s face blanche.<p>The next step for the ambitious tech person, would be to take some of that money and fund a new startup, staying away from venture capital as long as you can, and then when the time is right, opening up to investment and growing an even larger business rapidly and keeping as much equity as possible.<p>Or, you can continue to simply accumulate income and grow your investments, working your way toward more prestigious positions.')
