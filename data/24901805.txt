Yet the current administration identifies the situation and corrects it, winning over a significant number of voters.<p>The first example that comes to mind is US armed service veterans. Apparently, the medical care they received from the Veteran&#x27;s Administration was really terrible, with apocryphal stories of veterans dying while waiting for appointments to see Drs. There were many bad actors in the VA medical service who would have been fired in any other organization but due to VA policy, kept their jobs. Through programs such as VA Choice and VA Accountability[0], the approval rating of the VA jumped to 91%, a record.<p>In the US, there are 17.4 million veterans, and as you indicated, they all have family and friends who are going to see these improvements in a positive light.<p>It makes me wonder how many other situations there are like this that we don&#x27;t hear about.<p>On the other end, the president can pardon one person at a time. Perhaps that&#x27;s the least number of people who can be positively affected by one act.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.va.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;choiceact&#x2F;documents&#x2F;choice-act-summary.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.va.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;choiceact&#x2F;documents&#x2F;choice-act-summar...</a>')
