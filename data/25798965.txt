The idea was not patented, the technical invention (effectively flow-charts for how to have a button click trigger an auth cookie check, have databases retrieve credit card numbers, etc), which is not obvious to a child.<p>But, I would argue, the details of the invention would be clear enough to someone skilled in the art, another competent programmer.')
