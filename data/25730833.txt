They took my money, then retroactively made it look like my (brand new) account had exactly the amount of debt that I had paid in, and now my account was at 0.<p>I sent in 2 support tickets and received no reply, so I resorted to a chargeback, presumably forfeiting any right to the BTC I purchased.<p>Just to add salt to the wounds, I now constantly see adverts for Coinbase<p>Avoid Coinbase like the Covid')
