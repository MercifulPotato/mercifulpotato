Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[25572091], score=None, time=1609258174, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25570585, text='&gt;When you build a pipeline, it&#x27;s good for exactly one thing. An LNG pipeline won&#x27;t do for anything else, not even other types of oil products. But building a railroad on the other hand, that&#x27;s good for just about anything from transporting bulk grain to truck frames to solid rocket motors.<p>But doesn&#x27;t that only make sense if there&#x27;s going to be demand in the near future? Unused rail lines get abandoned all the time because they have maintenance costs, so it&#x27;s not like we can build it, stop using it, and then resume using it a few decades later when demand picks up.')
