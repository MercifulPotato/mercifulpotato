The US is really in no hurry to get their hands on Assange. They&#x27;ll play along as long as they know that Assange stays in a prison somewhere, till they get a favourable extradition ruling.<p>If the UK is really serious on the well-being of Assange, they should allow him to seek asylum and relocate elsewhere, without obstructing him as they did in the case of Ecuador.')
