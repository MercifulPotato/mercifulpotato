Item(by='renewiltord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605491002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25106919, text='I think I can admit that there are moral frameworks that don&#x27;t care if I live or die and don&#x27;t, therefore, take active action to prevent the death of this person, and therefore that are comfortable with killing me through inaction should a situation arise where I will die without aid. It would be foolish to believe otherwise. Most people actively take this position. If I were to post that I&#x27;m dying, not one on this site would save my life.<p>I don&#x27;t subscribe to an absolutist view of the veil of ignorance. My life is, to me, of higher utility than yours or the random children who I actively choose to let die daily.<p>So I&#x27;m going to act in a manner that preserves my life. That seems natural, after all. The other day I bought a new phone instead of saving a child&#x27;s life. I don&#x27;t even like this Pixel 5 that much. I like my life very much.')
