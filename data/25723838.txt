Airbags can propel objects into people, seatbelts can trap someone in a burning car, antilock brakes perform worse on sand, etc.<p>In practice, putting the responsibilty on auto manufacturers for every specific injury or death that happens due to a safety system, without somehow giving them &quot;positive credit&quot; for lives saved, massively delays or entirely prevents these sort of advancements from being made. We definitely need processes to verify that new features are actually functional, typically through recalls and product liability suits, but simply putting blame on manufacturers for all accidents is a terrible idea.')
