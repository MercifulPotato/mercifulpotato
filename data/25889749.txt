Get another gig, or just stay unemployed if you think the risk is not worth it.<p>If you get screwed, seek other people who got screwed and figure out if you can sue the person or organization who scammed you. But don&#x27;t blame capitalism - blame yourself or busybodies like Doctorow who helped make the regulations so complex. In a free market economy you&#x27;d get a simple one page contract you can understand. In fake capitalism you get 10 pages of fineprint.')
