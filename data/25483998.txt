If you can&#x27;t make your own value, and you&#x27;re letting something else make it for you, you might save yourself labor, but you&#x27;re giving up your ability to create that value. Yes, the system as a whole will produce more, which is good, but the loss of leverage is an important factor to consider.<p>There&#x27;s also a wasting and dependency effect that occurs when too much of a system is automated. If people aren&#x27;t needing to work on or maintain a system, they don&#x27;t need to know how it works to use it, pretty much by definition. It&#x27;s doing the work for them. That creates a dangerous situation where essential systems aren&#x27;t really understood, and fewer and fewer people end up knowing how to fix things because there isn&#x27;t the same need to distribute the knowledge of upkeep&#x2F;understand the work it&#x27;s doing personally by doing it yourself.<p>Automation is extremely beneficial, and I&#x27;m often frustrated by what seem to be clear cases of not taking advantage of it, but I think what you&#x27;re saying here over simplifies things.<p>I think the solution is for more people to learn how to set up their own automation and to automate things without making them too centralized.')
