I used to work as a weapons engineer for the Dutch navy and they were quite involved at getting the Vulcano (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.leonardocompany.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;vulcano-155mm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.leonardocompany.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;vulcano-155mm</a>) rounds working at the time. IIRC the larger caliber rounds were subjected to about 40.000g at peak acceleration though you could vary the amount of powder so actual acceleration varied. The HW guys had all sorts of trouble with exotic problems like getting the chips to stay attached to the solder pads etc.<p>Totally agree that the SpinLaunch system does not seem sufficient to get a payload to space though, let alone if it also needs to bring propellant for circularizing their orbits.')
