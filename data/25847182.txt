This is kind of like being a user of any other language, there&#x27;s no EULA, nothing to sign, you just write SOUL code, test and debug it with whatever tools (which may themselves have a EULA, but probably nothing heavy)<p>- device and host developers: These are the people writing DAWs, plugins, hardware that can run SOUL code, audio device drivers etc. These are professionals, and licensing is a normal part of life when you&#x27;re doing this kind of work.')
