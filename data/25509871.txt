Item(by='eloff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608664007, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25508210, text='&quot;Should you work hard&quot; is not aimed at people with lots of inherited wealth (unless they want to grow that wealth.)<p>Hard work is part of the equation of success, a necessary part I would argue. There&#x27;s not a lot of successful lazy people - inherited wealth is not success, it&#x27;s just a higher baseline. Success to me is something you achieve, not something you can inherit.<p>The money quote is:<p>&gt; You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both....<p>That seems beyond debate to me. Being at the 99th percentile is a relative measure and you don&#x27;t get there unless you work smarter and harder than most everyone else.<p>Once you get in a position of leadership (that is you have leverage) I&#x27;d argue working smart is far more important because that is a force multiplier on everyone working for you.<p>If you somehow do both then you&#x27;re Elon Musk.')
