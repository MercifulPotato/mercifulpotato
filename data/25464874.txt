The high duplex denaturing temperature of the initial thermocycle will usually also denature histones and unwind them from the dna.  That&#x27;s why thermocycle procedures for raw samples have a long initial denaturation (5-10 min) and thermocycle procedures for prepurified DNA need not have such a long initial incubation at 95 C.')
