Laptops are expensive.<p>For people who know and buy what they need, they&#x27;re indeed expensive but, some consumers see computers as consumable entities. They buy a machine, use it 2-3 years and buy a new one then. This is my experience at the least. On the contrary, I tend to use every device I own 7-10 years before replacing.<p>&gt; Lots of deplorable things make sense from a business perspective. That&#x27;s a very low bar to clear. ...  Is that supposed to make it better?<p>Saying that doesn&#x27;t mean I support business interests over legitimate user needs but, businesses are greedy entities which always want more money so, they always follow the path which brings more money. It doesn&#x27;t make any better either. I want to be able to buy any laptop and&#x2F;or device I want and change the software stack and tune it the way I wish however, as we see today, this freedom is attacked more and more.<p>Unless consumer choice generates more profits (which is unlikely), we won&#x27;t see that trend change much.')
