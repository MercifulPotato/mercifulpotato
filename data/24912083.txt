There&#x27;s something to be said for systems that are simple enough that you can, with some effort, hold the whole machine in your head, so to speak. That was the feeling I got with my C=128.  Anything much past that, and you have to resort to simplifications.  Which is fine, but may be less satisfying, depending on what you were getting out of it in the first place.  Getting really in to the edges of JavaScript on its own is a very different feeling than getting in to the edges of the system-as-a-whole, right? Barry Schwartz&#x27; <i>The Paradox of Choice</i> gets in to this to some degree, and is an interesting read.')
