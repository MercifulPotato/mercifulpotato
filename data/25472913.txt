I&#x27;m pretty aware of the benefits of AMD&#x27;s architecture.<p>But I also know that in-memory databases are a thing. Nothing I&#x27;ve touched personally needs an in-memory database, but its a real solution to a real problem. A niche for sure, but a niche that&#x27;s pretty common actually.<p>Whenever I see these absurd 8-socket designs with 48TBs of RAM, I instinctively think &quot;Oh yeah, for those in-memory database peeps&quot;.
