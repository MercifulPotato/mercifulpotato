It can be a fun exercise to write the functions that take you back and forth.  For instance:<p><pre><code>    A^(B+C) = A^B * A^C\n\n    to: (Either b c -&gt; a) -&gt; (b -&gt; a, c -&gt; a)\n    to f = (f . Left, f . Right)\n\n    fro: (b -&gt; a, c -&gt; a) -&gt; (Either b c -&gt; a)\n    fro (f, g) = \\case\n      Left b -&gt; f b\n      Right c -&gt; g c</code></pre>')
