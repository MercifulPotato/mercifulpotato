Item(by='alsetmusic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609895086, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25646078, text='&gt; enforce things like OFAC and sanctions.<p>This all the way. Not being able to just reach into your financial affairs would be seen as a huge affront. This is similar to how law enforcement believes encryption is a major impediment to building a case.<p>Years ago, at a time when money was tight, a bank transfer to my landlord for rent disappeared. OFAC seized the funds. The best reason I can come up with is that my landlord has a Muslim-sounding name (I don&#x27;t actually know his nationality or religion).<p>It took many calls to my bank to learn this information. The whole thing was shrouded in messaging that it was delayed and would post &quot;tomorrow,&quot; day after day. Finally, someone at a branch had some compassion and spent some time figuring it out.<p>I received a case number or incident number and was told that I could contest the seizure. A family member helped me cover the rent. I sent a form contesting the seizure and switched to depositing post office money orders into my landlord&#x27;s local branch, which was a huge inconvenience.<p>Eventually, I received a letter from OFAC stating some excuse that I can&#x27;t even remember why my case was moot. This was after maybe six months. I gave up.<p>It wasn&#x27;t worth it, to me, to fight the government bureaucracy that I knew would be involved. Sorta like paying a traffic ticket that you know you could beat in court because it&#x27;s easier than going to court. They can basically do whatever and get away with it by making things a pain in the ass to fight.')
