That way people are more likely to believe it&#x27;s not influence and only the most obvious are actual &quot;fake&quot; people.<p>All this post serves is to prove (by already being voted to the top 30) is to trick people into thinking China is absolutely harmless because they are woefully incompetent. While they are incompetent they aren&#x27;t stupid. They know how to manipulate and manicure an image of themselves to their own benefit. (It&#x27;s not like they do it to their own citizens 24&#x2F;7&#x2F;365)<p>Meanwhile this comment will show up dead because pointing this out over a period of months garners endless downvoted until you&#x27;re dead.')
