If you want to be effective in data science, you need to commit to being a rockstar programmer AND statistician AND be well versed in a number of different algorithms.<p>Unsurprisingly, this is difficult, and so the market of people who do it well is small. That’s not, however, a referendum on the value of predictive modeling and software engineering. I don’t see advanced math and software engineering skills going out of fashion anytime soon, simply because they are hard to acquire and immensely powerful in the right hands.')
