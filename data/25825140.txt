Over time I learned that there are different brain abilities. Some people are blessed with more, some with less, some people have synesthesia some aphantasia.<p>Anyhow, it would be cool if we could learn how to tap into potential... As I personally think that people who have a more vivid imagination have less fear of death. As they have more colourful dreams, it is easier to imagine &quot;other&quot; worlds... equally as it is easier for a person who seen to imagine colours than those who were born blind.<p>But I guess, at the end of the day, for the sake of the spices&#x27; survival, all those differences are essential as they push as to excel in different fields, and therefore survive.')
