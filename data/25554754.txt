It&#x27;s genius.<p>Mot hardware manufacturers do this and you can see it best in OnePlus devices where they are shipped with a compromise only to have that compromise addressed 6 months later with the new T update.<p>It feels nearly like the HW business is going down the SaaS route basically but for hardware.')
