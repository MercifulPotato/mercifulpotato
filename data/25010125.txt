When the price of the printer went below the price of ink, I bought a second one and stuck it in the attic, which came in handy when the first one died.  Both printers came with standard ink cartridges.<p>The HP laser printer I bought recently, on the other hand, did come with starter cartridges with a smaller amount of toner.  My impression is that starter cartridges are more common with toner than ink.')
