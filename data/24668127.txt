I have a deep love of the software development process, and started programming when I was 12 years old.  I&#x27;ve been developing software for 20 years now; 10 of those have been as a professional developer, and 4 in engineering management.<p>I&#x27;ve scaled a team from 2 to 8 full-time developers, with half on-site and half remote.  I&#x27;ve completely revamped the development process - moving to git, implementing a full DevOps pipeline with CI&#x2F;CD, automated unit&#x2F;integration testing, containerization, peer code reviews, and much more.<p>I&#x27;ve significantly improved the project management approach for my team, working directly with the CTO of a medium-sized (~2500 employees) enterprise.  Before I started, the PM was very ad-hoc, and it was very difficult for the executive team to plan and estimate major projects.  Under my direction, we&#x27;ve been able to execute at least one key project each year.<p>Some highlights include:<p>- The first-ever e-commerce website for the company and a companion React Native app for employees to pick, stage and deliver products even when offline (serving 89 retail locations).<p>- A payment gateway that&#x27;s had 99.99% uptime and billions of dollars processed, in production for 6+ years.<p>- A custom EMV credit card processing backend that runs on 500 edge devices.<p>- Architecture, project plan, POC, and implementation of a new suite of applications to replace a legacy COBOL system that runs all core business functions.<p>I love building and working with a team of highly-skilled developers, who want to learn and grow their craft every day.  My team has good tenure, with several developers past the 5 year mark with me. I have great pride in the way I&#x27;ve been managing, growing and mentoring a team of engineers. I am looking for a company that will be a good fit for me long-term, where I can grow even more as a technical leader.<p>I am currently targeting technical management- and director-level roles.  Please reach out if my experience sounds like a good fit for your org.  Can&#x27;t wait to hear from you!')
