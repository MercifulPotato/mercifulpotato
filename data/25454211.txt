As is the PR explanation.<p>I&#x27;d be willing to bet some money on it being simply the result of some employees saying, &quot;AI ethics is super important. We feel strongly there should be people working on AI ethics to make sure it&#x27;s not racist or sexist&quot;. And anyone who objected was yelled at with words to the effect of, &quot;are you saying <i>ethics</i> isn&#x27;t important? do you not <i>care</i> about <i>ethics</i>?&quot; until opposition was silenced and management felt it was a small sop to quiet the ranks.<p>The right approach to this would have been to say to those advocating for it the following:<p>&quot;Ethics is of course tremendously important. That&#x27;s why we carefully select our workforce and insist on the highest ethical standards from everyone, in their work. Ethics is not something that can be compartmentalised or delegated to a separate team. Ethics underlies all we do. If you see something you believe might be unethical, please raise it with your manager so it can be resolved company wide. Until then, return to work.&quot;<p>Creating a dedicated ethics team was a dumb idea because it can only possibly end like this: you hire people and tell them &quot;your job is to ensure we are ethical&quot; and they&#x27;re not going to sit back and say, you know boss, I sniffed around and everything seemed above board. Nothing for me to do here right now. I&#x27;ll check back in a month. Of course they&#x27;re going to see unethical stuff everywhere they look, regardless of merit. Their salary literally depends on it.')
