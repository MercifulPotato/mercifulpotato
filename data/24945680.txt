From the POV of an external observer you never cross the event horizon, because that&#x27;s a function time dilation, and light that you emit being more and more red-shifted as you get closer to the event horizon. From the falling observer POV, nothing really changes - or rather, what happens close to the event horizon or just past the event horizon depends on what the theory of quantum gravity says.')
