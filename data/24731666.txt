I&#x27;m a co-founder of AdviceBridge, where we have implemented part of the UK tax code related to income tax and pensions in order to provide digital financial advice.<p>In the UK, the HMRC (again, equivalent of IRS) makes worksheets available for computational tax but these are not machine-readable and are not guaranteed to be correct! (Indeed on some points, government websites give incorrect information related to the state pension.
