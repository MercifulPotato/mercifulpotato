But it certainly is the case that one of the two (climate change) is consistently downplayed and dismissed entirely as a major contributing cause. There are of course more contributing factors than just two, such as power lines sparking the fires.<p>It is not physically possible to manage the amount of forest in CA to the degree that it solves the problem. Help mitigate? Sure. Remember, you&#x27;re talking something like 30 million acres.<p>Experts acknowledge that forest management is important and a necessary component. But again...57% is the Federal government and 33% is private.<p>Logically, there must be some point where the temperature+climate change become so severe that regardless of how much forest is cleared eventually all 30M acres become dry tinder, are consumed, and CA becomes a desert. Global climate change WILL eventually create that situation if not addressed and the amount of change required to cause that situation isn&#x27;t as high as people might imagine. Some experts think it might already be too late.')
