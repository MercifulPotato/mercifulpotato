If you choose to use it religiously, that&#x27;s probably a bad choice, but if you don&#x27;t do it ever, you are missing out on a huge tool.  In general, if I see an insurmountably complex challenge ahead of myself, sometimes TDD (especially detroit-style TDD) is a tool to refocus my attention and implement the minimal implementation and move past goals.<p>Also, doing test-heavy development (which TDD gives you for free) gives you insight into how that break&#x2F;fix loop can supercharge your productivity by giving you those dopamine rushes as a reward for your effort.')
