Item(by='vsri', descendants=None, kids=[24830952], score=None, time=1603138776, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24829473, text='The author here seems to be using &quot;paraphrase&quot; to mean mean both &quot;mirroring&quot; (repeat back using speaker&#x27;s words) and &quot;paraphrasing&quot; (repeat back using listener&#x27;s words). I think there are contexts when each is appropriate.<p>For example, if I (speaker) am giving you (listener) instructions, it&#x27;s good for you to paraphrase. That shows me how you are interpreting my language and that allows me to clarify. Mirroring doesn&#x27;t allow for this because no new information is provided:<p>- Speaker: Could you sort all the files and destroy duplicates?<p>- Listener: You want me to put the files in alphabetical order and throw them out.<p>- Speaker: Yes, but by destroy I meant shred.<p>But there are cases where it&#x27;s more important for the speaker to be  understood. Perhaps they are feeling hard emotions and need to be heard, or (and I think this is the real use case for mirroring) when the speaker is still working through their feelings or thoughts on a subject. They are using speech, in a sense, to think.<p>- Speaker: I think it&#x27;s bizarre that the PM wants to push this along so quickly.<p>- Listener: You think it&#x27;s bizarre that the PM wants to push this along so quickly?<p>- Speaker: Well... not bizarre. It&#x27;s just surprising because there is no external deadline for this work.<p>Here mirroring gives the speaker an opportunity to see how their words sound coming back to them and it gives them an opportunity to clarify and add.')
