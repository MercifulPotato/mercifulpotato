The jesus-like dream of truth died before I was born and now we&#x27;re left with people choosing their own interpretations.<p>The article you linked under the shocking line &#x27;Mother Teresa killed five with her plane&#x27;, describes an incident where a plane was crowded around and unable to get airborn. Five people took the brunt of the propellers. No part of that is directly Mother Teresa&#x27;s fault and you have to work hard to ignore the pilot&#x27;s actions and everybody on the ground.<p>It isn&#x27;t hard to find the truth for what it likely is, through research and a charitable view. Society has determined that using headstrong fear to ram your own interpretation through is better than the past and I weep everyday for what we have lost. This used to be a good planet, now every single marginally positive outcome must be torn from history and context to be presented as the evil &quot;it is&quot;. Shame on you. I&#x27;m so tired of the politics du-jour shitting on 2k years of successful history. You can lie about the present, and the past won&#x27;t go away.<p>Everybody who thinks they have a modicum of intelligence and still accepts balongia like these hellish recasts of the past deserves their inability to tell truth from fiction.')
