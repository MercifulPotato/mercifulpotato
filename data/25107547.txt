On the other hand they LOVE order. That means meticulously inspecting every bolt and nut, finding differences and putting them, with great pleasure, to different boxes. Like: These two bolts are of the same size.

And actually that&#x27;s a sign her of flawless integration - completely in line with the way how the &quot;German&quot; Germans think of her. Because she has dark eyes and slightly, really just a tiny bit darker skin, even if she behaves like a typical German police(wo)man.')
