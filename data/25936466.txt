If it&#x27;s not illegal, it&#x27;s not manipulation.<p>This is backwards. The label &quot;manipulation&quot; is applied (or not) retroactively based on whether something was determined to be illegal or not. It&#x27;s not something you can know in advance; two copies of the exact same action might be judged differently.')
