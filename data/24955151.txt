How do you know they don&#x27;t have some legal agreement with those people? How do you even know they didn&#x27;t contact those contributors? How do you know the other contributors&#x27; contributions weren&#x27;t trivial enough (for all I know they could&#x27;ve even just been formatting&#x2F;indentation) and not warranting any action? How do you know the contributors aren&#x27;t fine with it?<p>And how does everyone somehow know other contributors want them to seek some sort of justice on their behalf?')
