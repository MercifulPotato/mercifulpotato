As an Australian, despite how my country isn&#x27;t the best in that field, I&#x27;ve always taken recycling seriously (even with the more challenging rules in Japan). It took him a while before the Japanese host and I could train him to recycle properly. It&#x27;s not like he wasn&#x27;t a decent guy, he just wasn&#x27;t used to it. It made me wonder if recycling just wasn&#x27;t a big thing in the US, and to hear that California, as a more liberal state, is still on 20% seems to confirm that.')
