So there&#x27;s no trace of many people migrating for economic reasons in the statistics.<p>I will admit that I&#x27;ve more or less given up arguing with my friends who live in Dublin about housing - some sort of mass hysteria has taken hold and normally well-informed people are convinced that Dublin &quot;has the worst property crisis in the world&quot; when all statistics comparing Dublin with other European cities show that buying or renting property there is about average or better in terms of affordability for a European capital.')
