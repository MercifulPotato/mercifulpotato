History does like to repeat itself...<p>I will commend gRPC for being brave enough to attach &quot;RPC&quot; to its name in 2020. Can&#x27;t say the same for that quisling GraphQL, which is neither what I would call a query language <i>nor</i> has anything to do with graphs. A- for marketing effort, I suppose.<p>&gt; it enforces no discipline where it counts, state management<p>A tale as old as time. If your redux app is a bloated confusing mess, then try scaling down your department from 100 devs to the 10 that it <i>actually</i> needs. Most devs are bad at organization. Most devs are just bad in general. Ever see a bad developer grapple with TypeScript? I wager most codebases fall apart from disarray long before they reap any of the presumed benefits of most &quot;best&quot; practices. You can&#x27;t fix social problems with technology. And code hygiene and state hygiene are fundamentally <i>social</i> issues. People think tools like Prettier can come around and clean their house for them. Like some Roomba for code. Even the best Roomba will smear dog shit all over the place.')
