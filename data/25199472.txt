For instance, to eliminate redundant members from a union, <i>the elements have to be compared pairwise, which is quadratic</i>. This sort of check might occur when intersecting large unions, where intersecting over each union member can result in enormous types that then need to be reduced.<p>This statement makes me think... how come the TS compiler is not using something like a hash&#x2F;map (object) of union members to basically ignore redundancy?<p>Or any other strategy really. The union of unique values in 2 or more arrays is a classic CS problem for which there are many, many performant solutions.<p>Anyone familiar with the TS internals? Maybe I&#x27;m not seeing the forest.')
