Item(by='virtuous_signal', descendants=None, kids=[25907810], score=None, time=1611603694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25905443, text='&gt;With Hart Taxis you get:<p>- Smart drivers who have been working a maximum of 12 hours in a single shift and a maximum of 6 shifts per week.<p>- Smart, washed and valeted cars<p>- Road legal vehicles with full service history.<p>- Vehicle tracking services so you can see where your driver is from when they accept your job to when they arrive.<p>- Text information detailing the make, colour and registration of the vehicle that will be picking you up.<p>- Meet and greet service at the airport where we monitor your incoming flight and only send the driver at the appropriate time.<p>- Bottled water on arrival at our airport jobs.<p>- Automated booking via our Oliviar booking system with the industryâ€™s leading booking and despatch software<p>- Full E-receipt provided on completion of job, if required.<p>If I understand things correctly, then the only difference between this and Uber&#x2F;Lyft is primarily item 1 (although I&#x27;m not sure why it matters that the driver is &quot;smart&quot;). Items 2 and the bottled water could probably be gotten through Uber Black which also costs more.<p>So it seems one pays a premium to help certain drivers earn a living wage, and support an ethical company; more cynically, to not feel like one is participating in Uber-style exploitation. I imagine that some in the effective altruism community[1] would consider this and other sorts of ethical consumption to be &quot;ineffective&quot;, and would recommend people just donate the price difference to needier people, or to an organization better equipped to create structural change. But I&#x27;m not an effective altruist so I may be misrepresenting that perspective.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csmonitor.com&#x2F;World&#x2F;Making-a-difference&#x2F;Change-Agent&#x2F;2015&#x2F;1228&#x2F;Forget-Fairtrade-just-give-cash-to-the-poorest-philosopher-says" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csmonitor.com&#x2F;World&#x2F;Making-a-difference&#x2F;Change-A...</a>')
