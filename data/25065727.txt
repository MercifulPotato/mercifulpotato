For a long time I rarely saw usage over 8GB.<p>But for a few months everything was running rather slow and I put it down to other causes.<p>One day I looked at the memory usage and saw it was using 10GB swap in addition to about 14.5GB RAM.  And when I clicked things that responded slowly, the memory pressure meter was lighting up.  Swapping was why it was slow.<p>It&#x27;s pretty fast swap, being on SSD, but it was the reason for the slowdowns.  Probably not doing the SSD any good either (they wear out if written to constantly).<p>Turns out Safari was using 8GB by itself.  Restarting Safari helped (it&#x27;s quick to restart which is nice).  Safari, like Chrome, uses a lot of memory after opening a bunch of tabs because of using separate processes for each tab.<p>I also use Firefox, but it uses 6-8GB for me too.<p>Then there&#x27;s my VM running my Linux dev environment.  Now I only give it 4GB, which is a bit tight but I run some things remotely so it&#x27;s ok.  I had to shrink it from 6GB to get my performance back.<p>Sometimes I&#x27;m foolish enough to have LibreOffice or MS Word open to look at documents.  They aren&#x27;t memory hogs, but when you&#x27;ve lost most of it to the browser(s) and dev VM, little things like office apps push it a few GB over the edge.<p>I&#x27;m also running Emacs with quite a lot loaded into it, and many iTerms, but they use so little RAM compared with the big stuff, it barely registers.<p>Nowadays I pay more attention to memory use, mostly use only one browser at a time, and restart more often.<p>Even so, it&#x27;s hovering around 5GB swap at the moment, and I haven&#x27;t got much going on at the moment.<p>Based on this, I know I can live with 16GB but it is restricting what I use and how I work now.  32GB would be let me stop thinking about RAM again, and I expect in a few years it will be nearly full, as usage tends to grow over time (as I found already).<p>If I could buy a new MBP knowing I could upgrade the RAM I&#x27;d be happy to buy at 16GB, but as you can&#x27;t upgrade, and I want a new laptop to last <i>at least</i> 5 years, I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable buying a dev machine at 16GB now.')
