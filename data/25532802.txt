In the past one could write software for an OS such as Windows or Classic Mac and have it working for decades. Nowadays, any software developer will tell you how difficult it is to maintain software even across single digit changes. Companies like Apple, Google, and even MS have forced developers to toil on rewrites year after year to support the new operating systems they release. In the web this is even worse. So I think that the old model of buying software and expecting that it will work for a long time is dead, killed by the process used by big companies. What is left is either well-maintained open source or subscription-based commercial software.')
