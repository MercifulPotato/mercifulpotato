It&#x27;s part of why most large animals, for which quick communication is imperative, use it. It&#x27;s imprecise, which is the problem that machines are not good at dealing with. It&#x27;s was a good direction, when we used to have machines that were initially trained with speech for better accuracy, but now passive listening of devices isn&#x27;t even used for that!<p>&gt; The real game changer for input is along the lines of what the neural lace is supposed to be. Cognitive input. Silent, fast, efficient.<p>Silent sure. The human mind is rather random, highly variable between individuals and ages. I would not call it fast or efficient. Then again, speech to text is contextual cognitive input. Without drugs or intentional damage (minor) to the brain, I don&#x27;t expect neural implants to be very effective, even in the next 100 years.')
