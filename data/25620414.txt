I can totally wait because it will be <i>an hour</i>!&quot;\n2. when that hour comes, I find I only browse around for maybe 10 minutes before I get bored.<p>ymmv but after trying to go &quot;cold turkey&quot; for the longest time, this was the best solution I could figure out. I genuinely like the info on HN &#x2F; certain parts of youtube, but having them as some emotional relief mechanism that I would get a &quot;hit&quot; from myriad times each day was the unhealthy part.')
