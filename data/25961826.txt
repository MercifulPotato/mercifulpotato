Bushes? Father and son were the president. Kennedys? Brothers were almost presidents, one was a President, the other governor. Clintons? Spouses were almost presidents! If that&#x27;s not cliquey I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>Your mate is also massively over-egging how bad it is, there is still an Eton clique (the present&#x2F;last government being a good example), but we&#x27;ve had a range of recent prime minister&#x27;s educated normally, outside of the Eton clique. Brown, Blair, even Thatcher just went to a Grammar school (generally a better school you have to pass exams to qualify for, which is semi-meritocratic, though gamed by the rich)<p>Our election system is even worse than America&#x27;s though so we keep getting conservative governments who win 40-45% of the popular vote but somehow get landslide majorities.<p>Also, what do you mean by &quot;small&quot;, it&#x27;s got 70 million inhabitants.
