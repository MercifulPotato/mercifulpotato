The format is clearly oriented around that.<p>An addition that could make it more useful for recording cardio workouts like swimming&#x2F;track&#x2F;indoor cycling would be the concept of rest intervals. For example, it&#x27;s common to prescribe a part of a swimming workout in a format like this:<p><pre><code>  4 x 100 at 1:20\n</code></pre>\nMeaning you have 1:20 to complete each 100m rep, where any extra time is rest. You could also add extra fields for recording the actual time taken to complete rach rep. E.g:<p><pre><code>  #Unit: m\n  #TimeFormat: M:S\n  \n  4r 100 @1:20\n    1:05, 1:07, 1:11, 1:06</code></pre>')
