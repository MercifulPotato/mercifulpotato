Even your comment nit-picks mine over technicalities while ignoring the obvious issues with the author&#x27;s.<p>Given how many of the &quot;features&quot; of V are completely unimplemented or only work in the most narrow of edge cases, it&#x27;s not clear to me why so much grace is extended to the author who&#x27;s generally been unable to deliver his promises all while collecting a tidy sum on patreon.')
