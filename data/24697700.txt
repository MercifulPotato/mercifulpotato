Overengineering isn&#x27;t good engineering.<p>This thing is a nice first prototype, but it looks like a death trap. There is absolutely no reason for the giant lever arm coming up from behind you and all the way around.<p>Look at the altwork design. It&#x27;s a lot lighter and more robust. It doesn&#x27;t place a ton of weight overhead, and there&#x27;s a lot less leverage on the joints. Or look at ErgoQuest. The monitors are stationary, and only a lightweight desk&#x2F;keyboard tray moves.<p>I appreciate your confidence, but I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s misplaced. I&#x27;ve been doing woodworking and engineering for a lot more than 15 years. A couple of things to consider:<p>&quot;When you want to build this kind of structure, I&#x27;m not sure you can plan everything beforehand, there are always things that will happen that you didn&#x27;t expect.&quot; You absolutely can. It just takes practice and experience. When I build something, I plan out what I do, and 9&#x2F;10 it comes together on the first go. For my mentors, it&#x27;s 10&#x2F;10. The first few years I was doing this, it was 0&#x2F;10.<p>&quot;After a few failing choices, I ended up with a main pole of 7cm x 7cm.&quot; You generally want about a 10x safety margin for dynamic loading and similar issues. If you had a few failing designs, you&#x27;re way too close to failing in your current design.<p>Back to the overengineering point: Simply using massive beams of wood and bolts doesn&#x27;t necessarily make things robust. A 7cm x 7cm piece of wood weighs a ton, and puts that much more strain on everything. That&#x27;s true for all the pieces. I could build a more robust design with normal-sized boards. That has the distinct advantage that if there is a failure, what falls on me my hurt me, but won&#x27;t kill or cripple me.<p>I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re trying, but by overestimating your expertise, you&#x27;re putting yourself at risk. I&#x27;d encourage you to keep trying, but to also take this sort of constructive criticism seriously.<p>Think through how the desk ought to move so you don&#x27;t need the giant lever arm, whether you want the monitors to move at all, and where to mount these so you can get in and out easily. I can think of a half-dozen designs where there are no massive lever arms, where nothing moves or just the keyboard tray moves, where if things break, I don&#x27;t die, and generally simpler, lighter, and more robust.')
