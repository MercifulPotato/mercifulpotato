This being the end of government, \n  that alone is a just government, which impartially secures to every \n  man, whatever is his own.\n  ~ James Madison, Essay on Property\n\n  Government is instituted no less for the protection of the property\n  than of the persons of individuals.\n  ~ James Madison, Federalist 54\n\n  the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate ... is\n  the first object of government\n  ~ James Madison, Federalist 10\n</code></pre>\nAnd, if we read Locke&#x27;s own words:<p><pre><code>  The necessity of pursuing happiness [is] the foundation of liberty.  \n  As therefore the highest perfection of intellectual nature lies in a \n  careful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness; so the care \n  of ourselves, that we mistake not imaginary for real happiness, is the \n  necessary foundation of our liberty.\n  ~ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pursuit-of-happiness.org&#x2F;history-of-happiness&#x2F;john-locke&#x2F;</code></pre>')
