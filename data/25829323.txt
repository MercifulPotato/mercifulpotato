Within the context of misinformation I don&#x27;t believe that opponents of the vaccine are making them in good faith, which is why they reach for dubious arguments. When someone says, like I&#x27;ve seen mainly on the blue site, that vaccines are tools of the wealthy to keep us at home and to be tracked, I don&#x27;t think that person is making a reasoned decision on well researched information; I see someone who is probably being misled by someone else for some other person (ex. downplaying the need to take COVID precautions).<p>However, your reasoning for not taking the vaccine is perfectly valid and reasoned and is something I&#x27;ve discussed with others - mRNA vaccines are a new technology and we don&#x27;t know the side-effects. At the very least I can assume you are willing to accept that COVID is real and are making arguments with empirical data.<p>Circling back to my original argument however, there&#x27;s a difference between &quot;the COVID vaccine may not be fully tested yet&quot; and &quot;the COVID vaccine is going to be used to track you&quot;. Anyone can do the calculus and understand, that while the COVID vaccine may not 100% safe at this moment, that doesn&#x27;t mean that the government, or the scientific community at large, is completely untrustworthy, or trying to deceive you; they are simply trying to make the appropriate trade offs. In other words, your argument implies a lack of certainty, and the other, and arguably more popular one, implies malice. Our institutions aren&#x27;t acting on complete malice, so given that they will be wrong sometimes, I think it&#x27;s unreasonable to abandon our intuitions just because they weren&#x27;t 100% correct.')
