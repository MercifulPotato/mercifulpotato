I talked to many maintainers in the first few years of its existence who truly benefited from the contributions. Nothing we ever did at DigitalOcean was &quot;just marketing&quot; - everything we did was because we all genuinely cared about developers, that&#x27;s why the company grew. Certainly it&#x27;s a real shame that a few bad actors are ruining the project, but I take real issue with all this vitriol. Maybe it&#x27;s gone off the rails and needs to be revised or reconsidered, but creating shitoberfest twitter and putting things in blog posts like &quot;Finally, and most importantly, we can remember that this is how DigitalOcean treats the open source maintainer community, and stay away from their products going forward.&quot; is certainly not constructive.<p>I find it troublesome that a room full of people and no one raised a concern about how the whole thing would be misused, and wasted time of hundreds of maintainers who now have to clean up their repo. Did &quot;the room&quot; consider this, at all, and what if they did, what was the conclusion?<p>Edit: I added neom&#x27;s original comment, still have it on my browser.')
