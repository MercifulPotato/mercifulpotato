You can expect &quot;core&quot; ecosystem libraries to be cross-published and most others don&#x27;t depend on macros.<p>Note that most things you&#x27;d need macros for in 2.13 have language support in 3, so for user code - if that even uses macros at all - the upgrade path is fairly straightforward.')
