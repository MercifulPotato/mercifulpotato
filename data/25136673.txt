Changing that will take far more work that wiring up ~2M lamp posts.<p>Also, to ban all parking on public roads is also infeasible aside from the houses with parking issues. Most city centre businesses would vehemently oppose such a move without replacement parking which would cost far far more money from the public purse.<p>So although I&#x27;m quite happy for people to have opinions, the consequences of enacting this opinion would be a greater waste of public resources than just allowing people to park on the side of the road (in most cases).')
