The ERG and Momentum are the most obvious, each pushing an agenda that, regardless of how much one agrees with it, has been incredibly divisive over the years: hard brexit and &#x27;corbynism&#x27; (to avoid connotations of the &#x27;S&#x27; word).<p>These have been big gambles by the major parties, the details and direction of which have mostly been dictated by marketing and in-fighting. Despite having multiple general elections with these as the main issues, the public has only been presented with coarse yes&#x2F;no choices and false dichotomies.<p>In a multi-party system (e.g. proportional like STV) I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;d see ERG as a separate party to Cameron-esque Tories, and Momentum as a separate party to the NewLabour&#x2F;Starmer side of Labour. I&#x27;m not sure who would get the keep the old Labour&#x2F;Tory names, though.')
