I use waste in the sense of like trying to assemble something complicated with the instructions just out of arms reach, not in the sense of doing something pointless.<p>In some cases all companies would have to do is <i>not</i> actively hide or obfuscate things. In others it may take more effort but still just a drop in the huge bucket compared to developing a system in the first place.<p>I love Apple&#x27;s hardware, I even (mostly) love the OS. If they too believe that it is solid - why prevent people from running what they want? The majority will come back anyway - I&#x27;ve run Linux for years and still ended up on MacOS for simplicity. I&#x27;ll still buy Macs and run MacOS because it works for me, it&#x27;s not like letting me run Linux will cost them money or something. The vast majority of people don&#x27;t  know what Linux even is, there is no threat there.<p>Please note that this comment is not directed at people who choose to spend their time on projects like this. You&#x27;re awesome, I just wish you didn&#x27;t have to put so much effort in.')
