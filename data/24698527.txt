Maintainers claimed that problem wasn&#x27;t related to image but rather to infrastructure, so we changed the base image to prove that infrastructure was totally fine. Also i personally don&#x27;t actually care that much if issue with this particular image is resolved, we switched to bitnami one for the time being (and will build our own one from sources when we have time to do so). It&#x27;s more of a warning for other companies&#x2F;people to check for the same problem.')
