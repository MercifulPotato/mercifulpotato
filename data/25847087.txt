We debated this last week at a community event. Here&#x27;s the tl;dr:<p>1. The argument goes that the slight potential damage to the norm of free speech is worthwhile to avoid damage to the norm of peaceful democracy, law and order. Besides Twitter are a private company, up to them. This seems prudent and justifiable.<p>2. However, there are two issues we must consider, Big Tech and Race.<p>3. Big Tech:\nIf you control information distribution the way they do, you control society. An ad based business model, reliant purely on engagement, optimises for posts about the sort of conspiracy theories and hate mongering that created the mob outside the Capitol. Dems have talked about regulation for some time. There have been hearings. Deplatforming Trump was about cosying up to the Biden administration, not defending freedom. We should be wary of their motives.<p>4. Race:\nNativism was around before Trump.\nTrumpism is the last stand of those who feel that America is the birthright of whites. Their argument holds no logic and was long ago defeated. To create conditions on what persons may say online gives too much credit to the ridiculous ideas being espoused by dinosaurs of American society. Dinosaurs who already find themselves staring up at the meteor heading straight for them.<p>5. The right moral approach was to ban trump temporarily (to scold him for being a naughty boy), and to make sure people are imprisoned for the violence. Conspiracies like QAnon (and voter fraud) thrive on collective belief. Collective belief vanishes pretty quickly when it is met with hard realities. You can convince people not to believe in gravity, but their belief will quickly disappear when they&#x27;re standing at the top of a cliff<p>6. Big tech should openly admit they helped create the monstrosity that is Trump, not just do what they think will keep the Biden administration off their back.')
