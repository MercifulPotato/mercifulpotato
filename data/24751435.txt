Though buying complete board does not make much sense, because it lacks the Golden Top project with all pin assignments and clocking constraints. This particular Stratix V has tons of logic elements and on chip memory, but applications are still rather limited for it. I did this before too, was curious how chip for $20k looks like :-)<p>My advice: get some board from Digilent, they have examples and active support forum. It will be more useful on the long run.')
