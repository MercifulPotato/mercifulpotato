Everything touched by them should be marked as &quot;tainted&quot; and should require explicit user blessing to leave their sandbox. Windows does something similar already with downloaded files.<p>Still, few programs need to change PATH, open arbitrary ports or ptrace other processes. These scenarios are so special that they should require explicit user approval. Also, apart from text editors, most programs don&#x27;t ever need to access arbitrary files from the file system.<p>Android being locked down is a distributor&#x27;s decision. They have average users in mind that might not ever need nor want to fiddle around on their system with a debugger and a text editor.')
