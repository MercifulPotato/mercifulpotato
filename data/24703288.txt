Item(by='gumby', descendants=None, kids=[24704270, 24704014], score=None, time=1602024529, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24703057, text='Of course they do but the description described &quot;techniques&quot;; he&#x27;s talking about a horizontal guitar play style.<p>As my comment said I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s anything wrong with the patent itself (and really the claims are the thing) just saying that that part of the description is probably wrong.  And that the patent system doesn&#x27;t care.<p>FWIW all the pedal steel guitars I&#x27;ve ever seen are in fact electric guitars... but I know what you meant.')
