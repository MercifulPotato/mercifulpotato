Current high-end monitors like 38GN850G and X27 are already plumbing the $2000 price point and the X32 is expected to tip the scale at $3600 MSRP.  &quot;Compared to&quot; just going out and buying a TV and using it as a monitor - you could buy a 55&quot; OLED for your PC and a 65&quot; for living room at that price.  Or two 55&quot; oleds, replace it in 3 years when it starts having burn-in from years of marathon Starcraft sessions or whatever.<p>There really isn&#x27;t a lot to justify a 32&quot; IPS 4K144 over a 48&quot; OLED 4K120 other than burn-in.')
