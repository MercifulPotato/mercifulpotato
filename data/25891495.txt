Then the one(s) carrying out the experiment go on and pick the most shocking writings. If you read all of the outputs (there are a few articles around that show you 5 or 6 different outputs) you&#x27;ll see the variations that it took duing those. I understand that 5 or 6 is actually small, to get shocking results they usually go into de dozens of tries.<p>[0] usually the priming phrases are given, but depending on how much of a snake-oil-salesman the person writing&#x2F;giving a talk is, they may even hide this part')
