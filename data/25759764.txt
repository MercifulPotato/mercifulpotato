Jeffrey Snover talked about this as part of his design for PowerShell, to have a standardised management interface that admins could learn for scripting and automation, and third parties could present an interface to for managing their products and services.<p>The print subsystem is one of the backwards compatibility limits on redesigning parts of the classic control panel - I&#x27;m fairly sure Raymond Chen has written about it - because so many print drivers depend on the way it works to hack in pages and popup dialogs for specialist configurations for their printers.<p>It also integrates decently with Windows&#x27; granular permissions, file and printer sharing on networks, logging, has tons of specialist printers like label printers, receipt printers, etc and is used by a ton of 3rd party management and configuration tools. I would be hugely surprised if it&#x27;s unsupported in 2031.<p>&gt; &quot;*&quot;I bought windows (server) because of the print subsystem&quot;?&quot;<p>When was the last you heard somebody say: &quot;I would buy Windows server, if it had CUPS printing support in it&quot;?')
