How long do you stay in China when you visit?<p>I&#x27;ve stayed usually for two to three months per year. I&#x27;ve been in Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Guangzhou mostly around tech folks. It&#x27;s getting better but I&#x27;m not fluent, I can get around. So sure obviously I follow the politics it&#x27;s of interest to me but mostly I&#x27;ve gotten my impression from work, talking to people and just living there.<p>And while the atmosphere is tenser maybe, there&#x27;s more nationalistic tones in particular from very young people and it didn&#x27;t feel as geopolitical say 8 years ago as it did 2 years ago, it doesn&#x27;t seem like a fundamentally different place. I can&#x27;t speak to every machination of the party but I don&#x27;t think China is going to withdraw from the world, or not let foreigners in or anything like that. People from the very bottom to the top seem to know there&#x27;s no way back to Mao&#x27;s days, I don&#x27;t think more political centralization is going to change that.<p>There&#x27;s so much bad press these days you think China is the next Soviet Union, but it&#x27;s hard to square with lived reality for me which is why responded quite strongly to the original post, there&#x27;s just so many of them, I don&#x27;t think it does the diversity in the country justice.')
