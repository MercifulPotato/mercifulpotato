Stambaugh&#x27;s revised translation of Being and Time is really good.<p>I disagree (I&#x27;ve never tried reading him in translation).  His German coinage and turgid sentences are legendary.  I had one particularly obscurantist sentence from <i>Sein und Zeit</i> on my whiteboard for over a year and it was always a source of discussion, both jocular and serious, when someone came into my office.')
