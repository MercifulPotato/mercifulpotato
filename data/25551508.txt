Not the enthusiasts, who will find a way to grok the full specs of cars and tinker even if you tell them not to.<p>Normal everyday folks should be content leaving the gory details to their mechanics. I&#x27;d wager it to be the same with Git, as an everyday tool of software engineers, rather than that of layperson. This is not gatekeeping; it&#x27;s a fact that Git is not your usual point-and-click stuff and UIs that attempt to do so can only simplify it so much. Real enthusiasts can always learn how to use Git if they want to, there&#x27;s no need to make it simpler or easier for the &#x27;casuals&#x27;.<p>The fact that people even have trouble with self-descriptive software like Microsoft Word - which is probably, in terms of UI, one of the easiest, most accessible UIs ever with years of research and iteration - speaks to the fact that not everyone will &#x27;get&#x27; Git, nor sho uld  there be a need to please or try to reach to everyone with a software that has as many complicated features as it does for the multitude of engineering problems it tries to solve.')
