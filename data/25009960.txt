Specifically, total global chip sales.<p>If Intel builds Intel (I believe their contract fabing is a rounding error?), then they&#x27;re directly tied to Intel chip sales.<p>This sets up a potential death spiral. Intel misses a process node deadline, Intel&#x27;s products are uncompetitive, Intel sales decrease, less demand for Intel fab, less money for Intel fab improvement.<p>Intel can temporarily paper over this by shifting money from other areas of the company, but it&#x27;s not a good path to be on.<p>Conversely, as you might expect, if Intel sales are <i>increasing</i> then the opposite, virtuous cycle holds.<p>So essentially, Intel&#x27;s fortune is tied to the Intel_sales : (global_sales &#x2F; number_of_leading_edge_non-Intel_fabs) ratio.<p>And with regards to that, two huge things happened in the marketplace recently: (1) mobile chip sales explosion, (2) GlobalFoundries exiting leading process race.<p>If Intel hadn&#x27;t been screwed by a process engineering miss, longer term trends would still have hit them hard.')
