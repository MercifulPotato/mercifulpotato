Maybe not. If there was a good answer that everyone was happy with then I&#x27;m sure the democratic process would adopt it.<p>&gt; The only difference between trying to prohibit supernumerary immigration of immigrants who aren&#x27;t personally barred and selling extra spaces is that the money those people are willing and able to spend to immigrate goes to criminals, and the public foots additional costs of enforcement as well as dealing with the social costs of immigration and the additional social costs of illegality, instead of avoiding the last cost, mitigating the penultimate cost, and avoiding driving money to criminal organizations.<p>Again, just as with murder; the point of making it illegal is to stop it, and I&#x27;m sure the illegality cuts the rate at which it happens.')
