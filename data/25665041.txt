On one hand I am glad that FB and Twitter are taking these steps but on the other I am deeply uncomfortable.<p>One of the things FB is removing is “ Calls for protests — even peaceful ones — if they violate the curfew in DC”. \nNot many years ago we as  lauded the ability of social media to galvanise protest against tyrannical regimes (eg the Arab Springs).
