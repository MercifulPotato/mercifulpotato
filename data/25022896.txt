That price might be high: Established companies have an interest in excluding future competitors&quot; - Bill Gates, cited in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;uH4RskpUFiA?t=1069" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;uH4RskpUFiA?t=1069</a><p>I believe what formerly happened with Software patents is currently happening with platforms. Lawrence Lessig (if you haven&#x27;t read his works, highly recommend) talks a lot about how copyright is used to restrict creativity &#x2F; culture &#x2F; innovation. In this talk [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uH4RskpUFiA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uH4RskpUFiA</a>] he makes the case that:<p>1. Creativity and innovation always builds on the past<p>2. The past always tries to control the creativity that builds on it<p>3. Free societies enable the future by limiting the past<p>4. Ours is less, and less, a free society<p>What&#x27;s fascinating is Apple has gone a step above and beyond here to use their control over a platform to control the innovations built upon it. The end-state is that no one can do to Apple what Apple did to other players (leveraging free software--Unix--and open hardware Schemas to kick off their computing platform). This pattern is one we&#x27;ve seen with other players, and will result in more and more people &quot;defensively&quot; building out platforms (what I suspect Google is doing with Android and FB with Oculus; if Apple&#x27;s monopoly is allowed to stand it&#x27;s only reasonable that other companies will need competing personal-computing platforms as a bargaining chip).')
