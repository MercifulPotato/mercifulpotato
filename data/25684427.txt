However, I feel that if I spent $200 or $300 on my resume, it would not increase my job chances nor salary significantly, and at the end, would be a waste of money. If such resume writing services offered a money back guarantee (say, a job making at least x within 6 months), I&#x27;d jump on it in a second.<p>Of course, resume writers can&#x27;t guarantee that, and I am in a position that spending $200 or $300 on something that won&#x27;t return isn&#x27;t worth it.')
