Gives an indication of how celebrity focused twitter is. Would be interesting to know how few people generate say, 80% of the value.<p>Also wonder what would happen if you just capped the number of max followers one can have or charged for shares, introducing some scarcity or locality. I once thought about making one where posts have to be paid for in some virtual currency that&#x27;s limited per month but given how much it violates every expectation people have of social interaction now it&#x27;d probably go down like a lead balloon.')
