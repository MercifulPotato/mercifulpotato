I&#x27;ve implemented B-trees. The majority of space the used by a B-tree is the data itself. Each N-ary leaf of the tree is a basically a vector of data with maybe some bookkeeping at the ends. The leaves are more than half of the tree.<p>Sure, you can compress the data. But that depends on the data, completely random data can&#x27;t be compress. Other data can be. But a point blank 83x space claim seems bizarre - or it&#x27;s comparing to a very inefficient implementation of a B-tree.<p>Edit: It seems the 83x claim is a product of the HN submission. I could not find it on the page. But even the page should say something like &quot;a compressed index that allows full speed look-up&quot; (akin to succinct data structures) and then it would make sense.')
