Flat hierarchies. In SE, there are officially only very few levels between a grunt and the CEO. In the military, hierarchies are deep. You have squad leaders, platoon leaders, sometimes even more staff, company staff, and so on. That means the gradient between a leader and someone being lead is rather small. Ideally, everyone can step up to a higher position immediately (useful because of the, ahem, high fluctuation).<p>2. Planned career advancement. The military has always agreed that leaders (that is, officers) require special training. <i>But</i> that training comes <i>after</i> they have learned the fundamentals. In SE, most managers come from dedicated management backgrounds. If an engineer becomes manager that is considered unusual and difficult.<p>3. Strategic training. Officers have wargames and even colleges dedicated to improve their decision making. SE Managers have what? A few books on amazon? It&#x27;s not just the <i>how</i> that is important in great leadership, the <i>what</i> should not be forgotten.')
