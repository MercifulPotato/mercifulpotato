Farming is a profession and an essential one. People need to be educated, trained and experienced. We can’t waste valuable farmland and distribute it.<p>However, if it does pass..then it could just be the dollar value of farmland that is redistributed or with the caveat that they form a co-op to professionally farm the acreage to be productive.<p>All farmland needs protection. Transitioning of farmland into commercial land or residential land should be fully discouraged.<p>Also..small holdings(less than 1000 acres) should be automated. Farming is for the rich. You need to lose a lot of money first before you can start making returns.<p>Encouraging those with no farm experience with farmland is pushing them into debt and penury.')
