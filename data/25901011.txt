Whoever had the newest fab node would have a notable advantage in being able to push their system harder. It could be better ML in missile to lock on and dodge, vs the defense system predicting paths as fast as possible with as low latency as possible to defend a ship or similar asset.<p>Its asymmetric in the example of course, but both sides would be doing both shooting and defending.')
