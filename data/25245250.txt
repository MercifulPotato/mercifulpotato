I remember seeing numerous top comment chains over the last four years (and of course before that but not here) that all boiled down to very eloquent defenses of censoring fringe thinkers.<p>Who knows, maybe in theory land there&#x27;s no reason we can&#x27;t have it both ways. But it seems to me that in the real world precisely the opposite is true. We can&#x27;t demand increasingly invasive and opaque mechanisms to prevent the spread of misinformation (once upon a time many examples of which would have just been called &quot;gossip&quot; or the &quot;rumor mill&quot;) and then act surpised when radicals for our own important causes get swept up in the net.
