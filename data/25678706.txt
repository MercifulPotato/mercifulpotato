This role used to be filled by SMS, but now people expect a better experience. Why hasn&#x27;t an alternative to SMS been created yet? We should not be relying on private tech giants to provide this essential service. There should be a fully end-to-end encrypted messaging service, supported by all Telecom providers, that is available by default with all cell plans. Data is now king, and almost all cell towers now have a data connection. We hasn&#x27;t this problem been solved yet? We&#x27;ve essentially outsourced the creation of this critical infrastructure to companies that want to sell our data.')
