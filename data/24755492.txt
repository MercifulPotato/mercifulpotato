The &quot;american steel&quot; argument falls flat; my car was made before the concept of crumple zones, much less airbags -- driving this boat, I&#x27;d be seriously injured or die in a head-on collison with a Yaris, where the other driver and passengers would probably walk away.  Unless my gas tank explodes and engulfs us all, that is.<p>If everybody was driving pre-1984 vehicles, the emissions would result in horrible smog, bringing most cities on par with Beijing.<p>The world must bring carbon emissions down to prevent severe climate change.  Maybe lax safety standards could contribute to that; but environmental regulations must not go.<p>Follow up: the &quot;free&quot; market that you propose is not actually free, but ignorant of externalities that the modern market has limited facilities to account for.')
