Naked short sales are short sales without an executed or agreed upon borrow between the borrower and broker. You are referring to short interest higher than 100% of the float (total shares in circulation), which is mundane because it happens organically when a lot of people want to short the same thing and start borrowing shares which were already sold short.<p>It seems entirely unsurprising to me that a brick and mortar retailer selling digital goods in the middle of a pandemic would be a hot short target for many different funds, thereby organically pushing short interest over 100%.')
