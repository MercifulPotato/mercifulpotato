If so, did they ever change any default?<p>I have family members who I&#x27;d call &quot;computer literate 101&quot; (i.e. they can use e-mail, create a PowerPoint, buy something on the web). Their homescreen is a history of their apps downloads, everything just gets added to the next available space. They do not use folders, they do not move icons. They do not enable large text size even though it would help them see the text better. They do not change the default ringtone. They do not use &quot;do not disturb&quot; when they&#x27;re in a restaurant.<p>The reason is, they don&#x27;t even know these options exist. They have never opened the Settings app.<p>To change the default search engine, you need to go three screens deep in Settings.app.<p>If Google stops paying Apple and Apple changes the default (for new users) to Bing or whatever, 99.5% of new users will just use Bing.')
