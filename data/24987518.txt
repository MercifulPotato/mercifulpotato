It&#x27;s a litmus test for who speaks in an uninformed manner.<p>Here is the only reference to seven-eighths in Prop 22:<p>&gt; <i>After the effective date of this chapter, the Legislature may amend this chapter by a statute passed in each house of the Legislature by rollcall vote entered into the journal, seven-eighths of the membership concurring, provided that the statute is consistent with, and furthers the purpose of, this chapter</i><p>Seven-eighths to overturn, eh? Now where did you go get that?<p>Now secondarily, one might ask if someone &quot;disappointed with the public&quot; is sufficiently informed about ballot propositions in the first place. For instance, if you&#x27;re a California voter and you can&#x27;t answer &quot;If a ballot proposition is passed through voter referendum, what majority of the legislature can overrule it?&quot;, then can you really be considered an informed voter?<p>Or, more directly, you are clearly expressing discontent with California voters while being the problem since you are clearly uninformed about Prop 22 <i>and</i> about how ballot props work (and perhaps about why they have to work that way).')
