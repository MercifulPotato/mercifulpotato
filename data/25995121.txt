Item(by='krick', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612219261, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25993643, text='I don&#x27;t know how HN feels about Stadia, so a honest question: why is it unpopular? I personally find it absolutely astounding that anyone can question that this <i>is</i> the future.<p>I&#x27;m absolutely confident this is the future. Except, unlike you, I don&#x27;t mean it in a positive way: I find it to be a one more face of the impending doom, anti-utopian authoritarian future, where people will be forbidden to perform arbitrary computations without a special permission. But that&#x27;s that kind of wild socio-philosophical predictions that nobody discusses seriously, and nobody even thinks you are serious for suggesting something as preposterous (but then it happen anyway and nobody is really surprised).<p>On the technical matter, though, it is so much better than owning your own hardware, that it&#x27;s hard to imagine how that could fail. I mean, obviously, Google will not succeed in making their own games (never could have). And of course current state of Stadia may not suit the &quot;real gamer&quot; (always a minority), because you can have a better performance on your own hardware.<p>But these problems will be solved, eventually. Better studios will make better games for this kind of platform, eventually it won&#x27;t be games only, but the whole workspace. CAD running on Stadia will perform better than it could have on your upper-middle-range laptop you paid a shitload of money for, and that still lags and overheats when running your 100-tab browser on it. Your client device will be cheap, completely silent, low-temperature and will run on a battery for several days (that is, with no power-battery technology improvement). Light and portable. It will be unbreakable, compared to your current PC. Basically just a good display, a networking card, and some input device. There is absolutely no way your software won&#x27;t run better on a shared hardware than you can buy for the same amount of money it will cost Google (or whoever will succeed with this).<p>I don&#x27;t know if latency will ever be low enough for every human-use application (which again makes me wonder why are they starting with games: probably the most latency-sensitive thing an average customer uses), but it is surprisingly good right now, and there&#x27;s still some room for improvement: computation servers will be more evenly distributed (CDN-style), and last-mile latency (the biggest problem, anyway) will improve in the upcoming years, especially on mobile.')
