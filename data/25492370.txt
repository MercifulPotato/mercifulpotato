Ideally, we would know there&#x27;s a cron that stopped working and we&#x27;d have to figure out which machine and which user it was on...then try and access it. Even the people that create them forget these things (myself included).<p>The most reasonable solution seems to use something like Jenkins--but I don&#x27;t think anyone is happy with that.<p>At one job they wrapped crontab and used RCS to write to a network location. Now you can grep a single folder, its now version controlled, and you can wire any re-image script to restore crontabs. I&#x27;ve pitched this approach at subsequent jobs, but was never in a seniority role to get it rolled out.')
