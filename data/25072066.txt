An autonomous vehicle that can only drive in these lanes will be autonomous a small portion of the time.<p>&gt;What needs to be done is force standardization of road markings and signaling and correct it where it is not compliant.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s different where you are but road marking and maintenance, especially as you get into secondary roads, can be rather haphazard. This is not going to change markedly so that people can use autonomous vehicles.')
