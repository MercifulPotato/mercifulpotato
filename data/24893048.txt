Wild dogs can&#x27;t afford shoes.  Sled dogs run all day barefoot in sub-zero temperatures.  I have four random little mutts between ten and twenty pounds, and even they rarely have trouble in the winter.  I took one of them out for a run today at 15 deg. F, no problem.<p>Salt is a problem.  If there&#x27;s a lot of salt out, I&#x27;ll rub a sealant into their pads before we go out.  Lots of things will work -- lip balm or lanolin are my favorites, but petroleum jelly would probably do in a pinch.  But whatever you use, the most important thing is to simply wash the salt out of their pads after they come back in.  I&#x27;ve done this for almost a decade in Colorado and none of my dogs has ever had a cracked or frost-bitten pad.')
