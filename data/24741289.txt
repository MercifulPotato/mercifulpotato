Your first leader (hopefully) are your parents since you don&#x27;t emerge with a complete understanding of things, and then you pick up a series of teachers&#x2F;mentors through-out life.<p>The thing that fucks everyone up is power. Power will corrupt a teacher. Power corrupts managers. Power corrupts owners.<p>The question is how to mitigate the corruption of power. A boss is a corrupt leader in my opinion, and I agree that we shouldn&#x27;t have one.')
