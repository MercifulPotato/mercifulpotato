I hope this means Signal gets back to normal soon.<p>Also, Signal should introduce some kind of paid subscription with a few critically important qualities:<p>1. Anonymous payment that binds subscriptions to users without retaining anything about who paid. Like a prepaid GSM SIM. All Signal needs to know is that the current terminal uses a paid subscription.<p>2. Ability to buy a cheaper bulk&#x2F;family bundle. I use Signal to talk to family and close friends and would like to pay for myself and my parents, at the very least.<p>3. Price it differently in different countries. $1 in India is as heavy as $10 in US. This is super mega important.<p>4. Setup dedicated servers for subscription users with a much better service level. The service collapse that happened today should not happen again. There should also be an option for a fully encrypted backup that Signal cannot decrypt just on the server side to store personal conversation logs.')
