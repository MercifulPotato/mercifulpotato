At best one has an implicit contract during a pre-order, which was violated due to its bugs.  That anyone could seriously believe that any complex software will be &quot;bug free&quot; strikes me as risible.  It seems to me that people are making a bet on a pre-order.  No regulation is necessary in any event: this can be handled using class action law, and true egregious misrepresentations are kept in check in this way.  These kinds of regulations are a jobs program for the officious personality and a way for politicians to seem relevant, but is mostly a form of or invitation to corruption, as the powerful influence the crafting of law to keep the small fry at bay.<p>Buyer beware, IMO.  Wait &#x27;til it&#x27;s out, reviewed, etc., and then you&#x27;ll know.')
