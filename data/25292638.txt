This happened to me last year. I was in the middle of a potential lawsuit for which Kat Herller and I hired feminist lawyers who threatened to sue Google (which is when they backed off--before that Google lawyers were prepared to throw us under the bus and our leaders were following as instructed) and the next day I get some random “impact award.” Pure gaslighting.<p>I think if you threaten to sue your employer, the employer isn&#x27;t too much at fault and just covering their own neck when you later threaten to resign and they take you up on that offer.')
