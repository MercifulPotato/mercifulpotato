I replace it with row Y that takes up 500b. I then write row Z after row Y that takes up 500b. If you want to rollback the original transaction, row X will no longer fit in its original spot because row Z is now taking up part of the space it used to occupy.<p>But this only can happen if replace X with Y and add Z are in the same transaction. If you rollback the transaction, then you start by removing Z, then replacing Y with X. What I&#x27;m missing here?')
