Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602797848, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24793895, text='&gt; The issue is that they both do it.<p>No, that&#x27;s not the issue. That&#x27;s never been the issue. As I said much earlier:<p>&quot;Everyone is wrong about some facts.&quot; &quot;However, this does not imply that everyone is equally wrong about the facts.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s neither time nor space here to numerically compare mistruths of the 2 major parties. I would just like to see acknowledgment of the general principle that 2 groups of people can be ignorant in some ways while having very different levels of ignorance. For example, compare high school children and elementary school children. Generally speaking, high schoolers have a lot more knowledge than grade schoolers, and yet high schoolers still have quite a bit of ignorance. The 2 groups are not at all equal. This is a very common situation, and &quot;both sides are wrong about things&quot; is not a useful description of that situation.')
