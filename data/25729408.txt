I&#x27;ve never heard of you before, but this article was an absolute pleasure to read. At an age where everything is competing for attention, and I end up skimming left and right to compensate, I really enjoyed reading this particular article from start to finish. Thank you for writing it.<p>And also thank you to the uploader for uploading it here. While the article itself is from 2014, it feels like it&#x27;s as sorely needed today as ever. I needed to read this right now. Thank you.')
