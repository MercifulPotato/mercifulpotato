Certainly not &#x27;assaulting the Capitol building&#x27;. I wonder if that is even within their imagination for what could go wrong, although I suppose it should be.<p>I don&#x27;t buy the conspiracy theories that the guards &#x27;let them in&#x27;, that&#x27;s clearly not the case for the most part, although there are some guards who very oddly seemed to &#x27;move away&#x27;. These kinds of conspiratorial actions would be impossible to keep under wraps, there&#x27;s no chance that at least a few guards wouldn&#x27;t &#x27;leak&#x27; the &#x27;secret plans&#x27; or whistle-blow after the fact.<p>It&#x27;d be great if there was a really objective piece by piece breakdown of all of this, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.')
