Because you&#x27;re storing the logs in your S3 bucket you can keep them however long you want and rehydrate them when you need them (say 30 days later).<p>The bill will still be in the low thousands but paying 30-40k per year for a logging solution is probably worth the cost if it means you don&#x27;t have to maintain it. Having logs and metrics (and the APM if you&#x27;re using it) all in one place is _really_ nice.')
