Products built like that tend to be the lowest quality, because the people actually making it don’t care about what they’re making. Teams run like that require detailed work tracking solutions with dedicated middle management.<p>The other approach is to have developers build up a real sense of why they are building what they’re building, who they are building it for, and give them the agency to change the how and what to better meet that why. This requires trust, so it is more easily done in organizations that are on a first name basis. It may involve jira, but really almost any work tracking solution will work.')
