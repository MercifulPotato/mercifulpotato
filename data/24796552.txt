However sometimes there is a level of corruption that can&#x27;t be dealt with any other way besides going public with it.  In those instances, it is up to the whistleblower and journalists initially before eventually the court decides.  Snowden was good in this regarding by trying to limit what was leaked.  Manning did a poor job here.<p>&gt;I would say that Snowden exposed a crime (perjury) by James Clapper. Manning (IMO) exposed war crimes.<p>No disagreement here.  Snowden and Manning fit a clear definition of whistleblowers.  Assange is the one who is not on the same moral footing as those two.<p>&gt;Similarly, I think that it was in the interest of the public to report when it was discovered that Trump only paid $750 in taxes (despite not committing a technical crime!) or that Hillary Clinton received some debate questions in advance (again, not a crime!).<p>Trump&#x27;s taxes likely did reveal numerous potential crimes.  He reported different numbers to the government and lenders which would likely indicate he committed fraud.[2]  He both employed his daughter and paid her as an external consultant which isn&#x27;t allowed[3].  He regularly claimed things as business expenses in questionable ways.[4]  I&#x27;m sure there are many others too, those were just the first three I remembered.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icij.org&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;panama-papers&#x2F;first-us-taxpayer-sentenced-to-prison-for-crimes-revealed-by-panama-papers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icij.org&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;panama-papers&#x2F;first-us-t...</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;trump-inc-podcast-never-before-seen-trump-tax-documents-show-major-inconsistencies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;trump-inc-podcast-never-b...</a><p>[3] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;28&#x2F;politics&#x2F;ivanka-trump-donald-trump-tacves&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;28&#x2F;politics&#x2F;ivanka-trump-donald-...</a><p>[4] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;28&#x2F;donald-trump-taxes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;28&#x2F;donald-trump-taxes&#x2F;</a>')
