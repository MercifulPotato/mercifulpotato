The server can be a bit performance hungry but I also host plenty of other services on my VPS (email, HTTP server, Seafile, VPN, etc) and I never noticed any degradation in performance in any of them.<p>They have been making a lot of progress in improving the performance of the Synapse server and it is very usable now. And it is not difficult to configure at all, it&#x27;s easier than configuring Prosody.<p>I would say that the bottleneck now is more about improving the UX and the Voip capabilities of the clients.')
