Starting with your side-projects is a good way to learn to code clean.<p>2&#x2F; electricity consumption is not the right metric: the devices&#x27; time of life is. The heavier the code, the sooner we need to replace our hardware to keep up. It&#x27;s both true on the front and the back sides.<p>Most of the CO2 and damages to biodiversity come from the hardware. The life time of a computer ought to be 15&#x2F;20 years. With choice of high durability of components, repairs made easy, upgrades as well, plus second-hand markets: a gaming computer bought today ought to be an quite decent office computer in 15 years.<p>On the data centers&#x27; side, economic incentives are huge for operators to reduce energy consumption, both on servers and bandwidth. The gains have been incredible in the last ten years.<p>Maybe a server that Google wants to replace because its datacenter is full could be resold, maybe not to a competitor but to a family as a home central server. Running the family&#x27;s NAS, media server and IoT hub.<p>To code clean is mainly a fight against hardware obsolescence.<p>Electricity consumption matters only for hugely used websites PLUS hugely-used frameworks like WordPress that run tens of millions of websites of smaller audience.')
