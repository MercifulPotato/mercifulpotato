Seems for now that the brand new Cloudflare Analytics is simply a server log tool with server log accuracy.&quot;<p>Okay, this is nice to distinguish but I would kinda like to know both numbers: what&#x27;s the raw load coming through CF to my website and what are the &quot;real human users&quot; -- and what tools can CF provide to block the former while allowing the latter?  If CF can provide easy to configure and understand WAF rules to filter more of the bots and other raw traffic that I don&#x27;t want then I&#x27;m going to save on my AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;hosting bill.')
