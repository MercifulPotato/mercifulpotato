Generally the most corrupt and abusive people you will meet are going to be someone mediocre who has been handed just a bit too much power. Think HOA&#x27;s and local bureaucrats, not the state or federal government.<p>Also, CA should go to shall issue. I&#x27;m not a really big gun-guy myself, but I don&#x27;t see the public benefit to being a may issue state. Especially if it creates little places like this for petty powers to solicit for bribes.')
