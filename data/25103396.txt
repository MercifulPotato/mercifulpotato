EVs are great for short commuting hops, but offer no solution if you want to have a road trip with daily mileage exceeding the full battery range. Also note that the posted ranges are &quot;under best possible circumstances&quot;, so factor in real-world use, battery degradation and not wanting the charge to drop below 20-30% for your own peace of mind, and your effective roadtrip range is sliced in half.<p>Sure, there are charging stations, but if you are traveling with kids, having an extra 1-hour break, could be a huge headache.<p>A common standard for batteries that could be quickly exchanged at a charging station, instead of charging them, could solve the problem 100%, but instead we see governments forcing less effective solutions into everyone&#x27;s throat.')
