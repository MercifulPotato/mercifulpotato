Orgo was a weed out course but it was weeding out pre-meds rather than STEM people.  The structure of the chemistry major at Penn was designed for chem majors - too many higher level or lab courses for the pre-xxx crowd.  And 3 semesters of calc was required for p-chem and qm.  Seems few willingly take calc courses...<p>In grad school (Duke) 1&#x2F;7th of the student body took freshman chemistry.  This was merely prep for the orgo weed out, and provided a lot of $$ for TA’s. As far as I can tell, both schools still operate this way.<p>And then there’s those lab courses - multiple 4-hour sessions a week since doing “cooking” or shooting spectra takes time.  But playing with dye lasers was fun.')
