But perhaps a fun thought experiment.<p>If you had access to a small satellite, what would you do with it?<p>We&#x27;ve managed to drop the price-point and expertise overhead required for having&#x2F;operating 5kg-class satellite to a point where a somewhat wealthy software engineer with a laptop could have one (i.e. $250k all in, including launch).<p>It is not the market we&#x27;re targeting by any means, but I&#x27;ve just realised the Venn diagram has crept in that direction.
