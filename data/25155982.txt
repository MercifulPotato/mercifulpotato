If you look at the literature it is clear that lockdowns and quarantines are no use against fast spreading infections which need population wide safety measures and tracking of clusters.  The primary approach we have taken is a dramatic departure from established epidemiology.<p>We did have a group focused on looking for and responding to epidemics, but it was disbanded by US leaders who find science uncompelling and inconvenient.  Japan responded to CoV2-SARS by attempting to identify and focus on clusters and have had far greater success than the US, so your glib reference to &quot;humanity&quot; and &quot;societies&quot; probably needs finer detail to be completely accurate.')
