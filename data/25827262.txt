Comparing that to the cohort of people who were never infected, that comes out to 83% efficacy. So there’s your comparison number – which means that being vaccinated with either of the mRNA agents provides better protection than being infected with the real coronavirus can.<p>The vaccine comes in two doses spaced by a month or two, and the second boosts immune response.  Being exposed to the real thing twice should have a similar effect, but it would be hard to precisely dose and schedule another weak exposure.<p>However, `42&#x2F;6000 = 0.007` sounds pretty low-risk to me, unless you are elderly and&#x2F;or in poor health.')
