For instance, dealing with things that need to be stack-aware, such as a GC or tail recursion, takes epic hacks like the Boehm GC or the &quot;Cheney on the MTA&quot; trick. You&#x27;re also stuck with the C calling convention.<p>Plus, while generating C is simple, you&#x27;re entirely on your own. With LLVM IR, you benefit from its infrastructure, the optimization passes and other LLVM-based tools, so you don&#x27;t need to reinvent the wheel as much. In the end, you&#x27;ll need some kind of IR anyway, and LLVM is a good place to start.')
