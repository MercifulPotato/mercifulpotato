If a bit of detritus got into yours and is reducing the flow, it will do exactly that. Seems more likely than that every pump handle you visit is defective...either that or the small gas tank&#x2F;bladder on your Prius can&#x27;t accept a high enough flow rate to work with normal pumps, though I&#x27;d be surprised if Toyota missed that.<p>Dropping the tank and replacing it or the filler neck is a pretty easy DIY project.')
