Face recognition isn&#x27;t as good as Apple&#x2F;Google, and there&#x27;s no automated AI stuff like Apple&#x2F;Google either, but it works much better than I honestly expected, and I have no complaints from my mostly-tech-clueless family. Plus you own the hardware.<p>I ended up opting for both.')
