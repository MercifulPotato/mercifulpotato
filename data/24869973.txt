Ran his own startup for 10+ years, just had a great exit.  And during his post-sale victory lap in which he took a much-needed burnout recovery break, STILL began to refer to himself as “unemployed” in the context of worry over what to do next.<p>“Employed” &#x2F; “Unemployed” is a mindset that’s been engrained into people for hundreds of years, so I can’t blame others for applying it to entrepreneurs.  But I think it’s a limiting frame of reference and holds a lot of people back.')
