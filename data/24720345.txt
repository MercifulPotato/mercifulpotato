Most security engineers probably realize that there are many gaping holes around the company but they never have the time or bandwidth to go broad and find issues in areas outside their BU. Ultimately, this kind of bug hunting, though lucrative for bug bounty people, does not realize true gains for the company because you are doing bug whack-a-mole all the time instead of trying to fix problems systemically. The joke at a big company I use to work was that its easier to pay thousands in bounty then trying to fix systemic issues because fixing those issues would be more costly. Not saying that this is the right mentality but leaders try to do cost benefit analysis and a bad bug is mostly just a bad PR day without any loss of value to the shareholders.')
