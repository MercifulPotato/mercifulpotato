The reason why we have this wrong notion of alphas in wolf packs is that it&#x27;s based on one guy who studied wolves in captivity. Wild wolf packs behave as family units with parents being &#x27;dominant&#x27; and offspring leaving to form their own families. There is social dominance involved but it&#x27;s not simplistic.<p>Interesting. Almost skipped it for having the sort of title that actually rarely answers &#x27;why&#x27;.')
