If you have data to that effect, please share it.<p>For all intents and purposes the election <i>is</i> done. The votes have been cast and with most of them counted, Biden has won by a wide enough margin that sporadic concerns about voter fraud is not going to change it.<p>Americans who are pushing back against Trump&#x27;s reticence to concede are not doing so not because they believe that TV decides who is elected, but because it&#x27;s a bald-faced attempt at a coup. Trump has every right to challenge the results in court, but if there was actual evidence of widespread election irregularities, it would have been presented by now.')
