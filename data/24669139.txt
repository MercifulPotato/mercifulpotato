I&#x27;m a little older, it was engrained in me that looking at your watch when you&#x27;re talking to someone is a clear and pretty rude signal that they&#x27;re boring you, wasting your time, and that in general you&#x27;d like the conversation to be done.<p>Like if I so much as glanced at my watch while talking to someone, I&#x27;d immediately say sorry and explain why I have to keep track of time.<p>Having a smart watch has changed this in one way, which is if someone starts blowing up my notifications I&#x27;ll say &quot;sorry let me fix that&quot; and turn it to silent.<p>I don&#x27;t have a good fix for conveying this etiquette to people who never got the message, but I&#x27;m with you: that&#x27;s rude, people need to stop doing it.<p>No need to blame the device though. I&#x27;m with everyone else who says that the notifications are way less distracting than they would be on a phone.')
