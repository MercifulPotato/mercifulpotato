This cannot be stated enough.<p>For many people Facebook <i>is</i> the internet. Facebook handles commercial transactions, conversations between family members and is the sole source of contact between old friends.<p>Other than Facebook, I&#x27;d guess the biggest source&#x2F;storage spot for CP would be Gmail.<p>Unlike PornHub, Facebook has to contend with <i>actual</i> children sending pictures back and forth to each other, just like our generation sexted on AIM and IRC. Last of all, PornHub content is mostly public so people will flag content and take cause it to be taken down fairly quickly, while Facebook can have content hidden away for ages inside some private chat or private group.<p>So the recap:<p>1. Facebook is bigger<p>2. Facebook has more source material (i.e. under 18 year olds use the platform)<p>3. Facebook is has less crowd-source moderation (so illegal content builds up like sediment)')
