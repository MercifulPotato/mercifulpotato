I&#x27;ll give you the benefit of the doubt instead, and assume you didn&#x27;t mean to generalize suburbs and exurbs as racist and homophobic, artless, desolate and uncivilized places.<p>I live in a quaint little town by the water, a decent drive away from a major city. I&#x27;m a tech worker that chose to move, because city perks didn&#x27;t outweigh the city stress.<p>I would say that for anyone considering the change, think about what you want out of your everyday life and move wherever gives you that. Do not lock yourself into an expensive city because it has something that you don&#x27;t see yourself enjoying every day. In my town, I can walk with my daughter to a local beach that has zero tourists. I have a garden, and a detached home office, and a garage wood shop, and two cars (one for hauling family, one for hauling lumber).  I live close to my suburban in-laws, who get great joy out of seeing their grandkids on the weekend. Those are things that no major city in the world could give me, reasonably, and are the reasons why I would never move back.')
