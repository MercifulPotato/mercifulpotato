When one uses the phrase, “science denier”, it often means, “you don’t agree with my philosophy&#x2F;metaphysics&#x2F;economic policy” rather than “you deny these particular facts”, which causes people to be rightly concerned. I’m not optimistic that this is going to change anytime soon, but this, I think, accounts for many of the issues in current discourse.')
