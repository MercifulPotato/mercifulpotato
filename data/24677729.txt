Maybe it&#x27;s always been that.<p>No one is &#x27;winning&#x27;, which is a stupid way to describe countries anyways, and reeks of Trumpian rhetoric. But if anyone is &#x27;winning&#x27; it&#x27;s China. They&#x27;re the ones lifting millions out of poverty while the rest of the world becomes less equal. Also the idea that the EU is democratic is not really true. It may be made up of democracies, but its institutions are run by technocrats and many of its processes are anything but democratic.<p>Also, Belarusians have a higher standard of living than Ukranians, something FP will never say. Belarusians know this and it&#x27;s one of the things that keeps their dictator in power.<p>&quot;Europeâ€™s spectacularly swift and successful response to the migration crisis demonstrates that mass migration can be controlled.&quot;<p>More white supremacist neo-colonial nonsense. No one in Europe is happy with how this is being handled, either on the right or left.<p>&quot;Outside of Britain, extreme Euroskepticism enjoys scant support.&quot;<p>Absolute bullshit. The EU is full of Euroskepticism. Simply compare the number of countries wanting to join it now compared to 10 years ago. I don&#x27;t think the EU will break up, but just wait until the next major economic contraction and we&#x27;ll see who steps up to leave.<p>I live in the EU, and I can&#x27;t imagine that many people in the EU taking this article all that seriously. It must be written for ignorant Americans.')
