Worldwide, diesel costs more than petrol (though by not that much). Some of the taxes also go towards subsidies for LPG, which is a major source of heating in many house holds in India.<p>However, taxes can come down. Geo-politically speaking though, it is in the interest of the govt. that the consumption of fuels is kept to a minimum, as we don&#x27;t have any significant oil reserves.')
