Item(by='forinti', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609942999, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25657588, text='Try this:<p><pre><code>    select ord, table_name, first_name, last_name, total_rows \n    from (\n        select table_name,\n               row_number() over (order by table_name asc) ord,\n               count(1) over () total_rows,\n        from all_tables \n        where table_name like &#x27;B%&#x27;\n        order by table_name desc\n    ) where  ord between 10 and 19\n    order by ord\n</code></pre>\nThis is basically what Oracle Apex does. You can do this without window functions, but it gets a bit more complicated.<p>I like to add total_rows so that I can show a &quot;rows 10 - 19 of 81&quot; header. You can also get the very first and last values by adding theses columns:<p><pre><code>    first_value(table_name) over (order by table_name asc rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following) first_name,\n    last_value(table_name) over (order by table_name asc rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following) last_name\n</code></pre>\nAlternatively, you could get the very last and very first whole rows by changing the outer where clause:<p><pre><code>   ord=1 or rownum=1 or ord between 10 and 19\n</code></pre>\nAnd then it would be easy to have a nice header with &quot;rows 10 - 19 of 81 (Algiers to Zimbabwe)&quot; with very little code.')
