The book &quot;The Reckoning: Financial Accountability and the Rise and Fall of Nations&quot; describes how the advent of double entry accounting meant that you could detect fraud, and suddenly you could do things like give your goods to a naval merchant who will sail away with them and bring you back the money and it works because you can detect any cheating and this is the foundation of capitalism (textbook version). You can think of the arrow of progress as pointing in the direction of increasing accountability . So, the problem with social media is that people lie, always have, and it&#x27;s like we are just noticing this for the first time ever, and now we are responding to that. Social media is making us more accountable, not less! See #MeToo, etc')
