First and foremost, because WebRTC mandates the use of DTLS to encrypt the RTP flow, thus a plain RTP stream won&#x27;t work. A more apt title would be &quot;How to use FFmpeg to generate an encoded stream that happens to match the requirements for WebRTC&quot;.<p>Still, thanks for the article; it is always interesting to see specific applications of the FFmpeg command line, because in my opinion after having read them top to bottom, FFmpeg docs are <i>very</i> lacking in the department of explaining the <i>whys</i>.<p>Random example: You read the docs of <i>genpts</i> and it is something on the line of &quot;Enables generation of PTS timestamps&quot;. Well, thank you (&#x2F;s) But really, when should I use it? What does it actually change between using it or not? <i>What scenarios would benefit from using it?</i> Etc. Etc.')
