These chips run cool and fast, and Intel laptop chips don&#x27;t. No amount of hyperefficient code is going to get you a real 18 hours of battery life on last year&#x27;s MacBook Air.<p>The other one is Apple&#x27;s proven track record of integrating custom hardware and software, into something which is greater than the sum of its parts. Ever since I got an iPad Pro, I&#x27;ve been quietly frustrated with the user interface of MacBooks. It&#x27;s just not physics-smooth, and the iPad just is.<p>I just got one of the 16&quot; MacBook Pros for work, and it&#x27;s pretty loaded, and it&#x27;s a good computerâ€” by the standards previous to the M1. Battery life could be better; overheats sometimes with serious fan noise, for no good reason, although each update to Catalina appears to substantially reduce this.<p>I figured I could get five years on this rig. No way. I might make it to 2022, but I know terminal gearlust when I see it. Whatever Apple sticks in the next release of the 16&quot;, I&#x27;m craving it already.')
