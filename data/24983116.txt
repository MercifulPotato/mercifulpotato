I was modestly successful, published only work that I believe was truly defensible, and never over sold any of my results.    I&#x27;ve asked to have my name removed from a paper that was submitted when I noticed it was revised to include lies after I had written it.<p>I believe you are wrong in saying that scientists aren&#x27;t idiots: they make colossal errors, obvious ones, all the time!  Frankly, I think most successful (in terms of adulation and $$$) scientists are ones who learned how to play the games scientists play, and publish known incorrect work, or unknowingly publish overly strong estimates of their confidence, because they&#x27;ve mastered the incentive system, not because they&#x27;re not idiots.<p>I see very little true humility amongst scientists- nearly every successful one I&#x27;ve met was aggresively egotistical.<p>That said, after another 10-15 years of being a SWE, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion most SWEs are idiots, too- too focused on clever algorithms and microoptimizations.')
