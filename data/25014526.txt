I&#x27;m happy to accept that most scientists are acting in good faith.  As I&#x27;m happy to accept most google, apple, facebook developers do not think they are building the prison technology of the future.  They simply don&#x27;t have the bigger picture.  Mind you, their jobs depend on not knowing that picture either.<p>&gt; Whatever problems scientists have with reproducibility, there can be zero expectation of reproducibility with anecdotes.<p>Why?  That&#x27;s insane.  If someone, in person, testifies to their personal experience, that it had an impact on their life, you would ignore that?  Corporations pay billions for people to create any old crap if they think there&#x27;s a market in it.  That individual is offering up some personal information for no gain, just as a simple expression of the truth they have found.  And you would ignore it?<p>With the best intent, you need to take a look in the mirror and question whether you are a part of the problem.  If you take the word of &#x27;science&#x27; over an individual&#x27;s open expression, you don&#x27;t have authority over yourself as an individual.  Science has authority over you.  And, be honest, you don&#x27;t even need them to provide evidence for you to accept whatever they state.')
