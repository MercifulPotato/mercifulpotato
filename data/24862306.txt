You would only be using the generator on long off road trips where you&#x27;re isolated and don&#x27;t have an alternative way to charge the vehicle. If having the generator means the EV is a viable choice then you would still get the environmental benefits of someone using an EV instead of ICE for 95% of their driving.')
