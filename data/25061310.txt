New maintainers welcomed, if you&#x27;re interested!<p>(One major &quot;oof&quot; is that the Google Photos API strips geolocation data, so unfortunately coordinates are lost when using this method. There&#x27;s discussion about using Takeout as a workaround, or even automating web browser interactions, but those have their own problems too.)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mholt&#x2F;timeliner" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mholt&#x2F;timeliner</a>')
