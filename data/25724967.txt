If there&#x27;s no moderation and there are posts violating FOSTA&#x2F;SESTA, I&#x27;m pretty sure someone is going to be having a talk with their domain registrar at minimum.<p>They&#x27;re running on AWS (ask Parler how that&#x27;s working out) and their contact is a gmail address, this seems like the opposite of uncensorable.<p>Their github repo mentions &quot;A host with good capacity and DDOS protection would be helpful to the project,&quot; which I&#x27;m assuming means it&#x27;s also extremely vulnerable to DDOS.')
