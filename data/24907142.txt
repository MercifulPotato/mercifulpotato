I don&#x27;t think I had to use any resources outside of the official tutorials and documentation on the Qt site, it&#x27;s well documented. My only complaint with the documentation is that for a lot of their example projects, it doesn&#x27;t explain it step by step, it just shows you a bunch of code and it&#x27;s up to you to look up what the different functions do. I was originally going to try to make web apps for my projects, but even with no prior C++ experience, working with Qt was easier to pick up than learning javascript and all the associated tooling required for web applications.')
