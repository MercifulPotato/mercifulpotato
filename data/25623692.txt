I love the language and the way Rich Hickey approaches it, but I was constantly frustrated with the lack of an IDE and having to stop to deal with Java and Java tooling errors all the time.<p>In the end I felt like Clojure was too clever for its own good. By relying on Java (which was a great choice) it took a lot of the oxygen out of the ecosystem for other devs to build tooling and libraries, and without that there aren&#x27;t as many people participating or becoming a well known community member from their work there. Again, can&#x27;t say this was the wrong choice, but in my opinion ecosystem is the #1 thing for a language and the way Clojure was done had an impact on how the ecosystem could grow.')
