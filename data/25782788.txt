One of the benefits of standard open source licenses is that it&#x27;s easier for companies to give blanket permission, &quot;you can use software that&#x27;s MIT licensed&quot;. Hopefully it becomes easier for companies to just pick whether they say &quot;we allow the use of SSPL&#x27;d software&quot; or &quot;we do not allow the use of SSPL&#x27;d software&quot; instead of making all the software engineers have discussions with lawyers to get work done.')
