Item(by='vikramkr', descendants=None, kids=[24761810], score=None, time=1602556849, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24761663, text='If its propagated by seeds its not patentable - so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible for that sort of scenario to rise. If you asexually propagated a plant and let a neighbor take a cutting, then I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;m not a lawyer, but that situation sounds similar to the what happens if you unknowingly buy stolen art and try to auction it type question. It would probably be a very interesting legal battle at the least - and the original propagator would probably be liable, but that&#x27;s definitely an interesting scenario. I doubt the end result is going to be that the patent owner just loses protection.')
