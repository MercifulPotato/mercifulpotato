While, for example, graphical techniques to make interactive elements in a GUI stand out from read-only content are partly universal and partly consolidated by tradition, even a noncontroversial principle like providing &quot;apt documentation&quot; is an abstract concept that can have a very different meaning for different people and in different situations.')
