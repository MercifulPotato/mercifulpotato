If someone can determine the API by referring to code released under the Apache licence, what copyrights could they be infringing by building a different implementation of the API using the Apache-licensed code as a reference?<p>For a copyright infringement to have taken place, there generally needs to be an unauthorised instance of recording or of duplication, of some copyrighted work.<p>I put <i>generally</i> as, I believe, precisely recreating someone else&#x27;s photo can still count as an infringement of their copyrights, despite that you haven&#x27;t copied the image itself in the usual sense of making duplicates.
