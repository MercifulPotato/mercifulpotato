Also the pitch of those blades in the photo are quite aggressive.<p>I wonder if they have different configurations - as photographed I can easily believe the 50mph top speed with small but high kv (fast but inefficient) motors but I&#x27;d expect a different configuration for longer flight times.<p>From the photo it looks like the battery compartment is shaped for 2 cylinders, its about the right dimensions for 2x 18650 cells but it&#x27;s impossible to say for sure. That would give up to 8000mah of 3.7v (1S2P configuration) or 4000mah at 7.4v (2s1p). They could be using different chemistry though, e.g. I usually fly LiHV cells which have a higher nominal voltage in the same pack size &amp; weight - you do get very slightly more watt hours out of those packs (not as much as the numbers would suggest).<p>The given all up weight looks plausible based on the size of what&#x27;s shown and the weight of 2 cells.')
