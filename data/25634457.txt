When you see $30000 price tag on a bitcoin you don&#x27;t know what percentage of it is actually fake USDT dollars. Right now it doesn&#x27;t mater as you can exchange usdt for usd 1:1, but one day the music will stop and a &quot;bank run&quot; will happen, which will expose a giant hole and a real price of btc, collapsing the whole scheme.<p>&gt;why 1) isn&#x27;t BTC tanking<p>My current theory is that they co-opted a lot of exchanges, if you read their website <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tether.to&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tether.to&#x2F;</a> they admit that they are not backed by USD and mention &quot;loans made by Tether to third parties&quot; which sounds like they give exchanges billions of dollars for IOUs. So exchanges get free billion dollar loans and in turn tether can print more billions and trade it for real money on bitfinex which they own.')
