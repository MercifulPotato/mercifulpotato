Every subreddit has fairly draconian rules against self promotion, so I’m curious if anyone here has strategies.<p>I am NOT trying to sneak around barriers to spam people with bullshit, I don’t even have a product to sell yet. I’m just curious to hear thoughts from anyone who may have succeeded here.<p>Thanks!')
