That’s a movie-plot threat, not something anyone reading this needs to worry about and if they did they should be investing in bodyguards.<p>Similarly, in the real world you have to make trade-offs. In this case, the alternative is using a password. Those are not only much, much easier to observe with a camera but also open rich new areas for an attacker to try: passwords are generated by normal people so they’re often weak, notoriously reused across multiple sites, and people are convinced by phishers to enter their passwords on the wrong site. Trying to protect against the Hollywood threats makes you more vulnerable to the kinds of things which befall many people on a daily basis.')
