I recently switched my note taking to be organized around concept &quot;hubs&quot; with Zettelkasten-esque linking between them, and it&#x27;s maybe the biggest improvement I&#x27;ve made in terms of organizing my learning. I sometimes cover material a bit slower, but I rarely have a single session now where I don&#x27;t have some kind of aha moment.
