For whatever reason you like, Reddit doesn&#x27;t delegate the community to its moderators. It delegates the responsibilities, but not the rights. Reddit still has an overarching &quot;community standards&quot; and is thus, at that level, still just one big community, with the accompanying failure. The attempt to solve that with subreddits was a good try, and solved some things, but it doesn&#x27;t get around the sorts of problems being discussed in this overall thread.<p>(I&#x27;m only talking about what the case is, in this context, not why, nor judging it at the moment.)')
