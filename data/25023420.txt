I am not saying we should there have as much hierarchy as possible, but I am certainly opposed to any form of anarchism (which I don&#x27;t believe would last long anyway). Give anarchy a month at most, and you&#x27;ll have leaders with followers popping up everywhere, which will eventually combine into a smaller number of large hierarchies.')
