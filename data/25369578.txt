Biden winning or losing doesn&#x27;t change that.  So those cries wouldn&#x27;t demonstrate much.<p>&gt; Hillary Clinton herself advised Biden not to concede if it came down to it<p>She said not to concede on the night of the election, because of factors like mail-in voting.  Someone that thinks she said not to concede at all, at any point, is just wrong.')
