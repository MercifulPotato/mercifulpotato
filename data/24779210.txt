Also, I would have thought there to be more automation in an economy like Germany&#x27;s and not people working around the clock.<p>I interned at a company in Germany before and my biggest takeaway was that everything was extremely high-efficiency and well-planned during work hours, and off hours were off hours, during which people enjoyed their lives.<p>It seems like a random American dude invaded and set up an sweatshop that is completely contradictory to the work-life balance and mental health standards that the rest of the country seems to have. I&#x27;d love to hear what Germans think of this.')
