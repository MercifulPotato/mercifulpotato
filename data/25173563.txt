PHP on server and a bit of java-script and IMG tag on client. Very simple and works just as well as Plausible and better than Goatcounter (compared the three on same site). \nIf you go for server logs you need ways to discount bots and other scripts. Probably discount foreign traffic depending on the intended audience - this works well for me in a small european country.')
