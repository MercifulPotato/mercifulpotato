This doesn&#x27;t make the word &quot;red&quot; lose its meaning. In my opinion, it gives the word <i>more</i> meaning by defining it as a spectrum of quality. Thus we can plot colors on a spectrum of red-ness, which can be useful for certain applications.<p>Similarily for capitalism-socialism. It is a spectrum. The United States represents one extreme, where something like, I don&#x27;t know, North Korea maybe represents the other. And Finland is somewhere in-between.')
