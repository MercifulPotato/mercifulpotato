It ties me to Wordpress and only Wordpress - anything I want to do requires logging in and navigating the admin interface, which I&#x27;m not a fan of.<p>By comparison, flat-file CMS&#x27;s allow me to edit, search and process my content using whatever tool I like. I can update my blog directly in the terminal, or in Github from work and have the changes pushed out automatically by CI. They&#x27;re not making hundreds of database calls every time I want a page, so they&#x27;re blazing fast. I can have simple scripts output to a text file and have it rendered as a status page. And if I want to migrate to another solution, my content is literally a bunch of text files that I can just copy to whatever shiny new thing just caught my eye.')
