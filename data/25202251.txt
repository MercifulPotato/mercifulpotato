So I&#x27;ll add in here -- as a data engineer myself -- that Rust is definitely providing an advantage for me. Combining it with Python (using PyO3 bindings) lets me write performant, safe code that interops with Python in a project for which Scala+Spark isn&#x27;t feasible. So while Rust may not provide an advantage for <i>you</i>, that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t have a potential niche for data engineering.')
