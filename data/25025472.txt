It has taken a while to get to general availability. Even now, for some strange reason they are permitted to serve only 20m users. Their beta was 2m users and they blew through that very early.<p>The user experience was fantastic - easier than sending a camera pic or audio message. They had zero promotions during the beta period unlike everyone else who were offering tons of freebies, not just at initial launch but even till now. If this works (as I think it will) it will lay waste to the billions of dollars that GooglePay, PhonePe and Paytm threw around.<p>Wonder if that will make the others throw around more cash to retain users or if the market will switch to a more rational model where people are not being paid to pay.')
