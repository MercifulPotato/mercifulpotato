Item(by='Nkuna', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608563719, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25493910, text='&gt; I find all these slavery comparisons in poor taste. Across history you will find slaves that were treated well, accumulated wealth, were educated and held in high regard - yet they still legally were the property of another person. The fundamental distinction with slavery is not a bad paycheck.<p>How do you hold someone in high regard when they are your property? You cannot see me as less than yet hold me in high regard!<p>Right! A slave or two that were &quot;treated well&quot; speaks for generations that were maimed, raped, erased from existence.<p>The only thing I could discern from this is that you would have owned slaves were you born in that era.<p>Hot garbage!<p>&gt; bad&#x2F;corrupt the legal system must be.<p>Ah! So, slavery?')
