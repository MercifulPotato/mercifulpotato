That&#x27;s time-critical. Delays of any number of days are very bad. People will likely die because of this error.<p>This is safety-critical software. It should be stress tested and have sanity checks. It should be impossible for this to happen.<p>For something like this system, part of a track and trace system costing billions, to fail because of a file size error is just unbelievable.')
