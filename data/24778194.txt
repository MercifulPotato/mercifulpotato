Arch could be great for some people but an LTS will be more popular with other people.  For example in my case I use Intellij for work and it comes in a tar.gz file format that I can use and I can keep the old version around when updating. The only time I compiled things was when I modified stuff to add my own changes to open source software.<p>If you are gaming I think you should still use Windows or a console, even some will claim Proton works with most games the experience can be frustrating with many of the games that are claimed to work.')
