They were &#x27;00 era kids and I had fun exposing them to older tech.  Was not too notable.<p>Their fave was a turntable and that pile of great 12&quot; singles.<p>They hated, and I mean viscerally hated the old dial bell telephone proper!  Solid, well expressed hate, except for audio quality.  They noticed, unprompted.  Computers, games, etc...  all were just fun, no big.<p>For a couple years, I had an HP Palmtop in the car for road trips.  They played text adventure games on it.  One of the oldest would read and the group would decide what to do.  Wonder if they remember now?<p>One child is struggling with meth so I am raising another little one now.  The gap is much larger now too!  Can really feel it.<p>So far, she cannot read an analog clock.  We just discussed getting one too.  I will look around for a cool one with a continuous second hand and great markings.  (No marks can come later)<p>She LOVES VHS!<p>A neighbor sold an entire Disney VHS collection for 20 bucks.  I have a good VCR for capturing old family movies, so I bought it just on a lark, curious.<p>Papa, it does stuff, makes noises!<p>What is rewind?  I don&#x27;t like rewind papa.<p>Do I thank it for giving the movie back to me when it is all done?<p>I will be frank.  Some of this fun makes me feel old.  But, I sometimes feel young too!  Memories come back and it is real fun to explore things through her very different eyes.<p>I will also say the UX work is paying off in some respects.  I feel we are hobbling skilled users at times, but new ones have it very good in some respects too.<p>She is learning to read.  Very visually driven otherwise.  The icons, cues, flow makes basic sense to her and for the most part, she uses tech easily and fairly effectively for her age.  Desktop computer, iPad, Roku, and an analog radio see regular use.  Questions are about doing more, not so much how.<p>Yeah, a ramble.  Well, maybe this was more fun than current events.')
