I tried to contribute to this, but it&#x27;s impossible to build without the webrtc binary and the docs are deliberately opaque about going about building your own version of the binary. You are encouraged to pay the (almost sole) contributor of this repo for his build of webrtc. For this reason it&#x27;s not really surprising that this version is both quite out of sync with the mainline OBS and also has only one or two contributors. Fortunately, for me, most plugins built with the mainline OBS do work with this.<p>I get that the maintainer has put a lot of work into this and wants to try and monetize some part which is hard when OBS is GPL, but depending on a binary which is nigh-on impossible to build and then charging for it on your website just feels a bit of a shitty way to do it.')
