Item(by='chris11', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609961366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25658948, text='&gt; but the kind of people who excel in each type of role will have very different personalities and skillsets. Grading them on the same curve in interviews seems like a pretty bad idea.<p>I haven&#x27;t interviewed for senior level positions with FANG. But aren&#x27;t interviews usually different based on the job? I assume that interviews for job families like front end&#x2F;backend&#x2F;sre should all test different skills. And if you are interviewing with a specific team the manager can judge your background and interviews for fit with their team. The interview bar for algorithms is probably too high at some places, but those skills are relevant for all engineers.')
