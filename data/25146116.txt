Otherwise, the far end of the curve is the performance level you&#x27;d have to artificially limit the device to in order to avoid any change in performance over time. The phone was defective before the update was shipped as it didn&#x27;t appropriately account for this normal battery degradation curve.<p>Apple was basically giving you more performance than you paid for, for free, early on -- not stealing your performance down the line.<p>The only time you should be told your battery is defective is if it reaches the 80% mark in less than 2 years or 1000 charge cycles along the defined anticipated performance curve. I do agree, however, that a battery replacement should be available at a fair price to those who want one.')
