Item(by='neilparikh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611809259, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25938278, text='&quot;Ch*nk flu&quot; is clear racial slur. The rest of list is based on stereotypes of Chinese people. The key thing is that regular Chinese people aren&#x27;t even responsible for the virus or the censorship (the censorship was done by Biden, a noted non-Chinese person), so targeting them seems misplaced and clearly racist.<p>&gt; It is part for the course of what I see on the site.<p>Well yes, if a site is full of racism, a comment with racism in it is &quot;par for the course&quot;.<p>Edit: To reply to your second paragraph that you added after I posted my comment:<p>Yes, I understand where they&#x27;re coming from, and that they feel like US is under attack. However, it should obvious to anyone that China isn&#x27;t governed by the average Chinese person; it&#x27;s governed by the CCP. By choosing to insult and make fun of the average Chinese person, they&#x27;re clearly engaging in mean-spirited racism (which has lead to increased racial violence against Asians), and that has to be condemned as the racism it is.')
