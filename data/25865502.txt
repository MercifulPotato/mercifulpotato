This does not remind me of the database groupby operation, but rather of partition, like in SRFI-1. I mean in natural language it is clear to me, why they&#x27;d name it groupby, but in programming terms I think partition is more appropriate, as groupby is already &quot;blocked&quot; by the database operation.<p>Often one only needs one of the partitions though, which is when filter is sufficient. Otherwise I guess one can easily write partition oneself and then use that function over and over again, without resorting to a library.<p>But perhaps it is a good example, so that you do not have to write partition in every project and if the additional dependency is OK to have, why not, if it is indeed a good one.')
