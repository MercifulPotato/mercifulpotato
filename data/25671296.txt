A microcontroller is used for that critical function.<p>If this is the case, then this would make the reliability much  better and there is a chance it could be useful to many places. If the SD card on the Pi dies (which, if they are logging the data to SD and not RAM, is a likely event), then they can have spare SDs available as part of the standard operating procedure. It&#x27;s not ideal, but so long as the main microcontroller is functioning, the display could be considered non-critical. Although, ICU staff might disagree...')
