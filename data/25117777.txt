Item(by='1vuio0pswjnm7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605565099, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25113396, text='Add to this that the original author recently posted a story about the origins of the youtube-dl script admitting it was designed to do:- download YouTube videos and name the downloaded files appropriately.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rg3.name&#x2F;202011071352.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rg3.name&#x2F;202011071352.html</a><p>Under DMCA, neither writing a script like youtube-dl nor using it is prohibited (making an unauthorised copy of a video could be fair use).FN1 Section 1201 however prohibits distributing the script to others.  Thus, the author of the script who &quot;releases&quot; (distributes) it is not necessarily the only one who might be violating the DMCA.  Any recipient of the script who distributes it further, e.g., Microsoft, could be violating the DMCA as well.<p>FN 1. Section 1201 prohibits distributing technology that is designed to circumvent either &quot;access controls&quot; and&#x2F;or &quot;copy controls&quot;.  Similarly, the act of circumventing &quot;access controls&quot; is prohibited.  However, the act of circumventing &quot;copy controls&quot; is not explicitly prohibited.  Making unauthorised copies, e.g., downloading YouTube videos, is subject to the defense of fair use.  It is arguable that youtube-dl is only designed to circumvent &quot;copy controls&quot;.  As others in the thread point out, there are generally no &quot;access controls&quot; on YouTube videos, e.g., password protection.  There could be exceptions.  If youtube-dl is designed to circumvent geographic or age restrictions, would those be considered &quot;access controls&quot;.<p>Aside from DMCA concerns, Google&#x27;s Terms of Service for YouTube would appear to prohibit use of youtube-dl:<p>&quot;The following restrictions apply to your use of the Service. You are not allowed to:<p>1. access, reproduce, download, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, alter, modify or otherwise use any part of the Service or any Content except: (a) as expressly authorized by the Service; or (b) with prior written permission from YouTube and, if applicable, the respective rights holders;<p>2. circumvent, disable, fraudulently engage with, or otherwise interfere with any part of the Service (or attempt to do any of these things), including security-related features or features that (a) prevent or restrict the copying or other use of Content or (b) limit the use of the Service or Content;<p>3. access the Service using any automated means (such as robots, botnets or scrapers) except (a) in the case of public search engines, in accordance with YouTube&#x27;s robots.txt file; or (b) with YouTube&#x27;s prior written permission;&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;static?template=terms" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;static?template=terms</a><p>Would these TOS be enforceable if challenged.  #1 makes no allowance for fair use.
