Rust&#x27;s advantages shine when it&#x27;s time to go low-level, but being without a GC is a disadvantage otherwise.<p>This application isn&#x27;t merely &#x27;performance-sensitive&#x27;, it&#x27;s a very particular form of performance - performance over network (I assume that&#x27;s the main bottleneck here). Better write in a ecosystem all-but-officially optimized for networked applications rather than lose developer productivity dealing with low-level stuff.')
