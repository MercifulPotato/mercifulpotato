Item(by='Tsiklon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608826381, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25528178, text='Brexit happened at the end of January past. The UK has left the European Union. From February through to the end of this year is a transition period to facilitate further discussions to sort out the state of the future relationship with the EU on Trade and other matters. For the transition period the UK remains aligned with the EU, and a part of the EU Customs Union.<p>There was a real fear of a cliff edge end of this transition period - this was the &quot;Hard Brexit&quot; scenario which I think you were referring to. This deal - if ratified by both parties - precludes this from occurring.<p>My issue with the procedure with which the UK has followed here is that there is very limited time to get this deal scrutinised by both Parliament and the Lords (and the EU Parliament on the other side). This is an enormous 2,000 page agreement which will form the basis of the future relationship the UK and all it&#x27;s industries have with it&#x27;s closest neighbour. It is precisely the sort of legislation that requires serious scrutiny.<p>Worse than that, all the businesses affected have a week to prepare for the changes required - This week has two bank holidays in it (these are functionally public holidays, for non UK people). This is going to be a challenge for everyone involved.')
