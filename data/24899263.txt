It looks like the course only plans to cover basic LL&#x2F;LR, which are admittedly the most commonly used parsers but more would be interesting. A fun one to include might be Might&#x27;s &quot;Parsing with Derivatives&quot;, which is algorithmically novel (though not very performant). I think there was a recent innovation on this: &quot;Parsing with Zippers&quot; at ICFP this year.<p>Hard agree that GLL is hard to follow. I&#x27;ve read the paper a number of times and struggle with it every time haha.')
