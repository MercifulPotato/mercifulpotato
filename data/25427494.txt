And you especially shouldn&#x27;t do this without good guarantees that system timers are indeed well behaved. Effectively, using a DLL and system timers instead of straight IRQs is a low level implementation detail, but that belongs either in the driver or in a very low level piece of code anyway (like JACK or some other audio daemon), not user applications. I was sort of throwing all of this together when I said hardware &quot;events&quot;; locking a DLL with a different time base to the playback hardware buffer pointer stats is still effectively that, and should be done, but only at a level low enough where you know it&#x27;ll work. Which definitely isn&#x27;t Android&#x27;s high level thread scheduling framework.')
