U-232 is much harder to separate out from the useful U-233 (which is the fissile fuel that Thorium is converted into) than Uranium 235 is from Uranium 238, so it is very hard to extract clean safe fissile material from a Thorium reactor.<p>This means that a Thorium reactor is really hard to get material from for a nuclear explosion. Any material you do extract is going to be screaming &quot;I&#x27;m over here&quot; to any nearby gamma ray detector, and will be dangerous to handle.<p>But if you just wanted to make a dirty bomb by blowing up a small Thorium nuclear plant with conventional explosives, spreading highly radioactive material all over the place, that sounds much more feasible.')
