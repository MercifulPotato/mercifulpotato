(Or, by my understanding, the CBOW mode of the FastText code.)<p>So all the reasoning in that issue for why Gensim didn&#x27;t want to make any change stands. Of course, if there&#x27;s an alternate mode that offers proven benefits, it&#x27;d be a welcome suggestion&#x2F;addition. (At this point, it&#x27;s possible that simply using the `cbow_mean=0` sum-rather-than-average mode, or a different starting `alpha`, matches any claimed benefits of koan_CBOW.)')
