This is an enormous difference.<p>Sure, it is a difference -- as in not identical. But what do you conclude from that difference?  That crimes that are less serious than this should be excused when committed as an act of protest but <i>these</i> crimes are different and should <i>not</i> be excused?<p>The assertion is that there is a double standard between these types of events. That some riots are excused and yesterday&#x27;s are not. You seem to be asserting that there isn&#x27;t a double standard because the events were <i>different</i> in the way that you described and so it sounds like you are saying the different treatment is <i>justified</i>.  No one is excusing yesterday&#x27;s rioters but you seem to be excusing previous incidents of rioting because they were <i>different</i>.')
