No one should use lazyio (or any library) for important work without checking the code or at least the docs to see if the code is intentionally bad (and renaming &quot;unsafeInterleaveIO&quot; to &quot;lazyIO.InterleaveIO&quot; is intentionally bad).<p>One of Haskell&#x27;s known weaknesses is that there are no curated catalogs of high quality libraries. The industrial strength stuff sits on package servers alongside the broken toys.<p>I once got an apology from a major luminary in Haskell, author of dozens of high quality packages, because I used a package he wrote that turned out to be an abandoned broken experiment, but not documented as such.')
