It would usually survive a couple of cycles of this then just be a black screen after login. Once in that state tricks to reboot the graphics driver did not work and reporting in speed working too, though the rest of the machine was up as services like IIS and file shares kept responding just fine.<p>My hacky solution is to run VM for most day-to-day work on that machine and remote to that, only using the bare metal when I need the fancy gfx card or otherwise the little bit of extra unpf gained by not having a virtualization layer in the mix.')
