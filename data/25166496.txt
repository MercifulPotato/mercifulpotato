I treat that as unit tests: run them all because even though I <i>think</i> only this is breaking, fixing it could have broken some other part.<p>Many other &quot;Jupyter killers&quot;, as sensationalist blog post titles call them, claim they have done away with Jupyter&#x27;s dirty &quot;hidden state&quot;, but reading further about how the &quot;Jupyter killer&quot; avoids re-doing heavy computation by &quot;caching&quot; compute-intensive results and you want to tell them &quot;get your mind right, which is it?&quot;.<p>The way we do it is schedule the notebook[0] to make <i>sure</i> everything works.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#long-running-notebooks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#long-running-notebooks</a>')
