I wanted to have my docker compose logs in separate tmux panes. I had a system where it would run the commands in the background, but then create several pipe files that each tmux pane would then read from. It didn&#x27;t work great though. At least in go, I struggled to get a system to open tmux panes in the order I wanted, in the windows I wanted.<p>I&#x27;m definitely gonna try this out and see if I can get it to play nicely with docker compose')
