Repeat. The buried carbon will release just ~3% back to the atmosphere in a decade. The sequestration potential of this technique alone is significant, of the kind of scale we need to tackle the issue. All of the fields of knowledge we need to execute on it (forestry, landfill, mining) are well-developed today.<p>Pretending it&#x27;s a problem with no existing solutions is a ploy to secure investments and diverts attention from action that could be taken today. But, of course, there&#x27;s no money in that.')
