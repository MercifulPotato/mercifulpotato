Odds are the only thing a human at corporate will ever see is &quot;Driver John Doe could not complete delivery, customer complained&quot; Unless purely by chance the same person just so happens to see the same issue with the same restaurant a few times, it&#x27;s very unlikely that they&#x27;ed notice a trend, nonetheless correctly deduce its cause. The person in charge of making sure deliveries get completed is almost certainly not the person handling restaurant partnerships.<p>Even if someone does eventually notice and takes corrective action, this is far from an optimal way to do it. Given that the server is acting like the drivers should just know that they wanted to be unlisted, it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the &quot;we told you before&quot; means all they did was tell drivers they wanted to opt out and never actually did the opt out procedure.')
