A guy flew from US to US (but is he a US citizen?). When it came time to leave the airport he showed a stollen ID. The airport staff didn&#x27;t let him leave (but didn&#x27;t arrest him?). He was then given the option to return (?) but refused since his place of origin has more Covid than the US (is there such a country?). Then people kind of let him be and he was able to eat simply base on the kindness of the few people using the airport for the passed 3 months.<p>I feel like I am missing a lot')
