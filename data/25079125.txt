I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s still true today, but there was a period last year where releasing decrypted L1 content without re-encoding meant sacrificing an NVIDIA Shield. The Shield was the only L1 capable player which had a known weakness and Widevine would revoke the device key based on the watermark in the bitstream.<p>Nowadays the piracy groups seem to have found a way around this. Presumably they found a way to strip the watermark, but we can only speculate as the groups guard their methods closely for obvious reasons.')
