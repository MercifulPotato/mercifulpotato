Item(by='acituan', descendants=None, kids=[25235735], score=None, time=1606540833, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25231384, text='&gt;  The article says &quot;roughly three-quarters of the Black employees&quot; left the company over a 6 month span due to feelings of being discriminated against. That isn&#x27;t an accusation. It is a fact.<p>I am not comfortable with promoting the framing of the article to an automatically established fact. The only solid fact here is people leaving and the <i>inferred</i> reason is <i>racial</i> discrimination. I am not saying this inference is likely to be wrong or not, but that it is nonetheless an inference and not a fact. The article also doesn&#x27;t let the reader know how those numbers compare to the baseline attrition of the company, i.e. what percentage of the other demographic groups have left in the same time period, which tends to be pretty high in the startup scene. Racial discrimination at workplace being pretty <i>seriously</i> illegal in the US these employees would have a strong recourse against it and NYT can not possibly provide a superior standard of factuality for those accusations.')
