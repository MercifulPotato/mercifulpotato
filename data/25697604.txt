The president quite literally  represents the states, not the people.  The US does not require that states assign electors by popular vote, states have <i>chosen</i> to do that. And in the past, they have chosen to do it other ways.  Before the civil war, there were states that selected electors without conducting a popular vote.<p>The way the US government is architected, the legislature <i>is</i> the extent of federal representative government.<p>6 of the 13 original states held a popular vote for president Washington.<p>But to respond to the bulk of your statement:  it was like airport security back when I was a kid, and I don’t see any reason why that wouldn’t also be appropriate on any other typical (i.e. not a special event) day.  Angry mobs <i>should</i> never make it to the building in the first place.  Crowd control happens outside of the building.')
