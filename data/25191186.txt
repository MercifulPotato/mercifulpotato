This is how you purge the weak and allow the strongest to survive. Whoever&#x27;s got the gumption, the grit, the fortitude, the courage, etc., will survive and whoever doesn&#x27;t... too bad.<p>The problem is, few people really have the stomach for this, because our modern world has become so comfortable. The beautiful thing is, the coming reckoning can&#x27;t be put off indefinitely. Eventually, the bill will come due and people will be made to pay up, whether they want to, or not.')
