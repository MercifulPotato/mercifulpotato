I think a lot of the kickback against apologising that we&#x27;re seeing is coming from the numerous public examples of this tactic and the follow-up where any good-faith apology will be used to make a further example of the heretic.<p>If you are dealing with this kind of thing then the tactic of take-cover and let the storm pass seems sane (pearls before swine etc).  But if you&#x27;re actually dealing with a genuine person or group who you&#x27;ve genuinely wronged then a real apology is warranted.<p>One other thing I&#x27;d add; if you have wronged someone and you&#x27;ve apologised and made genuine efforts to make amends.  While it is on the other person to decide whether or not they will accept&#x2F;forgive, it is not a requirement to indefinitely debase&#x2F;lower yourself in the pursuit of obtaining their forgiveness.  You can make efforts up to a point but you are not required to destroy yourself until they grant it.  If the situation is unsalvageable then that&#x27;s what it is.<p>For studys sake on how this can get out of control, there are numerous examples of shitty parents holding a past wrong over a childs head indefinitely in the raised-by-narcissists subreddit which illustrate the tactic in use by malicious types there.')
