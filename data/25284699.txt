If you look up &quot;長文失礼しました。&quot;, which literally means &quot;Excuse me for the long writeup&quot;, it&#x27;s usually appended to say a comment in a blog, or sometimes at the end of a Tweet when the speaker felt what they said is a bit on the longer side.<p>I somehow ended up picking up that habit somewhere down the line it seems. :)')
