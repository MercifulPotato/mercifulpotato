But it&#x27;s enshrined in law, both EU and US, that other manufactuers can make compatible replacement parts for cars. A manufactuer doesn&#x27;t get to say what parts you can put in your car after you bought it. You don&#x27;t have to buy genuiene OEM volkswagen brake pads or clutches - you can buy and install 3rd party ones, and legally Volkswagen cannot forbid you from doing so, and neither can they forbid anyone from manufacturing those replacement parts.')
