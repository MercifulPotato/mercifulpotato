I read the book and tried its techniques when I was young.<p>Interestingly, I started doing spaced repetition more recently (2 years ago), and I found it more effective than the method of loci or anything else in his book. Yes, I may remember things using the method of loci days, or even months later, but usually not longer than that. Spaced repetition is a system that <i>forces</i> you to recall things later. Probably one could couple the two, though. Maybe if a SR system forced me to recall something I learned with the method of loci, I would claim the latter to be effective.<p>I really did like the &quot;phonetic alphabet&quot; method in his book, though. I use it occasionally to remember things for the short-medium term.')
