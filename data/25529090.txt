The 5GB iPod cost about four weeks pay, was so far ahead of any other option.  I could almost fit my entire music library onto it!<p>I was a staunch PC+Windows supporter who thought Apple was dumb.  The iPod was the only Apple product I owned, but it was obviously the best music player.  There was no competition in my mind.<p>Unnecessary nostalgia: the original iPod was Firewire only, so I had to buy a PCI card to be able to plug it in to my PC.  The first iPod came out before iTunes was ported to Windows, so the official solution for Windows users was MusicMatch Jukebox with a shitty iPod plugin.  Eventually I discovered EphPod, an excellent third-party software, which I used for the life of my iPod.')
