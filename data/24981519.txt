There&#x27;s always a rush to post stuff like links to new movie trailers &quot;first&quot; on Reddit, so as to get the most fake internet points.<p>I guessed that the trailer would probably get added to the Star Wars YouTube page at around the same time it aired on TV, so I wrote a script to scrape the YouTube page every few seconds, and if a new video was added, submit the link to one of the big subreddits.<p>Sure enough, my hunch was correct, and  my submission of the trailer on YouTube wound up being the first. The upvotes and comments poured in, skyrocketing the post briefly to the #1 link on Reddit&#x27;s front page. This felt pretty cool and resulted in several thousand post karma. I didn&#x27;t use the program after that, having satisfied my curiosity as to whether or not it would actually work. But it did make me think about just how easy it is to farm karma on Reddit, and how useless it is as a proxy for &quot;trust&quot; or &quot;reputation&quot; or anything other than what it is - fake internet points.')
