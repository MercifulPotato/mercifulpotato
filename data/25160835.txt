(<i>CORRECTION: there is apparently a code version that disambiguates these and others.  See comments. That means this probably would be a candidate font for me, except:</i>)<p>I finally just paid for Pragmata Pro, and haven&#x27;t regretted it. The unicode support is incomparable, and for someone who lives in emacs and console, support for things like the Powerline glyphs and the option to use Emacs&#x27; prettify-symbols mode means an awesome user experience.<p>I actually like ligatures when reading code, less so when writing.  The thing I like about prettify-symbols and a font like pragmata pro is that I can toggle between strict representation and a cleaned up version with things like the below replacements:<p><pre><code>  (defun aja&#x2F;pretty-symbol-push-default ()\n    (push &#x27;(&quot;!=&quot;      . ?≠) prettify-symbols-alist)\n    (push &#x27;(&quot;&lt;=&quot;      . ?≤) prettify-symbols-alist)\n    (push &#x27;(&quot;&gt;=&quot;      . ?≥) prettify-symbols-alist)\n    (push &#x27;(&quot;=&gt;&quot;      . ?⇒) prettify-symbols-alist)\n    (push &#x27;(&quot;-&gt;&quot;      . ?→) prettify-symbols-alist)\n    (push &#x27;(&quot;lambda&quot;  . ?λ)prettify-symbols-alist))</code></pre>')
