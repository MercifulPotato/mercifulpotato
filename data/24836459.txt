Those same mechanisms which help organizing big code bases written by big teams often increase friction in smaller codebases and teams.<p>In C one has to be very disciplined about this type of stuff and needs to put much more thought into module API design (for instance to enforce memory management rules), because the language itself is extremely &quot;freestyle&quot;.')
