They are mere translators and that bootcamps basically just teach you these frameworks that make you a translator between `input -&gt; system -&gt; output`, a job that&#x27;ll be replaced to some extent by AI in the future. He also compared CRUD devs to those who wrote news by hand before the printing press.<p>How correct are these opinions? My recent work includes a large Django project with multiple components for an SaaS I&#x27;m building and that got me thinking, is this even real coding? Idk Geohot took a toll on me I suppose. I mean I&#x27;m not particularly restricted to a framework per se, I just like to use whatever the right tool&#x2F;technology is to get an objective done.<p>Either way, would love to have some opinions flowing.')
