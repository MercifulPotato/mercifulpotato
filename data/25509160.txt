I have used this exact word when trying to reconcile how scrum works. Some tickets are so detailed on acceptance criteria that if something is then missing I don’t feel like I have the agency to deal with it my self. I’ve used the analogy of fitting a kitchen, if everything is spec’d to super high detail and then it simply says “a cooler” no one in their right mind would just grab a cooker, they would ask the home owner&#x2F;client what cooker they want.')
