First, courts decide that not reading or not understanding a contract is not an excuse. Then, companies just start having their customers agree to ridiculous terms. So courts try and fix it by partially restricting those &#x27;agreements.&#x27; &quot;Okay, so you&#x27;re allowed to waive the right to sue for negligence, but you can&#x27;t waive the right to sue for gross negligence.&quot; It&#x27;s a situation where companies can basically get customers to waive every right they have right up until a fuzzy &quot;unconscionable&quot; line.
