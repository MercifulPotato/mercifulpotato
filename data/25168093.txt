I don’t really know what all else competes w&#x2F; it because in my view nothing has really toppled it since its introduction.<p>Pop_OS! is impressive, as is elementaryOS but Ubuntu tends to be their &amp; many others base.<p>Linux distros need to think in layers in regards to users &amp; either ramp up or ramp down the level of complexity better. This idea of one size fits all is dumb, make some difficult decisions &amp; create an OS that caters to at least 2 or 3 different type of users &amp; I think Linux distros could compete a lot easier.<p>Instead we waste our time talking of merits of one approach vs another. We can walk &amp; chew gum at the same time, it’s not about the approach as much as just recognizing where people are at &amp; meeting them there.')
