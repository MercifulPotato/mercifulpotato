We need actual discourse and understanding, or all we&#x27;re going to get is more us-vs-them polarization and ramping up of rhetoric and violence.<p>I strongly disagree with most of the opinions being voiced on the (far) right, but if they don&#x27;t happen in the open they will fester into something grotesque and far more dangerous. Just because I&#x27;m disgusted by the opinions of a group of people doesn&#x27;t it&#x27;s a good idea for me to make the situation worse by silencing them. Not least of all because we will eventually reap what we&#x27;ve sowed once they grab power again.<p>I still can&#x27;t help but shake the feeling that there are those with a real vested interest in a continuing and growing divide (and conquering) of the populace, regardless of the (externalized) cost.')
