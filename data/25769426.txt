The &quot;niceness&quot; is mostly a facade - a lot of the people in the Rust community are extremely passive-aggressive and back-stabby. OTOH, I&#x27;ve contributed to a lot of &quot;rude&quot; projects where they&#x27;ll treat you with respect and won&#x27;t try to pull weird bullshit if you actually come in to make a contribution rather than to do political activism or something.<p>Even if you&#x27;ve never had to interact with them, it&#x27;s easy to see that social signaling is more important to the rust community than doing good work. Last time I was in the Rust discord, their channel logo was literally the rust logo over a the gay flag with lines for black and brown people added. Wtf?<p>I&#x27;ve submitted probably &gt;100kloc to various open source projects over my career, and the weird politicking and immature behavior of the Rust community soured me on contributing to the Rust ecosystem almost immediately.')
