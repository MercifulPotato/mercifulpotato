I think you&#x27;re not appreciating Google&#x27;s ranking algorithms lending a hand to the popularity of SEO. Their rankings are certainly not objective.<p>As for &quot;far too valuable of a piece of real estate&quot;... I feel like that&#x27;s an unimaginative view trapped in the commercial state that we&#x27;re in. Perhaps if Google had beat Wikipedia to online encyclopedias, but had pumped theirs with ads, we&#x27;d be saying the same thing about the far too valuable real estate of online information.')
