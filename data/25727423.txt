The reason people are getting banned from these platforms and services isn&#x27;t because of just run of the mill political views. They&#x27;re getting banned because they are hosting content calling for the violent overthrow of the US government. Apple didn&#x27;t ban Parler from the app store for their attitude towards capital gains tax, they banned them because they found<p>&gt; direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action<p>The reason people are being banned now isn&#x27;t some sudden decision by publicly traded companies to try and endorse a left wing agenda. It&#x27;s because there&#x27;s been a massive uptick in the number of people advocating violence as a means of advancing their political agenda.<p>People keep acting as if these actions are being taken in the context of the 2008 election where everyone was pretty much civil and there was no real question of violence. In that context, yes, it&#x27;s an outrage that liberties are being crushed. But that&#x27;s not the context of today. Today we have people openly talking about murdering democratic (and somewhat bizarrely, insufficiently local republican) politicians, and credible evidence they plan to carry out those attacks.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t that those people are being censored, the issue is they exist in the first place.')
