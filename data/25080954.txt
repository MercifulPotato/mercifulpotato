If you knew you had a communicable disease that other people might have caught from you, and be spreading it themselves, and some people dying, and you get asked &quot;who might you have spread this to&quot; you&#x27;d refuse to answer on privacy grounds.<p>Would you even call them yourself to tell them you might have infected them? I guess if you&#x27;d been to somewhere that you didn&#x27;t know everyone, you&#x27;d just have to take that as an unavoidable sacrifice they&#x27;re making for your privacy.')
