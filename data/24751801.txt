I commented a few weeks ago on how it&#x27;d be nice to have a git CLI that actually helps you find the command you&#x27;re looking for because you don&#x27;t really know what to search for unless you know what command to use with git. It&#x27;s sort of this chicken-and-egg problem that this seems to help solve.')
