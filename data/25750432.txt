I&#x27;ll note some of the summaries of the various specific cases that were dismissed due to lack of evidence:<p>- Arizona, Bowyer v. Ducey\n: The judge ruled that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing; their fraud allegations were vague and implausible, and their evidence was unreliable or irrelevant. The judge singled out the fraud allegations being put forth, writing that they &quot;fail in their particularity and plausibility&quot;. The judge ruled that there would be &quot;extreme, and entirely unprecedented&quot; harm to Arizona&#x27;s 3+ million voters to entertain the lawsuit &quot;at this late date&quot;.<p>- Arizona, Ward v. Jackson: Arizona Supreme Court rejected her appeal, concluding that Ward presented no evidence of misconduct<p>- Georgia: The judge ruled that no evidence had been produced that the ballots were late<p>- Georgia: The judge stated that Wood failed to show that he had been harmed, while his proposal would &quot;harm the public in countless ways&quot;. The Trump-appointed judge concluded that there was &quot;no basis in fact or in law&quot; to stop Georgia&#x27;s certification of its election results (in which Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump) at such a late stage, as this would &quot;breed confusion and potential disenfranchisement&quot;<p>- Michigan: Chief Judge Timothy Kenny denied the motion for injunctive relief on November 6, finding that the plaintiffs did &quot;not offer any affidavits or specific eyewitness evidence to substantiate their assertions ... Plaintiffs&#x27; allegation is mere speculation. Plaintiffs&#x27; pleadings do not set forth a cause of action.&quot; The judge noted that &quot;sinister, fraudulent motives&quot; were alleged, but that the &quot;plaintiffs&#x27; interpretation of events is incorrect and not credible&quot;.<p>- Minnesota: The court&#x27;s decision to dismiss was based partly on the grounds that petitioners should have filed suit earlier. &quot;Given the undisputed public record regarding the suspension of the witness requirement for absentee and mail ballots, petitioners had a duty to act well before November 3, 2020,&quot; the ruling states. It goes on to say that &quot;asserting these claims 2 months after voting started, 3 weeks after voting ended, and less than 24 hours before the State Canvassing Board met to certify the election results is unreasonable.&quot; (Read as: If this was a concern over the law, it should have been filed pre-election, This was only filed because they lost)<p>- Pennsylvania: The plaintiffs appealed the decision of the board to count over 2,200 ballots that lacked a date or voter address, or were not sealed with secrecy sleeves, claiming the votes are invalid. The lawyers for the Trump campaign have signed an agreement that they &quot;do not allege, and there is no evidence of, any fraud in connection with the challenged ballots.&quot; They also declared that they were not alleging votes from dead people, &quot;misconduct&quot;, or &quot;impropriety&quot; related to those ballots, and had no evidence of such happenings.<p>- Pennsylvania: The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled 5â€“2 on November 17 against the Trump campaign, saying Pennsylvania law requires only that observers must be allowed in the room where ballots are counted but does not set a minimum distance between them and the counting tables; local county officials are left to decide.<p>- Pennsylvania: Judge Matthew W. Brann dismissed the case with prejudice on November 21, citing &quot;strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations&quot;, noting that &quot;[i]n the United States of America, this cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a single voter, let alone all the voters of its sixth most populated state ... [o]ur people, laws and institutions demand more&quot;.<p>Need I continue?<p>&gt; two of the justices<p>The same two justices noted that the the relief being requested by the trump campaign weren&#x27;t possible, so it wouldn&#x27;t matter anyway.')
