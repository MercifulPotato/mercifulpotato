The documentation is hard to use, and nearly non existent for F#. I looked at it before I started digging into Ocaml. I interact with Linux far more than anything else, I think Ocaml is just going to be more useful to me, more often.<p>I really admire Don Syme though. He&#x27;s one of the most intelligent people in software, by my reckoning. Literally a brilliant genius in a field littered with mediocre hacks that work real hard to ship things. He&#x27;s a real legend.<p>Thanks for the suggestion though. Maybe some folks will come across it for the first time now. It&#x27;s a well designed syntax, and has some really interesting features. Units of Measure in particular is a really cool thing I&#x27;ve needed before, I usually just use data classes and decorators in python to do a lookup, and just pay the performance penalty. It&#x27;s neat to have that info at compile time for free.')
