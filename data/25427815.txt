And not only did it take said service down globally, it also impacted dozens of other services...globally.<p>A good infra architecture has the “blast radius” of any issue confined to only part of your infra fleet. Avoiding the global outage.<p>Think of it like a navy ship. When a mussel breaches the hull, the ship is designed to contain the leak in a single section. Avoiding the entire ship sinking. Similar pattern is desired in your service and compute infrastructure.<p>The outage google just faced is equivalent to a single missel taking down an entire navy fleet.')
