I would like to say, though, that if I&#x27;d made a list of essential kit, I would have included a sauté pan; it&#x27;s like a frying pan, but deeper and with vertical sides and usually with a (transparent) lid. You can cook great meals in a sauté pan - do your onions&#x2F;spices&#x2F;garlic etc, then add meat (if that&#x27;s your thing), then stock, pasatta (or whatever) and then the bulking stuff - pasta etc - and all on the hob, rather than in an oven. Really versatile bit of kit.')
