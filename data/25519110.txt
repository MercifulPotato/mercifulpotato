In theory that’s true (since the brain barrier is actively pumping it back out and there’s gotta be a limit to that rejection), but I don’t think it’s worked out in practice other than causing massive constipation.<p>The article touches on this:<p>&gt;  In future studies it has to be explored, for example, how loperamide can be transported into the brain and cross the blood-brain barrier.\n&gt; Nanoparticles might be a feasible option.<p>But it remains to be seen what  opiate-like effects it would have on the brain if it got through.<p>For a short-term treatment, this could be managed&#x2F;mitigated. Mechanically (this machine will breathe for you while we knock out your drive to breathe) or chemically: an opiate-antagonist (naloxone infusion or naltrexone tablets). Whether this would counteract the effect of loperamide remains to be seen.<p>I also wonder what made loperamide special or if opiates in general would have the same effect. It would be interesting to see if long-term opiate users get this particular tumour less.')
