Thanks for the link.<p>Eyeballing the graphs, looks like we need maybe an average of 25GW for the 16 hours of low solar output, for 400GWh. If batteries don&#x27;t increase in price and the grandparent&#x27;s prices are right ($200M&#x2F;GWh, ignoring the prediction of it halving), that&#x27;s $80Bn of storage. The proposed mininuclear is a bit over £4Bn[0]&#x2F;GW, so £100Bn to get 25GW.<p>Seems like storage wins if you don&#x27;t consider cloudy days (bad for solar), maintenance&#x2F;operations cost (I assume much lower for batteries+solar than nuclear), or replacement times. (I&#x27;m guessing nuclear plants last longer than storage.)<p>I&#x27;m a little surprised how little wind is being used in California. It&#x27;s worth noting that wind actually picks up slightly when solar drops, but not as severely, judging from the graphs.<p>[0] I hate that some of our units are £ and some $, but I&#x27;m going to pretend they&#x27;re equal. That unfairly helps nuclear in the calculations.')
