Item(by='bookofjoe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608121295, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25440889, text='Back when I was still practicing as an anesthesiologist (1977-2015) I had a pack of 3x5 cards I carried in my scrubs pocket on each of which was an exhaustively detailed list I&#x27;d made of EVERYTHING I needed at hand to perform specialized procedures such as inserting an arterial line (putting a #20g plastic catheter through the skin on the inside of the wrist into the radial artery for direct beat-to-beat monitoring of arterial blood pressure, a measurement employed for seriously ill or unstable patients). I would assemble a tray with the following items in the OR before going to ICUs or the ER because invariably one or more of the items I would need would not be present and would take time to procure.<p>For example:<p>ARTERIAL LINE<p>• several sterile alcohol skin wipes\n• 3cc syringe with 25g needle [for skin infiltration of local \n   anesthetic at puncture site]\n• bottle of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine 1&#x2F;1000\n• 2x2 cotton gauze pads to use for pressure on failed \n   puncture sites\n• 3 #20 gauge plastic catheters (22 gauge for small children)\n• 2 surgical towels to drape over hand and lower arm to \n  absorb blood that accompanied successful arterial puncture\n• size 7.5 sterile surgical gloves for me to wear while \n  performing procedure\n• specialized 1&quot; waterproof plastic skin tape to secure and \n  protect catheter in situ<p>I was constantly amazed by how my colleagues would have to stop and wait for something not present in the unit they were called to.\nConversely, when I was called because of an inability to insert an A-line, as they were referred to, and wasn&#x27;t in a place where I could assemble my desired materials, I&#x27;d proceed with the materials at hand, all the while thinking &quot;this could have been done a lot better....&quot;')
