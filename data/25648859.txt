Which, by the way, get enforced all the time.<p>The only reason piracy isn&#x27;t enforced is because it&#x27;s largely a civil, as opposed to a criminal matter, which constrains the tools available to copyright holders to go after pirates. Criminal investigations, in comparison, are not hamstrung the way that Warner Brothers going after someone downloading The Matrix is.<p>You significantly overestimate the financial incentives for building special purpose hardware solely for the purpose of participating in a criminal economy. That would be trivial for the police to shut down, because hardware manufacturers have a very conspicuous physical presence.<p>There&#x27;s a reason nobody sells &#x27;piracy-solutions-in-a-box&#x27;. It&#x27;s because you need factories to build those, and you can&#x27;t exactly own a factory in secret.')
