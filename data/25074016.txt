Python is at least easy to read. Its major deficiency is the lack of annotation of parameters, and that&#x27;s something that could now be fixed... but it isn&#x27;t going to be fixed in that much historical code.<p>It you are trying to get <i>performance</i> out of it (which doesn&#x27;t really hinge on whether it&#x27;s a million lines of code), then Python might be the wrong choice. But you can always write it in Rust or C and give Python an API to the functionality.<p>I agree that packaging is a mess. Fixing that mess with modularization in Java took a long time, and most other languages have that problem, too.')
