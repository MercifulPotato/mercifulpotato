They know the license allows this. They were complaining from a place of asking for a little respect and acknowledgement.<p>AWS has appeared to be doing a better job recently (from what I can see) in that regard. It&#x27;s all around good PR. They lose nothing by thanking the maintainer&#x2F;community for the work, even though the license doesn&#x27;t require this. On the other-hand they build good-will.<p>Given the AWS response linked above, it would appear AWS recognizes this, and so maybe they will better accredit the work.')
