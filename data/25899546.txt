We obviously do not have enough data yet to understand the vaccine&#x27;s efficacy against these new strains but a lot of scientists are saying it will be &quot;good enough&quot; while we work on vaccines to handle the variants.<p>If this thing can basically be treated no differently than the common cold once vaccinated by most people and in the outliers something a little worse there will be no popular support to continue draconian lock down measures.<p>The goal is to stop the bleeding. The patient is on the floor right now and haemorrhaging liters blood. We want to stabilize the patient and let them get on with their life as quickly as possible. We cannot let perfect be the enemy of &quot;Good Enough&quot; here.')
