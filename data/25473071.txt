After all, we have a lower limit of single atoms.  They have a radius of around 0.06 -&gt; 0.5 nm.  That&#x27;s not terribly far from the current state-of-the-art processes of 7nm.  Further, I doubt we&#x27;ll ever get to that level in the first place without some really clever engineering.  The issue to solve is electromagnetic radiation will induce currents in surrounding conductive material.<p>I really don&#x27;t know where the industry ends up going when we hit that brick wall.  Different materials?  More exotic CPU designs?<p>Who knows.')
