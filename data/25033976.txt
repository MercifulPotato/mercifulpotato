Doing A with bad form has a higher risk than doing B with average form, for pretty much any A or B you pick. I think deadlifts are a good beginner exercise, and can also serve you well in intermediate lifting for some time, but once the plates rack up, it&#x27;s better to put your attention elsewhere. I agree that having complex movements for absolute beginners is not a good entry point, but I don&#x27;t think anyone here is advocating for that.')
