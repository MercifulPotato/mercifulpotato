Most people discover there is a problem only when somebody comes up with a faster program. Then, your program you thought was fast <i>instantly</i> becomes slow.<p>So, in general it is best to just <i>assume</i> there is a problem, and that the program really ought to be running 2x or 10x faster. Then, discover why it isn&#x27;t, and what must be done to get it there. Often enough, having got to 2x, a new bottleneck is slowing it down, and you may start over and get out another 2x. And again.<p>Sometimes it is best to release your intermediate improvements, and space them out a ways; three 2x releases can be much better for your reputation than a single 8x release, and no more work.<p>Also, sometimes clearing a bottleneck (apparently) doesn&#x27;t end up helping, because you have just lurched from one bottleneck to another. Don&#x27;t be discouraged by this: it&#x27;s normal. You&#x27;re digging a ditch across an oxbow, and halfway doesn&#x27;t help anybody. You just need to keep digging. When you get there, the flow takes off, and you are a magician.')
