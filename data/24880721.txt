Blaming Chernobyl on inherent dangers of nuclear power feels a lot like blaming 9&#x2F;11 on skyscrapers. The USSR was absurdly reckless and incompetent. It wasn&#x27;t just some freak chance that everything went wrong, even the designers of the RBMK reactor knew that operating it in the way the operators did would be catastrophic. Any competent reactor operator should have understood why the power level dropped so much at Chernobyl and should have understood why just removing the control rods was such a terrible idea to &quot;fix&quot; it.')
