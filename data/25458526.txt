It is a classic result from the dynamic systems that  improving the feedback in a given system  may lead to  destabilization of the system. Somehow it is lost on the proponents of Lean&#x2F;JIT&#x2F;etc.<p>It is interesting how it has similarity with software development - several years ago i worked on a project that was being done under total Lean&#x2F;Agile&#x2F;Scrum regime. Scrum forces significant lead times into the upstream&#x2F;downstream components chain(graph) like in a supply chain. As a result the whole  upstream&#x2F;downstream components graph relationship on that project got extremely slow (a sprint wait to get new upstream component version, try to use it in this sprint and fail because of bugs, file the bugs,  the bugs get fixed the next sprint at best, while other components trying to move forward in their development ) and ultimately completely broke down after about 2 years to the point where the product couldn&#x27;t even be built as not just functionality (the functionality got really lost months before that), the interfaces got completely out-of-wack without any chance of reconciliation in the setting of that process, and the product was quietly canceled soon as a result.')
