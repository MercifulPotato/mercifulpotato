For example, I will have a .github folder I&#x27;ll need for CI&#x2F;CD workflows used across the monorepo. This is sort of becoming my go-to tool for devops things in addition to deployment.<p>Are there other repo-maintenance type folders I should be thinking about that you specifically have in mind?<p>Did you mean to start a tree one directory removed from root so that the root has only a sparse set? What I mean to say is for your pkg&#x2F; example, have all services &#x2F; apps leap off that folder rather than root?<p>If you have any feedback on issue management as I mentioned in my other replies, also happy to take any feedback.')
