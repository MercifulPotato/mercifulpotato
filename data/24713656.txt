Again I don&#x27;t advocate for them, and find them to be of the most repugnant probably more so than QAnon or ISIS, I am just pointing out the hypocrisy of taking a stance not on principal but on what one agrees with, which seems to be the norm now days.<p>So I implore those that read, ask yourself would you root for the removal of a Westboro Baptist Church member from their job and livelihood. If the answer is yes, then you have no argument against those that would do the same to LGTBQ or other protected classes.<p>It&#x27;s not a matter of what is considered right or repugnant it is a matter of principal that the practice will inevitably ensnare less than guilty people, it is in effect modern day, digital Salem Witch trials (without the hanging and burning), and I honestly do see how people have been so filter bubbled to not see that.')
