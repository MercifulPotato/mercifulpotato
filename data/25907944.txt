People don&#x27;t share their content on TV, it is very easy for TV censors to say &quot;no female nipple on screen, period&quot;.  For sure this becomes a problem on social media where there are plenty of reasons to share pictures with nudity (arts, breast feeding, etc), but not for movies&#x2F;tv shows.')
