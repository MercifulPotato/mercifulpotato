Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=[25868594], score=None, time=1611292419, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25868505, text='&gt; Taking a government grant of liability protection should come with obligations to the public.<p>Why? That&#x27;s a serious question.<p>The reason liability protections exist for information services is because information services <i>can&#x27;t exist</i> without them. It&#x27;s not possible for an information service provider to be strictly liable for what their users post while having anything like a reasonable quality of service or cost. Think 10 hour moderation queues to post on Instagram, which costs $15&#x2F;month, and requires using your driver&#x27;s license or other photo ID to sign up so they can forward libel suits to you.<p>Requiring strict liability on the part of information service providers will likely drastically <i>reduce</i> the amount of free speech. Because they&#x27;re going to aggressively take down&#x2F;reject anything that has the slightest possibility of them getting sued. They won&#x27;t suddenly morph into the town square because an unmoderated Internet town square is a filthy, ugly place that repels users and advertisers and hurts the bottom line.')
