It&#x27;s definitely a very different mode of storytelling to a lot of popular contemporary content for children.<p>The characters aren&#x27;t exactly pacifist, but they&#x27;re not superheroes. Their abilities are quite limited, and they have basic human needs. Overarching conflict is usually external, and often not something the characters can do much about.<p>The joys the characters experience are one of two kinds: the joy of relief (a problem is solved, the danger is past), and the joy of discovery (an eccentric character, a mysterious island, a magic hat). When conflict breaks out, it&#x27;s usually among children, and then it&#x27;s the children&#x27;s job to learn to resolve it peacefully.<p>I&#x27;m sure the books aren&#x27;t entirely 100% unproblematic, but compared to a lot of popular children&#x27;s writing today they are quite unique. Tove Jansson&#x27;s biography makes them even more relevant and humane.')
