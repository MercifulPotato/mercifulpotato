QM tells us systems can be in superposition of energy eigenstates, and we&#x27;d like to know what happens to the gravitational field in such cases. For that, we need a quantum theory of gravity.<p>We have some recipes to go from a classical to a quantum field theory, but they fail for general relativity. For example, GR is not perturbatively renormalizable: For electromagnetism, we only need to determine a finite number of parameters experimentally to (presumably) fix the theory at all energy scales. That doesn&#x27;t work for general relativity for technical reasons, and we&#x27;d have to measure an infinite number of parameters.<p>Then, there are a couple of conceptual problems, such as GR doing away with a fixed background spacetime, or the so-called problem of time. Different approaches to quantum gravity approach this in different ways (as far as I&#x27;m aware, the background normally gets fixed asymptotically in string theory - though don&#x27;t quote me on that one - whereas loop quantum gravity tackles the issue head on).')
