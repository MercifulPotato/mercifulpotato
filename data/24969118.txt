It&#x27;s about relationships, not &quot;facts.&quot; Someone who believes there is a conspiracy identifies as an outsider to it. The only question is whether they are an outsider to their relationships as well. Discussing a conspiracy theory is usually the same as trying to explain a break-up to the person on the receiving end where the more you explain, the less convincing or final it is, with the real risk of exposing yourself to backlash.<p>The necessary condition for a conspiracy theory is for someone to believe they are a victim, and that they are being actively disenfranchised by a group who doesn&#x27;t acknowledge it. Some are falsifiable, others not so much. Quite a few are even more true than they could ever conceive of.<p>The way I relate to the people I know whose lives are consumed by conspiracy theories is by setting clear personal boundaries for myself, so that when I inevitably diverge from their belief bubble, it&#x27;s not traumatic because it&#x27;s just outside the boundary on which we relate. I&#x27;d argue that if you want to deflect most conspiracy theories as a leader, professional, or even a manager, don&#x27;t be empathetic, be magnanimous.')
