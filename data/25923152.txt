There are plenty of sites that won&#x27;t show you anything.  I&#x27;ve taken the tact that there is more on the net than I could possibly view in a million lifetimes and just move on.  I could see some people taking exception here.  And yes, I don&#x27;t bother with google&#x27;s captcha, since if that shows up, it&#x27;ll most likely never work, even if you keep trying.  Some of the others will let you pass after one successful test.  I don&#x27;t find tor to be too slow though.')
