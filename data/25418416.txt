I don&#x27;t know if they are right (I want the OASIS as much as anyone but not from Facebook, unfortunately), but people who use Facebook probably don&#x27;t care all that much. And there&#x27;s no way they&#x27;d make their new social VR space work without a Facebook account (they allowed that on Instagram and now seem to be trying to set up a bunch of interoperability stuff for things like Messenger).')
