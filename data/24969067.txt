I&#x27;m not actually disagreeing with you, but you&#x27;re missing my point. I don&#x27;t mean to be rude, but you really appear to be suffering from man-with-a-hammer syndrome here. As I&#x27;ve already shown, what can be mechanically verified with a model checker has no bearing on a programmer&#x27;s ability to formally derive totally correct software. It would be extremely surprising if it were otherwise, since that would mean that one of the most fundamental theorems in computing science is incorrect.<p>&gt; Anyway, I encourage you to try to affordably write ordinary software in this way<p>I already stated in an earlier response that I&#x27;ve been doing this professionally. And I have been for over a decade.<p>Regarding the Shuttle, you&#x27;ll have to hit a library, the only online source I can find is Feynman&#x27;s minority report and it doesn&#x27;t go into great detail. It does however show how properly decomposing a complex system into component parts is necessary to keep it intellectually manageable. And bear in mind that while Feynman is best known as a physicist, he knew enough about computing science to write a book on it.')
