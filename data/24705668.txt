That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been doing as a step-up from Heroku and have been very happy with it.<p>My project currently runs on Digitalocean managed k8s and setting it up really wasn&#x27;t hard. I had everything already in containers for dev&#x2F;prod anyway, and having those run on k8s just meant I had to write the deployment manifests that pull the containers and setup the pods.<p>What I love about managed k8s (and also shared a couple times in comments on HN) is that it&#x27;s separated from the servers below. I can have 20 containers (that can be separate things all-together) running on the cheapest Droplet and would only pay whatever that droplet costs, so under $20. Then when I need more power, I just scale the Droplets used for the k8s cluster and my pods&#x2F;containers get shoveled around the available resources automatically.<p>I liked this approach so much that I now have a private &#x27;personal projects cluster&#x27; that runs on digitalocean with the cheapest&#x2F;weakest droplet avvailable, and whenver I have a small hobby project that needs to be hosted somewhere, I just add that container to the k8s cluster and be done with it.')
