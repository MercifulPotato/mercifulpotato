Allocation of free public space (car parking) to drivers, effectively subsidizing (disproportionately suburban) commuters at the expense of residents.<p>The times I&#x27;ve commuted into a city, I had to pay for parking, usually in a private lot. I suspect it&#x27;s like this in most big cities, and in smaller cities where people still commute, parking is probably private lots owned by the employer, not street parking. Picture a standard office park.<p>In places with free street parking (or public lots), I suspect the population is sparse enough that the added land cost for parting isn&#x27;t a big deal, most people have cars, and most people support having parking.')
