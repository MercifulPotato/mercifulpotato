I was giving cancer talks that made mention of it back when I worked in cancer bio, just about 16 years ago now. I didn&#x27;t come up with it, and it wasn&#x27;t new then. I used it in talks to laymen, to give a very abstract idea of how cancer worked. But it fell into the category of &quot;lies we tell children,&quot; because it was only true in the most abstract way, and utterly incorrect once you dug into any details.<p>The reason cancer bio people dislike it is because it&#x27;s only true at the 10,000-foot, highly abstracted level. When you start digging into the granular level, its testable predictions rank between &#x27;falsified&#x27; and &#x27;irrelevant&#x27;. It doesn&#x27;t produce any alternative lines for thinking about treatment, causality, etc. Especially given that the progress of a single cancer tends to be <i>all</i> about their interaction with the multicellular milieu - e.g., developing immune evasion, which isn&#x27;t at all an &quot;atavistic&quot; trait, although it&#x27;s one of the core hextad that defines malignant development. (On the contrary, it comes built-in for normal cells - they&#x27;re now developing a novel immune evasion, to hide their newly altered antigens from the immune system).<p>e.g., &quot;Cannot help but switch to previous single-celled metabolism&quot; doesn&#x27;t follow in any meaningful way from the thesis of atavistic traits. In fact, it doesn&#x27;t predict at all the relationship between tumor size, distance from vascular supply, and anaerobic metabolism. &quot;Cells without controlled growth will outgrow their vascular supply, requiring a transition to anerobic metabolism&quot; does, however, and predicted the relationships we see. It&#x27;s not &quot;cannot help but engage with less efficient metabolism&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;transition to relying on the only metabolism afforded to a highly-dysregulated cell that is not responsive to environmental signals that normally trigger or withhold growth.&quot; Normal unicellular organisms <i>are</i> responsive to those signals.<p>Yeah, I don&#x27;t hate it - it&#x27;s a cute metaphor. It&#x27;s a nice way of thinking of cancer at the 10K-foot level. It&#x27;s just also <i>wrong</i> at any closer level of inspection than that, which is why people whose job is to be elbow-deep in all of the nitty-gritty details of cancer can&#x27;t help but look at it and go &quot;please stop wasting my time.&quot;')
