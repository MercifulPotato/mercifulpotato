These areas are primarily mobile markets that would like to consume the same content we do. What might sound like small overhead (SYN-&gt;SYN-ACK) actually takes half a second. If your performance is measured in this way than N connections times half a second is a long time. And, on mobile networks, sometimes your TCP connection will drop even if there&#x27;s still data being sent back and forth (some times you can see latency spikes up to 3sec on really bad networks which causes most software to timeout since it thinks no data came in because of head-of-line blocking).<p>It&#x27;s a truely miserable experience that QUIC or HTTP&#x2F;3 can easily solve. Imagine how slow an `apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade` is and how much of that overhead can be dropped by connecting to 1 mirror a single time and bulk requesting 10 to 100 file transfers. This allows you to maximize your network throughput. Think instead of how slow this would be if you opened 10 to 100 connections each of which might take 500ms per startup. In the worst case that&#x27;s a 500ms penalty versus a 5 <i>second</i> penalty.')
