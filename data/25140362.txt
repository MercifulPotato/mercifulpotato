Look at how detailed the CDC guidance for restaurants is:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;community&#x2F;organizations&#x2F;business-employers&#x2F;bars-restaurants.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;community&#x2F;organiza...</a><p>This is not business as usual.<p>Also, the way restaurants are patronized in Seattle is different from Central Washington, at least that I have witnessed. In Seattle, I never see crowds of people clustered together, but I have elsewhere.<p><i>&gt; The hicks aren&#x27;t sick because they won&#x27;t wear their masks.</i><p>I haven&#x27;t characterized anyone a hick, but these people <i>are</i> spreading COVID more because they are not following the guidance:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;seattle-news&#x2F;health&#x2F;17-cases-two-covid-19-outbreaks-connected-to-washington-state-wedding-with-300-guests&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;seattle-news&#x2F;health&#x2F;17-cases-tw...</a><p><i>&gt; they&#x27;re doing the same exact thing as you, just more of it.</i><p>I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s necessary to clarify this, but yes, doing a more of a thing that carries non-zero risk is riskier. No one is arguing that Seattlites are at zero risk. Again, black-and-white thinking. The claim is that the way people in Seattle follow the guidelines has a lower total risk than the behavior of people elsewhere.<p><i>&gt; It hardly matters that your tables are spread out, or that you wore your mask while waiting for your reservation.</i><p>According to the CDC it does.<p><i>&gt; And I don&#x27;t see why you should attack people for not wanting to make sacrifices that you yourself refused to.</i><p>I haven&#x27;t stepped foot inside any building without wearing a mask the entire time since February. I haven&#x27;t gone to a restaurant or bar (indoors or outdoors) at all. To the best of my recollection, I can count the number of buildings I&#x27;ve been inside on one hand.<p>The most recent restrictions in Washington don&#x27;t affect me at all because I never loosened my behavior after the first wave in April. I&#x27;m going well above and beyond what&#x27;s necessary in order to reduce not just my risk but that of the people I come into contact with.<p>Meanwhile, jackasses are throwing parties and protesting wearing masks and making it worse for everyone.')
