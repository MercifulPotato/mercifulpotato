While sometimes we have policies that maximize one for the sake of the other, not all policies will. Some will maximize both, others will minimize both. The solution likely includes some policies that will make tradeoffs (e.g. like rent control), offset by other polices that maximize surplus at the cost of utility.<p>Yes, this means some policies will be working at cross purposes, but different people in our society will be impacted differently by those policies. (E.g. there are some folks for whom rent control means being able to live in their community at all).  So it might be best to not try to chart the most efficient course from the outside, and instead accept some inefficiencies if it means making positive moves <i>now</i>.')
