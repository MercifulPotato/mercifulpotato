It&#x27;s also how fast they can read&#x2F;understand the program code.<p>What are you doing? Speed reading? Even 2xing the reading time with verbosity is not a factor if lack of verbosity forces the reader to switch context multiple times in order to elucidate meaning.<p>&gt;Sure, we do that for software also - we document things outside of the code. For example in a wiki, a README.md or sometimes even just above the code as comment&#x2F;docs. But that&#x27;s not what I was talking about, right?<p>Major difference. In math it&#x27;s required. In programming it&#x27;s recommended and rarely done. When it is done, it&#x27;s rarely done in a form that&#x27;s as complete or as detailed as math. YOu get an outline at best. Programmers are expected to read code without documentation because program writers are too lazy to write documentation.<p>SO what I&#x27;m saying is put your documentation into the code itself. Self documenting code with readable names as opposed to elegant.<p>&gt;So you are fine if a developer does e.g. `c := (some super complex expression) &#x2F;&#x2F; find relevant customer` and then goes on to use just `c` everywhere in their code instead of `relevantCustomerBlaBlaBla`?<p>relevantCustomerMetric is way better than c everywhere. Autocomplete should alleviate the pain of typing. Not every programmer arrives at the variable where it was incepted so they can&#x27;t see the comment.<p>&gt;Also, mathematicians don&#x27;t always do that. Sometimes they just say &quot;let x be [insert complex equation]&quot;.
