Item(by='tabtab', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609259900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25563772, text='There&#x27;s been a lot of products that try, including MS&#x27;s current &quot;Power Apps&quot; and &quot;Power Automate&quot; utilities. But the problem is that lots of intricate business rules need to be understood and maintained longer term. RAD has had a problem with long-term maintainability of business rules. Instead, I&#x27;d like to see a focus on a stateful GUI markup standard so that it&#x27;s easier to do regular code-based CRUD apps without dealing with screwy web (un) standards, such as bloated JavaScript libraries and CSS wankiness. The UI is a bottleneck to CRUD dev productivity.')
