A lot of what I and my colleagues do is glue, sew and plumb things together.<p>I’ve never had to write a crazy algorithm. Nor have I had to do any graph traversal. Or anything that impacts performance.<p>For data analysis, pandas and numpy are plenty powerful. At no time in my career have I said “ditch all this because it’s too slow”.
