(I am happy none the less)<p>Muslims are currently vilified, and Pakistani isn&#x27;t in the best books right now. So, a little nod to someone who did good being muslim and pakistani-origin goes a long way to neutralize stereo types, without taking away the good work from anyone.<p>He studied at University of Peshawar. You know, the same Peshawar where OBL was found (edit: sorry, OBL was found in Abbotabad). Throwing some positive light there will help the millions (Pakistan is a very populous country) raise their self-worth.<p>And regarding erasing debt, you have to realize that it is not easy, especially when family is involved. There will be children who will have wanted to have that money for themselves, and slightly poorer relatives who would have said &quot;why not us first&quot;. So, helping strangers (well, client, but still not relatives or friends) should be applauded whenever it happens. Also, direct payments (or debt relief) is the best. No leak into admin expenses.')
