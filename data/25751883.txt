The most widespread bastion of closed source binary blobs left on the planet with no alternatives is cellular baseband firmware. Anyone breaking down those walls should be congratulated regardless of the reasons.<p>If you are interested in these things don&#x27;t be put off by the kneejerk comments here, it&#x27;s fertile land, there are devs who have worked for years on open source cellular modem software and poured significant money&#x2F;energy into such endeavours knowing they could never realistically get their work approved by regulators anywhere on Earth.<p>Have some links, honestly surprised many people in 2nd one haven&#x27;t been arrested. This is a highly regulated space and they&#x27;ve caused a tad bit of trouble over the years for simply trying to be free.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freecalypso.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freecalypso.org&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;osmocom.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;osmocom.org&#x2F;</a>')
