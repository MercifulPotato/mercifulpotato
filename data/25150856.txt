Something comparable to an Nvidia 3060 would be great.<p>The GPU in the M1 is perfectly good for the power targets it&#x27;s trying to hit.<p>Either fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your perspective, Apple is unlikely to be able to do with the GPU what they did with the CPU. That is, there&#x27;s no legacy in either Nvidia nor AMD&#x27;s GPUs that Apple can cut out to get wins. And similarly, neither Nvidia nor AMD slowed down their progress or is suffering from fab issues like Intel did &amp; is on the CPU side of things.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt Apple can hit an RTX 3060 level of performance, but they&#x27;ll get there with roughly similar to RTX 3060 level of power draw. Which means it ain&#x27;t fitting in a MacBook Air or MBP 13&quot;, either. And judging by the existing MBP 16&quot; cooling solution, not really going to go well in that chassis.')
