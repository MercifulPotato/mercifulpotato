You pick up the high quality goods and tools from Earth and ship them to Mars&#x2F;Moon. Since there is water on Mars&#x2F;Moon, you grow food, &#x27;wet&#x27; supplies, and unfinished goods in the weaker gravity well for shipment to the Belt. These arrive in the Belt and you repeat the process, profiting at every spaceport.<p>As the metropole has overwhelming manpower&#x2F;firepower due to it&#x27;s high class manufacturing base and population, the threat of violence is just plain bad for business all around and is discouraged.<p>Now I&#x27;m gong to speculate very hard: Eventually, the lesser manufacturing base (Moon&#x2F;Mars) will gain in economic and political power as their frontier life becomes more civilized and independent of the metropole. And they may try to <i>declare</i> independence fully. However, in the case of Moon&#x2F;Mars, you&#x27;re looking at a fully independent multi-generational extraterrestrial biospheres at that point and probably millions of people, if not 10s of millions, to run the whole thing. <i>Lots</i> of people that have never been to Earth and never plan on going. I really don&#x27;t see that much trade&#x2F;mining would be needed to go to Earth to build up and support permanently independent biospheres of a few generations of native Martians&#x2F;Moonies.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Triangular_trade" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Triangular_trade</a>')
