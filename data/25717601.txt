Now I&#x27;m feeling very uneasy about this (not yet posting from a throwaway, heheh).<p>It is my feeling the combined action to de-platform Trump including de-platforming Parler is foolish and very likely to escalate the tensions, not defuse them, e.g. increase the likelihood of Bad Things Happening That I Won&#x27;t Explicitly Detail Because I Don&#x27;t Want To Be De-Platformed For Writing About Stuff That Should Perfectly Obvious To People That Pay Attention To History.<p>Millions of people were moving onto Parler because TheDonald and a number of well known commentators told them to go there to avoid censorship. Subsequent to shutting Trump out of public social media over what could understandably be construed as a bogus rationale of censorship (especially if one believes the elections were fraudulent), BigTechBogeyPersons collude to shut everyone out of Trump&#x27;s replacement platform, (and potentially any future option). That&#x27;s what <i>literally</i> millions of American people perceive. My messaging is buzzing with non-tech people who are afraid the apocalypse is now and asking me what to do, what&#x27;s going to happen, etc. People are asking <i>me</i> what to do about it!<p>The blowback potential is off the charts. The chilling effect is over the top. There&#x27;s plenty of American people personally affected. They are frightened and&#x2F;or outraged by this outcome. Plenty of people who immigrated to the US from non-free countries have drawn conclusions from this that are quite different from the virtuous and self-righteous moralizing I see commonly proposed here on HN and by &quot;acceptable&quot; social media sources.<p>The commenter who suggested this would be perceived as a &quot;casus belli&quot; probably hit the nail on the head.')
