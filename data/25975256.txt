I mean, single person game is good and all, but that is arguably the worst performing for a cloud gaming because they are create with local hardware in mind.\nWhy isnt online multiplayer game takes more focus on these platform? Like those battle royale games. If they create it with cloud gaming in mind, a match can be just like local coop game, except you have a very long controller and HDMI cable(aka your internet).<p>Online multiplayer is the only category where cloud gaming have the potential to be better than traditional hardware, but they have to built the game with cloud gaming in mind, not just porting it')
