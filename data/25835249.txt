In the end, if you believe that the population at large has to be shielded from what is now a large volume and range of types of speech, it means that you implicitly don&#x27;t trust them to make the right choices on their own. And if you don&#x27;t trust them to do that, then it never was about democracy to begin with. If you consider opinions you disapprove of to be illegitimate in democratic terms but opinions you approve of to be the result of the proper process of the exchange of ideas, then you implicitly recognize that it is about technocratic management of that exchange of ideas and the influence of the population rather than the actual exchange among free individuals.<p>It has little to do with absolutes but actually the basic underlying concepts.
