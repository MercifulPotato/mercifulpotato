Item(by='fairity', descendants=None, kids=[25093962, 25093905], score=None, time=1605375073, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25093737, text='&gt; It just feels weird to take a short-term loan (whatever the interest rate) when I have the cash to cover the loan.  And if I donâ€™t have the cash to cover the margin loan, I should be working on increasing my emergency fund instead.<p>I see.  Would your thinking change if your emergency fund was sufficiently large but much smaller than your investable cash?<p>For example, let&#x27;s say your rainy day fund was $10, and you have $100.  You have $90 to invest.  In this case, the short-term loan you&#x27;re taking out could range from $0-270 (the majority of cases would not be covered by your rainy day fund).')
