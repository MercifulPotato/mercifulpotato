The &quot;ugly&quot; ad cost $11 to drive a webpage visit. Is this enough to result in a profitable conversion? I&#x27;m guessing almost certainly not.<p>So what does it matter if the &quot;ugly&quot; ad performs better? All that means is you go bankrupt slower. Is there room to improve the performance of the ugly ad so it wanders into the realm of profitability? I&#x27;m guessing there&#x27;s far less room than for the professional ad and, probably, there doesn&#x27;t exist a design that will drive profitability with the current offering and more focus should be made in customer development to discover and communicate a clear value prop rather than mess around with ad copy.')
