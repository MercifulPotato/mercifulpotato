For most people words are a truthful declaration of intents and ideas. But fascists often use words for a different purpose. They don&#x27;t use them in their common meanings, but rather as tools to inflame and to denigrate others.<p>Take use of the word &quot;socialism&quot; or &quot;nationalism.&quot; I&#x27;ve seen a disturbing tendency on the right to call anything they don&#x27;t like &quot;socialist.&quot; Nothing makes that clearer than Trump&#x27;s call to the Cuban expatriates in Florida to vote against the &quot;communist&quot; Joe Biden.<p>If you know anything about Biden&#x27;s policies you would recognize them as pretty standard Progressive policies. I have never once heard him discuss taking private property and distributing it as a public good. He&#x27;s not once talked about erasing private enterprise. He is manifestly not communist. So the only conclusion I can draw is that Trump is using &quot;communist&quot; to mean &quot;person you don&#x27;t like&quot; so he can fan the flames.<p>Given that, I don&#x27;t think we can take anything he says at face value. This is actually a common tendency on the right, and it&#x27;s why they&#x27;re so good at fanning the flames. They see what our words mean and they disregard that meaning.')
