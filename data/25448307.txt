Item(by='giantg2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608151366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25447967, text='It&#x27;s a valid concept, but the concept is already existing - infect a machine and have it blink a light or emit RF.<p>I guess it isn&#x27;t very interesting, for me, compared to passive side channel attacks (interpreting naturally generated RF).<p>&#x27;“this isn’t a complete attack by itself and is therefore uninteresting” seems myopic to me&#x27;<p>I think you are misunderstanding me. I do agree that how attacks are put together and coordinated is interesting. I just don&#x27;t see much to get excited about for this exploit. So viewing this from a larger perspective... Most of the time if you are attacking air gapped systems for data exfil, the physical site will have security countermeasures, especially for RF. I would be more interested to see an exploit that doesn&#x27;t use RF (at least not in the known data bands like wifi in this case) to rely data since RF is so scrutinized in the target setting.<p>So my position isn&#x27;t that I don&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s not a full attack, it&#x27;s that I don&#x27;t like it because the author is basically recycling old ideas and I view this idea, for the intended use (air gapped data exfil), to be lacking when evaluated from a systems thinking perspective. It&#x27;s like giving someone a knife and telling them to sneak into a secure facility with metal detectors to stab someone. Can it work? Sure, but probably not as well as other options. It isn&#x27;t very imaginative either.')
