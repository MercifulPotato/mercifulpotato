I have been using Macs since the Mac IIx, and my first Mac laptop was the Powerbook 190.<p>The only reason that I have my Mid 2018 Macbook Pro, is that I bought it in Budapest after my previous machine died, and the reseller Apple store was the only one that stocked English keycaps for the keyboard (they did have to unbox and change the keycaps).<p>My technology choices are starting to feel frustratingly niche. I am using Apple over Linux because I tired of having to mess around with the systems constantly to get things working.
