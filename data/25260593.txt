Item(by='ghshephard', descendants=None, kids=[25261929], score=None, time=1606780415, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25255668, text='I&#x27;m wondering why we <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> want to pip freeze every single dependency in the tree.  I&#x27;m looking at our requirements.txt, and everything is of the form:<p><pre><code>   vine==1.1.4\n   urllib3==1.25.10\n   wcwidth==0.1.7\n</code></pre>\nI know that changing the versions of any of the underlying libraries is always a big conversation.  (We&#x27;re still locked in on pandas==0.23.4)<p>So, if I understand correctly, with Poetry, we might be able to say, &quot;Keep Pandas at 0.23.4 and sqlalchemy at 1.2.7 but figure out all the other dependencies for us and load them.&quot;<p>Or, even better, &quot;Keep Pandas at 0.23.x and sqlalchemy at 1.x.x but figure out all the other dependencies for us and load them.&quot;<p>The advantage here is security patches in underlying libraries come for free, while we focus on porting code for the really high-level + important Libraries which aren&#x27;t always backwards compatible (Pandas)<p>Also - if we <i>want</i> to stick with specific versions, that&#x27;s also possible with the lockfile - so every library will be exactly the same as the one in a build that worked.<p>The thing I don&#x27;t understand - is when I do:<p><pre><code>   pip install pandas==0.23.4\n</code></pre>\nIt does load the dependencies.   Indeed, if I create a requirements.txt that just has:<p><pre><code>   pandas==1.0.3\n   pytz==2020.1\n   six==1.14.0\n</code></pre>\nThen pip install -r requirements.txt goes and does:<p><pre><code>   $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n   Collecting pandas==1.0.3\n     Using cached pandas-1.0.3-cp38-cp38-manylinux1_x86_64.whl \n   (10.0 MB)\n   Collecting pytz==2020.1\n     Using cached pytz-2020.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (510 kB)\n   Collecting six==1.14.0\n     Using cached six-1.14.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (10 kB)\n   Collecting python-dateutil&gt;=2.6.1\n     Using cached python_dateutil-2.8.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (227 \n   kB)\n   Collecting numpy&gt;=1.13.3\n     Using cached numpy-1.19.4-cp38-cp38-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl \n   (14.5 MB)\n   Installing collected packages: six, python-dateutil, pytz, \n   numpy, pandas\n   Successfully installed numpy-1.19.4 pandas-1.0.3 python- \n  dateutil-2.8.1 pytz-2020.1 six-1.14.0\n</code></pre>\nSo - I&#x27;m still at a loss of the advantage of poetry vs pip install, given that pip loads dependencies as well - the advantage of &quot;fuzzy specs&quot; seems minimal given it&#x27;s such a big deal to upgrade the big packages.')
