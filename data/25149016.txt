People unironically comparing F35 with Gripen. It&#x27;s a great piece of kit worth locking in now. But last few years of US commitment uncertainty meant countries are now refocusing on indigenous defense industries, military goals are important now. Every previous billion that goes into F35 from foreign purchases improves F35 competitiveness while depriving competitors and foreign indigenous efforts, which was fine if US is dependable, i.e. Japan complained about how little US provided tech transfers and cooperation in the joint F2 program. I imagine it&#x27;s in US interest to kill these upstart efforts or SAAB and Dessault when it comes to European procurement hence need for espionage. EU market size + existing industrial base could be a viable competitor to US MIC.')
