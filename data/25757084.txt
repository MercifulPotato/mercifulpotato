I&#x27;m on a team of damn good full-stack developers and the most senior ones (10-15 years) bill out around $150&#x2F;hr. I guarantee you we&#x27;re better than most SV consultants at what we do (though we are a small team). I&#x27;m in the US, but not SV, so that must make the difference, but people are really stupid to be over-paying by &quot;way more&quot; than 50% for quality that I guarantee is no better than average.')
