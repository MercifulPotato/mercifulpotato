Very seldom they mean the speed of compilation (though they sometimes do, in which case they almost always explicitly mention &quot;compilation&quot;).<p>When people talk about Typescript performance, they either mean Javascript performance or, more likely, the speed with which Typescript type-checks their code; the latter doesn&#x27;t happen in run time. That&#x27;s what the original commenter meant when they said &quot;you cannot run Typescript&quot;. It&#x27;s also what TFA means by &quot;performant&quot;.')
