This has given them some improvements to latency[1] and power usage[2] in the past but hurt them on yields. AMD has a chiplet design, which improves yields[3] and may allow a more modular approach as mentioned.<p>[1] can be overcome via caching and other considerations, but purely from this aspect the impact is this.\n[2] Longer traces lead to higher capacitance, and the power estimation formula P=C<i>(V^2)</i>f*a shows that this one aspect will change power use. Everything on one die means less parasitic capacitance. \n[3] If the defect density is the same, and if you have 10 errors per wafer, then you will see different yields if you make 10 vs 100 vs 1000 chips on that wafer. Chiplets are smaller than monolithic designs, so we can put more of them on one wafer which improves yield independent of process')
