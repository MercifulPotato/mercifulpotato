TeamCity’s merge after private build feature etc.<p>Ironically these days i see a big push to use git in a way that would work pretty well in svn too.<p>The biggest hassle with svn was long lived branches. Back then we encouraged devs to branch and then somehow smoosh it all back together (painful). Then we said ok do it more frequently in atomic commits (i liked that model) then DVCS took off largely in the open source world and now major dev houses (well i guess except google with p4 - but they do provide a git interface) all have come along for the ride.<p>Ironically with products like Stash&#x2F;Bitbucket and Github Enterprise, we’re back to an SVN like model.')
