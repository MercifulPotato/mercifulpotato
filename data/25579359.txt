Item(by='tooltalk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609311973, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25575956, text='&gt;&gt; Governments really need to do the heavy lifting though ...<p>Companies like Apple outsource their assembly lines to unscrupolous contract manufacturers in 3rd world countries with substandard labor&#x2F;human rights&#x2F;environmental practices precisely to avoid the &quot;heavy lifting&quot; from gov&#x27;t at home and also hopefully deflect the blames when their shenanigans get exposed.  They feign fake outrage, send fake instigators; then &quot;suspend&quot; until the bad PR dies down -- wash, rinse, repeat!  Tim Apple, aka, Apple&#x27;s &quot;supply-chain-genius&quot;, seems like he knows what he&#x27;s doing.<p>In the meantime, at home Tim Apple and his cohorts parade around making feel-good virtue signals on everything from environment, to racism, to immigration, to equality, to privacy, to you name it, so Apple&#x27;s fan base can feel less guilt and blissfully turn a blind eye to abuses in the 3rd world.<p>&gt;&gt; apart from refusing to hand over money&#x2F;work they are very limited in what they can do.<p>money talks, bs walks. Apple&#x27;s money has far more leverage than empty promises from politicians in most underdeveloped world. It&#x27;s just that Apple is really interested in cutting cost at sweatshop factories and making money, not promoting some idealistic goals Apple purported to stand up for at home.')
