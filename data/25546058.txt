Musk said they would have a fully autonomous cross country trip by 2017, and said there would be 500,000 robo-taxis on the road by the end of this year. These claims make the general public assume the tech is almost ready and that disclaimers are just a legal CYA. Why else would people be trusting their life to something that could fail at any moment.<p>The only thing that makes me question is that only around 5 people have been killed by a Tesla on autopilot or FSD, which frankly is shocking to me given the multiple videos of abuse of these systems floating around the internet.')
