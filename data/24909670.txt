Earlier onset of colorectal cancer is rare and strongly associated with other risk factors such as family history and bowel problems such as IBS.  In most cases the polyps that can lead to cancer do not even begin to form until the age of 55.  Early testing is a significant amount of money traded for little expected result.  There is such a thing as too much testing and we need to be targeted in our use of medical resources.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sciencenordic.com&#x2F;should-colon-cancer-screening-start-age-45-or-55" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sciencenordic.com&#x2F;should-colon-cancer-screening-start...</a>')
