I see that you were probably responding to &quot;Are those opinions shared by the scientific community?&quot;, in which case yes you make a valid point. However it still holds that this paper was from 2006, we&#x27;re in a much better position today in many places to accomplish work remotely. Many assumptions are in fact not met. I&#x27;ll keep my original comment as is below:<p>It is immaterial that D. A. co-authored that back in 2006. It was a different time, and the measures that he is professing against have _demonstrably_ proven to be effective.<p>The paper gives suggestions based on many assumptions that don&#x27;t hold considering the implemented rules. But they&#x27;re just suggestions. Offering this paper in the face of demonstrable evidence that these measures do in fact work seems a little irrational in my perspective.')
