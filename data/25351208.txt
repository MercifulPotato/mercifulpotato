I expect them to outsource a Bluetooth chip that can&#x27;t negotiate AAC over the air, because they weren&#x27;t willing to pay the chip cost or licensing fee. I expect them to be unable to easily pair with five separate devices (including Windows 10) and transition between them rapidly. I expect them to cheapen their audio experience when they go wireless.<p>If Apple&#x27;s new thing was wired <i>only</i>, I wouldn&#x27;t even consider them. I already have my custom balanced-XLR Beyerdynamics on a pile of Schiit on my office desk. They serve that purpose beautifully, and I see no reason to change that.<p>The DT1770s that you compare them to are <i>not</i> wireless. They&#x27;re not in the same market at all as Apple&#x27;s wireless products. Of the manufacturers you list, I trust <i>none</i> of them to meet wireless needs. I trust Apple to meet wireless needs as much as I trust Beyerdynamic to meet wired needs.')
