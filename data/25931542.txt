Currently the only style that is enforced is that we use spaces instead of tabs and the length is two spaces per indentation level. Everything else is informal convention and there&#x27;s a lot of subtle variation across the codebase.<p>We primarily use C# and SQL. I&#x27;m curious if you have to abide by a style guide and if you&#x27;ve encountered any pitfalls when enforcing a standard like that.')
