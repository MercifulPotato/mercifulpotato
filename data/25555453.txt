I;d imagine that a decent portion could be ripped from another open source operating system and run in userspace in SeL4 and get some benefits, but I&#x27;m not aware of any real effort to do that.  Otherwise the usual way to use SeL4 as a hypervisor and just run linux under itm which gets you some benefits but probanly not the ones you&#x27;d want for a router to be as secure as possible.')
