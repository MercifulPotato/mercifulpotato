It seems like the incentive on both sides will be to always push it higher and higher.<p>You&#x27;re forgetting the other side of the coin. The money comes from somewhere.<p>Suppose you can fund a $12,000 UBI with a flat 25% tax rate. So now the breakeven point is at $48,000 in income. If you make more than that you don&#x27;t want to increase the UBI amount because it&#x27;ll cost you more than it gets you.<p>Whereas you could fund a $15,000 UBI with a flat 35% tax rate. The rate has to be more than proportionally higher because of the negative impact of higher tax rates on economic activity. Now the breakeven point is at ~$43,000 in income. It&#x27;s lower, so fewer people want to increase it more than that.<p>When the breakeven point has more than half of the population on the other side, you don&#x27;t have the votes to raise the amount any more.<p>&gt; Imagining a world with UBI, widespread automation, and general or close-to-general AI, what percent of humanity will be able to meaningfully contribute?<p>Imagine a world with widespread automation and general or close-to-general AI <i>without</i> a UBI.')
