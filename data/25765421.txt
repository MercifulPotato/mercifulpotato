Solar is a simple ROI calculation, you are not &quot;printing money&quot; until you payback your initial investment, your basically making a lump sum payment for electricity and the longer the system last the less you&#x27;re paying per kwh in that lump sum.<p>Edit: SREC credits do make a lot of difference wow, unfortunately my state (FL) does not have them.<p>Solar systems do not last forever and can break, my dads SMA inverter just went out after 5 years and he is having trouble getting a warranty replacement as his original installer is out of business, meanwhile he&#x27;s paying a normal electric bill again while its down. Panels lose efficiency over time and need to be cleaned from time to time as well.<p>I will probably be doing solar on my house at some point because it will probably save some money in the long run, but mainly because I want to help reduce carbon emissions right away, plus I like the tech aspect of it. It does however add complexity and equipment that will eventually fail and have to be dealt with and replaced.')
