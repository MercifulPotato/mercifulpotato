Right. It&#x27;s not your garden variety lock down.<p>While the US government authorities were telling people &quot;Masks don&#x27;t work&quot; and armies of conformists were busy shaming mask wearers for not thinking about &#x27;our frontline workers&#x27; and nonsense like that, Taiwan just built sufficient capacity to make a mask for each person every 3 days. &quot;Don&#x27;t hoard your masks. Give them away to our precious medical personnel&quot;. Total fucking bullshit.<p>There are lots of people who went around telling people that masks don&#x27;t work unless they&#x27;re N95, that N95 don&#x27;t work unless you&#x27;re trained, that N95 don&#x27;t work if you reuse. All <i>total</i> bullshit.<p>Don&#x27;t try to rewrite history. I was there.')
