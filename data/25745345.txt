When „soviet“ calculator produced an error, it would display „error“ on 8seg display. This „strangeness“ was explained in manuals that «ЕГГОГ» (which is error transliterated using cyrillic and is an absolutely nonsense gibberish in russian language) „is a special codeword to indicate an error condition“ :)')
