And he was totally defeated by red tape, bureaucracy and process.<p>The first guy who&#x27;d come in and broken everything in one fell swoop had to convince his bosses that radical change was necessary just that one time, when he was new and there was no history. He got the green light easily.<p>The winning strategy for the VPs in that company was to put all their eggs in that one basket. If it worked, they came out smelling of roses. If it doesn&#x27;t they go find a new gig. But playing the long game didn&#x27;t work.')
