Tinder of course was acquired by Match Group, and went public in November of 2015.<p>The Tinder CEO at the time was, uh, unfamiliar with how quiet periods are supposed to work in IPOs, and, I want to say interviews in general. As such Match had to amend their S-1, filing a free-writing prospectus, to include this absolute dumpster fire of an interview given <i>during the quiet period</i>. If you&#x27;re having a tough morning, at least remember that you&#x27;re not responsible for the only instance of the word &quot;sodomy&quot; on the SEC website.
