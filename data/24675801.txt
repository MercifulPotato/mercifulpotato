Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[24678869], score=None, time=1601772084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24674800, text='I think it&#x27;s reasonable for Apple to make it difficult for shady third-parties to get you to install their malware-ridden app store, but I don&#x27;t agree that the only way to keep users safe is to disallow any third-party app installs entirely.<p>Apple just currently has little incentive to do the former, because a) it&#x27;s more difficult, b) they have a financial benefit to keeping everyone in their own app store.<p>Given that, it&#x27;s naive to think that Apple&#x27;s main motivation here is to protect users.  Sure, that&#x27;s a part of it (maybe even a big part!), but they could protect their users in other ways, but those other ways would likely hurt their bottom line.<p>And I think <i>that</i> is why people cry anti-trust all the time when it comes to this: in a perfect world where no one was motivated by profit (and consumer lock-in), we can imagine that Apple would find a way to open up the platform a bit more.')
