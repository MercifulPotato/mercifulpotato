It SOUNDS like, if you have a Big Sur machine that runs no software other than Apple&#x27;s and software downloaded from App Store, this isn&#x27;t an issue.<p>The problem is if you install non-App Store software. Most people don&#x27;t need to do that, but of course, the types of users who frequently Hacker News frequently will. So they run the risk of installing, and using, malicious software.<p>I myself do install non-App Store software sometimes. Prior to Big Sur, I could use Little Snitch and be sure I knew what servers it was communicating with. With Big Sur, I can&#x27;t.<p>Does that sum up the problem?')
