(Except in the rare possibility that the &#x27;smaller&#x27; Canadian entity made a deal with a Hedge Fund for a massive leveraged buyout of their much larger American peer, but that&#x27;s unlikely)<p>Of course, one might argue that would be a &#x27;giant disaster&#x27; for Canada, even as Canadians had immediately higher incomes and GDP&#x2F;capita - and the argument is essentially derived from nationalism. Hence, the hypocrisy of people lamenting that the UK doesn&#x27;t deserve a degree of material sovereignty.')
