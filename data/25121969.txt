And I&#x27;ve been using Macs since 2003 (along with Linux, Windows, etc).<p>It&#x27;s the effect of:<p>(1) millions of Macs updating at the same time (fastest OS updates in the industry) vs a smaller number of Linux users scattered upon every distro and updating at random piecemeal intervals (and Windows users fragmented into 2000000 possible configurations and OEMS, with different pain points and issues, that nobody cares for, and is not newsworthy, plus the blame can be dilluted between MS and the PC vendor.).<p>(2) Apple doing bolder changes with releases than Windows or Linux does (adopting new things faster, custom processors and co-processors and SOCs, whole new languages, new filesystems, etc), so risking more problems.<p>(3) Apple news sell (few would care for &quot;Asus botched the production run of one of its 200 models&quot;), so they magnify the issues that 1000 or 10,000 people see as if they concern 100,000,000+ users (or half a billion in the case of iOS).<p>(4) Hackers and tinkerers being angry that they&#x27;re not pandered by Apple, as if they ever were the target group for Macs, and as if curation and the concept of the walled garden is not central to macOS&#x2F;iOS (in the positive light: not &quot;I can&#x27;t get off the garden&quot; but &quot;it&#x27;s a peaceful garden where I can focus on X things, creeps, crazy people, junkies, etc don&#x27;t get to screw around -- and yes, this means that to achieve that I can&#x27;t do any arbitrary thing I might want either&quot;).')
