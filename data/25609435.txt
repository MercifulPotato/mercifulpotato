Part of the teacher&#x27;s job is to look for signs of abuse, bullying, and health problems. I&#x27;m not a doctor. I see a possible symptom, I&#x27;ll bring it to the attention of people who can help. If they are using the bathroom frequently because they are being bullied then I am exactly doing my job in the best way possible by alerting the nurse, who can alert the counselor, etc.')
