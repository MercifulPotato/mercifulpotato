It does seem that either iOS is sending her more notifications about various things which she is scared to touch.<p>Im not entirely sure what triggers it, but I think the fact that she doesn&#x27;t get the &quot;toolbox&quot; view you can swipe up. I&#x27;ve had to help her with turning wifi back on, or screen becoming to dim.<p>I wouldnt be surpised if it is the swipe gestures that she randomly engages and all of the sudden the phone is doing something she didnt intend that makes her afraid of &quot;breaking it&quot;.<p>Though, I havent actually tried to observe her usage.')
