The erstwhile norm was to rely on unionized laborers for work, but migrants from the destitute states up north started coming en masse, which suppressed labor costs even further. As long as you give them a roof over their (families&#x27;) head, 3 meals a day and a living wage to send back home to their village, they work reliably, especially when you need the manpower to guard against thieves or harvest season. Nobody I know uses heavy harvesting machinery except for cereals and some commodity vegetables - tech is mostly used for plant and livestock monitoring.')
