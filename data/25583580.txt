The Sopranos (1999), The Wire (2002), and Firefly (2002) were all shows at the forefront of the current renaissance in dramatic televisionâ€” they were all shot on film, but it&#x27;s interesting that Firefly for example was natively 16:9 and cropped to 4:3 for its original run, whereas The Wire&#x27;s &quot;conversion&quot; to widescreen has been a matter of some more controversy, eg: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techhive.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2854439&#x2F;hbo-remastered-the-wire-in-169-hd-and-it-was-a-lot-harder-than-youd-think.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techhive.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2854439&#x2F;hbo-remastered-the-...</a><p>Another interesting aspect of Firefly is that the pure VFX scenes (eg spaceship exteriors) were rendered originally at 480p, so when you watch the Blu-ray version of the show, you can see a bit of an awkward transition where the shots of the actors are gloriously crisp, but the space scenes are clearly upscaled.')
