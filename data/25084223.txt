My parents are coming to us for Thanksgiving, but we are making them get tested the weekend prior, quarantine at home for a few more days, then they are driving to us only stopping for gas (so, wipe down the pump with a Clorox wipe and then use hand sanitizer after touching it).<p>That process alleviates enough of the fear for us.<p>Edit: Why the downvote? This answers OP&#x27;s question, and if I&#x27;m being downvoted due to concerns around spreading a virus then by all means, please feel free to start a discussion around why this option might be unsafe. Nobody in my family has traveled yet this holiday season and I&#x27;m not trying to be cavalier about this, so any additional input is welcome.')
