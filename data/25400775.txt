Basically bringing in all the tools from MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 &#x2F; H.264 that have patnets expired or soon to be expired ( by the time finalised ). It is expected to be somewhat better than AVC High Profile but not as good as HEVC. ( Which I should remind everyone this claim seems too good to be true and requires 3rd party testing to verify )<p>It is interesting because a lot of the original purposed tools for H.264 were deemed far too complex for hardware at the time and were not accepted into the standard. Now 20 years later those tools are being put into good use.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Essential_Video_Coding" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Essential_Video_Coding</a>')
