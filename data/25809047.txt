I have some old mercury fillings and at least one newer resin one.<p>Your link is interesting. It seems like the arguments against mercury amalgam being a problem include:<p>1) organizations like you listed saying don&#x27;t worry<p>2) obvious scammers making a living blaming everything on fillings, even nonexistent ones<p>3) only 5% of people with fillings having elevated mercury in urine, particularly gum chewers<p>4) &quot;hypersensitivity or allergy&quot; are the &quot;most likely health effects&quot; but there is not clear evidence for or against autoimmune disorders caused by fillings.<p>It seems to me that it&#x27;s perfectly conceivable, at the same time, that there is or has been a scam&#x2F;cult of mercury fillings causing every possible problem, and at the same time, that they <i>do</i> do something to a minority of recipients that is different from acute mercury toxicity that we know about. There could be a combination of more than normal mercury released and more than normal sensitivity.<p>Something that would be interesting to research, I think, is the microbiome of people with and without different kinds of fillings. There&#x27;s been some recent claim(s) about the bacteria that cause gingivitis being linked to Alzheimers.')
