Sex is free and not that time-consuming. You can work hard at college and still find time for sex. You can be in debt and have sex with other people in debt without incurring further debt.<p>Women getting married and having children later should mean more opportunities for casual sex, not fewer.<p>Boomers have not forced younger people to find hookups on tinder. The argument about competition makes no sense. Everyone can&#x27;t be outcompeted.<p>If a generation has chosen only to have sex with its most attractive members, how did that happen? Why does it leads to less total sex? Why is this the fault of older people?')
