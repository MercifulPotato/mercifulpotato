Blog posts like the one this thread is about are really valuable to those of us interested in the work of others.<p>I can see how what I said could be interpreted as &#x27;folks that blog about their work are narcissists&#x27;.  That wasn&#x27;t my intent.  The headline is a bit clickbaity but the explanation is a good walkthrough.  This isn&#x27;t the far end of the spectrum that I had in mind.
