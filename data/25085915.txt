I believe the right ultimately poses the greater danger in this context. What I am saying is it&#x27;s very obvious what Trump wants to do: he wants to build and support a narrative that this election is illegitimate. He wants to do it through stoking resentment against the left and center and suggesting systemic bias. We resist this by calmly saying that we as a nation are committed to fair elections, and we agree that we need to investigate any cases of impropriety that he can find in courts which are independent (and if anything are largely friendly towards his party).<p>If he fails to discover any issues, we say we cooperated fairly &#x2F; openly, he failed to produce evidence of impropriety, this suggests the process was fair, and now we can move on. What we don&#x27;t do is scream that he&#x27;s wasting our time, that Republicans are assholes, that they&#x27;re trying to undermine democracy, and that this whole process is bullshit. If we do, it allows Trump to say &quot;SEE?! I told you they are biased against us! What are they trying to hide??? Why are they so impatient?!&quot; It hands him the ammunition to build the narrative that there has been a conspiracy. If there was no conspiracy, why is the left so impatient and hostile? Why are they trying to subvert the process? Politics isn&#x27;t just about facts it&#x27;s about feelings and opinions. At the end of the day we want Republicans to accept the results willingly, and in my opinion that&#x27;s best served by being calm and patient in our dealings with them rather than by being angry or impatient. This is a lesson the left generally fails to grasp: screaming at people and calling them assholes is not a particularly effective way to get them to agree with you.<p>The most effective thing we can do is allow Trump et al to burn themselves out.')
