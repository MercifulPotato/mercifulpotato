So while society provides safety, etc people and companies add to it with additional value. This value gets taxed (to support society) and the remaining value builds and compounds.<p>So at a macro level any persisting organization contributes more to society than they gain or society would crumble. By definition the growth in society is driven by people making it better. And people work on stuff like corporations.<p>On the micro level, it’s hard to figure out the exact net contribution from individual persons and companies, but Amazon is obviously a huge company paying out returns and the second order effects from how they’ve driven e-commerce, cloud, and logistics make me think they’ve helped many others beyond just customers and shareholders.<p>That being said, maybe taxes should be changed. But they are currently paying everything required of them and monetarily generate lots of revenue for government (eg, corporate income taxes, sales tax, property tax, tariffs, capita gains paid by shareholders, and income tax paid by employees, etc)')
