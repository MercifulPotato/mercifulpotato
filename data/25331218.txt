If the project is very complex (e.g. P2P, blockchain, distributed messaging, machine learning, ...) then you actually want engineers to think really hard about every line of code they write.<p>The best, most long-lasting code I ever wrote took a long time to write. Sometimes I have to think about a single small feature for multiple days before I begin to implement. Some foundational structural technical decisions require weeks of thinking and analyzing. It&#x27;s the best way to guarantee that you don&#x27;t have to come back to rewrite the code later.<p>When I was younger, I would refactor some of the foundation logic every few months as I added more changes on top. These days I almost never refactor the foundations. That extra time is totally worth it. It&#x27;s very hard to come up with a good design.')
