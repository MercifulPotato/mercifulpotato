In tightly-connected local societies that asymmetry is generally countered by reputation effects and limited scope of bad-faith action. In the worst cases, it&#x27;s countered by societies being small enough that even when bad-faith ideas take over their spread is limited.<p>Technology has broken down the limitations. Information is spread by entities with no history or reputation at all (Twitter bots, for instance). The spread of bad-faith ideas is no longer limited spatially. The result of this is that obvious scams like QAnon (created to sell merchandise) thriving because there are now mechanisms to bypass all the natural limitations that used to constrain them throughout centuries of history.<p>Censorship is kind of like slapping a tourniquet on it. It may stop some of the worst symptoms, but it has a lot of terrible side effects and doesn&#x27;t work that well anyway.<p>The biggest advances that need to be made are in recognizing that there is a problem in the first place, and that a &quot;marketplace of ideas&quot; is not equipped to deal with asymmetric bad actors. I don&#x27;t know what the solution is, but &quot;marketplace of ideas&quot; has proven insufficient to deal with the real world. We need people to be looking for something better instead of claiming there is no problem.')
