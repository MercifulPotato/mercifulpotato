I never imagined someone would have the opposite experience from me. :)<p>I used Mach 3 &amp; 4 and got terrible irritation.  I think you have better shaving technique than me.<p>If I could have learned better technique 20 years ago, it would have saved me from years of body insecurity.  My family members and various physicians never informed me that unsightly shaving rashes are avoidable.  I imagine the popularity of beards is partially due to insufficient shaving technique education.<p>Would you care to post a video of yourself shaving?  It could help others.')
