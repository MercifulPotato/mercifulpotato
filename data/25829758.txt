I can&#x27;t remember the name, but the joke rule that work expands to fit the time given to it.  Such that, if all work expands to the max of the distribution, your time is easily set at the point of the max.<p>Of course, this has been tried and doesn&#x27;t work.  The max time on many distributions is effectively infinity.  Which, fails.  For obvious reasons.  And is why I assert you can really only talk of how long you are willing to work on something.  Not how long it will take.')
