But frequently older people don&#x27;t, even older people who were near tech. And in particular many of them don&#x27;t <i>get</i> communities like Reddit.<p>I don&#x27;t think a lot of people could have predicted that tens of thousands of retail investors would flash mob an out of favor stock to bust a hedge fund&#x27;s short position. The chances that a 65 year old lawyer would see that coming? Seems pretty unlikely.')
