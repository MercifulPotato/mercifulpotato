And Europe has never experienced anything like that, so for the average European, there are no frames of reference, no shared history, nothing.<p>Sure, there&#x27;s been slave economies in Europe, but the last ones were a thousand years ago. Sure, there&#x27;s racism in Europe, plenty of it, but it looks completely different, and it&#x27;s never been as hyperfocused on skin colour like racism in the US is. Racism in Europe is more about ethnocentrism, and some of the worst atrocities in the continent&#x27;s history have been committed by super white people against other super white people.<p>Another thing that Europeans <i>do not understand</i> is how the police works in the US. Where I&#x27;m from, the police consists of two national organisations, 700 years of history, and an origin as the city watch, making sure cities in the middle ages didn&#x27;t catch on fire.<p>Whereas in the US, the police consists of some 16000 decentralised wildly different organisations, federal, state, county, local, all with a much shorter history, wildly different histories, wildly different scopes of law enforcement. But most importantly, some of those local police organisations were explicitly founded to enforce slave laws, to enforce racial segregation, to enforce Jim Crow laws, and they were founded by the local KKK leaders.<p>The situation is completely different, the history is completely different, the racial divides are completely different. And then people try to import the US discourse on racism, and nothing fits, nothing makes sense, but people still don&#x27;t want to be seen as racists, so they try to make it fit, try to agree, and it&#x27;s all just weird.<p>You can stand in solidarity with BLM no matter where you live, that&#x27;s fine, but if you&#x27;re European, please stop there. Don&#x27;t try to deal with uniquely US issues in your own country, because I promise you, they don&#x27;t exist. You have other issues to deal with.')
