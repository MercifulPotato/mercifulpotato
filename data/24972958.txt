Speaking strictly for Romania (from where I&#x27;m from)<p>Great specific question! Because Romania isn&#x27;t a signatory to the Washington Accord, which is the mechanism by which these engineering degrees get recognised for chartership by other countries.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ieagreements.org&#x2F;accords&#x2F;washington&#x2F;signatories&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ieagreements.org&#x2F;accords&#x2F;washington&#x2F;signatories&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s a simple fact that chartered engineering societies don&#x27;t accept many overseas degrees! It&#x27;s very hard to get chartered from overseas unless you&#x27;ve been to a few very notable universities. Even being listed on the European Engineering Education Database isn&#x27;t accepted.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engc.org.uk&#x2F;glossary-faqs&#x2F;frequently-asked-questions&#x2F;international-activity&#x2F;recognition-and-registration-in-the-uk-for-engineers-from-outside-the-uk-or-with-non-uk-qualifications&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engc.org.uk&#x2F;glossary-faqs&#x2F;frequently-asked-quest...</a>')
