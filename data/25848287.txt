Their crap can work only on Windows, so I don&#x27;t actually have any choice.</i><p>Maybe this software actually is crap and you know this for a fact. Maybe whoever is in charge doesn&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing. If so maybe ignore this comment.<p>With that said though, the principle to only allow &quot;secure&quot; systems for remote access sounds absolutely reasonable.<p>Having been on the other side of this situation, I have to say users like you are a real pain to deal with sometimes. There are always a few who &quot;know their stuff thank-you-very-much&quot;, and feel that they need to &quot;give the finger&quot; to whatever measures are taken to secure things.<p>Try to see it from the IT-sec guy&#x27;s perspective. Maybe some &quot;crap&quot; endpoint security software on the PCs isn&#x27;t the end of the world if it helps keep things secure?')
