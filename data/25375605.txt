That is a huge red flag if, like me, you are trying to avoid narcissists who aren&#x27;t interested in listening to others. It&#x27;s clear that the developers of Typefully are oblivious to this Twitter syndrome.<p>At best, it&#x27;s for people who are in transmit mode (like Rob Rhinehart on his blog) and this is a dangerous way to operate because you&#x27;re not engaging with your hypothetical audience before pontificating.<p>See, e.g.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;klwightman.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;11&#x2F;zero-twitter-following-count-says&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;klwightman.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;11&#x2F;zero-twitter-following-cou...</a><p>&quot;What a zero following count on Twitter really says is that you are more concerned with your image than your connections. Your ego is more important that the conversations you could have to genuinely build your character.<p>A zero following Twitter count shows that you don’t care what others on Twitter are saying.\nMaybe you do, maybe you don’t. Because actions speak volumes, a zero following count says that you don’t.<p>No need to worry. This strategy often fails, and for good reason.<p>Many Twitter users see through this strategy. How much fun is it to follow someone who doesn’t care what anyone has to say, even you?<p>So many will unfollow these ego accounts and their Twitter follower account once again dwindles.&quot;')
