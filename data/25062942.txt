Don&#x27;t buy things that you don&#x27;t eat on a regular basis because:<p>a) they&#x27;ll sit in the back of the pantry and expire\nb) if you do have to eat them you&#x27;ll be miserable if you don&#x27;t like them\nc) you won&#x27;t know how to properly prepare them and you&#x27;ll probably be missing some other key ingredients')
