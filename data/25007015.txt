So for the people who don’t pitch in on general principle, straightforward processes help bring them around. And in general that means not leaning on clever CI features, and instead leaning hard on the CLI tools your ecosystem supports.<p>There are exceptions to every rule of course. Features around scheduling have little to no impact on what gets built and how, just when and why. Similarly, analytics have second order effects on how and when, but once a problem is discovered you can mostly ignore them for a while. Integration with external tools and services on the other hand, should always be questioned. Do I have another way to do this mostly outside of the CI system?')
