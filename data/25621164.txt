Those record the location of the source code together with the machine code. These locations are stored in the image.<p>For example the standard CL function ED takes a function name and in many Lisp systems this will edit the function in some implementation specific way. In Emacs one uses M-. to get the definition of a function. In those implementation it will ask the Lisp for the location of that function source code.<p>The one system that worked similar to Smalltalk is Interlisp. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interlisp.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interlisp.org</a> . It recently has been open sourced and is in the process of making it more accessible. It&#x27;s a glimpse into an alternative world of computing from the past.')
