Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602535615, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24758763, text='&gt; I&#x27;d love it if free speech advocates were uniform in their attack on &quot;cancel culture&quot;. I have two friends, each faculty members at top schools, who have been personally attacked on Fox News and called enemies of America. This has led to hundreds of people sending them death threats via email and constant calls to their department chairs demanding their firing. Not a peep from organizations like FIRE.<p>FIRE focuses on the exercise of free speech in education, so if your friends weren&#x27;t fired or reprimanded for exercising their rights, FIRE probably won&#x27;t weigh in. Doubly so if no one writes to FIRE on their behalf asking them to cover the case. Ultimately, FIRE can&#x27;t cover every case (they&#x27;re a nonprofit), so it might also just be bad luck that your friends&#x27; case wasn&#x27;t selected. Hard to say. It certainly <i>could be</i> that FIRE is discriminating against your friends&#x27; for the content of their speech, but FIRE and Fox News are rarely aligned (indeed, FIRE got its start defending academia against <i>conservative</i> illiberalism).<p>&gt; And why is sending an email to somebody&#x27;s boss saying that they are an asshole and should be fired fundamentally worse than posting on social media about how so-and-so is a secret jew who works for the new world order and literally sacrifices babies to satan?<p>No one is making this argument.')
