Having many heads the process can be sped up - but with DMLS it&#x27;s mostly moving mirrors which needs to be parallelized, as laser beams have little inertia.<p>Comparing with injection molding it seems IM is a good shortcut for many - not all - cases, while 3D printing is a fundamentally generic technology.')
