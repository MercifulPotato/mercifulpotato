The only practical way to make sure the license change is legitimate is to get permission from every single copyright holder.<p>&gt; Lots of kernel code is copyrighted by companies now.<p>And some of those companies may have gone bankrupt or been dissolved which puts you in a similar situation to a contributor who has died, except it may be even harder to figure out who exactly owns the copyrights.<p>&gt; If they are dead, their copyrights are held by someone else now who can be asked.<p>Even if you figure out who owns the copyrights, do you really think you&#x27;ll be able to convince every single bereaved spouse, sibling, or child to &quot;relicense your dearly departed [father&#x2F;mother&#x2F;wife&#x2F;husband&#x2F;brother&#x2F;sister]&#x27;s contributions to Linux to GPLv3&quot;? I envy your optimism.')
