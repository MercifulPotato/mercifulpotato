We&#x27;re doing this by delivering security as code, or as Charity Majors (cofounder &amp; CTO of Honeycomb) put it, &quot;Consumer-quality developer tools&quot; for security (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mipsytipsy&#x2F;status&#x2F;1288326027001782273" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mipsytipsy&#x2F;status&#x2F;1288326027001782273</a>) â€“ beginning with an open source policy engine for authorization.<p>We open sourced oso last summer, and the feedback has been amazing. We are hiring folks who want shave down the time developers have to spend thinking about things like roles and route authorization. We spend the bulk of our time building the oso policy language, Polar, and libraries on top of it. We are building the product in Rust, which we think is both a good design choice for our use case and a fun choice for the team. The team members who join now not only have a disproportionately large impact on the product and the community, but also on the culture and future of the company.<p>We are based in NYC and hiring folks remote or onsite.<p>To apply, please visit:<p>- Software Engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osohq.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;eng" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osohq.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;eng</a><p>- Developer Advocate: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osohq.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;dev-advocate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osohq.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;dev-advocate</a><p>- Engineering Manager: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osohq.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;eng-mgr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osohq.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;eng-mgr</a>')
