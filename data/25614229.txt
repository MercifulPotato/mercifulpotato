If the top 1% double their income and the rest halves it, that&#x27;s still a net increase in &quot;disposable income&quot;.<p>2. &quot;Disposable income&quot; does not at all account for the varying amount of cost required to sustain a given standard of living in different regions, even within a country.<p>3. &quot;Disposable income&quot; is a purely economic measure. As such, it does not measure a large amount things that impact your quality of life, like time off, stress, job satisfaction, etc. A quick look at those non-economic measures will show those high economic measures don&#x27;t come for free.')
