If you move from California to another country or U.S. state, the requirements to get an &quot;exemption&quot; from California tax residency are essentially &quot;convince the FTB that you have weaker ties to California than to your new location.&quot;<p>While arbitrary and open to abuse in theory, it appears less so in practice. Quoting from California&#x27;s Guidelines For Determining [Tax] Resident Status [1], heading &quot;Leaving California&quot; on page 6:<p>&gt; <i>Example 4 - You and your spouse&#x2F;RDP are California\nresidents. You accept a contract to work in South America\nfor 16 months. You lease an apartment near the job site.\nYour contract states that your employer will arrange your\nreturn back to California when your contract expires. Your\nspouse&#x2F;RDP and your children will remain in California\nresiding in the home you own.</i><p>&gt; <i>Determination: You maintain strong ties with California\nbecause your spouse&#x2F;RDP and children remain in your\nCalifornia home during your absence. Your intent is to\nreturn to California, and your absence is temporary and\ntransitory. You remain a California resident during your\nabsence. You are taxed on income from all sources,\nincluding income earned in South America.</i><p>&gt; <i>Example 5 - You receive and accept a permanent job\noffer in Spain. You and your spouse&#x2F;RDP sell your home\nin California, pack all of your possessions and move to\nSpain on May 5, 2019, with your children. You lease an\napartment and enroll your children in school in Spain. You\nobtain a driver’s license from Spain and make numerous\nsocial connections in your new home. You have no\nintention of returning to California.</i><p>&gt; <i>Determination: You are a part-year resident. Through\nMay 4, 2019, you were a California resident. On\nMay 5, 2019, you became a nonresident. All your income\nwhile you were a resident is taxable by California. While\nyou are a nonresident, only income from California\nsources is taxable by California.</i><p>&gt; <i>Example 6 - You are a resident of California. You accept\na 15-month assignment in Saudi Arabia. You put your\npersonal belongings, including your automobile, in\nstorage in California. You have a California driver’s license\nand are registered to vote in California. You maintain\nbank accounts in California. In Saudi Arabia, you stay\nin a compound provided for you by your employer, and\nthe only ties you establish there are connected to your\nemployment. Upon completion of your assignment, you\nwill return to California.</i><p>&gt; <i>Determination: You have maintained greater connections\nwith California than you have established in Saudi\nArabia. Your absence is for a temporary or transitory\npurpose. Therefore, you remain a California resident.\nAs a California resident, your income from all sources\nis taxable by California, including the income that you\nearned from your assignment in Saudi Arabia.</i><p>Example 5 above is closest to what I think you were talking about by &quot;moving from California to another country.&quot; The only way I think FTB could go after you for here is to argue that you <i>could</i> have an &quot;intention&quot; of returning to California eventually, and I do not know whether keeping your American bank accounts at California banks would be enough of a hook for FTB to decide it&#x27;s worth the effort to try that argument.<p>For myself, if I did move from California to become an indefinite expat, I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much about the FTB going after me. Opinions may vary, of course.<p>[1] CA FTB Publication 1031, 2019 edition: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftb.ca.gov&#x2F;forms&#x2F;2019&#x2F;2019-1031-publication.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftb.ca.gov&#x2F;forms&#x2F;2019&#x2F;2019-1031-publication.pdf</a>')
