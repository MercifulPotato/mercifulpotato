If someone is trying to kill themselves I think its different and they should get help. But we cant be hyperbolic about what that means and try to force everyone into a norm that values long term health above all else, because of how it encroaches on freedom.<p>A more realistic example of what you&#x27;re saying could be like when people get those big holes in their ears. It&#x27;s clearly destructive to the body, I personally think its gross, but there is no good reason to limit people&#x27;s right to do that. The limitations on freedom that preventing that behavior would entail is far worse than letting it happen.')
