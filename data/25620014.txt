I worked on imaging systems for various NASA spacecraft, and most of the published images are false-color, albedo-adjusted, averaged mosaics of many imaging sources from different orbital passes over months or years. Images of people and everyday things are heavily-processed as well, using techniques like HDR and color correction. Photography has always involved this sort of technical manipulation.')
