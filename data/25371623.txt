Item(by='lend000', descendants=None, kids=[25371724, 25372286], score=None, time=1607592280, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25371534, text='Most water in the region isn&#x27;t used for drinking -- there&#x27;s plenty for that.<p>Example use case: almond farmer buys 0.5% of the current capacity of the reservoir at the now liquid market price, with delivery 6 months from now. Instead of having cyclical &quot;rushes on the reservoir&quot; for the remaining farming allotment of water in the reservoir whenever capacity gets low (or just unexpected bouts of no water coming out of the faucet, when transparency into reservoir levels is poor), resulting in less efficient water practices&#x2F;ruined crops, liquid futures provide farmers with stability and actionable planning. If an almond farmer buys futures delivering a million gallons of water each quarter, he can expect that water to be saved and available when the crops need it, and can plan crops around that.<p>Other side effects: prices will be more transparent, liquid, and consistent across the region. Possible bonus: the financial incentive will potentially improve the quality of drought modeling in the region. Imagine future weather computers that use the futures price as an input.')
