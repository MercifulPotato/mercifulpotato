There are definitely pros and cons to this approach and I&#x27;m happy to dive in depth into them if it&#x27;s of interest to folks (I was early at Gigster YCS15 and work at a firm, tribeai.com that has a similar model but focused only on ML projects).<p>But at a high level, this is something to consider if you have a good network of friends&#x2F;former colleagues who are also solid devs who you can tap for projects to rapidly expand your services offering and capabilities without paying for a bench and taking the risk of having a bunch of people you have to constantly pay')
