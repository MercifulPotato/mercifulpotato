That&#x27;s intellectually so dishonest I see no functional difference between that and what one would criticize extremists for, and I don&#x27;t see a meaningful difference between &quot;not minding&quot; a breach of someone&#x27;s rights and committing it, so that&#x27;s the violent bit.<p>&gt; He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.<p>-- Martin Luther King, Jr.<p>But if you don&#x27;t mind their use of &quot;violent extremists&quot; apropos nothing, no, I don&#x27;t particularly &quot;care to&quot; explain myself to you for using the same phrase in response to them -- I just do it because I can. You could simply remove or ignore my re-using that phrase and my point would stand unchanged. Address the core of an argument, don&#x27;t just play &quot;gotcha&quot; while ignoring the context and the woods for the trees.')
