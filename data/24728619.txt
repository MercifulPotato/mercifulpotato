I guess the problem is partly the application implementing them (one example is the end key going to end of line in some application and end of page in others. Ctrl + E does not work on some application etc).<p>I have been using Rectangle now which makes window management bit more sane. But things like command+tab not working on minimised application, having to use a different shortcut to switch between windows of an application is not ideal. In MSWindows, windows are first class citizens and alt + tab works across all the cases mentioned above.')
