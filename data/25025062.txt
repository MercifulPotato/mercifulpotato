Previous administrations have been soft on border enforcement, which led to that number constantly increasing, putting regional pressure on wages, lower class jobs, and regional cultural identity.<p>Trump increased enforcement of existing immigration laws. He wasn&#x27;t going to put the kids in detainment centers with their parents. Children don&#x27;t belong in prisons with adults, there would be incredible abuses that occur. Hence separation pending litigation and&#x2F;or deportation.')
