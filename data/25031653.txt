For instance, you could uniquely generate a Google Form for each person you&#x27;re emailing and so that removes the &#x27;safety&#x27; they&#x27;d feel responding.<p>However, if the platform said &quot;The user you&#x27;re giving feedback for has received 10 unique pieces of feedback over 15 different links&quot; you skip reviewing that guy but if it says &quot;The user you&#x27;re giving feedback for has received 10 unique pieces of feedback over 1 link&quot; then you feel more like it&#x27;s trustworthy.<p>The platform could have a &quot;which email did you receive the request from&quot; and you could punch it in and the platform can tell you how many unique feedback requests the person has and so on and so forth.')
