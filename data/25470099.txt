No celiac diagnosis, but just experimentally trying it out I felt like I&#x27;d reverse-aged 10 years within a week of cutting out all wheat products (more energy, easier time waking up, no bloating, happier bathroom visits, etc.) No real other diet change, mind you, I&#x27;d still eat fried foods, junk food, whatever.<p>What was really unusual about this was, a year ago I tried the keto diet (very low carbs), strictly for several months, also to see how I&#x27;d feel.  It was too hard to keep up, but after doing it for several months, it seems to have &quot;reset&quot; my digestive system, to where I can handle wheat again without any ill effects.  No idea how or why, but at least if I start to feel like my digestion is shitty again I know I can just cut out wheat pretty easily.')
