First of them - an email address.<p>&gt; Someone may ask: &#x27;Why Recipe Generator might need my email address?&#x27; That&#x27;s a pretty good question, especially when you concern your privacy, but the answer is rather straightforward. Recipe Generator is quite a complex piece of software and it needs some time to prepare your recipe, especially when there are many orders. The generator will email you a recipe as soon as it&#x27;s ready, so you don&#x27;t have to keep hanging on the website.<p>&gt; Recipe Generator is not only excellent artificial chef, but also very caring about it&#x27;s customers privacy, so after he emails you a recipe, he immediately forgets the address (that&#x27;s why you have to provide it many times).<p>I think you have a great tool if it works, pretty well monetised if you want to go that route, but I cannot tell if it works and am not willing to submit an email address, sorry.  So, just some basic potential user feedback.  Perhaps a tool for more, of course.')
