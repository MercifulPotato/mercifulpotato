Developing for Apple means you have to only use their tools. I legit hate XCode as an IDE. I tried to do swift in VScode last year but the language server was very barebones.<p>In my mind, despite this Apple is successful because they make fantastic hardware. If Apple didn’t have the fastest chips and stellar cameras, they wouldn’t be successful. Developers jump through so many hoops because the customers are there.')
