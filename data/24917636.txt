Item(by='Hokusai', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603885579, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24916197, text='&gt; Having to deal regularly with the type of person that the average HN reader would never come across in their lifetime, I can understand why organisations like Amazon would set up these bureaucratic support &quot;walls&quot; and&#x2F;or outsource all support to a Filipino call centre staffed by people that don&#x27;t even know what Amazon is. The systems are designed to make getting support hard, because most people contacting consumer support literally don&#x27;t even have a problem that good support staff could solve.<p>Let&#x27;s screw people with real concerns and real business so Amazon can save money on customer support seems a horrific justification. That is basically making all small businesses guilty of wasting Amazon time and burden the small businesses with the burden of proving that they are not.<p>How do you know so well the internal statistics for Amazon if you are just a seller? Cannot your kind interpretation also be based in wrong assumptions?<p>Who has more resources to deal with this situation Amazon or the little business? Amazon does this bullshit because it has power to abuse, not because it is a reasonable relationship with its providers.')
