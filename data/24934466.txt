At best you get a variety of opinions and some personal anecdotes. I posted about my own struggle with shyness and introversion above. If I still suffered from shyness and introversion I would get therapy, I wouldn&#x27;t come to HN and ask random people what to do.<p>In the spirit of trying to help, let me point out that your comment, and some others from people who apparently don&#x27;t have networks of friends and colleagues, start the discussion with a negative tone. &quot;That&#x27;s fine for you but I don&#x27;t have a network, I guess that means I&#x27;ve failed.&quot; Comments like that communicate giving up and blaming external forces, or things outside your control. We can all control whether we get along with people and cultivate relationships. Some people are better at that than others, but it&#x27;s a skill anyone can learn <i>if they want to</i>. It&#x27;s probably harder than learning a new programming language, but it has a couple of orders of magnitude more value in the long term. And it&#x27;s never too late to start.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be harsh on people or show off. I had the shyness&#x2F;introversion problem when I was younger, and the lack of friends and professional network to go with it. The problem was my own behavior, not the world, not some cloud hanging over me I couldn&#x27;t control. It took a person with insight who cared enough to try to help me to let me see I could change my behavior. Ironically that person was a new acquaintance I had just met a few days before. Just like changing any self-defeating or limiting behavior you start by acknowledging it and committing to change. Try CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy), that might help if you can&#x27;t push past it on your own. What doesn&#x27;t work is telling people &quot;I&#x27;m introverted&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t have friends.&quot;')
