Yes maybe I have to maintain it and it&#x27;s definitely more expensive then renting in the long run, but man, I have a comfortable, safe car that I can use with no overhead to get out of town on a whim.<p>With COVID, I avoid taxis &amp; ubers; I can take a zipcar-like rental with relatively low overhead, but one isn&#x27;t always available next to me. When it is, it&#x27;s sometimes not very clean. Those services have small-ish vehicles (and mostly electric ones) that are fine for city &amp; surroundings, but if I want a weekend getaway I need to use real rental, and that&#x27;s a lot more overhead (plus, if I get out 3 weekends per month, just the rentals would be more expensive than the car costs - and that, at a lower quality of the rented car; with COVID I don&#x27;t get out as often, but previously, I used to).<p>I think living without a car definitely makes sense for some people; and definitely doesn&#x27;t for others. But that depends a lot on your conditions, location and lifestyle.')
