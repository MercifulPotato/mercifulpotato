Clearly, so does Covid, and we need to balance it.<p>Can we do better, as societies, if we aggressively protecting old and vulnerable people, and let fitter people continue with their lives? This can avoid the economic collapse of lockdowns, bring about some degree of herd immunity, and yes, trading some lives saved by lockdown for lives saved by &quot;normality&quot;.<p>Suppose 70% of the society is under 50, and has a IFR of 0.1%. Take UK (65mn people), and suppose everyone in that group gets it. That would lead to 45k fatalities (very close to what was already experienced), plus herd immunity, and lack of economic collapse. It&#x27;s clearly not so simple, but it&#x27;s start.<p>I&#x27;m in no position to question the research, but I spoke once to a professor of respiratory diseases at UCL, who quoted that mild Covid cases often do not register in antibody testing (for reasons unclear), so I wonder if even the 0.3% is an overestimate.')
