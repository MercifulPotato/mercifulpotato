I can accidentally kill a pedestrian, a pedestrian can&#x27;t accidentally kill me unless they throw a brick off an overpass.<p>In Germany,  car drivers must always be prepared to brake for pedestrians, including children and elderly people. Children as young as 6-7 walk the streets alone or in packs, so the kid dashing is real possibility. No one is gonna call CPS over it, schools literally recommend first graders to walk to school alone.<p>Pedestrian must use shortest path through street, but does not have to use crossing - you have to use crossing only if one is available within 40m or so.<p>The power dynamic does not really plays out. The cars are slow in cities, cross walks are everywhere.')
