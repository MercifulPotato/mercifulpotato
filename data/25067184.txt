If you give a 2 panel markdown editor to any non-developer human they will be baffled at how to do any formatting with it. Rich text editors <i>are</i> intuitive, that&#x27;s why they&#x27;ve dominated computing for the last 30-40 years.<p>&gt; you can&#x27;t easily predict what will happen simply by looking at the screen<p>Huh? In rich text you see what everybody else will see. In 2-panel markdown you need the second panel to see how your final text will look to the rest of the world because you can&#x27;t predict that easily when writing in an esoteric markup.<p>&gt; For this huge advantage in predictability and simplicity, Markdown sacrifices formatting power<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call requiring a second panel to preview how the actual text will look predictable or simple. It&#x27;s a rube goldberg machine. On the other hand, I think the <i>best</i> thing about markdown is the restrictions to formatting. It forces you to write in semantic HTML.<p>IMO, Notion, for all its sluggishness, nails this part. They provide the intuitiveness of a rich text editor, while restricting the amount of styling to a markdown-esque set of properties so what you write will be easily portable to the web.')
