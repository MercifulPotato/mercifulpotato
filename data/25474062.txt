But that is <i>far</i> from true. As of yesterday I was still getting unsubscribed from email lists due to bounces on my @gmail.com account. But that&#x27;s not the worst.<p>As of yesterday there are some google email customers like NOAA.gov that cannot receive emails from external mailservers (like my personal domain mailserver I run) because they are now proxying through some &quot;security consultant service&quot; ala mx.us.email.fireeyegov.com which causes the SPF validation to fail because it&#x27;s no longer the external mailserver&#x27;s IP that&#x27;s sending it.<p><pre><code>    Received-SPF: fail (google.com: domain of superkuh@superkuh.com does not designate 209.85.219.72 as permitted sender) client-ip=209.85.219.72;\n</code></pre>\nNote that IP, 209.85.219.72, that&#x27;s not my mailserver&#x27;s IP, that&#x27;s an IP that Google owns and use with their new setup to foward email for (some) government accounts.<p>I&#x27;ve re-signed up for the email lists that gmail&#x27;s behavior got canceled and subscribed to them with my personal domain&#x2F;mailserver. It&#x27;s incredible that a random $5&#x2F;mo VPS has given me better uptime over the last decade than all of google&#x27;s infrastructure.')
