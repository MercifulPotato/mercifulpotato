It was <i>everywhere</i>. Even the skin of the thing was a two layer affair in places, deliberately designed with channels and helium pressurisation in a complicated way to flush even the tiniest leak through long channels to the nearest sensor.<p>It sounds crazy until you realise that even a pinhole leak would release gas that rises up and concentrates in spaces between bulkheads and tanks where it can <i>rapidly</i> reach an explosive mixture ratio.<p>Hydrogen is not safe at all.')
