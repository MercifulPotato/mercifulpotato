I think they&#x27;re pretty good at censoring large numbers of people, as we&#x27;ve seen over the last several years.<p>The problem is with determining the standard by which people are censored. Currently, like most large social media companies, Facebook&#x27;s standard is largely arbitrary, opaque and unequally enforced. Posting audio of Melania Trump&#x27;s personal phone calls is fine, even though it violates Facebook&#x27;s policy on posting someone else&#x27;s personal data without their permission, but posting the contents of Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop receives an instant ban. Posting info about the Steele Dossier was fine, even though none of it was verified, but posting any articles about the Biden Ukraine scandal received bans...because none of it was verified.<p>I&#x27;m less concerned with censorship and more concerned with the censorship standard being uniformly applied, and right now, on most sites, it&#x27;s not.<p>Most of the staff they use to censor people are young people with left-leaning politics, so even well meaning censors will inadvertently censor conservatives far more often and without explanation.<p>I think minds.com probably does censorship the best. There&#x27;s a public log of what gets removed, and it can be appealed to a public group of randomly selected users to judge whether or not the removal was warranted. That&#x27;s both scalable (since they don&#x27;t have to hire thousands of moderators) and is responsive and accountable to the community it&#x27;s trying to foster.')
