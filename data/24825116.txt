Texts are lost all the time because no copies exist.<p>What don&#x27;t I understand?<p>There&#x27;s the HP archives that burned down, for one.<p>For another, in a vault at the bottom of the World Trade Center, there was an archive of thousands of unpublished Kennedy photos. No copies were made of those photos. You&#x27;d think it would be safe in that vault. Nope. All gone.<p>Unless the book is a suspected palimpsest, a phone photo will preserve the text more than adequately, and would take an hour or two to accomplish. Then the risk of total loss is averted, and they can relax and do their proper scan whenever budget and schedule allows.')
