Localized entropy can go up or down as energy is added&#x2F;removed or reorganized in the system.  Water can freeze or thaw.  Dice can be random or in a pattern.  But eventually all the suns will go out.  It is only the overall temperature of the universe, the largest system, that is always increasing.  (Sorry, mixed up my increasings and decreasings.  How one discusses entropy can change by context.)')
