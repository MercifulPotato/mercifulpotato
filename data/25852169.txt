In this way, horizontal pleiotropy is significantly mitigated.<p>This is sort of a natural extension (on a statistical methodological level, really a simplification) of a popular technique where a drug which has a known protein target is used in a &quot;factorial MR&quot; scheme [2]. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m less familiar with the literature here because it&#x27;s very domain-specific.<p>[1] doi:10.2337&#x2F;dc18-2444<p>[2] doi:10.1016&#x2F;j.jacc.2015.02.020<p>Edit: removed one of the references because it&#x27;s a somewhat convoluted example, and on a deeper read, wasn&#x27;t actually the paper I was thinking of.')
