Designers want pixel-perfect layouts because they care much more about what their page looks like than what it says, and non-designers had to use the same techniques as designers because browsers were asleep at the wheel in how they handled unstyled pages.<p>When showing what possibilities there are, they are used no matter by whom. For instance when I showed what is possible with inline svg in React everybody in the team bought into that eventually. Also designers are (in contrast to artists) all about creating things considering a lot of constraints. Most web designers know at least basic html so it&#x27;s possible to design for and therefore work with reusable markups<p>To me XHTML failed because it was really painful to use (and still is). You forget one closing tag and everything fails. The amount of people using IDEs (or even XML editors) are still in the minority. On the other hand React proves that XML (JSX) can be used in a modern way. That&#x27;s probably mostly due to the fact that it&#x27;s not used in one big blob but modularized into more digestible pieces and the barrier to write custom functionality is really low')
