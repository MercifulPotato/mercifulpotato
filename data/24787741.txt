The American version is broad and almost absolute. The British model was a document that said you had it and a crown that would execute you or take your property for your words (usually when those words were against the crown).<p>Freedom of speech is fundamental to freedom of conscious, which is different than &quot;live freely without undue influence from others&quot;. I&#x27;m very happy with American style freedom of speech, where the cure to speech you don&#x27;t like is more speech instead of jail and violence.')
