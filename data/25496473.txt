Item(by='detaro', descendants=None, kids=[25496690], score=None, time=1608568571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496421, text='Yes, even mainstream media covers that every now and then (e.g. &quot;Apple just bought an entire company making X to make even better macbooks&#x2F;iPhones&#x2F;...&quot;), but as the parent poster complained 3D printing is getting more attention.<p>Whereas &quot;within the industry&quot; is exactly the thing I&#x27;m talking about: the threshold for getting into more mainstream media is not necessarily related to actual importance and different from what field-specific or even just enthusiast perception focuses on. E.g. the bits and pieces I know about injection molding mostly come from &quot;maker-type&quot; publications that, while of course also talking about 3D printing a lot, also cover entry-level discussions of what happens if you try taking something to larger-scale production - and &quot;forget about your product looking like an Apple product&quot; is high on that list ;)')
