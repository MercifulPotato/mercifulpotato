Item(by='iso1210', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609179069, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25559819, text='Looking at the bookshelf at preschool books, and only including ones with children, I see two :Pirates next door&quot; books, both starting in &quot;Dull-on-sea, a gloomy seaside town&quot;, and some Alfie books (where Mum takes him to various locations where he has magical adventures - diving into a swimming pool and being abducted by pirates, been driven to school but it&#x27;s actually and alien school, etc)<p>I don&#x27;t get this hate at suburbs either, unless it&#x27;s by 30-somethings that love their city lives but now want kids and are trying to convince everyone that the city is the best place. If you think that, that&#x27;s fine, plenty want space and open air.<p>There does seem to be an issue with American suburbs though. Every suburb in the UK I can think of has pavements down the side of every road, has a primary school within walking distance, a secondary school in biking distance, a bus stop within half a mile. Indeed there are specific limits like &quot;distance to supermarket&quot;, &quot;distance to postbox&quot;, etc which come into the planning process.<p>We also have a National Planning Policy Framework, which states things like<p>give  priority  to  pedestrian  and  cycle  movements,  and  have  access  to  high  quality  public  transport facilities<p>and<p>create  safe  and  secure  layouts  which  minimise  conflicts  between  traffic  and  cyclists  or  pedestrians, avoiding street clutter and where appropriate establishing home zones<p>New developments have to provide appropriate public open space in them, the larger the development, the more space, but as a rule of thumb a development of 400 houses will have a large multi use game area (basket ball, 5-a-side soccer, etc), playground, and an acre of two of informal green space, far more than in a city or town centre.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with suburbs, just how they are implemented.')
