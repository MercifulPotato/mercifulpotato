A single server is not good for that...Also not every site has internet so yes having small redundant easily replaceable nodes on-site does have plenty of use cases.<p>Y&#x27;all negative folks against this seem to have very restricted use cases in mind. Not all redundant rack servers live in a 36U case in a air-conditioned internet connected server farm. There are plenty of use cases outside of this.')
