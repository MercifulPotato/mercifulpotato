I know their <i>intention</i>, but the way they are going into this battle is just wrong. And they are kind of losing public support <i>and</i> court orders, all while burning bridges with Apple and Google.<p>One could argue Epic is trying to demonstrate Apple and Google are basically Visa and MasterCard. ( That is purely my guess, personally I dont see Epic has planned a decent, long term strategy other than simply charging into battle ) And in EU Visa and Master had to lower their CC processing fees from their 3-5% in US to somewhat sane %. Similar case in AUS as well.<p>I wonder if Tim Sweeney saw the opportunity from DHH &#x2F; Hey.com, decided to take a bet and jump onto it. Simply judging the flow from Twitter and people within his own circle. ( or Bubble )<p>I actually have no problem with Apple or Google charging 30% for gaming. I do have problem with Apple charging business like Fitness class, Online Email Services, Education or all other Services simply for <i>access</i> through their Apps. Had it been something like 5% to 10% I think everyone would have been happy to pay. It was estimated 80% of App Store revenue were from Gaming. Apple could have lower their non-gaming cut without substantial loss of services revenue stream.<p>But it seems there are large enough group of Americans thinking Apple can charge whatever they want. It is their platform.')
