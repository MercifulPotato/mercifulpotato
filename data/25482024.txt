His memory was bad, then came some terrible hallucinations, and now he&#x27;s starting to have problems with balance and movement. He&#x27;s 76.<p>He was in the hospital one time and they had him chained to his bed because they were scared he would hurt somebody. This is a man who never raised his voice to me even at my worst. I talked to him on the phone he begged me to call the police because he thought he was chained up in a barn that was on fire. The way he described his situation convinced me that it felt 100% real to him. The people around him were trying to kill him.<p>His medications have helped a bit with the hallucinations. He still sees people around his home and it scares him. The worst part though is that as bad as today is, things are going to get worse.<p>I just took a commercial DNA test because I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m at risk for the same end. I&#x27;ll do what I can (although it seems like there might not be much) but ultimately I&#x27;m going to make sure I&#x27;m in control of the end.<p>If anybody here can point me to information or resources on Lewy body dementia beyond WebMD, I&#x27;d be very appreciative.')
