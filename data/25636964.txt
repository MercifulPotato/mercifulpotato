There are a few hundred domains, but all point to the same IP and the total traffic is very low (below 10 GB&#x2F;month).<p>Cloudflare is asking to buy their $5,000&#x2F;month Enterprise plan, Stackpath quoted over $2,500&#x2F;month, Fastly charges $20&#x2F;domain, AppTrana charges for domains as well, Akamai is also super expensive.<p>Why everyone is charging per domains? Seems that don&#x27;t care if there&#x27;s no traffic on that domain or if the domain is pointed to the same origin.<p>Is there any WAF service not charging based on how many domains we have?')
