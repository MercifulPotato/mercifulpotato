This article has two main comparisons. One of these is Pine64 vs Purism and the others Phosh vs LoMiri. For those who haven&#x27;t read the article but want to quickly skim to the sections with actual comparison between the Librem 5 and the Pinephone, here are the relevant headers:<p>- Kill Switches<p>- Charging the battery<p>- Temperature<p>- Phone shape<p>The rest of the article is not about Librem 5 vs Pinephone. While the sections on the apps could have compared the two phones, instead they compare two operating systems. I would have loved a discussion of the performance differences between the two phones or the screen brightness or the speakers. However, most of this article is largely irrelevant to the phones.')
