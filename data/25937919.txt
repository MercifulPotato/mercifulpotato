Either issues with depression, neglect, and lot of abuse.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s not the drug use that causes the problems, it&#x27;s the problems that cause the drug use.<p>Not bashing folks who smoke weed here. I partake on occasion. But this study is bullshit.<p>“Overall, regular use of cannabis – more than weekly and especially daily use – was found to have harmful consequences, regardless of the age people began using it.”<p>Regular use of anything, particularly if it&#x27;s mind altering, is likely to cause harmful long term effects. Particularly if it starts at young ages. That said, the study doesn&#x27;t seem to even attempt to ask why these people were regularly smoking weed in their teens.')
