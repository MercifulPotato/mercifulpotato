I&#x27;ve done quite a lot of health research over the past few years. My personal metric at the moment is to lower my cholesterol and have been moderately successful <i>without medication</i>, so I think I&#x27;m doing something at least partially right.<p>I think the beneficial geeky rules of thumbs for healthy living that are simple rather than perfect, are:<p>1. One needs in ones diet\n1.1 Protein\n1.2 Fiber\n1.3 Carbohydrates\n1.4 Fats\n1.5 Vitamins<p>2. Prefer foods with:\n2.1 Unsaturated fats like olive oil, salmon, etc\n2.2 Fibers<p>3. Generally avoid food with:\n3.1 Fast sugars\n3.2 High inflammatory index\n3.3 High saturated fat content<p>4. Don&#x27;t eat more than you consume.<p>5. For exercise, as the bare minimum, try to walk at least 8000 steps per day or equivalent. This will statistically reduce mortality <i>considerably</i>.<p>6. Sleep enough<p>7. Don&#x27;t stress about the above rules! Pay attention, but don&#x27;t judge - yourself or others.<p>8. Look into other stuff that&#x27;s probably good for you like stretches, breathing exercises and strength exercises.<p>These are not hard and fast rules. But things that one can pay attention to, and through self observation perhaps make slow adjustments.<p>So don&#x27;t stop eating burgers, but pay attention to the number of calories you eat, and of what the calories are composed of. Eat what you like, but don&#x27;t delude yourself.<p>For geeks metrological devices may offer motivation. I have a bracelet that measures my steps and my sleep, and I feel it as a successful facilitation tool. But don&#x27;t treat the device as a life coach, or the numbers as something that you should strive to optimize.')
