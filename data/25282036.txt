It literally got tweaked at least once a year so the problem of &quot;multiple agreements&quot; wasn&#x27;t really a problem.<p>I&#x27;m definitely not defending the actions of Google here but I do understand them - it&#x27;s quite likely this HR rep couldn&#x27;t legally agree to this contract modification and it&#x27;s entirely possible that when it was forwarded to legal <i>they</i> didn&#x27;t have the power to approve this change without consulting up the legal ladder and possibly passing the question by upper management.<p>To contrast, if this person had said &quot;I can&#x27;t agree to that clause for my personal property but I am happy to be issued and exclusively use (for business purposes) a phone from you folks.&quot; - that problem has a solution that&#x27;s pretty negligible in cost when compared to the cost of employing someone and it doesn&#x27;t go against the contract they&#x27;ve been asked to get people to sign on to.')
