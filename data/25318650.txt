Information that contradicts existing beliefs is filtered.<p>This has the overall effect of reinforcing the bias of a person and their existing social network.<p>So conspiracy theories, propaganda, racism, just flat out wrong information, once it takes root, is very hard to dislodge.<p>We have huge chunks of the population now believing in COVID conspiracies, that hospitals are misreporting to make money, that it&#x27;s a psy-op, that mask and distancing directives were either purely to disadvantage their favored candidate, or exist for some nefarious purpose, and on and on.<p>Maybe this is the real answer to the Great Filter&#x2F;Fermi Paradox -- civilization drowns in a sea of mutually reinforced misinformation.')
