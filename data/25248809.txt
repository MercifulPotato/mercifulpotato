If yes, do you reckon automated tools mostly miss emails communicated through these schemes?<p>What do you mean by the scheme being compromised? An automated tool harvested it? Do you have any information on the possibility of harvesters with human in the loop? I can see some &quot;shop&quot; having human harvester who get paid by the number of addresses they &quot;harvest&quot;.<p>Regarding genuine users having difficulty.. What would you say the rates are? Genuine users unable to read emails from schemes vs automated tools unable to extract emails from ad-hoc schemes.<p>What would you say the benefit is from having a plain e-mail address given the likelihood of it being &quot;harvested&quot;?')
