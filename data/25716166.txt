Many topics are introduced at young age, and can take many years until they become a part of the person&#x27;s worldview that they person can meaningfully defend. But it better reach that state for key topics before the person is out of school.<p>&gt; segregation, fascism, etc aren’t “bad” per se. We don’t reject them because there’s some inherent logical fallacy — we do it because they’re morally wrong.<p>Ouch! Fascism and segregation <i>are</i> morally wrong, but just as important they produce systems and societies that exhibit horrible features and, time and again, crumble and fail. Morality is pliable -- many things considered good two generations ago can now seen as morally wrong and vice versa. When your grandkids ask &quot;grandpa, why did you break&#x2F;prohibit&#x2F;deplatform&#x2F;cancel X?&quot; you may want something better to stand on than &quot;because we had that power and we could&quot;. Because that is how your argument reads to me.')
