It seems reasonable to doubt the quality of the work conditions in the factory it came from, but I just don&#x27;t know.<p>I think about something like &quot;Organic Food&quot; and there are at least labelling requirements for things like that. People do, with some effort, manage to eat completely organic, even if there are some problems with labelling consistency.<p>There&#x27;s nothing equivalent for &quot;no kid&#x2F;slave labor&#x2F;fair wages&quot; etc. You could buy only things made in the US, or other countries with fair labor practices, but the supply chains for components &amp; materials to build those things are will be opaque &amp; frequently have roots into the labor practices you want to avoid.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you shouldn&#x27;t try to avoid products like that: If possible for a given product? Sure, go for it. But otherwise I&#x27;m saying that is seems like a virtually impossible task to accomplish')
