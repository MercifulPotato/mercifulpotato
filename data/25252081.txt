After 3-4 days, hunger will disappear. The issues with this method are the metabolic rate drop and muscle is reduced along with fat.<p>I don&#x27;t see how a diet of almost pure carbs (potatoes) does anything but delay weight loss with empty calories.<p>Overall, the goal is to eliminate as much adipose fat as possible since this contributes to greater and greater ghrelin production.')
