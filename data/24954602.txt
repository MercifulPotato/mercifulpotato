I then signed in on my phone’s browser (no way am I installing the app) and that flagged it for suspicious activity, which when I (admittedly very very stupidly) used the same picture as my profile pic for their request, disabled the account.<p>I have submitted for account recover 7 times by this point with a picture of my license to no success of hearing from the company. And I can’t request for them to delete my license from their servers because lo and behold, you need to sign in to do that!<p>The best part is that if I trying making a new account&#x2F;signing in with the same email, it says I can’t do that because the address is associated with an account that is disabled. If I go to the recovery site to submit a request, they claim an account with that email doesn’t exist to be recovered.<p>At least my Messenger account is separate, but they still have my phone number.')
