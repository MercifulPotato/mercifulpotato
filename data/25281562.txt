Completely clueless about mathematical and information theory concepts, etc. Here&#x27;s my measly two cents:<p>I&#x27;ve been running my own Urbit for a few years that I&#x27;ve connected to broader communities, and have found it to be a really exciting and fun platform.

What I understand about its essential purpose sounds great â€” a decentralized identity that I own and can make communities with.<p>I am mostly a tech outsider, but I find it strange to see such a normally open-minded community (hackers) shut it down with such vehemence whenever it comes up')
