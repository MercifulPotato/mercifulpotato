It sets up a more mature world that engages seriously with a lot of the difficulties inherent in the whole Bender and Avatar classes of people. It&#x27;s more political and interpersonal. But it&#x27;s also less fun, and especially after the second season, rather muddled in its storytelling.<p>That is, apparently, partially due to the creators being jerked around by the production company. It&#x27;s very good nonetheless, and if you have time to kill, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a try. You&#x27;ll know in a few episodes if it doesn&#x27;t work for you. (It was in some ways rather too dark for me.)')
