Especially at the time as we were dealing with the war leading up to Segwit and Bcash hardfork and barely starting to make inroads with Lightning Network proofs of concept in the Bitcoin community. I&#x27;m glad I left when I did, but IBM had everything going for it in that space and despite that they still managed to cock things up because they&#x27;re too blinded by their old contracting business model instead of actual innovation. They lost their vision a long time ago, and subsisting on Government and Military contracts is what probably made them this complacent.<p>In short, now after ~10 years in Crypto you&#x27;d be an idiot to deal with xrp and I don&#x27;t feel bad for anyone that gets burned; I&#x27;d prefer it died without with no State intervention, but as some of you may know we&#x27;ve dealt with a lot of that in Bitcoin and only came out stronger while this may kill this project entirely. Just keep that in mind when you see why Bitcoin keeps defying every possible analyzer&#x27;s projections and why even its main detractors (JP Morgan et al) have had to eat their weight in crow and are trying to get in after having ruined the banking Industry yet again with their largess and corrupt business model.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thexrpdaily.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;27&#x2F;stellar-partner-ibm-confirmed-to-be-working-with-ripple&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thexrpdaily.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;27&#x2F;stellar-partner-ibm-confi...</a>')
