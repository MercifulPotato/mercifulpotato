Then I use a razor blade to scrape off most of the metal layers (which obscure the functional blocks), then a cheap Chinese inspection microscope ($100) attached to a DSLR with a 3D printed adapter (a DSLR with a lens attached backwards also works in a pinch). Then take a bunch of individual photos and stitch them with Hugin.<p>Results:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marcan.st&#x2F;transf&#x2F;latte_stitched.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marcan.st&#x2F;transf&#x2F;latte_stitched.jpg</a><p>Edit: sorry, the link was previously the (lower res!) Chipworks shot I&#x27;d annotated previously. I got confused. Replaced with mine. It&#x27;s less clean but higher resolution than what they released.<p>At the highest zoom I could get I could just about make out individual bits in the eFuse array. This is a Wii U GPU (Latte).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marcan.st&#x2F;transf&#x2F;latte_otp_slr.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marcan.st&#x2F;transf&#x2F;latte_otp_slr.jpg</a><p>No chemicals needed. I&#x27;m probably one of very few people crazy enough to do this mechanically, but it clearly works!<p>Here&#x27;s a single shot done with a reversed cheap kit Canon lens of a PS3 GPU (RSX), again with the scraping method.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marcan.st&#x2F;transf&#x2F;rsx.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marcan.st&#x2F;transf&#x2F;rsx.jpg</a><p>I do happen to have access to a SEM too, and obviously that gets a lot more fun. Here&#x27;s the same eFuse area (again this is still the mechanically deprocessed chip!):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marcan.st&#x2F;transf&#x2F;sem&#x2F;latte&#x2F;20161210_201044.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marcan.st&#x2F;transf&#x2F;sem&#x2F;latte&#x2F;20161210_201044.png</a><p>I think the mechanical delayering usually gets me to M1 or so, though it&#x27;s not completely consistent depending on the specific process. Some chips work better than others.')
