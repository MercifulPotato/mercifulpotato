It&#x27;s only for coasting, there is a small electric motor that will only help to re-start the engine. It&#x27;s basically a better start-stop for driving on highways - you don&#x27;t notice that the car is in &quot;neutral&quot; gear with the motor turned off. It helps a bit, but I would definitely not call this a hybrid, not even a mild hybrid. But - I saved 50% of the registration tax, so I don&#x27;t complain.')
