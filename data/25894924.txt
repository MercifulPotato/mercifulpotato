What&#x27;s actually ideal for baseload are fossil fuels.  Unfortunately, those aren&#x27;t going to be an option going forward, so we have to choose between a number of less-than-ideal options.  I think it would be better to be realistic about the tradeoffs of those options than to try to argue that we actually aren&#x27;t giving anything up.')
