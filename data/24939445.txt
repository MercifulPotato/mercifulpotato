The 14 individuals they studied had metabolic syndrome, not cancer, so there&#x27;s no telling how a real cancer patient would react to a fasting diet. I recently had a friend starve to death during her cancer treatment. I really think she would have recovered if we had fed her more. We had 3 doctors agree, their reasoning being that cancer wastes a lot of energy that normally would be used by non-cancerous body parts, so a cancer patient should try to eat more food than they normally would have before developing cancer, on top of whatever other treatments they may be doing.')
