Tons of rule breaking. The dance studio next to my  dwelling has been running popular dance classes as recently as last night.  I think it&#x27;s mostly an age thing: the under 20s almost completely ignore covid restrictions, and so does a substantial part of the under 30s.  I can&#x27;t even blame them as it doesn&#x27;t affect them. And they mostly lack an understanding of the concept of asymptomatic carrier.<p>Regarding your PSA: In the mean time Taiwan has not had a quarantine at all, and has been\nfree of (internal) Covid for over 200 days.  Other SE-Asian countries\nare all doing very well, Japan for example does not have quarantine either.<p>European lock-down policies have been a monumental failure. Not good enough to stop the spread. But ruining the economy (and everybody&#x27;s fun). It is truly remarkable that Europeans agree with being locked away for nearly one year now with little to show for, while other societies achieve <i>much better</i> results with different, and less drastic measures. No curiosity at all, it seems, even to understand why Taiwan, Japan and other countries succeed! SMH')
