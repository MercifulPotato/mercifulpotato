It works exactly how you expect it to work. I want to load a register, I want to loda a second register, I want to multiply them. The most remarkable caveat in 68K, that I can think of, off the top of my head, is &quot;multiply and divide can be slow than you expect.&quot; Which is where the MMU or the x40 comes in.<p>The MSP430 is also a good learning processor, clean instruction set, not too much to take in at once, though there is mental overhead when you need to start being concerned with stack processing and also with some jump instruction limits.')
