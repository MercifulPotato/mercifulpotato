Why? Unlike other inert gases, you have a decent chance of detecting CO2 intoxication. For most people, excess CO2 is very unpleasant, giving you a chance (NOT a guarantee!) to recognize the hazard and escape. Meanwhile, if your body is short of oxygen because an inert gas leak has reduced O2 concentrations in the room you are in, there&#x27;s a very good chance that won&#x27;t notice and at some point will just pass out suddenly and die. Our bodies just don&#x27;t have the ability to detect a lack of oxygen directly; we evolved to detect an excess of CO2 instead.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t want to fear monger: you can certainly handle nitrogen and argon safely with some care and common sense. I myself used to work with liquid helium in large enough quantities to need an O2 alarm. But all things being equal, I&#x27;d use CO2.')
