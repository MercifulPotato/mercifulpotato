The article doesn&#x27;t back the headline. They never mention the effect size, how much parental finances matter. The mention that smarts &quot;explain 11% of the gap&quot; or something, but they don&#x27;t provide the number for parental finances, so we&#x27;re left to just have some vague impression that this variable is &quot;key&quot; to entrepreneurship.<p>This was a government study, where the government researcher is explicitly talking about how the findings must have specific policy implications. I would bet that they advocated for those policies before ever conducting the study, and that any result would have been used to advance such policies. All we know is that the effect was north of 11% in variance explained. So, is 12%? 17%? 25%? What is it? And at which threshold does this variable become &quot;key&quot; to entrepreneurship? (Also, what would people have predicted in advance? And does the reality alter their policy prescriptions?)<p>They&#x27;re also doing potentially invalid things with the stats in not using continuous variables, but rather dichotomizing them. And their slices are arbitrary. They&#x27;re comparing the top 20% on one thing to the bottom 60% on another, for example, and it&#x27;s not clear why they chose those specific slices. It could be the it was specifically those arbitrary slices that gave them the story they wanted to tell.<p>Also, parental finances will correlate with lots of variables, including culture, values, all sorts of behaviors and social norms, as well as concrete domain knowledge in things like business and banking. There could be a disposition effect where the children of people who are more likely to be entrepreneurs are themselves more likely to become entrepreneurs, which is almost trivial right? Or there might be a culture effect where these kids are exposed to the phenomenon of entrepreneurship in a way that is less likely or less strong for other kids.<p>What I mean is that starting a business <i>doesn&#x27;t even occur to some people</i>, for various reasons. Like no one they ever knew growing up had a business, compared to someone growing up in Silicon Valley where starting a business or being employee # ≤12 at a startup is almost as common as having two arms. I noticed this kind of cultural difference in the US. I&#x27;m a Mexican-American from Arizona, but I&#x27;ve lived in Silicon Valley and the American South (North Carolina). When I lived in Chapel Hill, I ended up knowing a lot of natives from other areas of the state. They would talk about wealth as something that you got from your family – they just assumed that&#x27;s where you got money. So if they meet someone and notice something expensive they have, like a car or pricey jewelry, or even housewares that seem high end, they might ask others afterward &quot;Does she come from money?&quot; I had never heard that expression elsewhere in the US. Does so and so &quot;come from&quot; money? It didn&#x27;t make any sense. No one talks like that in Silicon Valley. People don&#x27;t come from money here – they make it. They talk that way in Mexico though, where entrepreneurship of this sort is rare and poverty and class structures abound. So I think people who grow up affluent are more likely to think about starting a business because it&#x27;s just kind of obvious or normal to them – it&#x27;s what people do. It&#x27;s a natural part of their choice space, something to think about and consider, whereas for others it&#x27;s totally not, and wouldn&#x27;t even come up in their thinking, planning, etc. The effect of having affluent parents could mostly be about the literal money situation, like people here are thinking, which is about having access to funding, or it could mostly be behavioral&#x2F;cultural assumptions. I don&#x27;t have any predictions or opinions about which is the strongest effect. It would take careful research to find out. But their affluence cutoff includes lots of households that wouldn&#x27;t have nearly enough money to fund most start-ups. Making $125k a year is not the same as being able to provide seed capital for some business. So in that case, it might about networks and knowing people who have more money to invest. That kind of spills over into the cultural aspect of thinking of starting a business as a totally normal and smart thing to do.')
