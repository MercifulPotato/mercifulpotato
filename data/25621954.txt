Item(by='santah', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609684245, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620706, text='Yes - this business supports me and my family and I don&#x27;t have or need another job. I&#x27;m lucky to have found something I&#x27;m passionate about and that I can be helpful to others with.<p>That said - I haven&#x27;t had a day without working on it (for at least 30minutes to handle support email) in more than 15 years. Also - I plan all vacations around it (well, those are really vacations for my wife, I try and keep working as much as I can on them) by making sure we always have good internet connection and we&#x27;re never somewhere where we won&#x27;t have internet for more than a day. Thankfully, that&#x27;s fairly easy to accomplish nowdays, but I can&#x27;t, for example, do a multi day camping or hiking trips.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say it it comes at a price and it&#x27;s not all great even when it&#x27;s successful.<p>And yes, of course I feel I&#x27;m competing with the other options - some with huge teams and VC money, but at the same time I regularly check them out and I&#x27;m confident my product brings enough value to stand its ground - it doesn&#x27;t have tens of millions of active users monthly - and it doesn&#x27;t have to. I&#x27;ll be happy if I can keep the current scale and the level of satisfaction of my users forever.<p>Now, I wish I had some advice for someone with a new product in this space. The truth is I have no idea how viable or hard for someone to start something new may be.<p>If you want - let me know specifically what you&#x27;re working on and I&#x27;ll give you some feedback (either in here or through the contact form on Next Episode).\n(it&#x27;s fine if you prefer to keep it under wraps too)')
