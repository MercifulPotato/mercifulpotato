The model then needs just a single image at test time.<p>Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong, but: Given a novel scene, it seems the model must be retrained on multiple images of that scene? It seems disingenuous, then, to say it works from a single image. No doubt the interpolation is state of the art, but the title seems misleadingly magical.')
