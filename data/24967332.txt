I also don&#x27;t feel hungry.<p>For me, lunch was usually some low quality food grabbed in a hurry, and so it was the easiest meal to cut out.  But the main reason to cut lunch was that I always got sleepy mid afternoon, and falling asleep in meetings isn&#x27;t really acceptable.  Not having lunch makes my afternoons much more effective, which is great as I&#x27;m not really a morning person.')
