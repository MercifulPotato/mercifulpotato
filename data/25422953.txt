Program representation and execution need a major re-think along the lines of the once-investigated dataflow architecture. Why do and then un-do?<p>In a world where most code is JIT compiled on the target architecture and&#x2F;or periodically re-compiled using the latest, optimized compiler once a new CPU comes out â€“ sure.<p>But is that realistic? Maybe that would work for Android and iOS (with on-device and app store level compilation, respectively), but with Docker, we seem to be moving to the opposite direction again, and runtime hardware-based optimization makes a ton of sense there.')
