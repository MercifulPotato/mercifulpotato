My employer usually does a flu shot clinic at work every year, but as we&#x27;re all home we were not able to do that. In some ways there&#x27;s been more barriers to getting it than in previous years, despite it being more urgent to do so.<p>If this was rolled out properly people would be actively contacted by phone, etc. with assistance on how to get it. That&#x27;s the kind of aggressive roll-out I&#x27;m hoping we see if&#x2F;when a COVID19 vaccine becomes available.')
