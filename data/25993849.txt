Most x86 chips were 32 bit at the time and you need Alpha&#x2F;Sparc&#x2F;PA-Risc, or some fancy custom chips to work in 64 bit.<p>I wonder if the AMD&#x2F;Intel competetion pushed x86 to get as fast as it got surpassing all those custom chips?<p>HP was involved in Itanium and was discontinuing there own chip lines.  We were talking about moving to it, for the &quot;superdome&quot; line of machines.   I was working with PA-RISC at the time, and it seemed like this was the next chip.  But it wasn&#x27;t compatible with PA-RISC but had an x86 compatibility mode..<p>It was a weird chip, and required really good compilers. I thought it was long dead.  It was interesting though..<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14518758" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14518758</a>')
