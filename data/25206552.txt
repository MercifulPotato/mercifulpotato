I&#x27;ve read a whole home library (est. eight shelves each 1m wide), but not interested in reading anymore. Does that count? And no way I&#x27;m going have a hobby out of my interests purely for dating purposes. PC games are not about playing mario, it&#x27;s the world of problems, solutions and efforts¹. If you cannot see that, or never seen that, you&#x27;re likely &quot;stereotyped basic&quot; to me rather than &quot;more evolved&quot;. This advice advises me to being &quot;not me&quot; in a most disturbing way possible. And for what? To see a shallow glimpse of interest and then proceeding to that plain chit chat until it comes to lust, if it ever does. The pretence is big but in the end it is either ONS or a family&#x2F;dating life without all these cool entry attributes.<p>The problem with non-supermodels is that they have all the exact downsides and quirks. It&#x27;s not easier <i>after</i> the date and they do not market-value themselves less, like you expect.<p>¹ I have a buddy who is a racer, country-level. We sometimes talk about his problems (beyond astro money spent on a single race) and it seems that my trackmania canyon (e-sports) progress has many similar issues like apex, drag, curve trade-offs, entry points and so on. Yes, I&#x27;m not experiencing hard pulls on a wheel and 80kg force to brake in timely manner, and I don&#x27;t account for a tire wearout, but if you try to make it close even to my 2 years old PBs, you&#x27;ll have a hard time for sure. And when you compare us, he is a sports man and I&#x27;m a jerk who plays mario cart. Sigh.<p>Upd.note: I used &quot;you&quot; at some places, where it should read &quot;they&quot;. It is not intended to be personal in any way.')
