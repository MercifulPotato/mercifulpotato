No drug is 100% safe.  The FDA determines <i>whether the risks of the treatment are outweighed by the benefit</i>.<p>I have no doubt that additional safety signals will pop up from Covid vaccines as the treated population expands by 100x.  Most likely they will not be severe and the risk will still outweight the benefit.<p>But to say &quot;we&#x27;ve tested the vaccine on a 15,000 people so we know it&#x27;s safe to vaccinate 1B+ people&quot; is not something the FDA would agree with.')
