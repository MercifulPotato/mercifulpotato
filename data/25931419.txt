My reasoning is that I want the complete volume of data actually copied as part of the backup activity. The source filesystem, being btrfs, should raise an error if there was bit rot, but that requires actually reading the file contents. If there is, I can grab the copy from the syncthing peer. The destination hard drive has to actually write all the file contents, so the magnetic fields should be all fresh.<p>The 3rd hard disk is a cold backup in case syncthing has a common mode failure that takes out my redundant drives. I want its filesystem to be as boring as possible. For me that currently means ext4. I don&#x27;t want to have to manage and worry about another tool that optimizes away data transfers, when there&#x27;s value in the data transfer and plenty of copy bandwidth going SATA to SATA.')
