But in practice modern military hardware is both expensive and slow.  The destructive capacity of modern great powers effectively limits the timeline of any large war to either hours(nuclear bombardment) or weeks ( precision bombing of all military and industrial targets )<p>The real loss is that industrial enterprises employ a lot of people who are exposed to hard problems.  I&#x27;m skeptical that the current set of &quot;design&quot;&#x2F;&quot;marketing&quot; only hardware businesses will last much longer than the international trade pacts that support US patent law.')
