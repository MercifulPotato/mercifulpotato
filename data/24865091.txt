The unit economics of Uber&#x2F;Lyft, in principle, work out. If there was no way for them to make a profit nobody have invested in them.<p>They&#x27;re currently unprofitable in the same way that Amazon spent a decade being unprofitable; every cent was invested back into growing future revenue. It&#x27;s a little different; if Uber flipped their switch and started taking a profit Lyft would swoop in and steal away market share. But the unit economics do work out, I&#x27;m claiming that once prop 22 fails there will be markets for which the unit economics will no longer work out at all.')
