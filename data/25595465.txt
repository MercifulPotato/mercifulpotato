This stuff is collaborative,<p>I do not believe that, of course it is collaborative. Some things are emergent, some are not. Some can be neatly broken down into fixed length tasks, some cannot. Some are planned, some are not. Some are top-down, some are bottom up. Some are obvious business function items, some are leftfield ideas.<p>I&#x27;m just feeding back that attempting to mediate and regulate that collaboration via JIRA is a bad idea. A common, and bad idea.')
