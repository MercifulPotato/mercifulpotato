At the unit cost level, it&#x27;s material to their business.<p>Pfizer, where IT is a minor backoffice operation, doesn&#x27;t care that &#x27;everything is 2x the cost&#x27; because that cost is materially small, and the nimble nature of the cloud is a much bigger advantage. And they don&#x27;t have the talent to make their own cloud anyhow. So to them it&#x27;s cheaper.<p>Also note that most cloud users are not startups or tech companies, they are &#x27;basic corps&#x27; doing IT.')
