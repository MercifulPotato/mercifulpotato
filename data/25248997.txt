There is plenty of evidence we landed on the moon, there is plenty of evidence vaccines work.<p>Truthers don&#x27;t argue if planes hit the towers. They argue the people behind the act were not those you have been lead to believe with little to no evidence.<p>Truthers don&#x27;t believe the narrative. And aside from the more extreme individuals that believe everything that Alex tells them, truthers don&#x27;t disagree with facts.<p>In fact truthers seek fact. The only problem is that they we were met with obstruction at every turn.<p>When you&#x27;re prevented from looking at the evidence, when the evidence is quickly cleaned up and destroyed without standard practice investigation taking place it leaves questions open for interpretation.<p>You can&#x27;t tell then me the sky is green, no you can&#x27;t look, and no, your argument that it is blue is an argument from ignorance, how dare you open these old wounds.')
