I don&#x27;t know if you could even use Netflix CDN tricks since their content keeps changing constantly.<p>Considering pretty much every YouTube video I see these days is uploaded in 1080p or 4k, these costs would start to matter eventually.<p>I wonder how this affects their operating margin, considering this article calculates it to be between 5-18%.')
