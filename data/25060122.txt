I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case.<p>Considering that people of color and (to a lesser extent) younger people are largely Democrat (while noting that e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;theres-no-such-thing-as-the-latino-vote&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;theres-no-such-thing-as...</a>), it seems likely that race&#x2F;ethnicity and age are bigger factors than this guy is making them out to be--most of the working class black population, certainly, is still reliably Democrat. This person themselves may be a Republican person of color, but they are certainly an outlier.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;election&#x2F;2020&#x2F;exit-polls&#x2F;president&#x2F;national-results" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;election&#x2F;2020&#x2F;exit-polls&#x2F;president&#x2F;natio...</a><p>Note in particular that 72% of Trump supporters claim that they are better off financially than they were four years ago, and 84% believe the economy is in better shape than it was (compared to 16% of Biden voters).<p>The narrative this piece is pushing doesn&#x27;t seem to fit the data, assuming these CNN numbers are representative.<p>This being the case, I&#x27;m curious why the discussion isn&#x27;t (also) framed as &quot;why aren&#x27;t black people voting Republican in greater numbers?&quot; Black voters have suffered from economic distress in higher proportions, yet are arguably responsible for the continued success of the Democratic party. Why don&#x27;t we talk about this more when we talk about political divisions in the U.S.?<p>The fact is, that, while we do have to contend with class in the United States--and I absolutely see truth in the notion that Democrats failed to support working class, rural whites especially, leaving a void waiting to be filled--it&#x27;s worth examining _also_ why working-class black voters didn&#x27;t similarly swarm en masse to the Republican party because of economic conditions (which have on the whole been consistently _worse_ than those of most working-class white people). Solving the problem of divisiveness in the United States requires acknowledging and working to address the challenges faced by of _all_ its citizens, not just poor white people.<p>P.S. to folks who think that the &quot;white supremacy&quot; narrative is bunk because Trump increased his numbers among blacks and latinos, note that black support is still at 12% (per the CNN link above) --not high! And the Latino narrative is complicated: compare Cuban-Americans in Florida and Mexican-Americans in Arizona, for example. I wouldn&#x27;t be so quick to make too many assumptions about this narrative.')
