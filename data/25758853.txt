I really value that it&#x27;s possible to have discussions like this on the internet.<p>&gt;I am yet to be convinced that &quot;neutrality&quot; or a requirement to provide service regardless of content should be enforced by any government regulation above the network layer.<p>I agree with you. I wouldn&#x27;t be in favor of a government regulation at the level of social media that would prevent specific services like Facebook or Twitter from banning things. But the bigger problem for me is that we&#x27;ve all just decided that it&#x27;s okay for really fundamental things about the web to be controlled by private companies.<p>The web was designed to be an open system and it&#x27;s slowly being more closed in. There&#x27;s still areas of openness, but they get smaller every year. And every time there&#x27;s a new layer of restriction added there&#x27;s always someone to point out that you still <i>can</i> do x y and z, it&#x27;s just 10-20% harder than it used to be.<p>When apps for phones came out it was &quot;Well, you can always just make a web app. They have no control over that.&quot; but consumers are less likely to use a web app and you don&#x27;t have the same access to the device.<p>Now it&#x27;s &quot;Just move to a different hosting company!&quot; which is disingenuous for several reasons. First, any company they move to is going to get pressured to drop them in the same way. Secondly, even if they did find a new hosting company that was okay with them, the pressure would just get applied to a different point (like Cloudflare.) You can roll your own hosting system but it&#x27;s prohibitively expensive for most people especially if the site has a lot of traffic, DDoS and regular hacking attempts. The fact that web hosting beyond the basics is complex and hard is the reason that cloud services exist and are so popular these days to begin with.<p>So yeah, I think we&#x27;re basically on the same page. I don&#x27;t see this getting better. But I still think it&#x27;s worth pointing out.')
