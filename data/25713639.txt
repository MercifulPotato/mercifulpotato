The social get together is different from the weekly 1:1, which is more about his perspective and goals. It’s never too early to start with this stuff.<p>If you know another parent that has a child with design and communication talent, set up some play dates so they can both collaborate on building what will hopefully one day be a great Calendar app that sends out notifications (in real time). Plus it’s a great opp to pickup that much needed well roundedness to engage with product development workflows.<p>This is all very important because aside from the tuition you will pay for college (if for some ungodly reason this child doesn’t pick comp sci), you will have to shell out a solid 17k for a bootcamp to save your child’s career 15 years from now. If you just start the kid early enough, you save 17k, or what will probably be 30k by then. Now that I think about it, have a bootcamp-emergency-fund that you contribute to starting right now might be good in case the kid goes through a phase and blows 4 years majoring in Media Studies.<p>The leetcode is the most important thing here, because even if you do all the right things I just mentioned above, no Leetcode skills means no job.<p>Remember, this kid has exactly 11 years to go from high school -&gt; college -&gt; straight to a 200k salary at a FAANG, he’s not gonna have a lot of time to have a naturally paced career where you work your way up to those places. So if you think I’m joking about any of this, I’m not. You’ve got 10 years to pull this off, best of luck.<p>P.S:\nForget about the video game programming part though, that job doesn’t pay well.<p>Or you could steer him into a more sane career path, and nip all of this shit in the butt. Can’t go wrong with something in Medical.')
