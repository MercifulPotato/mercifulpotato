Each one may have been economical in isolation, but as a whole is not. This is why a rewrite often seems so attractive, to analyze the entire known scope and use a smaller set of mechanisms to do the same often allowing for additional changes to fit more easily. Painting yourself in a corner is either short-sightedness (technical&#x2F;vertical, voluntary&#x2F;oblivious), a tech-debt choice, something that didn&#x27;t turn out as well as expected despite efforts for technical reasons or unexpected changes. It also comes from trying too hard, generalizing too early. So there are many reasons, and pragmatically balancing them is something that is given far too little weight.')
