It&#x27;s very different, but still great.<p>I&#x27;m going to recommend Babylon 5 for this as well.  It&#x27;s not nearly as utopian as Star Trek and focuses on many of the issues interacting with other people&#x2F;groups&#x2F;alien species that ST (DS9 does do this, in some respects) generally ignores.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t ignore capitalism, greed and general bad behavior like ST mostly does.')
