At a guess, around 40% of the entire staff (admin, management, scientists, technicians) are PhD graduates. They&#x27;re working in industry and reasonably well paid.<p>The point is that a desire to secure senior academic positions, such as tenured professor, are not the only reasons people decide to pursue a PhD.')
