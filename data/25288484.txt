My sister in law is from, and lives, in a south-East Asian country and she had an interesting story.<p>She needed to register for her identity card so she went to her local police station and filled out the forms.  Gets a call a week later - “oh sorry, one of the forms was filled out incorrectly, can you come back and fill it out again?”.  Sure, no problem.<p>A week later “oh, one of the forms filled out was the wrong form.  I have the right one now, can you come fill it out?”.  Well this is silly, but ok.<p>A week later “it turns out you need a form from the district as well, please fill that out and bring it in”.  This is stupid, but she does it.<p>A week later “oh, that form had the wrong stamp on it, you need to fill out a new form and get the right stamp”.<p>A this point it was obvious - she went to police station, explained that the stamp was the correct one and oh, yeah, by the way, I know you’re working hard so let me give you some coffee money ($10 USD in local currency).<p>She had the identity document the next day.')
