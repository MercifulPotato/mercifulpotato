If the problem you&#x27;re solving <i>really</i> needs solving <i>right now</i>, you will always make the trade-off that gets your solution into the world faster. You&#x27;re not obsessed with the fact that teams all over the world could have less sucky meetings if they had an even incomplete version of your product in hand right now.')
