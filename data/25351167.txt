The intern used a mouse to select the original 3 on the screen, then typed 4, then selected the original 4, then typed 5, then scrolled down, then selected the original 5, then typed 6, and so on. Another intern sat watching the screen to make sure there were no mistakes.<p>Microsoft Word has automatic numbering. Just to be sure, I opened Word, and entered a numbered list. When I inserted a new numbered item, it automatically renumbered the list. Also, converting from a numbered list to bullet points is as simple as selecting the list and clicking the bullets icon instead of the numbered list icon.<p>This opening anecdote makes me think the author is completely unfamiliar with Word, and is strawmanning it.')
