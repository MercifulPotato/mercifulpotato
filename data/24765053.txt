Item(by='iron0013', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602593176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764587, text='First, Alpha news is a conservative propaganda site.<p>Second, the Minneapolis police department is still fully funded, because the council’s police reform efforts have been stymied by the unelected charter commission, who have prevented the citizenry from voting on an amendment to the city charter that would remove police funding guarantees and allow them to be held accountable. Because they can’t be held accountable, police have simply stopped doing their jobs, while still collecting their fat paychecks. As a citizen of Minneapolis, let me tell you that it doesn’t feel great to watch these welfare queens in blue sit in their cars taking naps and eating bagels instead of doing their jobs. They are leeches, and when the amendment does eventually make it to the ballot, we the voters are going to pull their gravy train tickets so fast it’ll make their heads spin.')
