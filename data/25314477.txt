It is entirely plausible that if a child who&#x27;s brain is still developing falls into a obsession&#x2F;reward pattern,  they could become hard wired to this and become more likely abuse substances later in life.<p>Of course the same could be said for any other behavior if overdone (Such as video gaming), but the fact that &quot;coding&quot; is such a brain centric task it may have a greater effect on a developing mind.')
