I don&#x27;t regret it, and quite enjoyed it, but I was appalled at the state of academia and how poorly resourced it was, despite the vast amount of money being charged the students. Permanent staff were few, and I don&#x27;t really understand how academia is designed for anyone but those at the top. The article&#x27;s basic point is right.')
