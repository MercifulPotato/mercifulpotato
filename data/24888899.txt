This notion of &quot;you signed = you consent&quot; is ridiculous when you are in practice forced to sign.<p>When there is a mono&#x2F;duopoly there is no choice if you want to live or do business. You are forced to accept their conditions.<p>I do not agree with banks, Google, Linkdln, FB, etc. yet I have been forced to sign their user agreement to have a job, to be able to buy food, etc. In no way I consent to their terms but I have been forced.<p>Consoles situation is bad too but you can live without a console, you can&#x27;t live without a phone.<p>The usage of phones is not comparable with consoles. We do everything on phone&#x2F;tablets&#x2F;laptop and almost nothing on consoles.<p>That&#x27;s why addressing Google &#x2F; Apple Store monopolies are a priority compared to marginal things in our lives like consoles')
