The decline in response was slow, a sign that immunity could last a long time. But Weiskopf emphasized that &quot;nobody knows&quot; how things will look in a year or 18 months.<p>&gt; Worldwide, there have been less than 30 cases of known re-infection among COVID-19 survivors, although more are suspected. Experts said the numbers would likely be much higher if most people had not developed immunity.<p>&gt; &quot;I think that tells us that there&#x27;s some level of immunity after you&#x27;ve recovered from the primary infection,&quot; Wherry said. &quot;We don&#x27;t know how durable that is.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s hard to read even this article as anything but &quot;It seems there is a high level of immunity, but we don&#x27;t know for sure, so let&#x27;s be careful.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know any reason to say otherwise, except if you are afraid people will get infected voluntarily for immunization.')
