Because of course it&#x27;s not. The bigger companies (twitter, facebook) minimized risk of fallout by waiting until DT&#x27;s time in power was up and there was a good opportunity to do what they wanted (Jan 6th events), and the other companies are just following in their footsteps while it makes good PR.<p>It&#x27;s kinda like when BLM was hot in the news and companies decided to paint their logo black. They didn&#x27;t suddenly care about racism, they just chose an opportune time and had the excuse that other players were already doing it.<p>It&#x27;s pretty pathetic yeah. In this case, better late than never, but still really fucking late..')
