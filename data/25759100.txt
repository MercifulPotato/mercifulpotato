I do tend to favor ideals of the left (the right doesn&#x27;t seem to be welcoming of Black men like myself).<p>I think we&#x27;ve already seen how terrible things can go when veering too far right and I&#x27;m HOPING the ones in&#x2F;come into power will be mindful enough to compensate.<p>While I strike a positive tone with the implosion of Parler, I am not blind to what could feasible happen to other communities. I am sympathetic to the trials of the sex industry, what with Patreon and payment providers effectively cutting off their livelihoods.<p>A truly balanced view of the news is not happening, even with A.I. assisted processes (human bias is embedded in A.I.) but I think that&#x27;s your best bet.')
