The only bad thing about them is the low social status associated with it. There is some weird bias in society that you are a lesser human somehow if you spend a lot of time in front of computers instead of doing more &quot;rich&quot; things like reading books. At least for me all anxiety related to spending a lot of time with computers disappeared once I stopped caring about what others think, I don&#x27;t think there is anything inherently bad with it other than that.')
