Few thousand outdated tanks unworkable condition.  Then maybe up to  ~500 T-72B3 (somewhat modernized and in workable conditions). Rest is just junk not touched or upgraded for 30 years after Soviet Union collapsed.<p>Poland+Germany together have 500 Leopard 2&#x27;s. France has 400 Leclercs. Britain 200 Challenger 2&#x27;s. (I&#x27;m not counting old but modernized tanks Poland has).')
