They want to use them to pay for more expensive abstractions that allow them to develop software faster.<p>Unless you have a performance issue that’s really pathological, speed really doesn’t matter for most applications. I’ve developed dozens of python web applications. Python is slow as hell, but I can count on one hand the number of times hand where I found the RoI of optimizing a performance issue to be more valuable than feature development (and all of them were problems that couldn’t be solved with more hardware, which is the default best-RoI way to approach most performance issues).')
