Their search: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notebookcheck.net&#x2F;Search.8222.0.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notebookcheck.net&#x2F;Search.8222.0.html</a> is marginally better, but in general, they&#x27;re for researching specific models, not finding models, imo.<p>Edit to add: The other thing is that for their percentage laptop score, you should generally subtract 80 and multiply by 10. I&#x27;ve never seen them review a laptop below 60% or above 92%.')
