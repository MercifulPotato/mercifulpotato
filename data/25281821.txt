But it’s all so intentionally obfuscated with a dash of elitism thrown on top.<p>I think the most frustrating part was reading the Hoon tutorial (Hoon is their high-level programming language) and not understanding a single word. They use completely new terms, strange syntax &amp; then throw in the casual “See? It’s that easy!”. Not even a comparison anywhere to traditional languages for reference (not that it’d help at all anyways)<p>Never again.')
