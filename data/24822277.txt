It means measurements (e.g. lengths, areas, time intervals) are different depending on where you are in the spacetime. The are forces don&#x27;t come with these &quot;extra&quot; effects - an EM field doesn&#x27;t stretch and contract space.<p>However, there are a lot of parallels between electromagnetism and relativity! Quite often relativity effects are introduced with an EM analogy, e.g. gravitational waves (which have polarisation) and electromagnetic waves ie photons (which also have polarisation). Note though it really is an analogy - they are fundamentally different things in both reality and mathematical form.')
