(or the second, etc time, if it turned them off the first time)  I enjoy rust and I write as many of my personal projects in it as I can.<p>Here&#x27;s a quote that really resonated with my early experience with the language:<p><pre><code>  &quot;However many of these [common rust patterns] are by convention, rather than by language design. Their prevalence depends in part on the authors&#x27; stylistic choice. This meant I was more reliant on examples and documentation than I am perhaps accustomed to.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI find, even today, it&#x27;s impossible to check documentation or read &quot;the book&quot;, alone, and produce idiomatic rust code.  Finally one breaks down and asks on Stack Overflow or one of chat or forum outlets and receives an answer which (almost always accidentally) comes across as, &quot;Oh, didn&#x27;t you know it??  We always express those ideas in this format here [example code]&quot;.  I&#x27;ve come to accept and appreciate this way.
