You literally could go out, borrow your friend&#x27;s crate of 10,000 bananas, sell them on the open market, then wait for the price of bananas to crash, and then buy them back (maybe even the same crate!) and give them back to your friend, plus whatever the banana margin costs. Effectively, if you were to do this at scale, you would directly be influencing the price of goods at Walmart. Mechanically, this isn&#x27;t how it works, and I don&#x27;t think there are banana futures and options, but thinking that all derivatives activity is speculation is simply na√Øve.<p>On the GameStop excitement, all I have to say is...<p>&quot;Apes, together.. strong.&quot;')
