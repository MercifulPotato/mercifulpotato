The ecology of science education misconceptions is a wild and wonderful thing.  My best laugh of yesterday was this page[1] from the Stanford Solar Center, saying &quot;It is a common misconception that the Sun is yellow, or orange or even red.&quot;... now look the page header, and at the rest of the site.  Gee, I wonder where students, including astronomy graduate students, might come by such misconceptions??? :) Literal lol.  And yet, that&#x27;s still doing better than many a colorful NASA and solar observatory outreach site, that don&#x27;t even manage that sentence.<p>I wonder, if a simple CSS radial gradient was available, to easily create a realistic image of the Sun, might people (someone; anyone) use that instead of the usual yellow circles and assorted misleading colorfulness?  Something like [2], but for its suboptimal choice of white point (so whiter in the center), and maybe the rim edge isn&#x27;t quite right.  Perhaps homeschoolers might pick it up if it was posted... somewhere?<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;solar-center.stanford.edu&#x2F;SID&#x2F;activities&#x2F;SunDetermine.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;solar-center.stanford.edu&#x2F;SID&#x2F;activities&#x2F;SunDetermine...</a> [2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;space.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;16622&#x2F;need-help-simulating-solar-limb-darkening&#x2F;16639#16639" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;space.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;16622&#x2F;need-help-si...</a>')
