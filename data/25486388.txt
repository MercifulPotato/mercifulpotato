I think you answered your own question - JavaScript&#x27;s strengths are being very widespread in current software development and having a minimal syntax&#x2F;type system. IMO it can be a good language for MVPs&#x2F;POCs and serve as a higher form of pseudocode. Perhaps the author&#x27;s choice of JS as a way of reaching the widest possible audience and focusing on the concepts more than the implementation details.<p>A relatively recent personal example: in working through some DSL and parser combinator examples in Rust, sometimes I get too distracted with lifetimes, annotations to deal with deeply recursive functions, etc. and just search for examples in a different language that allow me to focus on the concepts I&#x27;m trying to learn.')
