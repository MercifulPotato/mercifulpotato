Item(by='dpc_pw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603302717, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24845478, text='&gt; here is decades of system development behind the C&#x2F;C++ ecosystem and coming onto a C&#x2F;C++ thread (about a package manager) and calling things a &quot;shitshow&quot; is not going to win people over.<p>But it is as shitshow. Pretty much everything in system programming is a shitshow.  From the moment you boot up a computer, it&#x27;s just continous stream of bad ideas, lack of foresight, incidental architectures, hacks, bugs and workarounds all glued together with a duct-tape. That&#x27;s what system development really is.<p>Everything we do in mainstream system computing is a shitshow. The fact that people are afraid to put any computer to handle public Internet traffic is a shitshow. It&#x27;s a shitshow, everybody knows it&#x27;s a shitshow and we even have whole mature industries sucking out a lot of money out of economy to deal with that shitshow.<p>Anyone that can&#x27;t see it&#x27;s a shitshow can&#x27;t really be &quot;won over&quot;. They will happily live their lives being quite skilled at navigating this shitshow, and repeating stuff like &quot;UB is not a problem&quot;, &quot;security bugs are only problem of bad developers&quot;, &quot;modern C++ is mostly-safe&quot;, and so on.<p>The biggest shitshow... the meta-shitshow here, is how many people in systems development can&#x27;t see it&#x27;s a shitshow. They never ventured to investigate ideas from outside of the Unix&#x2F;C&#x2F;C++ bubble and tried to incorporate it into systems programming.<p>And just to be clear... Rust is not completely shitshow-free, and is just a small pocket of almost-shitshow-free environment in a vast shitshow ocean.')
