These publications are not only read by specialists in the field.  I use automatic differentiation in my daily work, but I&#x27;m not familiar with machine learning.  Thus I am very confused when &quot;backpropagation&quot; is used to mean an optimization algorithm.<p>EDIT:  It is as if physicists used the term &quot;special relativity&quot; to talk about &quot;quantum mechanics&quot; because, after all, quantum mechanics happens in Lorentzian spacetime.  Now for specialists of quantum physics it may make sense, since they are using &quot;special relativity&quot; to distinguish it from fancier quantum theories that combine field theory with GR.  But for normal people it would be certainly misleading.  Using &quot;backpropagation&quot; to include optimization has the same feeling.')
