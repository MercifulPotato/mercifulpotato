There are no images, so including alt descriptions isn&#x27;t even a concern. There&#x27;s no CSS, so you can&#x27;t make controls that visually look like check boxes, but are much less accessible. In fact, it&#x27;s way harder to make an inaccessible Gemini site than to make an inaccessible website. The only gripe I have is the possibility to introduce ASCII diagrams, which usually aren&#x27;t accessible.<p>The provides an alt text tag to preformatted text blocks for this purpose:<p>&gt; Any text following the leading &quot;```&quot; of a preformat toggle line which toggles preformatted mode on MAY be interpreted by the client as &quot;alt text&quot; pertaining to the preformatted text lines which follow the toggle line. Use of alt text is at the client&#x27;s discretion, and simple clients may ignore it. Alt text is recommended for ASCII art or similar non-textual content which, for example, cannot be meaningfully understood when rendered through a screen reader or usefully indexed by a search engine.')
