With automation, those limitations no longer apply.<p>For an example of what I&#x27;m thinking of, look at air to air missiles. Sidewinder air-to-air missiles achieve an acceleration of 20g, far more than a human pilot can withstand. Drones in the air superiority role could likewise be designed more like larger, more advanced missiles than traditional aircraft.<p>I suspect that if engineers design combat aircraft to be pilotless, you&#x27;ll soon see them executing maneuvers that would be far too punishing if the craft had to support a human pilot.')
