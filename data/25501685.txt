If certain types should not be serialized beyond a certain depth, the config should be per type, not on the whole serialization.<p>Or leave it as it is and expect the user to map the complex values into hashtables. Eg in your example, make the user pipe the objects through `%{ @{ Name = $_.Name; Mode = $_.Mode; } }` first.<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t know about other PS users, but all my command-lines that ended with ConvertTo-Json either started with ConvertFrom-Json (transforming an existing JSON file), or started with HashTables (building a JSON file from scratch) or a mix of the two. Therefore I always wanted everything to be serialized, and the `-Depth` parameter was always a nuisance.')
