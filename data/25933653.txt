I have a Galago Pro from 2017ish I got from System76. It&#x27;s a 13&quot; form factor with a 3200x1800 display, which I find quite detailed.<p>I&#x27;ll echo the frustrations of other folk in the thread when using the device with an external monitor; at the time, the DPI scaling was a mess between the internal display and the external 4k I used for programming. It has been a couple years since I&#x27;ve tried that setup, so it&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s improved since then.<p>I will say I&#x27;ve enjoyed the roadmap System76 has had for PopOS, including their work on HiDPI quality-of-life improvements.')
