In Bangladesh, we have strong norms in favor of marriage and strong taboos against divorce. There is a whole social infrastructure for helping people enter marriage with realistic notions and expectations, and counseling couples through rough patches. It&#x27;s not perfect by any means, but strong family and community bonds make life tolerable in a desperately poor country. And of course, unlike the United States, we can&#x27;t afford to just throw government money at the problems created by out-of-wedlock births, marriages dissolving over solvable problems, etc.<p>It&#x27;s truly not clear to me that the choice we made in America is the correct one. My wife&#x27;s family is full of wonderful and loving people, they are suffering from our country&#x27;s social dissolution (which has hit non-college educated people outside major metro areas especially hard). <i>Nearly everyone</i> is divorced, often several times over. Grandparents raise their grandchildren. Fathers are in some cases are absent entirely. Children grow up without stability. And now folks are getting close to retirement age with divorces having devastated their finances.')
