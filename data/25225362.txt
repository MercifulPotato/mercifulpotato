If you “upgrade” from Enigmail, it will try to import your keychain. Now you have two keychains :( Of course, if you’ve detached your primary key, the import will fail (in a very unclear way), so you have your GPG keychain and a half-baked duplicate of it in Thunderbird. Then the UI for encrypting and signing mail is hidden away in a menu somewhere, so I forget to turn it off when I don’t want it (some legacy systems don’t react well to the “weird” attachments). When I do want it, it magically knows my passphrase and encrypts&#x2F;decrypts&#x2F;signs automatically, whether it’s me at the helm or not. So much for security at rest.<p>Honestly, I was <i>really</i> frustrated and disappointed by the upgrade. It’s not easy to roll it back, either, apparently. I haven’t risked it, but I sorely miss TB68 with Enigmail.')
