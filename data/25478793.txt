But then, California is larger than many countries. Is it really so inappropriate for California to consider taking even small steps towards ... well at this rate not decreasing inequality, but marginally slowing its rate of increase?<p>To me, the crazy part of this isn&#x27;t the idea of a wealth tax, nor the fact that it includes a prorated tax for part-time residents. (If anything, it&#x27;s weird that ordinarily we expect that the first 89 days per year of your involvement in any state are &quot;free&quot; for income purposes, but not for consumption taxes.) To me the crazy part is that we&#x27;re willing to begin this conversation without first getting rid of prop 13. If the motivation is to decrease actual economic equality, how on earth do we justify this policy that allows people to pretend that their most valuable assets are worth far less than their actual value?')
