The MPLA?<p>&gt; African writers in Britain and Africa, respectively, write to disparage the export of the Black American anti-colonial perspective<p>Is this new?  The South Africans had Buthelezi to go around the world criticizing the anti-apartheid movement, and there were ones before that.<p>Benedict Arnold ended up not sharing the anti-colonial attitude of his fellow Americans.  Nor did Vidkun Quisling of his fellow Norwegians share anti-colonial attitudes.  We are not unaware these people exist.')
