My GP had one look and realised it was gout (red inflammation is a giveaway). Anyway, I just took Ibuprofen and lots of liquid for a few days and it went away.<p>I&#x27;ve had a few minor bouts of it that seem to be brought on by either eating asparagus or mackerel or not drinking enough water, so I tried the cherry juice for a while which seemed to work. After a year or so of that, I thought I&#x27;d just try drinking more water instead - that works most of the time though I did have a minor gout episode just last week.')
