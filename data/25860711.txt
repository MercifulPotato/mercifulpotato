Likewise, observing that not only exhibit A has property P but also exhibits C, D, and E is no proof that property P is irrelevant with respect to A.<p>&quot;Democracy&quot;, &quot;freedom&quot;, &quot;the law&quot;, &quot;the economy&quot;â€”all of these terms are in the realm of Philosophy and are subject to philosophical discussion, as they ought; none of these is not highly relevant in a universal, everyday, hands-on sense. Likewise, that meat production is wasteful doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a good idea to add yet another wasteful item to a place characterized by finite resources.')
