I find TS much more easy to refactor because since the structural typing basically just says, for example, &quot;This method argument needs to have these properties of these types&quot;, if I find out &quot;Uh oh, this method actually needs one more piece of data&quot;, in Java I&#x27;d have to change the definition of the type that was passed in which could have lots more unintended side-effects, while in TS I can essentially &quot;localize&quot; my changes just to wherever I call that method.<p>The &quot;blast radius&quot; if you will with nominal type systems is just always much larger.')
