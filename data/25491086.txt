I think it&#x27;s biggest weak point is suffering from lack of recent support&#x2F;ecosystem that hype usually brings.<p>The ability to use your frontend framework of choice (Angular, Vue, Svelte, Vanilla JS) is awesome, and I think can be incredibly productive for businesses (turn your frontend devs into mobile devs).')
