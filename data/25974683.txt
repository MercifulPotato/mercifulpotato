At least, that&#x27;s the authors&#x27; claim.<p>But what it means to &quot;share facts&quot; in these studies is not what you might anticipate. In Study 5, for example, participants speak with someone who disagrees with them about gun control. In the article, we&#x27;re told that these interlocutors &quot;offered either personal experiences or shared factual knowledge to support that stance.&quot; But the Supporting Information (which is separate from the article) shows what the interlocutors really said:<p>&gt; Well, I do think you’re wrong about gun policy. I am [for&#x2F;against] gun control, and I feel pretty strongly about that. I don’t know how you can call yourself an American if you don’t think that guns [hurt people and communities&#x2F;keep our communities safe]. I believe this because I have read many books and governmental reports on gun policy, so my factual knowledge has really made me feel strongly about this. [1]<p>The interlocutor claims to be basing his views on &quot;factual knowledge,&quot; but no actual facts are offered. To me, this seems a bad way to study the effects of fact-giving in discussions. If you want to do that, you should...study discussions in which facts are given.<p>Study 4 is similar in this respect. Then again, in the authors&#x27; defense, there&#x27;s more to the article than these two studies.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;pnas&#x2F;suppl&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;25&#x2F;2008389118.DCSupplemental&#x2F;pnas.2008389118.sapp.pdf#page=6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;pnas&#x2F;suppl&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;25&#x2F;200838911...</a>')
