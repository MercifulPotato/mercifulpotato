Nothing I see people today complaining about compares to the essential small-town experience of your church community (i. e. &quot;the town&quot;) ostracising you for wearing white after Labor day, or having disabled child, or being too friendly to &lt;anyone they don&#x27;t like&gt;.<p>If you didn&#x27;t like it, you could move to a different small-town. As I understand it, that was a strong motivator for many people to move to the new world, that they could live in a different way that they wanted to.<p>But you can&#x27;t move out of the global village.')
