Item(by='ricardobeat', descendants=None, kids=[25799510, 25800980, 25799272], score=None, time=1610761654, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25798538, text='&gt; the masks perform as well as ones without the valve<p>&gt; CDC now says valved N95 has better source control than cloth&#x2F;surgical masks<p>There&#x27;s quite a difference between <i>as well as</i> and <i>better than</i>. I think that qualifies as editorializing, which is discouraged by HN guidelines.<p>&gt; penetration goes up to 76% when considering fit<p>They quote a separate study for that. The numbers from their own testing are 2%-17% for surgical masks, and fit doesn&#x27;t seem to be factored in for the FFR ones - all the testing was done completely sealing the mask edges. On top of that, most of the FFR models perform <i>worse</i> than the 17% baseline, as seen in Figure 5.<p>My last point was: what can be the physical explanation for a covered valve performing <i>better</i> than not having a valve? The numbers are there for the specific model that achieved it, yes, but I&#x27;m surprised there is no hypothesis put forward.<p>EDIT: I looked into the study where the 76% figure comes from: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.isrp.com&#x2F;the-isrp-journal&#x2F;journal-public-abstracts&#x2F;1150-vol-26-no-3-2009-pp-54-70-rengasamy-open-access&#x2F;file" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.isrp.com&#x2F;the-isrp-journal&#x2F;journal-public-abstrac...</a> - again ranges don&#x27;t tell the truth, a single model tested went into the 76% range, most stayed around 20%.<p>In addition to that, the study says &quot;76% when considering fit [Rengasamy et al. 2009]&quot; but the results in the 2009 article are also from a mask sealed around the edges, they didn&#x27;t actually test for fit.<p>Enough masks for a day now... these inconsistencies just trigger my curiosity.')
