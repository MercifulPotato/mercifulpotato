Try again. Like, they aren&#x27;t even comparable. Trump told these people to gather, on a lie, and fed them nonsense.<p>Bringing up BLM as a counterpoint to these terrorists is the weakest argument I&#x27;ve heard in a long time. Whataboutism to the max. Pathetic. There is exactly 0 connection to the two events, yet you people seem to keep bringing it up to distract from the right-wing terrorism you seem to support.<p>Also, the looters during BLM were not connected to the message - they were thugs looking to take advantage. Not the same of last week. But, you must have known that, right? Since it&#x27;s pretty basic knowledge. Ignorance is bliss, I guess, right?')
