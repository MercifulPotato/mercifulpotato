I mean, excel does work so well for so many—even unintended—applications that the users expect unlimited magic in all things computer and fail to understand why new limitations may be imposed when they want their workflow simplified and it can’t “just work” no matter what.<p>(Forgive any latent frustration making its way into that comment, the project I’m referring to has felt nothing short of Sisyphean while a new application in the space of it would be quite simple to develop)')
