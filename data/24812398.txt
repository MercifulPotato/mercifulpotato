The current political economy is based on a false idea of material abundance. We call it pseudo-abundance. It is based on a commitment to permanent growth, the infinite accumulation of capital and debt-driven dynamics through compound interest. This is unsustainable, of course, because infinite growth is logically and physically impossible in any physically constrained, finite system.<p>2. The current political economy is based on a false idea of “immaterial scarcity.” It believes that an exaggerated set of intellectual property monopolies – for copyrights, trademarks and patents – should restrain the sharing of scientific, social and economic innovations. Hence the system discourages human cooperation, excludes many people from benefiting from innovation and slows the collective learning of humanity. In an age of grave global challenges, <i>the political economy keeps many practical alternatives sequestered behind private firewalls or unfunded if they cannot generate adequate profits.</i>&quot;<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.p2pfoundation.net&#x2F;artificial-abundance-and-artificial-scarcity&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;21" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.p2pfoundation.net&#x2F;artificial-abundance-and-arti...</a><p>Does that help you understand my argument?')
