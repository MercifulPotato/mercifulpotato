Item(by='lucideer', descendants=None, kids=[24768015], score=None, time=1602608015, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24766583, text='&gt; <i>are different browsers not allowed to be different?</i><p>The web (and open standardisation in general) has pioneered an ecosystem where the primary differentiation between browser is in user-facing UX &amp; features (and ancillary factors such as performance, etc.), rather than developer-facing web-tech support.<p>This is quite different to a lot of other commercial &quot;competitive&quot; spaces as it substitutes vendor lock-in on patents &amp; trade-secrets for actual innovation in the user-facing space. It&#x27;s not all rosy: competing browsers still stray from this on the regular, but the ideal is one of the primary selling points of the web as a platform.<p>Browsers differentiating themselves on user features while maintaining cross-competitor consistency on web standards is the dream that differentiates the web, so seeing its erosion is something to call out.<p>&gt; <i>Like if Firefox didn&#x27;t want to implement WebUSB, Safari didn&#x27;t want to implement WebPush, or Lynx didn&#x27;t want to implement Canvas is that outrageous?</i><p>What&#x27;s particularly different here is that this isn&#x27;t about the addition of a feature. The ticket opened is about adding XPath2 support but the quoted line is about removing existing XML support.<p>This may sound a bit like I&#x27;m supporting Microsoft&#x27;s old &quot;don&#x27;t break the web&quot; adage, but the big difference here is MS was reluctant to remove features competitors didn&#x27;t have for fear of breaking IE-only websites (that had relied on them due to IE&#x27;s dominance). This is about Chrome removing standardised features that browsers, servers, and applications of all varieties have supported interoperably for decades.')
