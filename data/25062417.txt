You realize Apple <i>does</i> put dedicated AMD GPUs in their Macbook Pros?<p>The Radeon Pro 5600M with 8GB of HBM2 has a pretty significant power envelope, and is coupled to 6 or 8 core Intel H series that are equally power hungry.<p>The fact 16&quot; MBPs are undercooled is beyond the point. Apple ships laptops with a ~95W TDP. Why would they not ship a SoC with 16&#x2F;24&#x2F;32 graphics units for high-end laptops and iMacs?')
