Is it even being maintained anymore?<p>I see they&#x27;re pushing one release a year. Last release was in April&#x2F;May.<p>I hope it&#x27;s being maintained.<p>At this point, I view jQuery as a foundational library.<p>I know newer versions of HTML and browser APIs are replacing some of the need for jQuery. But its ergonomics are universally understood. For me that&#x27;s as important as the APIs themselves.<p>And I don&#x27;t trust browser vendors to maintain uniformity long-term. Too many egos involved.<p>I hope jQuery never dies.')
