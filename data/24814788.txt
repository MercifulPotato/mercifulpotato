A population-wide case fatality rate of 0.05% is lower than seasonal influenza. If that is the true rate, locking down the world with potentially tremendous social and financial consequences may be totally irrational. It’s like an elephant being attacked by a house cat. Frustrated and trying to avoid the cat, the elephant accidentally jumps off a cliff and dies.<p>&gt; Could the Covid-19 case fatality rate be that low? No, some say, pointing to the high rate in elderly people. However, even some so-called mild or common-cold-type coronaviruses that have been known for decades can have case fatality rates as high as 8% when they infect elderly people in nursing homes. In fact, such “mild” coronaviruses infect tens of millions of people every year, and account for 3% to 11% of those hospitalized in the U.S. with lower respiratory infections each winter.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statnews.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;17&#x2F;a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statnews.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;17&#x2F;a-fiasco-in-the-making-a...</a><p>He was one of the big sources of credibility for people that extrapolated that to &quot;just a normal flu&quot;.<p>&gt;  If he says the IFR is 0.27% and it is really 0.6% that is only off by 0.33. Anyone who thought it was 1.5% or 3% would&#x27;ve been off by a much higher amount.<p>Remember he was against most actions at the worst time for people being unprepared and hospitals potentially getting overwhelmed.
