It comes with the twin downsides of wholly different categories of errors cropping up, and with the lack of a universally agreed upon tool for human entry.<p>Perhaps text was a fashion, though. I definitely have had thoughts in that vein lately. And in that case we shouldn&#x27;t always be rushing to use it as the source of truth when we have many good, machine-level agreements about numeric formats.')
