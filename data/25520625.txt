Robinhood, instead, will go with the $99.99 offer if that seller offers them more money.<p>You were willing to pay $100, so from your point of view you weren&#x27;t &quot;harmed&quot; either way, <i>but</i> with the traditional broker you saved $2&#x2F;share, and with Robinhood all the savings went to them.<p>Generally, brokers are either required to go with the best offer, or, if they don&#x27;t, explain to customers that they don&#x27;t and why. Robinhood violated that rule by marketing themselves and going with the best offers (but actually did the opposite) and that&#x27;s what the SEC is fining them for.')
