The barriers&#x27; main function is to open or close. Someone needs to assess and predict rising water levels, but a lot of that is surely done by other systems. Add in some speed adjustments and some docking&#x2F;aligning adjustments to get everything to shut just so -- and it still sounds far simpler than an iPhone camera.<p>The civil engineering challenge is huge. But I&#x27;m not seeing a huge need for the very high end of modern computing power to make it all work.')
