I find it cheap for something that works perfectly, across any device&#x2F;OS and never fails, never breaks, and is extremely fast (insanely fast).<p>The only way one would prefer something half-baked just because it&#x27;s &quot;free&quot; is if they don&#x27;t really care about robustness and dependability.<p>That said, maybe the current Covid crisis is hurting them more than others. I used to travel a lot and leave machines in different places instead of carrying a laptop everywhere. Now that I don&#x27;t travel, &quot;magic sync&quot; is much less useful.')
