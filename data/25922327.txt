There&#x27;s all sorts of prejudice, and some of it&#x27;s not illegal, or even bad.  But in normal usage, it&#x27;s understood to be referring to unsavory prejudices against sex, race, etc.<p>Every publisher censors, and it&#x27;s fine.  That&#x27;s part of their job.  Censorship by the government, without or without the backing of law, is abhorrent (and I think that&#x27;s what the term is normally understood to mean).<p>The muddied part are these huge enterprises that aren&#x27;t part of the government, and yet whose actions against the public _feel_ like government dictates to the common man.  Not decisions made between two people, like a publisher and an author... but a rule enforced by a faceless entity of overwhelming power.<p>I&#x27;m torn on the matter.  I despise Twitter to the degree that I think negatively of anybody defending their behavior.  However, I also don&#x27;t want the government making laws controlling what Twitter is forced to host on their own servers.<p>Pox on both their houses.')
