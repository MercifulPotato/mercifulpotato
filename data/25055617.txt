But that is kind of how things go: part of the d20 system&#x27;s charm is that it successfully approximates the absurd range and randomness inherent in ordinary life.<p>Sometimes you get a company that gets offended at the prospect of negotiation - that&#x27;s a 1, although if you get an offer rescinded like that it&#x27;s probably good for you in the long run.<p>Sometimes you throw out a ridiculous number for whatever reason and the other side says, &quot;mmmm...yeah, okay.&quot; That&#x27;s a 20.
