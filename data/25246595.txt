They are just a way to store energy.<p>&gt; So when a solar or wind powered off grid home uses batteries to store solar energy for later usage is that 100% renewable energy as long as the power is originally from sunlight?<p>Sure, why not?<p>&gt; Don’t get me wrong, it’s easy to disagree with the common definitions. However, as long as the definitions used are common and describe the situation you can’t say they are lying.<p>I don’t know about that. It seems quite hard to disagree with the common definition. It seems very apt. The definition you seem to defend on the other hand seems like meaningless political drivel.')
