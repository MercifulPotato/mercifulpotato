Even something as simple as the fact the rPI form factor has been fairly consistent for a while is a huge boon to people just trying to start with this stuff.<p>I could give my mom a rPI and a $20 starter kit and she could probably get to the point of a working PC.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t dream of that with anything else. The fact it&#x27;s Broadcom based is a little unfortunate but that ship has sailed and the ecosystem around it now trounces any benefit of alternatives for the actual people using them. Not embedded engineers who say it&#x27;s crap because they wouldn&#x27;t make a custom product based on that SoC.<p>-<p>This is like when people point out that for half the price of an Arduino Uno you can get an STM32 board that will run circles around a dinky ATmega328.<p>It&#x27;s not about the power or &quot;objective goodness&quot;, even the header layout of the Uno lets beginners use an insane wealth of peripherals designed for it')
