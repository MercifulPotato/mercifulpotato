The pi is still limited to ~ 15w.<p>When you get to the pc ecosystem, and it&#x27;s really just a bit more expensive, you get a step up in capabilities.  You get all the voltages.  You can get a 300w or a 1500w power supply.<p>You can add a graphics card.<p>You can put it in a case that has room for more than just the board.  Say, I&#x2F;O?<p>I wish the pi had a nice metal case that had a 2x the width allowing for an enclosed breadboard or the like.  Or a case with all the connectors on one side.<p>&gt; Pi 4 has pci-express, no?<p>really? where is the slot?  (I said not compute)  ;)<p>btw, I&#x27;m not anti-pi, the opposite in fact.<p>Maybe I could say it in another way -- what if you could have an itx form-factor pi?  I think that would be very exciting.')
