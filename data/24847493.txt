And that is where the problems usually start.<p>The reality is, not everyone agrees what the reality is and especially a company which takes licenses serious will be very careful to check, whether using GPL code is possible in a project.<p>And no, we don&#x27;t need another license, there are plenty of licenses available which resolve the issues. Be it the permissive licenses (MIT, BSD, ...) or GPL with linking exceptions.')
