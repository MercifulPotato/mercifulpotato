Item(by='s0rce', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609354129, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25582353, text='Ebay has lots of junk (the worst being the people who drop ship items from Amazon marked up or just outright scams) but its also a source of really good deals that you really can&#x27;t find elsewhere. Refurbished PCs, obscure electronics, mechanical and pneumatic fittings, lots of stuff I order for work to test&#x2F;prototype which can save $100s-$1000s.<p>I also use ebay for various antique&#x2F;vintage stuff (only &lt;$100). Seems like overall a positive experience and the few times I&#x27;ve had issues I&#x27;ve always got my money back and the scammers account was closed, although I&#x27;m sure they just pop up again under a new name.')
