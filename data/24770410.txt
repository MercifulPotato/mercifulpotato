The amount banks have to keep in reserve is set, but it changes. They can lend the balance after that, although there&#x27;s a rate set by the fed that also works as a lending&#x2F;holding incentive too.<p>&quot;Excess reserves are capital reserves held by a bank or financial institution in excess of what is required by regulators, creditors or internal controls.
