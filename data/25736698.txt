I burned ~60 hours in cyberpunk on a ps4 pro, the content of the game was fun - but the bugs were pretty dumb.  Many of the worst bugs originated in story pathways that would only be triggered if various conditions had occurred (which undoubtedly changed during development).<p>From a testing perspective It seems like it would require an impossible amount of QA time to vet all of the quest paths as a player, and it would be easy to miss game breaking bugs if QA testers were using manipulated save files.  Issues like the bad police AI only crop up once in the main game, but are pretty noticeable throughout free roam.<p>If players want games to get bigger, will we need smarter and more automated QA tools? what would these look like?')
