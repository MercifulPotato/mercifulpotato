There are a lot of vegetarian farmers in India, who I&#x27;m sure are not presumptuous enough to think they are &#x27;part of the solution&#x27;. For some meat eaters the idea of vegetarianism brings out strong reactions. If you are guilty just deal with it. People have their own reasons for being vegetarian and most don&#x27;t judge and don&#x27;t care.')
