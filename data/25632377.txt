The first of which being the push in the back to change my approach drastically and obsess on the product much more than on the technical beauty.<p>I&#x27;m not kidding, but this morning I went with an axe through the backlogs and have pushed back so many tasks that I was emotionally attached to. Now, the &quot;MVP MUST&quot; version is planned for the end of this month rather than March.<p>A change of mentality really makes you see things very differently.<p>Anyways, it was time for the madness to end.. right? ;-)<p>Thanks again!')
