If there are patterns, which could lead to compression tricks, it&#x27;s not random anymore.<p>Primitive runs like 0000000 are compressible patterns. Other patterns similarly, like 01010101, or 00110001110011. That&#x27;s why you check generators visually by printing out bitmaps, and ideally by running it through a couple of compressors. Afaik this is not yet done by the 4 most common PRNG testsuites yet, but I&#x27;m working on it.')
