Free online resources like Wikipedia provide more comprehensive, current and accessible reference material than small local libraries, and non-free academic research databases provide more accessible, and arguably more comprehensive and current, reference material than any single physical library. As the parent recognised, there are still many books that haven’t been digitised, but it is not fair to compare the set of freely available online resources to the set of all copyrighted works you could eventually get your hands on via an inter-library loan. The fact that libraries need to pay for these books, and readers need to return them after a short time, makes them much less “accessible” than online alternatives.')
