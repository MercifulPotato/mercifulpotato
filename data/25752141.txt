If the mother-glass is some compatible multiple of 16:9 in order to cut full-size (40&quot; and above) TV&#x27;s from, maybe cutting 16:10 14&quot; laptop displays from it wastes more glass than cutting 16:9 14&quot; displays from it?<p>At any rate, it seems like we all agree that 16:9 is a rubbish aspect ratio for a laptop screen. I can&#x27;t wait for Lenovo to release a 16:10 version of my X1 extreme.')
