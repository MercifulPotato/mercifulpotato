I remember reading in Ready Player One about IOI controlling most people&#x27;s internet connections and mentally drawing a parallel to Google at the time, thinking that would be a huge monopoly if Google not only served the online services, the laptop hardware, the laptop software, and now also the uplink itself. And indeed, a few months after I read the book, they announced the fiber project. Then Google and Facebook were going to give people in Africa internet with balloons and stuff. Now we can add this initiative.<p>It&#x27;s really getting there: ISPs are shifting from a specialized business (they may do TV, web hosting, etc. as well, but it&#x27;s always related services together) to something that comes bundled with your favorite ad service. They have the money to outcompete any existing ISP they like, so long as they somehow manage to dodge anti-anticompetition laws they can really give the non-ad-supported services a tough time. Ads is were we&#x27;re headed, it would seem.')
