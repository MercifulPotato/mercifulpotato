In the US there is something called &quot;US Export Law&quot;, the law includes declarations that makes companies unable to sell services&#x2F;goods to certain countries (which spoiler, Iran is part of that list).<p>The law itself is not illegal, as the lawmakers have created and enacted that law. It&#x27;s the opposite, the law is declaring what&#x27;s illegal.<p>So, if GitHub doesn&#x27;t ban users from Iran, they are breaking the law in the US.<p>Hope this clears up any misunderstanding on how things work.')
