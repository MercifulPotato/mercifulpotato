I am staying far away from all countries that treated their citizen like prisoners until the pandemic is over â€” and I have forever lost respect for quite a few countries due to this.<p>I had the misfortune of getting stuck in Singapore on a 3-day business trip when things got locked down, and it turned into a 4 month miserable ordeal of house arrest and quarantines before I was able to make it back to my much more reasonable home of Hong Kong. Truly, from the bottom of my heart, fuck Singapore&#x27;s lockdown.')
