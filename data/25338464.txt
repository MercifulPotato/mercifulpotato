(Job postings are almost universally terrible. Why is everyone so bad at it? I don&#x27;t want to hear excuses like &quot;HR&quot;. If hiring engineers is crucial for the company, then you need to fight HR.) You may need to interview only 1 or 2.<p>Don&#x27;t &quot;screen&quot; a bunch of people. That&#x27;s a giant waste of everyone&#x27;s time, both employers and candidates. Start at the top of your list, and only interview your top candidates. Spend the time to research those few individuals — even before you interview them — instead of spreading out your time relatively equally on a large number of candidates.')
