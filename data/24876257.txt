Item(by='vl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603504231, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24873572, text='&gt; but its interesting to look back at how we got here.<p>Oh, please, I worked at Google as well, and this is typical Google’s inability to have attention span and coherent leadership for anything longer than 6 months. One VP did one thing, then another one another, then it turned out that it’s stupid and inconsistent. As. with. any. other. non-core product! Basically Google’s top leadership doesn’t care enough to impose coherent strategy across different divisions, and thing like this happen all the time (Android&#x2F;Chrome OS, Chat&#x2F;GVC&#x2F;Hangouts&#x2F;Allo&#x2F;Duo&#x2F;RCS&#x2F;Meet, Gmail&#x2F;Inbox, Nest&#x2F;Google Home, and so on).')
