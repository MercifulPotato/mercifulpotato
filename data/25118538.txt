Theories are like specification of an interface of a programing module, and models are actual implementation of said modules. If one can implement an interface to satisfy all requirements of the specification (that is, all the axioms and theorem that the axioms entail), existence of such implementation shows that the specification is self-consistent: in math, we say that theories that have a model are consistent. What Goedel&#x27;s <i>completeness</i> theorem says is the converse: consistent theories always have a model; in programming talk, non-contradictory specification can always be implemented.<p>Here&#x27;s why it means that &quot;all true things are provable&quot;: if something is supposed to be true fact about the theory, it has be a property of every model of said theory, that&#x27;s the lowest bar for any notion of &quot;truth&quot; to make sense. But, one can easily show, using Goedel&#x27;s completeness theorem, that if something is true in every model of the theory, it has to be <i>provable</i>: indeed, suppose that statement f is true in every model of theory T, but is actually not provable from T. We can then extend theory T by statement &quot;not f&quot;, and the resulting theory T&#x27; = {T, &quot;not f&quot;} is still consistent, because for it to be inconsistent means exactly that T could prove both &quot;not f&quot; and &quot;not (not f)&quot;, and the latter is equivalent f, which we assumed T cannot prove. Then, Goedel&#x27;s completeness theorem says that this extended theory, since it&#x27;s consistent, must have a model, M&#x27;. But, a model of this extend theory T&#x27; is also a model of basic theory T; if you implement larger specification, your implementation also implements any subset of it. But f was supposed to be true in every model of T, and so f is true in M&#x27;, but also &quot;not f&quot; is true in M&#x27;, which is a contradiction. Hence, f must be provable from T.<p>Why it doesn&#x27;t conflict with Goedel&#x27;s <i>in</i>-completeness theorem? After all, the Goedel&#x27;s sentence constructed in the proof of Goedel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem is supposed to express something true but not provable. Well, the idea is that it is not true of the <i>theory</i> of natural numbers, but it&#x27;s true of the particular <i>model</i> of natural numbers that we have in mind when we think of what natural numbers are, the so called standard model of natural numbers, where all of the numbers are of the form 0 and, using OPs notation (next (next (next ... (next 0) ... )). As it turns out, there exist other models of natural numbers, which have extra, &quot;non-standard&quot; natural numbers which are <i>not</i> of that form, numbers you cannot reach by just applying successor operation finite number of times starting from 0. These models are really weird, but they still must abide all provable rules of the behavior of natural numbers. One can still add them, there must be some &quot;prime&quot; non-standard numbers that aren&#x27;t products of any smaller numbers, the non-standard numbers must also split into unique product of prime numbers (some of which must necessarily also be non-standard), and so on. This is all crazy, and can make your mind twist, so only think about it at your own peril.<p>To sum up, the notion of &quot;truth&quot; with respect to theories coincides with provability, but not so when you start talking about things true in particular models. This means that we cannot describe all true things about specific models, and in particular about standard natural numbers, using standard logic, but if something does follow from the theory and is true in every of its models, it is in fact provable.')
