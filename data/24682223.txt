I have had some meaningful conversations while WFH, but only with direct team-members, and only people I knew while in the office. I used to sit next to a guy in another org who was really interesting, and since WFH started I don&#x27;t see&#x2F;hear him at all.<p>2. My large company had a relatively successful transition to full WFH, but as time goes on and we hire new people, I foresee a lot of trouble in maintaining healthy team dynamics. It seems like a lot of the success in the transition was based on the presence of already existing, successful teams. I wonder if teams would develop and mature with the same success if they began in a full WFH setting.')
