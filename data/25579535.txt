Sometimes I get a message and feel lukewarm about it, ignoring it entirely, but by the follow-up have definitely made up my mind. Other times, I intend to get to a message but just fail to because of ADHD or life events and a follow-up is a convenient reminder.<p>If I dont like the message, the delete button takes a fraction of a second (my mail client [spark] makes it easy to actually just select a ton of emails at once and mass-delete) so it&#x27;s really not an inconvenience to me at all. If I despise the message, the spam button also exists.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the big fuss is people make about email all the time, but I&#x27;m thinking it might be time to just reassess how you manage your emails rather than blaming the people sending the messages.')
