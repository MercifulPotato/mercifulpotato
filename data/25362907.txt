Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607540948, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25360126, text='&gt; But the different divisions don&#x27;t talk to each other as much as you&#x27;d think. Why should they?<p>Because they are a customer with real world usage?<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is asking for &quot;special access&quot; or &quot;special Google only APIs&quot; or anything like that. <i>However</i>, if the Angular team isn&#x27;t even looking at how parts of Google themselves are using their framework in out-of-the-box configurations and making the Framework look terrible on performance at scale, then is the Angular team looking at <i>any</i> customer&#x27;s performance?<p>Facebook and Microsoft here both make a huge deal of dogfooding one&#x27;s own frameworks because when you are your own first customer you get a lot of direct, immediate feedback. There are performance characteristics of today&#x27;s React that we know come from needing to work at Facebook scale. There are performance fixes to Typescript that we see get mentioned that Microsoft internal teams experienced pain points with and let the Typescript team know that a hand would be useful there.<p>At least from external appearances, almost all of Google&#x27;s largest scale usages of Angular perform poorly. I don&#x27;t understand how anyone would <i>want</i> to use Angular knowing that even Google can&#x27;t get it to perform at scale. That either the Angular team isn&#x27;t prioritizing performance at scale or the Angular team has built it in such a way that even supposedly smart people &quot;in the office next door&quot; can&#x27;t figure it out. In neither case does it look good for Angular.<p>What&#x27;s the point of even having the Google name behind the Angular brand if Angular isn&#x27;t taking production performance feedback from Google? (Obviously, it&#x27;s still good marketing because so many people outside Google are using Angular, sometimes against their own better judgment. But it feels like a bait and switch.)')
