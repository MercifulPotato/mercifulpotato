Yet, I can provide Matrix hosting services for you.<p>If you and more of my customers start asking for changes&#x2F;improvements (customizations to the clients, better solutions for storage, different kinds of integrations, etc) I can go and develop the changes myself <i>AND DEPLOY THEM</i> on a server for you to use, without needing to ask permission from any of the Matrix devs or Element or the Foundation.<p>Just a very, very real example: I started looking into how I could integrate Hub20 with a Matrix homeserver to allow people to send&#x2F;receive payments by messaging. It&#x27;s the kind of functionality that would be super interesting for some folks, it does not require change in functionality of the core protocol in any way and it is very aligned with the Hub20&#x27;s principle of facilitating access to crypto for the masses that do not want to deal with the complexities of blockchain&#x2F;wallet&#x2F;etc.<p>Such an integration will never happen on Signal. Signal being centralized, there is no separate instance that could try out this integration, or make it work <i>only</i> for the accounts that it can manage. Telegram is the same, WhatsApp is the same.<p>Instead of looking simply what is given to you &quot;for free&quot; in the different offerings from the market, start looking at what we can build <i>on</i> them. Don&#x27;t let your lack of imagination become everyone else&#x27;s weight to carry.<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;docs.hub20.io')
