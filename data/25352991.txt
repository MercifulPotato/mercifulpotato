Item(by='vosper', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607469885, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25352015, text='&gt; Estimates given by the subject matter expert (the only one who could give an estimate) are way too small because it implies they will be doing the work.<p>If you play the pointing poker game you tell everyone on the team (of people who might have to work on it) to make an estimate, and if they&#x27;re unsure then to estimate high. Then you can take the mean, or the highest estimate, or talk through the concerns and come to some consensus (the consensus includes things like &quot;we need a lot more information before we can estimate&quot; or &quot;we need to break this up more&quot;).<p>If an individual is estimating the level of effort for work that could be given to any number of people then I think the estimation system needs improving.<p>I generally agree with the rest of your comment, though.')
