If just 1.5 voters every hundred had flipped side, Trump would have won. At this point, with the results so close, who wins the elections is basically a coin toss- which arguably isn&#x27;t a terrible thing in democracy, as it means that the parties compete fiercely and almost <i>optimally</i> for votes. But still in the end the outcome of these elections seems due mostly to chance.')
