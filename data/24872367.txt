Superpowers tend to nudge the rest of the world&#x27;s governments to be more like them (see Britain and the US over the last 300 years). Do you want the rest of the world to be more like China or more like the West?<p>China has shown the world what it considers to be acceptable norms of governance: unrepentant, ongoing genocide against the Uigers, snuffing out liberal democracy in Hong Kong, and denying the sovereignty of a liberal neighbor in Taiwan.<p>I&#x27;m fully expecting plenty of whataboutism and false equivalencies in response to this comment and others making a similar point.<p>Believe me, I&#x27;m disappointed in the US and the rest of the West&#x27;s recent slide away from liberal values, and I hope we can start doing better soon, but I encourage onlookers to ask themselves: do you really believe the there&#x27;s no meaningful difference between China&#x27;s vision for the future and the West&#x27;s? No difference between the future each will create for you?')
