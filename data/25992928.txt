While Decriminalization is laudatory and beneficial, it solves far fewer problems than outright legalization.<p>With decriminalization:<p>1) drug users will still not know what they are actually consuming. They can very easily invest drugs heavily mixed with other drugs, or dangerous chemicals.  This will lead to far higher levels of accidental overdoses and is a path to more addictive substances.<p>2) Drug sellers will still be subject to lengthy prison terms. This directly creates to massive amounts of drug violence. If you are a dealer, you will commonly hold large amounts of cash and valuable drugs, making you a prime target for robbery including home invasions.<p>Since you cannot rely on banks to deposit your sales, nor police to protect your property, you will need to be heavily armed.<p>And if you suspect a partner or customer to actually be an informant who can net you a  sentence nearly as long as murder, there is almost no downside to killing them. How many innocent kids have been buried in fields because of the paranoia of their dealer?<p>3) Our individual rights have been reduced significantly because of drug sales  prohibition. Because of the war on drugs, police can get no knock warrants to burst in your house, kill your dogs, maybe even you, and not even apologize when it turns out their “tip” was wrong.<p>If you are driving or flying with a large amount of cash, police can simply take it from you without showing it was linked to any crime, and force you to spend thousands on a lawyer to even have a chance of seeing it returned.<p>Then there are zero tolerance laws that allowed police to seize your property because anyone on it was using drugs.<p>We all pay the price for the drug prohibition, whether we use drugs or not. Time to end it completely.')
