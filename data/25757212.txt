They usually don’t even decide what’s right and wrong. They take what culture has decided is right and wrong and codify it in law. The law is a trailing, not a leading indicator of ethical practice.<p>Do you think planes were falling out of the sky left and right before those air safety laws came into effect? No. The engineers at some companies pushed for sane, safe practices first. Later they were adopted by the industry and later still they were enshrined in law. Before those laws were passed, airlines still had a duty of care to their passengers, ethically and (I think) legally.<p>Likewise it’s up to us to decide what sane, secure software engineering looks like. Not politicians. Not management. It has to be us. Nobody else is qualified to make those choices. At some point those ideas might be codified in law; but we need to figure out what that looks like first. (And to be clear what you’re arguing for - imagine the reverse. Imagine if inventing security best practices was outsourced to politicians!)<p>The idea that management should feel free to steamroll over their own employees’ judgement for the sake of the initiative of the day is toxic. And that’s exactly the sort of work culture which creates global security issues like this one. Of course a balance has to be reached, but you don’t do anyone any favours by being management (and the law’s) highly paid keyboard.')
