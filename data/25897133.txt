Similar to reason the US Navy has been offered a buy 1 get one half off deal for it&#x27;s air craft carriers. Using standardized designs and the same labor force to build multiples of the same thing is exponentially cheaper than doing one off designs&#x2F;contracts.<p>There is of course a limit to this effect, for nuclear there&#x27;s site specific engineering&#x2F;design that has to happen which you don&#x27;t have for ships.<p>But the savings in workforce cost can absolutely be realized in nuclear if a large enough pipeline of projects is developed which it looks like the French power company EDF is doing.')
