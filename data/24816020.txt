This is relatively benign as it is public information. However the site also has the option to request a replacement ballot. When requesting a replacement, the website mentions that if a previous mail-in ballot has not yet been successfully validated, it will be cancelled.<p>My aim is not to spread disinformation here. I have hidden the thread until a reputable source can confirm further as there may be other details I&#x27;m missing. This is not about changing votes, but the replacement of a ballot that can be initiated using very little information, and can cause a person&#x27;s mail-in ballot to be invalidated.')
