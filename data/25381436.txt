There&#x27;s obviously no market research in this topic but the fact that people only go to the App Store to download apps and need an iCloud account to do so makes it pretty apparent that Apple is running things on their phone. People don&#x27;t see that as a problem but only because it hasn&#x27;t directly impacted them, or it has only impacted them in a way that is, in itself, disingenuous (ie piracy) or otherwise not something &lt;society&gt; would back them up on (the break from that being Epic Games&#x27; lawsuit where they were removed for offering direct payment - society&#x2F;their player base is indeed going &quot;yay Epic&quot; and supporting them).')
