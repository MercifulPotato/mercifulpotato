A $25B hedge fund has $25B in assets, but a $25B market cap does not mean that they have access to anywhere near that amount of capital.<p>Sure, maybe they could issue a dilutive follow-on offering and bring in some cash, but who knows where the stock price will be by the time they get through the paperwork on that. And they&#x27;re currently losing about half a billion per year on about $6B in revenue, so I&#x27;m not sure that an extra billion or so in cash is going to fundamentally remake the company....')
