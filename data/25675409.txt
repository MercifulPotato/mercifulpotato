Currently it&#x27;s a free-for-all chaos. Theoretically papers are reproducible from the documentation found in the paper but that is a lie. It is never reproducible just from the paper. Lots of stuff is done in the background that is not known to the reader. For all we know, they can even tweak their numbers to be 2% better and if someone can&#x27;t get the results of the paper from the released code, the authors can just ignore it or say, the problem is not on their side, or that the paper numbers were generated with a slightly different code than the released version etc. I&#x27;ve seen this many times on Github, issues getting closed or deleted without comment etc. There is zero accountability.<p>It&#x27;s slowly changing though but many people are grinding their teeth, because they can&#x27;t torture the data as much if things are out in the open.')
