Gemini is a <i>user-agent</i>, and this time we actually mean it. It&#x27;s <i>not</i> a developer-agent or vendor-agent. You provide the content and the client provides the presentation, by design, and if you don&#x27;t like it, then you are missing the point. I looked at your HTML pages and I find the colors uncomfortable to read.<p>&gt;My personal home page has blog posts that use styles to sound like the way I talk. I emote. I emphasise. I bold important sentences.<p>Use asterisks and underscores and slashes then, like we&#x27;ve all managed to do just fine since the dawn of the internet.<p>&gt;Do you really think I belong with &quot;the rest of the web&quot;? Or do you think my sites are not worth keeping?<p>No. I think your websites are suited to Gemini, but you don&#x27;t understand what Gemini is trying to do. Your tools seem to be bizzarely obsessed with colors, though, so I can understand why you would recoil at the idea that a document format might not invite you to its party.')
