How do I check if&#x2F;where my passwords or session cookies or something that would allow anyone to get into my accounts are exposed? Or if&#x2F;where my screens are exposed? Are there companies&#x2F;organizations that can search the internet for you and tell you if&#x2F;where you&#x27;re exposed? Are there any remote malware removal or malware analysis companies I can use that can completely get rid of malware (I don&#x27;t think places like geek squad and micro center would be of any use, I might have some really bad malware on my computers and phone and need something more capable)?. I tried amazon eero a while ago and it definitely picked up spyware on my computer and phone (I have screenshots indicating it), I&#x27;ve reinstalled windows and reset my phone and malware still seems to be there. Pressing a random key on the chrome address bar types the letter a like 50 times when the letter a was not pressed, I get phone calls when I&#x27;m feeling vulnerable as a form of intimidation as if I&#x27;m being watched (attacker seems to be using an ai voice generation social engineering tool, I&#x27;m not sure if this is the right terminology). Hundreds if not thousands of fake profiles with images from rural india show up in the people you may know section in my facebook  account and weird stuff like this happens to me often. Should I also consider switching to macbook and iphone from windows 10 and pixel 3a? Are there any companies I can use that can do everything and ensure that I have privacy? I can&#x27;t function, I&#x27;m completely mentally paralyzed because of it. I would be grateful if I can get advise here on what to do. I&#x27;m not familiar with the hackernews website and might have posted this in the wrong way. Thank you.')
