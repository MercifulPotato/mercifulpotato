It basically says &quot;The Biden Campaign checked Biden&#x27;s schedule, and said that Biden didn&#x27;t attend an illegal meeting at that time&quot;. The rush to cover and dismiss the story makes it seem more likely that it&#x27;s true (I have no idea either way), than if people could just write it off as another crackpot story from the NY Post.')
