Item(by='cloverich', descendants=None, kids=[24669030], score=None, time=1601690970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24668309, text='&gt; Might as well just use React state and save the overhead.\nUnless you mean conceptual overhead (i.e another library), it should be less overhead with mobx because there&#x27;s no need to re-create objects on every re-render, and further re-renders in general are less common (since mobx precisely controls renders for you). Also localStore&#x27;s need not be short lived by definition, just local. I have a notes app where the main components localStore stays mounted for (literally) days :)')
