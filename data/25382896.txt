Item(by='brundolf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607667424, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25382354, text='&gt; The assumption that a &quot;wealth tax&quot; will lead to a more equitable system is predicated on the assumption that: the government can use your dollar more effectively than you can at creating an equitable [wild, wild] world.<p>If the money is directly redistributed to those who need it, how is that the government deciding how it should be used?<p>Personal responsibility is well and good - we should all aspire to be more charitable - but it&#x27;s become clear that it doesn&#x27;t scale. Free-market capitalism is <i>specifically designed</i> to decouple the seeking of profit from the real-world consequences of that activity. This is what makes it so powerful, and also why it can be so destructive. It should be no surprise to us that a system designed to simplify and abstract people&#x27;s relationship with society ends up eroding things like empathy and social consciousness.<p>If you ask me, human society can&#x27;t effectively scale to this level at all. But here we are, and burying our heads in the sand when it comes to clear and present (and deepening) issues is foolishness.')
