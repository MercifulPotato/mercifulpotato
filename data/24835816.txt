Even if we accept that FPTP gives the government &quot;clarity and a definitive mandate&quot; (a very dubious claim given the chaos of the last few years), what&#x27;s so great about strong government? The whole point of democracy is to <i>prevent</i> the government from getting too strong; if we really wanted strong government we&#x27;d abolish parliament and go back to letting the monarch decide everything.<p>Many, many European countries have proportional systems in which it&#x27;s very rare for one party to get a clear majority and governments are almost always coalitions. Would Norway, Sweden or the Netherlands really be better off under a system like FPTP that effectively disenfranchises a large majority of the electorate?')
