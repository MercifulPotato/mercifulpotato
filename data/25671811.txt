The only gain to be made is through integration and attention economy, creating perverse incentives.<p>I don’t know if I <i>wholly</i> agree with this point.<p>Especially in the most recent decade, we’ve seen a lot of the F&#x2F;OSS developed at attention economy companies applied to completely disjoint industry sectors, with positive effect.<p>I work at an insurance company, for instance. The fact that we’re using gRPC&#x2F;protobufs allows us to have a small engineering team that hits way beyond our headcount. Happy to elaborate more on the point, but I’ll leave it here in good faith.<p>I think that our dependence on this technology is a smart choice in the short to medium term. In the long term (10+ year), the worst case scenario is that we have to maintain a fork, or migrate to something more secure. We would have had to do this anyway, if we built our own RPC framework.<p>I agree that OS’s and web standards are becoming less and less user serving, and more corporate&#x2F;attention economy serving.<p>I wouldn’t be shocked to see the web bifurcate eventually, between HTTP&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;JS and something simpler served over a simpler protocol.<p>That being said, I do think there’s some value in having an opinionated author compelling people to conform to their standard. When that leadership is absent, you end up with something like the Bluetooth or USB standard, and everybody suffers.<p>But at least those standards will exist forever, until they’re superseded by something that’s a superset of them. The same can’t be reliably said about the F&#x2F;OSS we’ve been talking about.<p>It’s all a series of trade offs. I’m not too pessimistic. I think we’ll eventually end up in a better place, but we will likely stub our toes and bump our head am any times on the way there.')
