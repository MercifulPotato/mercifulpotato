A 3rd party auditor might give you a “certification” but it’s meaningless to call yourself “HIPAA certified”. You wouldn’t say that. You’d say “we’ve conducted a 3rd party independent audit”.<p>You can go ahead and claim HIPAA compliance all you want, but most health systems are going to ask you if you’ve conducted an audit or if you have any certifications - SOC 2, HITRUST, etc.<p>So in reality you’re not HIPAA compliant until you can prove it. That’s my point.')
