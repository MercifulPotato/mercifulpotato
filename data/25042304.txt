The reason Apple is blocking game streaming apps is because games could contain content that violates the standards of the app store.<p>An easy violation is nudity, there is an app for Playboy, but there is zero nudity in it. However, I can get the full, uncensored Playboy magazine in the Nook app. I can watch movies with nudity in Netflix or Amazon Video. I can even buy or rent movies FROM APPLE with nudity in the iTunes store, like Eyes Wide Shut, Walk Hard, Boogie Nights (which is about porn!), and Barbarella, all right from my iPad or iPhone.<p>So why can I see nudity if I buy it directly from Apple in a movie, but not an app?<p>I can download the Twitch app and watch streams of video games, but I can&#x27;t download an app to let me PLAY the very same games?<p>There is no difference, it is simply Apple capriciousness.')
