Sometimes you may need to break things down a bit more.<p>And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking for a tool that lets me model projects as Directed <i>Acyclic</i> Graphs of tasks. Because all I seem to be getting in popular tools is a flat list with some categorizing, or a single level of subtasks at best. I want to be able to express directly that this subtask has sub-subtasks, and that this sub-subtask depends on completion of a subtask from some other task (without making it a dependency between root tasks).')
