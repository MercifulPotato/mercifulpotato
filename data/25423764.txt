The problem is that the instructions have varying lengths. Only when it has decoded an instruction, the chip knows where the next instruction starts. ARM-instructions are all the same length, so the instructions can be decoded in parallel without &quot;knowing&quot; the previous instruction. That lets Apple go much wider (8 instead of 4) with the instruction decoders.')
