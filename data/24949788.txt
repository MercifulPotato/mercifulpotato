Item(by='kmill', descendants=None, kids=[24974357], score=None, time=1604130841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24949127, text='I&#x27;ve mostly used Pure Data patches or a C program I wrote that interfaces with Jack.  I like Johnston&#x27;s notation for extended just intonation, and the C program lets you press buttons on your MIDI controller to alter notes by the various commas&#x2F;accidentals.  Eventually I&#x27;d like to have a sequencer for it...<p>His idea was actually pretty cool: you start out with an F, C, and G major chord tuned just like in the ratios a couple comments up, which gives you an entire C major scale, and then there are a handful of accidentals.  The syntonic comma (+) is what turns A into the fifth above D rather than a third above F, # applied to the top note of a major third turns it into a minor third (defined by the division of a major triad into a major and minor third), 7 applied to a Bb lowers it to coincide with the 7th harmonic of C, 11 applied to an F slightly raises it to be the 11th harmonic of C, and so on.  Each accidental also has an inverse operation.  With just these accidentals above, the system is able to uniquely represent every ratio whose prime factorization contains numbers up to 11.<p>Unfortunately MIDI is not so good for non-12-EDO.  Some instruments support SYSEX messages with per-note-number alterations.  There&#x27;s also a program out there, forgot the name, which takes a MIDI channel and splits it across multiple channels to apply independent pitch bends per note when there&#x27;s polyphony.  I hope MIDI 2 will help...<p>I don&#x27;t know much about real DAWs, though there are some Adam Neely videos exploring microtonality and alternative tuning systems where he pulls up some plugin -- maybe that will help you find something.<p>Having seen a video of Jacob Collier&#x27;s projects, it seems like he might do microtonality using only pitch correction.  I think if you&#x27;re familiar with your commas -- there aren&#x27;t many after all -- you just learn how many cents you need.<p><i>Edit:</i> I thought to look up Sevish, a microtonal musician who seems to actually care about making good music, and he has some resources on his site: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sevish.com&#x2F;music-resources&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sevish.com&#x2F;music-resources&#x2F;</a>')
