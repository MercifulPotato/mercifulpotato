Item(by='shard', descendants=None, kids=[25042165, 25040022], score=None, time=1604955871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25039784, text='It&#x27;s super convenient for me to drop my phone in the phone holder when I get in my car and have it start charging, and to just take it out of the holder when I exit my car, without having to plug and unplug the phone. It&#x27;s different from charging at home since when at home, I pick up and use the phone in my hand even while it&#x27;s charging, so a wireless charger is less useful, while in a car the phone has to stay in the holder when I am driving, so saving the steps of having to plug and unplug makes sense.')
