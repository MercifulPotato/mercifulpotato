I&#x27;m willing to be proven wrong though!<p>I do try to write about the reasons why and use-cases improved. One of the issues is that that <i>increases</i> the amount of text, which directly goes against the idea of quickly finding what you want.<p>At the end of the day, if you want to know everything, you have to read everything. There&#x27;s no shortcuts.
