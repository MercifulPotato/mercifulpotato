At the start of covid, I was dealing with ptsd from a difficult childhood..  and after some time with a good therapist (for once) I&#x27;ve managed to work past a lot of issues, and finally built up the courage to come out as transgender.<p>Now I&#x27;m working with an endocrinologist on transitioning to female with hormone replacement therapy.  Now I&#x27;ve been queer in intolerant environments before, but I have been pretty shocked with the way people have been treating me in the conservative area where I live.  Basically I&#x27;m afraid of my own neighbours and have to drive an hour round trip into the city just to get groceries without being called a fag..<p>So, life is rough.. but getting a lot better.  Thankfully my employer is being super supportive, as are all of my co-workers.  Not speaking with my family though, I would have done this 10 years ago if it weren&#x27;t for them actually :&#x2F;')
