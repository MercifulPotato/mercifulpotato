Item(by='__blockcipher__', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611264731, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25864279, text='&gt; Bitcoin only really got any attention because of Silkroad<p>You just refuted your own argument. Bitcoin got attention because of its utility as a currency, in this case for illicit drug purchases. Now as soon as I have to pay an $80 fee, it ceases to be useful as a currency (except ironically for illegal drugs, if you had no other option - which is not the case btw because you can just use monero or bitcoin cash - some users would still pay a 50% fee to get their illegal drugs)<p>&gt; but they have nowhere near the amount of currency transactions to legitimately call it a currency<p>What the hell is your definition of currency? A currency is whatever people use as a currency, and by that definition BCH or what have you is absolutely a currency. And fortunately you can send a transaction on-chain for 1 satoshi per byte, instead of having to use a stupid side chain &#x2F; lightning network pseudo-solution<p>&gt; instead one side got upset and created a hard fork at the next opportunity. Then attempted to call themselves Bitcoin, knowing full well they didn&#x27;t have the hash rate and subsequent proof of work.<p>This is a fundamental misunderstanding of how it works. Within a protocol, the &quot;real&quot; chain is the longest chain. But when a hard fork occurs it splits into two different universes, where BCH people don&#x27;t recognize BTC as valid and vice versa.<p>Frankly the software ignorance of so many shows when they discuss this topic of forking. It&#x27;s worth nothing that the &quot;soft fork&quot; vs &quot;hard fork&quot; distinction, while somewhat real, is part of the whole Bitcoin Core propaganda belief system; they believe that there must be some arbitrary &quot;legitimacy&quot; to a hard fork (where legitimacy is defined as who can shout the loudest after having conveniently censored all the sane people out of the room).')
