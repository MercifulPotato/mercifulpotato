If somebody comes up with the cure for cancer, letting them soak the insurance companies for 20 years is a fair trade. If somebody comes up with a pill that does the same thing as the combination of two pills that had been standard practice previously, but can convince doctors to prescribe the new thing, letting <i>them</i> soak the insurance companies for 20 years is some kind of regulatory failure.')
