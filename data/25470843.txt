And in some cases the testing is valuable but can be abstracted, e.g. with snapshot regression testing.<p>Just as you probably don’t get much value out of testing a function that increments an input number, but you may get a lot of value out of testing, say, a function that generates a series of smooth quadratic curves over a series of points.<p>And that’s a much easier thing to test at the unit level than integration.<p>It seems to me that either:<p>- your usage of props and rendering isn’t particularly complex, but your interaction model is<p>- you’re using state to manage that complexity where someone else may model it without state<p>I’m not passing judgment if it’s the latter, it’s fairly common in the frontend world to model that way. But it’s certainly not my preference.')
