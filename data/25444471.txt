Here&#x27;s a more recent example. I bought a Windows Phone way back when. It was amazing. My favourite feature of it, believe it or not, was the keyboard. I have a sneaky suspicion that they used MS Word&#x27;s dictionary somehow, because it could correct typos not just when the wrong <i>letter</i> was typed (for instance, typing &#x27;aentence&#x27; instead of &#x27;sentence&#x27;), but also words typed in the wrong order (&#x27;snetence&#x27;). It was delightful. I could type as fast as I wanted, confident that auto-correct would take care of any errors. Then I moved to Android, and I could not believe how appalling the keyboard was. But it seems that no one else was talking about it, because android users just didn&#x27;t know of the excellence that existed out there.<p>Then, at some point, Microsoft went ahead and ruined their keyboard when they went to Windows Phone 10 or 8.1 I can&#x27;t remember, and I&#x27;ve been searching for perfection ever since. GBoard, with it&#x27;s fucking emoji page is an affront to engineering.')
