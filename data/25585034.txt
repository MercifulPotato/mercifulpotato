It increases the cost per chip because it significantly decreases the yield per wafer of the monolithic chip.  I will be really curious if they can get much more RAM onto a M1 chip without charging astronomical prices (even by Apple standards).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qgvVXGWJSiE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qgvVXGWJSiE</a> Talks about this in detail of chiplet vs monolithic chips in the AMD context back in the Zen 2 days.')
