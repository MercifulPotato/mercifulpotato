Item(by='universa1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607946159, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25415773, text='&gt; What agriculture really needs is an effective way to make and keep decent soil.<p>Growing up on a farm in Germany, this is just what I would call decent farming and this is not rocket science. The knowledge how to do this is there and imho it does not involve some &quot;tech disruption&quot;. Agriculture, at least in Germany, is highly mechanized&#x2F;technized and in the end it does not matter if you look at conventional&#x2F;&quot;industrial&quot; or ecological&#x2F;bio-farming.<p>You need to take care of nutrients, humus creation, ... . This involves &quot;artificial&quot; fertilizer, regularly taking soil samples, to check what nutrients are there, crop rotation, etc... Sure you can just &quot;raid&quot; the soil and move on after ten years, but good luck finding new area in Germany to farm on ;-) And this is more or less independent of scale of farming.')
