You have to keep some level of basic infrastructure running; that will cause spread. There will always be some level of violations. Borders are more porous than people think. The mental cost of lockdown is also higher than people originally thought. &quot;Listen to the experts&quot; really meant &quot;listen to epidemiologists,&quot; but this is their first time trying this at this scale, and it ignores psychologists and economists, even though those forces are going to be major drivers of behavior.<p>There&#x27;s also the elephant in the room: If Covid-19 were 10x more deadly or 10x less deadly, people would actually take it very seriously or brush it off. It falls in a very awkward place, and a lot of people are looking at the death rate for their age group, weighing the risk against 1-2 years of partial lockdown, and deciding if the risk is worth it.')
