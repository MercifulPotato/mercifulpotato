While I&#x27;ve read reports about frustration with the electoral college among Hilary voters and a fear of election interference from foreign nations, I haven&#x27;t read much about that level of suspicion of ballot-level fraud. I would push back on the idea that those concerns (which I don&#x27;t feel qualified to speak on that true validity of) are equivalent to the idea pushed by Donald Trump that there was a scheme to legitimately steal the election, as in to produce a situation where the votes cast do not determine the winner.')
