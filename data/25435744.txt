Item(by='WalterBright', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608069434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25431036, text='&gt; That&#x27;s obvious to many of us, but depending on the role I wouldn&#x27;t fault someone for not being in tune to that question or ready for it.<p>The job interview gets debated endlessly, week after week, on HN. There isn&#x27;t one interview method or question that numerous people would consider unfair, irrelevant, broken, etc.<p>Eric was interviewing people for very high paying jobs. A decision has to be made about the candidate based on something. A person who wants such a job should go in eager and ready to convince the employer that they&#x27;re a great fit for the job, and do what it takes.<p>And yeah, Eric&#x27;s question was pretty obvious. It&#x27;s open ended, and you can interpret it as you like, which is part of the point. But being a smartass and&#x2F;or complaining about the question isn&#x27;t likely to leave a favorable impression. A &quot;faster horse&quot; answer isn&#x27;t likely to, either.')
