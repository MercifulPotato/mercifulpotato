ETS is a technique for extending sampled system bandwidth at the expense of requiring a perfectly repetitive waveform. Consequently, it&#x27;s useless for single-shot captures, where you only get the native sample rate of the system.<p>ETS used to be much more common in the days before (affordable) digital oscilloscopes could directly sample at high enough frequencies to be useful.')
