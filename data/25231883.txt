They lock otherwise talented and competent people out of jobs until they pay to take an &quot;exam&quot; for the $CORP approved check mark which gets their resume passed the round of filtering. Sometimes you even have to re-pay for the exam every few years to certify you&#x27;re &quot;up to date&quot; with the software.<p>I&#x27;m less cynical about certs offered by neutral third parties, or if they are offered free of charge. (If quality versions of those exist?)')
