You &amp; I may be gamers or computer users, but normal people don&#x27;t want to deal with that shit. It also again assumed you have a Steam&#x2F;Epic account to begin, or else that&#x27;s another layer you have to deal with.<p>With Stadia, you press one button and you&#x27;re in the game 5s later. It also has deep integration, allowing friends list, voice chat, game invites, achievements, etc. Nvidia relies on Steam for those (Epic doesn&#x27;t have most of it). That&#x27;s just the surface level integration too. By having games integrate with Stadia&#x27;s API, they can do other kinds of optimizations, like having simple optimized options, compares to Nvidia where you have to mess around with the settings like on PC.<p>If you&#x27;ve used both, it&#x27;s night and day experience. Again obviously for you and me, we&#x27;re used to PC gaming, but for average people wanting to play some AAA game, GFN is a complete no-go.')
