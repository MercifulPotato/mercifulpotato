Advertising has been targeted since advertising exists. Advertisers have been choosing radio or billboard-slots for well over 100 years (well, radio for 100, print and billboards probably for centuries), using data or educated guesses to reach a target demographic. As advertisers now choose on which sites (or not) their ads should appear, in order to reach their target demographic. Of course, they can choose by a few more criteria now. How ubiquitous should a specific ad be, so that it would not be &quot;targeted&quot; advertisement?<p>I think we need legislation, but it&#x27;s not black and white. There&#x27;s a huge grey line that spans all of advertising history.<p>Edit: just to be clear, choosing whether to advertise in a newspaper (and which) on radio (and which channel), or on facebook, is already targeting for a desired audience.')
