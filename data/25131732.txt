High spend on marketing can absolutely be justified. Additionally, there&#x27;s rarely enough public info to allow any investor to independently verify whether it&#x27;s justified in a specific scenario or not. But if an investor thought that there was positive ROI on that spend, they&#x27;re not going to fret too much about how large that amount is - as long as it&#x27;s bringing in a positive return.')
