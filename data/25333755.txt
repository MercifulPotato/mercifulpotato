There are a lot of types of software review so I&#x27;m not quite sure which one you&#x27;re referring to. If you&#x27;re talking about matchmaking for pentests then you&#x27;re essentially describing a bounty program, the only difference is that bounty programs don&#x27;t pay researchers for their time. If you&#x27;re referring to blog&#x2F;publications on security then this is the first time I&#x27;ve heard of that market.')
