It doesn&#x27;t have to be a job.  It could be an instrument, sport, extra ciricular, school project, volunteer work, or really anything.  If you haven&#x27;t, it means you either have never wanted to achieve something or didn&#x27;t want to put the effort in to try.<p>Life happens and at some point we all make it to a point we are comfortable.  So I think it&#x27;s unfair to expect that out of a 45 year old with two kids.  But if you get to be 45 without having really tried at something... well it&#x27;s a bit sad.')
