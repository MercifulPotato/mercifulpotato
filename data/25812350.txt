Methods for doing this are outside the scope of this document.<p>&gt; If authentication is not performed, the <i>parties receive no cryptographic guarantee as to who they are communicating with</i>.<p>I have not known anybody that actually does this. If an active attack does happen on somebody, I&#x27;m pretty sure they would not notice.<p>As far as I understand, a decentralized model solves this problem. Don&#x27;t trust the server? Run your own instance or have some other way of validating clients (via your own PKI infra or similar).')
