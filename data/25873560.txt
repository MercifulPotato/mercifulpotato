There are lot of what I call &quot;country drives&quot; where the quick route may not involve highways and with an ICE car those country bumpkin gas stations are all you see.<p>So until charging becomes as ubiquitous to where the country store has &quot;two pumps&quot; or such people are going to find situations where it does not work or only works on a good day.<p>hence the reason I am an advocate of range, range, and more range. Range that lets you make big round trips without charging are the goal. I know many say &quot;they don&#x27;t need range&quot; or whatnot and can use a short range city car, well that same rule applies to ICE but you will see the market for those small lower end lower range ICE cars was never great so why would an EV market of the same be different?<p>Soon even low 200 mile range BEVs will be looked at similar to how many look at the sub 150 crowd today; Mini should have been ashamed to release their car; and 250-350 will be the norm (numbers in miles, so KM is 400 to 560)')
