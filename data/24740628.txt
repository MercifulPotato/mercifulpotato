It&#x27;s a huge godsend for big codebases. But afaik it doesn&#x27;t guard against null by default.<p>A simpler example:<p><pre><code>    declare type Foo = {name:String};\n    declare function getFoo():Foo|null;\n\n    const f = getFoo();\n    if(f!==null) &#x2F;&#x2F; mandatory or yields an error\n        console.log(f.name);\n\n</code></pre>\nBut afaik it doesn&#x27;t guard against null by default.')
