Item(by='Normille', descendants=None, kids=[25177447], score=None, time=1606052007, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25177087, text='<p><pre><code>  &gt;Being trustworthy is orthogonal to being “impartial”...  \n  &gt;Also I find Reuters to be pretty damn objective..\n</code></pre>\nReuters literally has a link to the &#x27;The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles&#x27; at the bottom of every news story[0].  Which amongst other things state:<p><pre><code>  &gt;Thomson Reuters is dedicated to upholding the Trust Principles and to preserving its independence, integrity, and freedom from bias in the gathering and dissemination of information and news.\n</code></pre>\nIronically, I started checking the news headlines each morning on Reuters instead of the BBC a few months back, as I was fed up with the BBC&#x27;s increasingly less than subtle spin on things.<p>I thought Reuters being a press agency, as opposed to a news publisher might provide what I want from my news which is to present me with the bare facts; A or B happened, X or Y said this or that, without editorialising.<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;ve found that Reuters is just as guilty as anyone else, albeit in a more subtle way.  I&#x27;ll give you just one recent example:<p><i></i>[and let me preface this by saying I  have no interest whatsoever in American politics]<i></i><p>After the recent US election Reuters ran several headlines saying that Trump had &quot;falsely&quot; claimed he&#x27;d won [1] and have used similar language when  describing Trump&#x27;s legal challenges to the results.<p>Now, whatever you think of Trump and his behaviour [and again I don&#x27;t care one way or the other] I don&#x27;t think a news agency which claims to have &quot;freedom from bias&quot; should be telling me whether or not something the US President says is true or false. That&#x27;s for the legal system to decide.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thomsonreuters.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;trust-principles.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thomsonreuters.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;trust-principles....</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uk.reuters.com&#x2F;search&#x2F;news?blob=trump+falsely+claims+win" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uk.reuters.com&#x2F;search&#x2F;news?blob=trump+falsely+claims...</a>')
