Then I got the original DiRT, which had incredible graphics, but the car physics felt off. The cars seemed to rotate from a centre point when you turned. Like if you were square against a wall or barrier on your left, and tried to steer right, the back end of the car would initially press into the wall. Can&#x27;t remember exactly, but I remember many people had similar complaints. To be fair, it wasn&#x27;t terrible, but the steering just felt a bit more floaty than it should, IMO.<p>Do you know if the physics in Dirt Rally have improved on this? Or does the underlying issue remain?')
