It meant customizing my terminal colours so they were non-awful (the minimal 16 are super-garish, I have mine tuned for less harsh contrast but also more colour differentiation considering I&#x27;m red&#x2F;green colourblind).<p>I then used the same customized terminal colours in my GUI theme.<p>It works like this:<p><pre><code>    (if (display-graphic-p)\n        (setq color-yellow &quot;#f57900&quot;\n              color-bright-yellow &quot;#fce94f&quot;\n              color-red &quot;#ff6464&quot;\n              color-bright-red &quot;#ef2929&quot;\n              color-bright-green &quot;#73d216&quot;\n              color-green &quot;#4e9a06&quot;\n              color-blue &quot;#729fcf&quot;\n              color-bright-blue &quot;#204a87&quot;\n              color-white &quot;#babdb6&quot;\n              color-bright-white &quot;#eeeeec&quot;\n              color-magenta &quot;#ad7fa8&quot;\n              color-bright-magenta &quot;#1d324b&quot;\n              color-black &quot;#1a2022&quot;\n              color-bright-black &quot;#2e3436&quot;\n              color-bright-cyan &quot;#555753&quot;\n              color-cyan &quot;#888a85&quot;)\n      (setq color-black &quot;black&quot;\n            color-white &quot;white&quot;\n            color-red &quot;red&quot;\n            color-green &quot;green&quot;\n            color-blue &quot;blue&quot;\n            color-yellow &quot;yellow&quot;\n            color-cyan &quot;cyan&quot;\n            color-magenta &quot;magenta&quot;\n            color-bright-black &quot;brightblack&quot;\n            color-bright-white &quot;brightwhite&quot;\n            color-bright-red &quot;brightred&quot;\n            color-bright-green &quot;brightgreen&quot;\n            color-bright-blue &quot;brightblue&quot;\n            color-bright-yellow &quot;brightyellow&quot;\n            color-bright-cyan &quot;brightcyan&quot;\n            color-bright-magenta &quot;brightmagenta&quot;))\n</code></pre>\nThen, later on, I use these colours for setting the faces for the cursor, region, keywords, comments, tweaking various different major modes, etc.<p>With a true-colour capable terminal there&#x27;s no technical reason to need to take these steps, but this approach works for me in rxvt-unicode and mintty, the two terminals I use on Linux and Windows respectively, and aren&#x27;t mucked up by any level of tmux or screen nesting.')
