Having &quot;u&quot;s in spelling (eg colour) is a left over of the French influence on English in the UK.<p>A lot of the changes in spelling are because Noah Webster, when creating the first US dictionary, simplified things, eg axe vs ax. Some of the word usage, eg &quot;gotten&quot; came over to the US but faded out in the UK.<p>Oh, and it&#x27;s spelled &quot;americanization&quot; :)')
