As others have mentioned you could probably use external tools like a video camera aim system. You can&#x27;t do much about aimbots. But you can make it so that the game takes more skill then &quot;point and click&quot;. I used to play a lot of Unreal Tournament (the classic) in instagib mode which meant one shot instant kill, but even then I was able to win over players with auto aim. You just waited for them to shoot someone else, then you killed them while their weapon was cooling down. You couldn&#x27;t shoot them in the back as they used 360 field of view, so you had to know the map well.\nPlayers&#x2F;athletes that cheat usually do it because they want a shortcut, and thus can not become very good. Or there is a financial incentive, where you cheat just a little bit in order to make a living doing what you love, and those cheats are the most problematic as they are hard to catch.')
