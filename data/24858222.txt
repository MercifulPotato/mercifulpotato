It&#x27;s a career dead-end (tech-wise at least; money-wise it can be smart[1]) to get a job in COBOL as used in banks.<p>[1] Though, to be honest, the claim that you should learn COBOL because there&#x27;s a shortage of programmers and it pays well is not particularly true. Nobody I know of is making big money with COBOL. It&#x27;s mostly an average-paying, uninteresting programming job. You&#x27;ll probably make money by climbing through the ranks within the bank organization, where your COBOL skills will become slowly irrelevant.')
