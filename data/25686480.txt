With the a la carte model of $30 a paper there is no way she could have read the literature. My wife would read the papers slowly and look up words as necessary.<p>We read about a surgery that could potentially help our daughter, which the head of neurosurgery declined to do. We then said we’d take her to another children’s hospital (it turns out our insurance actually wouldn’t have covered that, but we didn’t know we were bluffing) and he begrudgingly agreed to perform the surgery. Had to get the expert who is a professor at Washington University to give a second opinion recommending surgery before it happened.<p>Most of the doctors really didn’t like my wife, there are notes about her obstinance in our daughters file. But our daughter is doing well, and I’m glad I married someone so doggedly persistent.')
