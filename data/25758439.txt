When slavery was threatened, they went to war to preserve it.</i><p>Of course. That doesn&#x27;t make it a war about slavery, it makes a war about a threatened economic advantage.<p>In fact, I agree further with you: the South did fight for slavery both as an economic advantage and as a racist ideology.<p>My issue is with the notion that the Civil War cause as it comes to the North was about the emancipation of the slaves  - which I consider cant. It was about economy and control from the Northern side.')
