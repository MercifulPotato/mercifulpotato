Like &quot;hey, maybe there is a guy at hotmail that reads my emails and will do something bad with their content&quot;.<p>But when you put your secrets in a single database for convenience, if there is a problem, you know where it comes from. And your secrets manager would suffer the consequences.<p>That said, a optionnal simple zero-knowledge approach is very possible. You would have an encryption key that you enter locally and in your CI &#x2F; server and you would never send your actual secrets, but an encrypted version of them.<p>Is it something that would help you trust the service ?')
