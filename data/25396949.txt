The intent is to force the player is to burn through available energy and, being so close to finishing something, that they spend premium currency to buy energy to get more chances for the shard&#x2F;fragment to drop to complete the thing faster.<p>There was even talk of a software patent that EA might hold governing this very behavior.<p>I would be very interested in reading a statistical analysis of droprates in gacha games, as I feel like I&#x27;ve noticed this stuff in my own play. But short of hard evidence (plus the ease of explaining away this stuff to the nature of randomness) it&#x27;s difficult for anyone to make accusations that aren&#x27;t baseless.')
