Iâ€™m not ashamed to admit it.<p>I&#x27;ve never understood why it is considered un-masculine for men to pee sitting down. Or even if it is, why so many men pee standing up just to play along. It&#x27;s one thing to use a urinal in a public toilet, but at home it&#x27;s potentially messy and probably not hygienic to release a partially aerosolised stream of urine just below waist height.')
