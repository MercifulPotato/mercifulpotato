Of course not, arguing otherwise will get you a bad grade. What about the yellow-press? Universally bad of course, Katharina Blum is required reading. Religion? All are nice and equally fine, criticizing religion is a nono and &quot;fear of god&quot; is an aim of all education mandated by the constitution. So please read Nathan der Weise critically and regurgitate what the official comment says. Do we need a military? Of course not, why would you want to invade Poland again? Workers rights? Good and well, but compromise is necessary for the good of the economy and society. Except in the case of teachers, as state officials they always get a bad deal supposedly...<p>I&#x27;ve come to see &quot;critical reading&quot; to be just a furtherance of the teachers&#x27; and the states&#x27; biases and aims by means of a more sophisticated cloak. You are supposed to be able to fake a little critical thinking, but arrive at the predetermined conclusions. Don&#x27;t rock the boat, stay inside the lines, but do this little hand-wringing ritual so you don&#x27;t seem like an unsophisticated sheep.')
