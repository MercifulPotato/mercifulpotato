Aren’t great grand children overrated anyway? My grandmother was a great grandmother and aside from the early toddler years the kids didn’t really give a fuck tbh. We don’t live in a society where a great elder is looked upon with any kind of prestige, so why aspire to it? Hell, not even most adult children care. They’d rather shovel you off somewhere where they don’t have to deal with your old people problems or antiquated views.<p>The only thing that will keep you respected in old age is your lucidity, wealth and power, and a sharp wit. Spending more time with your young children in late life could help cultivate those things out of necessity.')
