Yeah, if you want C-like performance, you have to do <i>some</i> low-level considerations, that is unavoidable at <i>some</i> point. So the &quot;speed of C, convenience of Python&quot; is misleading.<p>However, for many, many small tasks, today&#x27;s compilers are smart enough that you can express your idea in a high-level language and the generated code will be maximally efficient. The real killer feature of Julia is that, where ever you can gain maximal performance with high-level syntax, you can just choose to do that. A more correct but less sexy slogan for Julia is that it has the best performance&#x2F;expressiveness tradeoff you have ever seen.')
