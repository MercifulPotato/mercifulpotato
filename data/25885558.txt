And if it did, it wouldn&#x27;t be <i>real</i>, and those that think it is are fooling themselves. Only biological organisms feel. Why are you wishing for a cold lump of steel to feel something?<p>In my mind only someone who struggles severely with emotional intimacy with other humans would want to create a machine that tries to imitate human feelings, and thus ‘suffer’; likely done in an effort to try to feel close to &#x27;it&#x27;. It sounds like that person might not be having their human needs for safety, connection and acceptance met, which is very painful. I think tackling this issue is the important and worthy cause. That would be better than spending money on some Hollywood-inspired notion of &#x27;AI&#x27; - which itself seems more a story made up to keep the USA spending insane sums of taxpayer money on research, weapons and other tech at DARPA.<p>I do think society is super alienating to most humans in it&#x27;s current form [1], so I can somewhat understand the science fiction.<p>What is your definition of suffering though?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TIjvXtZRerY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TIjvXtZRerY</a>')
