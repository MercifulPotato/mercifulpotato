Some of those bad assumptions made sense 10 years ago.   Some of them didn&#x27;t.   I was far too generous to Congress by only talking about the former and not mentioning the latter.   Multi-launch for large beyond-Earth missions made much more sense 10 years ago than a big rocket.  Heck, multi-launch probably made more sense in the 60&#x27;s than Apollo, if it wouldn&#x27;t have been for that 1969 hard deadline.')
