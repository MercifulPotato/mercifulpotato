The difference is individual driver errors are not correlated, a bad reflection tricks a few humans at once instead of tens of thousands of cars running the same model. There is significantly more brittleness in a fleet of cars than in a population of humans, because the human population has diversity in judgement and experience.<p>This is not simple to fix because this uniformity is actually a feature of automated systems, it makes them explainable, produces expected results and conform and cheap, training a human for 20 years is more expensive than training all the cars once. However it also makes them collectively vulnerable, which is why heavy machines tend to be locked away on factory floors.')
