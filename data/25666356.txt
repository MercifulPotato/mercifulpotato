There was very tight control over the distribution of any information media<p>Now, everyone has a voice. The problem is that these older people are still socially conditioned to believe that because something is on an expensive computer, or in a book, or a man is saying it on a screen, well - it must be true! Because back in their day in the 70s if you saw a video on a screen it was an exercise that cost thousands of dollars.')
