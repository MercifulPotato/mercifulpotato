Here in Canada, Elections Canada is responsible for federal elections across the country.  Voting is pretty much the same everywhere, and unofficial polling stations and ballot boxes are prohibited.  The only machines involved in the voting process scan and count paper ballots that humans can recount, making electronic tampering much more difficult than having giant blobs of untrusted software accepting votes.  As a software developer, having the option of a low tech option for recounts is quite reassuring.')
