The point is that when people starting programming, it&#x27;s good to put them into a restricted environment, so that they get used to use the right tools and in the right way. For example, it&#x27;s quite easy to misuse goto in normal programs and make the programs unreadable. However, if a developer is already perfect with writing good code, but (s)he needs to do something special, like the state machine in the article, the restriction just makes the developer&#x27;s life harder.')
