The moment you buy it it&#x27;s a used house and the price goes down just like a car would. The point being home ownership is viewed differently.<p>Also, the recent episode of the Flash Forward podcast pondered the idea of guaranteed housing. They complained that 60% of people on minimum wage can&#x27;t afford a 2 bedroom apartment in the USA but coming from Tokyo my first thought was &quot;why is the standard a 2 bedroom apartment?&quot; There are 100s of thousands of studio apartments all around Tokyo and it&#x27;s normal to live in one. From $400 a month and up. I&#x27;m sure Hong Kong it&#x27;s even more normal.')
