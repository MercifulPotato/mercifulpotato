Lets assume that the minimum required to live in a given place is $20K.<p>So now you have two people, one makes $30K, the other makes $40K. How much more does the second one make compared to the first? Twice as much. At $30K, you have $10K disposable. At $40K, you have $20K disposable. And someone making $60K is making four times the disposable compared to $30K.<p>Once you get above cost of living, everything gets easier.')
