I often wish for things I don&#x27;t have, including more money, and I often find myself thinking &quot;it&#x27;s not fair&quot;. However, I have a better life than most people in the world by a large margin. I could be poor, disabled, etc, but I&#x27;m not. People are starving, dying, and suffering. If anything is unfair, it is how easy I have it. I really have no right to complain, but I still complain to myself internally.')
