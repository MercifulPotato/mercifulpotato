So instead of<p><pre><code>    &lt;input type=&quot;...&quot; &#x2F;&gt;\n</code></pre>\nwith bogus XHTML-like slash at the end, just use<p><pre><code>    &lt;input type=&quot;...&quot;&gt;\n</code></pre>\nSorry, but it&#x27;s a pet peeve of mine to point out cargo-cult idioms like that. The slash at the end was there to make your HTML parse as XML&#x2F;XHTML. But unless you have very specific requirements (like serving your page as XHTML, or fruitlessly attempt to produce or parse your HTML using an XML toolchain) we don&#x27;t do that anymore, even in 2019. The slash and the pretentious-looking space before it is ignored&#x2F;error-recovered away by browsers and other HTML parsers anyway.')
