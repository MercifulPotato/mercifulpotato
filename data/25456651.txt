Identifying the infected to allow them to isolate is the reason for it. I&#x27;m <i>not</i> worried about false positives because there is little harm done in having someone isolate uneccessarily. Much more harm is possible by keeping an infected person, who now thinks they&#x27;re fine, out in public.')
