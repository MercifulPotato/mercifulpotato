Also part of the reason why mobile games and micro-transation are so huge, there&#x27;s no bank asking why are you spending repeatedly on Genshin Impact and do you want to take it back.<p>It&#x27;s tied to your national ID for sure, but it stops there.<p>It&#x27;s actually good for the CCP, coz corruption is lubricant and everybody is in it, you don&#x27;t want to track who&#x27;s behind this money, they don&#x27;t even disclose how many dozen condos every official owns.')
