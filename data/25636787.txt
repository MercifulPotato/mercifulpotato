Idea of an online currency was interesting, but not something I spent too much time thinking about. PayPal already served much the same purpose.<p>Flash forwards to 2017 and the popularity of bitcoin is to the point where it&#x27;s affecting supplies of computer hardware. Yet, it&#x27;s not being treated as a currency at all, instead it&#x27;s an investment. Again, what happened? I don&#x27;t understand why it shifted like this, and I haven&#x27;t found any particularly convincing explanations.')
