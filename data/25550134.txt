Anxious that I would &quot;waste&quot; my life, that I wouldn&#x27;t seize the opportunity to make the absolute best of it, that I would fail the only thing that mattered in my existence.<p>I changed my perspective. In a way I now compare life to what it would have been to never have been born, and it&#x27;s wonderful. I feel privileged and gifted to have been &quot;given&quot; (metaphorically for me, but it&#x27;s up to one&#x27;s beliefs) the chance to live, to experience the truly insane thing that it is to be a human being!\nSure, maybe I could&#x27;ve had more, but in a way it&#x27;s like being upset because you sold your startup for 1 billion instead of 2 billion...')
