I had the same pain point and built Bardun (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bardunapp.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bardunapp.com&#x2F;</a>) as a iOS app instead of a website. Bardun brings together freeform notes and contacts to capture relationship information.<p>For privacy, the app stores information locally on-device only. Sync of contacts via phone, Google mail or calendar is possible. Contact information is streamed to the device rather than stored on a server.')
