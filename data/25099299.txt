They seem to do two types, one has an Oxo-degradable additive which is currently being banned in the EU[1] because all it does is break the bag down into microplastics.  The visible litter problem may be reduced but it&#x27;s not a good solution to anything.<p>Their other bags, the light green ones, are only industrial compostable.  They will stay as a plastic bag unless they go down the correct waste stream.<p>People leaving their dog poo bags has been a problem for years, in the UK they are know as Dog Poo Trees and are disgusting.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.letsrecycle.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;latest-news&#x2F;wrap-caught-up-in-degradable-plastics-row&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.letsrecycle.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;latest-news&#x2F;wrap-caught-up-...</a>')
