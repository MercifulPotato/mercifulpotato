The usual `df` command is inaccurate with btrfs. Instead there&#x27;s a set of btrfs specific tooling that you need to learn which can show the actual space in use.<p>Freeing up unused space from older snapshots also requires manual work. I often had to start removing the oldest snapshot and it&#x27;d turn out that it didn&#x27;t free up enough space. Continue repeating the step of deleting oldest snapshot and hoping it frees up enough space.<p>It&#x27;s possible the tooling is better&#x2F;convenient now, but I prefer to stick with ext4 now.')
