Climate scientists have been literally weeping in interviews because of what they know. These are things that you just have to read for yourself to get a sense of the scale of the problem. But here&#x27;s some exercises if you actually want to learn about this and you&#x27;re not just going to hand-wave away unpleasant notions:<p>1. Read about the Permian Triassic extinction event (The Great Dying). That involved somewhere between 1200 - 2000 ppm CO2. We&#x27;re emitting CO2 at least an order of magnitude <i>faster</i> than what led to that event. We still have at least 800 ppm to go to get to that scale, but if the permafrost decides to start belching everything up, we&#x27;ll be heading there very, very quickly. Feasibly by the end of the century.<p>2. Do the math on how much excess carbon is in the atmosphere right now compared to the ice core data from the past 800,000 years. That ranged from around 180 - 300 ppm that changed gradually on the scale of thousands of years. That range is what humans have lived in for the existence of our particular species. Now, take the extra 120+ ppm and determine just how much material that actually is. How much mass. Now, do the math on how much of that carbon an average forest can absorb. Or any of these direct air capture technologies.<p>There is so much data out there. It&#x27;s easily available. It&#x27;s far easier emotionally to just plaster over this with general skepticism and blind faith in technological progress though. You can sealion all you want, demanding other people produce things on a platter for you to digest, but you&#x27;re not going to really understand until you look at it directly anyways. You don&#x27;t have to be a climate scientist to crunch some of the numbers.')
