With some exceptions, their CPUs have nothing to run without external help, so they are forced to load and run arbitrary code to even be operational.<p>Although I <i>personally</i> don&#x27;t always consider this to be a hard reason not to use hardware, yes, I am indeed quite grumpy about the fact that most of my systems contain parts that I don&#x27;t control. As to practical fallout, it varies by impact and options; since AFAIK I <i>can&#x27;t</i> buy a modem that doesn&#x27;t use binary blobs, I just factor it into my threat model with mitigations where reasonable (thankfully, not all phones expose all of main memory to the modem) and move on, but where there <i>are</i> reasonable options (yes, that&#x27;s weasel-worded; I haven&#x27;t yet switched to POWER because I don&#x27;t want to pay 10x for my machines) I use them, for instance when I buy a phone I filter by whether it has an unlockable bootloader.<p>&gt; The artificial constraint is either that the code (firmware) is closed, or both closed and signed.<p>Yes, agreed.')
