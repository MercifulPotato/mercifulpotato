I&#x27;m not looking to work in compilers. OP sounds like the opposite of the type of people I want to work with. I enjoy what I work on quite a bit. I am paid well. I have the chance to build up the business and a team.<p>It is just an attitude that I see a lot. The candidate doesn&#x27;t have XYZ specific knowledge. Find someone who is interested and motivated (e.g. someone who has independently  taken an advanced course in a topic) and build them up.<p>I&#x27;m sorry that some candidate can&#x27;t answer your trivia question, but if it could be taught in a 16 week course (~10 hours &#x2F; week), you could find a way to convey it on the job (~40 hours &#x2F; week) in a much shorter period of time.<p>For this scenario have new hires work through a series of designed problems. Have them implement and run into the pitfalls with LL, LR, and Packrat parsers. Show issues with left recursion,  shift &#x2F; reduce conflicts, space trade offs of Packrat, seriously whatever you want to demonstrate.<p>Even just write up a document explaining when to use each rather than bemoaning the lack of knowledge. Like how much cooler would the top comment in this thread have been if I had learnt something?<p>This feels a lot like &quot;I want a candidate with the knowledge of a senior for the price of a recent grad&quot;.')
