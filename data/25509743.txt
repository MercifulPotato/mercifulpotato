In CS, the usual threshold for cheating is whether or not you actually wrote the code yourself--you can (and are encouraged to!) work with other people to discuss how to solve the problem, but you have to sit down and actually write the code up yourself.<p>That said, as a TA, I found that I really didn&#x27;t want to put any effort to identify if students were cheating. I did catch a few cheaters, but largely because they inadvertently broke my grading setup in ways that made me suspicious that they were getting their code from something other than the homework assignment.')
