It&#x27;s honestly better than I expected. Try to get a decent microphone (not very expensive, I got one for around 30-40 euros, Skype does not have sound quality high enough to notice better mics) and headphones.<p>There are still limitations, teacher can&#x27;t really test the reeds, and some things can&#x27;t be heard through Skype, but it&#x27;s better than nothing. You can also combine it with in-person classes once a month or once every two months so that the teacher can hear you for real and correct things every once in a while.')
