So you had to merge the active configuration into excel, upload the excel document to some server that customers didn&#x27;t have access to that turned the excel file into a config file, then you could use that config file to upgrade the system.<p>It was as problematic as you could imagine, lost configuration, lots of macros, etc. Eventually they made some improvements, but I left the industry so don&#x27;t know what the current status is.<p>Enterprise &#x2F; Telecom solutions at their best.')
