The exercises themselves do cover many common situations such as having to edit a commit that&#x27;s not the HEAD, or porting changes from a branch to another, or finding the source of a bug.<p>I had only ever used git-bisect once but had the same impression then as I did now with these exercises: that it was super powerful for this particular situation.')
