After we bought him out fully in 2019, I sent this feedback email detailing the ways in which he had disrupted our board and company.</i><p>The former CEO should take down the feedback email, as he is exposing himself and others to legal liability.<p>He is not the only one who has had to deal with toxic investors who sit on startup boards. It&#x27;s driven many good people away from companies they&#x27;ve founded. Sometimes the toxic board members are not newbies, either - they&#x27;re supposed pros. Not sure what sort of due diligence can sniff these jerks out before they join the board, and maybe it&#x27;s not even possible to turn them away if it&#x27;s a condition of getting investment.')
