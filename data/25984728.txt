It&#x27;s not. You can bastardize one on top of it but really, don&#x27;t. WhatsApp was built around RabbitMQ which -is- a messaging solution (one of the more complex ones, crazy complicated compared to Kafka at least).\nKafka -doesn&#x27;t- compete with RabbitMQ any more than MongoDB competes with PostgreSQL. Apples and oranges if you are trying to do anything but the most basic stuff.<p>Why would you want to disagree with Kafka being the default option? What could you reasonably advocate for in its place?')
