Some parts of compilers rely heavily on having real problem solving skills at this level - for example most books won&#x27;t teach you how to integrate ELF into your compiler, let alone DWARF.<p>I am hesitant to say performance optimization because many people have an idea of a CPU just executing one instruction at a time rather than the heavily pipelined and out of order monsters we have today.<p>To become Anger Fog, you must first invent the CPU-niverse.<p>(Agner is a almost mythical figure for many compiler and microarchitecture folks)')
