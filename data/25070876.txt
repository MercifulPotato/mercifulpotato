It may actually be that there is an over-representation of women in the white category compared to other ethnicities, and therefore the bias towards hiring females carries with it a bias towards hiring white.\nHowever it&#x27;s possible that if you compare ethnicities separately between men and women you might find no racial discimination exists.<p>(and vice versa for ethnicity vs gender).<p>The fact that they don&#x27;t show these breakdowns is a major weakness of this study.<p>Or strength.
