As in, you literally take a phone call and come back and he&#x27;s doing the dishes.  Not playing Fortnite, not watching YouTube, scrubbing plates.<p>The reality of the situation, that&#x27;s painfully obvious to everyone except his mum and dad, is that a) there is some sort of breakdown in the relationship that has nothing to do with online technology (he has his iPhone on him 24&#x2F;7 and will go hours without using it outside the home) and b) he fully understands that dedicating himself to his studies will help him follow the path his parents want for him - it&#x27;s just not what he wants.<p>Drug addicts disengage from society well before they become addicted.  I don&#x27;t see any reason why &quot;Dopamine addicts&quot; are any different.')
