The USA has the highest incarceration rate in the world and very high crime rates.<p>So when I talk about deterrence I&#x27;m mostly talking about reoffenders. I.e, the prisoners I talked to coming back. I think they&#x27;re <i>more likely</i> to commit crimes after prison, not less!!<p>Do you think people would lie, in a heavily monitored prison, about wanting to never come back to prison because they&#x27;ll &quot;die in glory&quot; in a gun fight against the cops next time so they can&#x27;t be arrested? Or about becoming a drug kingpin? Sounds like you think I&#x27;m saying these people were claiming nice things about themselves, but really they&#x27;re mostly claiming quite bad things if it makes me think they&#x27;re going to be back and were strongly negatively influenced by peers in prison.<p>On the topic of regular people who prison serves as a deterrent for, I&#x27;d look at other countries where crime rates are lower without the same hideous institution. Clearly it&#x27;s not just horrible prisons which prevent noncriminals from committing crime, since so many countries don&#x27;t have that? I guess that&#x27;s up for debate.')
