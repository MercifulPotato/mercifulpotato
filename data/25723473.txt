It’s a formalization of the ideas to make them more “acceptable” to execs and the decision makers (who care about such things).<p>When applied to in house engineering teams, it is largely ineffective if it doesn’t come with the same kind of freedom that highly paid software consultants get. This is manifested concretely in how many companies have corrupted agile methodologies by focusing too much on the perfecting practices (or “ceremonies”) rather than focusing on the foundational principles.')
