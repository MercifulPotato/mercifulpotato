Both are loaded and mapped to a running user-space process.<p>If foo links to bar, then there must be a symbol table somewhere in physical memory with an entry that points to bar’s TEXT.<p>That symbol table is part of the shared cache, right? Doesn’t it already follow that bar’s TEXT needs to be at the same virtual address in every process?')
