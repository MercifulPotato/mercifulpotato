Today&#x27;s &quot;browsers&quot; with their ever-increasing scope surely fit that criterion. I&#x27;m not defending Apple, but the idea that the web is an &quot;open&quot; platform (when it&#x27;s overwhelmingly just Chrome) should not be used as an argument here, when Google employs just other anti-competitive tactics.')
