First of all, I would like to thank you all for the valuable feedback that we have got from you for the last 24 hours. It means everything to us. This being said, I feel like this Patent comment is making us look dishonest. So here is the deal. I hold an AI patient that we are currently not using in the product as it is now because it is not AI-based. We mention that we hold an AI patient on the last part of the About us page, in a part where we outline general information on the founders&#x27; backgrounds. That&#x27;s it; it is not a dominant part of our marketing material. Our plan is still to include AI in the application when it makes sense to do so.<p>I like discussions and critique, and almost all of what you have said in this forum is true, and your reflections are valuable learnings for us. Please don&#x27;t take this remark as a signal that I am not open to feedback because that is what we are seeking, and I prefer the negative because that is where you learn the most.')
