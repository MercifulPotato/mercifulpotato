I&#x27;d like to add the nuance that us the Homo Sapiens seem to operate better when we are pushed into the right direction.<p>Giving us too much choice -- like global mutability and OOP in general -- can cause analysis paralysis and make people do all sorts of panicked dumb choices in their software projects. As a guy with 19 years of experience I seriously wish I could forget some of the codebases I had to inspect.<p>So while FP is just another tool, it&#x27;s also a framework for thinking that helps people make better choices. Same goes for static strong typing.')
