One of whom I was close with (grandparent) but it barely affected me negatively yet I had been forced into shell for months due to otherwise small things in the past. It&#x27;s not the severity of the outcome. I recovered faster from those. I require medicine when that happens and the triggers are always small non obvious.<p>Please don&#x27;t judge people based on the severity of their situation as to whether they are suffering or not. It doesn&#x27;t help. It misleds bystanders reading your comment into a pit instead of seeking help.<p>As for the comparison to the world getting better, it&#x27;s not linear and same for everyone. While on average, people are living better life than they did before. Life for people in some countries have gotten worse, not better. Maybe life for people which this forum self selects have gotten worse in the last few years.<p>Also see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;optimism-pessimism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;optimism-pessimism</a>')
