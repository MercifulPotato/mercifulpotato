Its services superficially appear like databases just sitting there, even if we know that&#x27;s not the case.<p>FB and Twitter, on the other hand, largely work on <i>push</i> models: you log on and the app will give you stuff to look at, as well as notifying you incessantly. It easier to perceive the app&#x27;s own agency and priorities.<p>In this sense, it explains why Google tends to get heat over Youtube: because it&#x27;s closer to a push model, both with homepage and suggestions.<p>Also, Google services are largely <i>useful</i> to get stuff done, in a way FB and Twitter are not. That gives G a big pass.')
