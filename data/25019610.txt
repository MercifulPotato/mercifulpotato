In the early to mid 90s IBM was all-in on Smalltalk, they had a product called VisualAge, they were all set to push it as the next enterprise language, replacing RAD tools like Delphi etc etc. Then Java happened and immediately developed a huge mindshare and IBM pivoted the VM and tooling they had developed for Smalltalk into Java and rode that wave.<p>But if Java had been a flash-in-the-pan, then Smalltalk would be today where Java is now in terms of adoption (and decades ahead of Java in terms of technology).')
