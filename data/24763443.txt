The link you gave shows that excess deaths started March 28th, for a period of ~119 days.<p>Wikipedia says that the U.S. had 291,557 combat deaths during WWII, which was over a ~1366 day period of U.S. combat involvement if we count the period from Pearl Harbor until the end of the war. The U.S. is about 2.46 more populous now, so adjusting for that, the ratio of the rate of excess death over the period studied vs. U.S. combat deaths in WWII is (235610 &#x2F; (119 * 2.46)) &#x2F; (291557 &#x2F; 1366) = 3.77.<p>Since you&#x27;re calling 3.77x the population-adjusted rate of WWII combat deaths &quot;mostly normal&quot;, I would be curious to know what rate of death you would consider abnormal.<p>On a non-population-adjusted basis, which is arguably the correct measure if we want to think about waging a war that&#x27;s the equivalent of WWII, the death rate over the period studied would&#x27;ve been equivalent to the U.S. combat deaths from waging 9.28 simultaneous WWIIs. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t consider simultaneously engaging in nine wars the size of WWII to be business as usual.')
