There are SF history articles in the library that go into great detail about the shift in neighborhood demographics since the initial Gold Rush.<p>When I first perused the source material back in the 1990s, I learned about the hidden history of San Francisco. Of particular note, was the Irish and Polish presence in the Mission in the early to mid-twentieth century, and the Scandinavian wave to Upper Market around the same time.<p>These waves of ethnic migration to the city influenced its development, brought people with new skills and culture, and greatly contributed to the multicolored tapestry of San Francisco.  Many of these groups had organized meeting places and interest groups which directly benefited their districts, and they performed charitable work to improve the city in which they lived.')
