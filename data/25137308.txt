Depending on the location of the building, the premium can be very high.<p>100% agreed with this. I personally see no issue in paying a <i>premium</i> if an employer is asking for something extra, like being in a specific location, or working odd hours, paying a premium is reasonable. There are many reasons why a company may want someone to be on-site in a specific city; this applies if the city is SF, or a small city.<p>The issue that I personally have is when location is not a factor, but is still factored in to &quot;location dependent pay&quot;. Pay someone in SF more because it&#x27;s important to you for them to be phsycially present? Sure. Pay someone in Oklahoma less than someone in Austin, despite the fact that neither of their locations makes a difference to their work? Now you&#x27;re openning yourself up to implicit discrimination and &quot;unfair&quot; conditions.')
