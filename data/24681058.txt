The recognition of customers is literally through which phishing attacks work. This is one of the most common avenues that people get access to systems and data they shouldn&#x27;t. GDPR mandates that virtually every site needs to deal with this problem now.<p>Also, I&#x27;d say that reprieving <i>all</i> data on someone is not a trivial problem. Imagine you had a forum and somebody requests all of the data on them. However, another user has made a copy elsewhere on the forum with some notes about that user&#x27;s personal data. Does the requester get access to that copy?<p>And now keep in mind that you complying is based on your understanding of a regulation that companies have spent millions on lawyers to figure out and still aren&#x27;t entirely sure. And you have to follow this regardless how big or small your website or business is.')
