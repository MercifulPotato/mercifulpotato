I could keep going but the world of magazines is far richer than regular news. There is significant diversity of thought available (just buy a few different magazines), and with the long form format, there is more than just a shallow hot take.<p>One frustration is that as you devote more time to reading from such sources, the more mainstream news and social media seem broken. It can be harder to feel connected to others and even depressing, because the world in general is short on nuance while the world of magazines and journals offers it in spades. Still, it’s worth it.<p>I highly suggest visiting a Barnes &amp; Noble or another retailer with a big magazine section, and checking out what they have to offer in person. Many stores also carry more serious academic journals (I recently discovered the Cato journal) as well as literary journals that can be a great way to discover rare gems.')
