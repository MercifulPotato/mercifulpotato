Then they prove the teamwork is important... and therefore 10x developers do not really exist!<p>But in fact, there are people who are 10x developers and are great team players. And there are also people with great technical skills, who are completely toxic. And there are also people with mediocre technical skills who believe themselves to be gods, and for some reason management seems to believe them. All of these are real, and I have met them.<p>For good cooperation, both the 10x developer and the rest of the team need to be good team players. Because some people are unable to teach, but also some people are unable to learn. Some people are condescending to those with less experience, but also some people are hostile to those with more experience. If the team works well together, the 10x developer can set the project architecture right, teach other team members to follow some good principles, and then all together do seemingly miracles.')
