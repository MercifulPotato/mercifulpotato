This is a local government problem. The solution is for citizens of those cities and counties to hold their local governments accountable and vote them out of office if they don&#x27;t fix the problem. The last thing we need is more big government, one-size-fits-none policies dictated from above. We need more local people solving their own local problems.<p>It would also help if police were not tasked with enforcing a litany of nanny state laws that shouldn&#x27;t even be on the books to begin with. Any cop that wants to mess with a citizen can always find some excuse; with all the laws we have, all of us are violating some law every day.')
