Many engineers are also not good at thinking in &quot;analog&quot; (vs digital) and obsess on things that just impact the wrong thing.<p>Those comments about people using a couple $100s for monthly SaaS service a few months ago baffled me. The real question is: do those multiply&#x2F;improve the output of your most scarce resource?<p>Saving a couple $1000s per year is good all else being equal, but in the end it&#x27;s creating $100,000s more that matters in business.<p>Focus on the right order of magnitude.')
