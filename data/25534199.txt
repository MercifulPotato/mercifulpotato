Item(by='cgriswald', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608870534, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25533170, text='In elementary school we used some software that thought teaching, but IIRC it was for some special program and it also was mostly for fun (we had access to LogoWriter and some other software). We quickly figured out you could type nonsense, delete it, then type out the required text and the software would measure ~350 wpm. Learned nothing else. : )<p>I took typing as an elective one semester in high school because I couldn’t stand hunt and pecking when I was trying to get things done. We’d get done early and just type out lyrics to House of the Rising Sun. We’d also replace homonyms or type nonsense lyrics. A few years later internet chat rooms were big and I’d be in half a dozen of them plus various private chats. My wpm ended up being such that people who saw me in real life would notice the speed. Easily over 100 wpm (not 350 though!).<p>These days I very quickly adapt to macros, function keys, and remappings. I type nearly as fast as I can think of the words. I thumb-type on the phone noticeably fast (lead singer of a bar band called me out on my speed one NYE). And I memorize my passwords physically. I lay that all at learning to touch type in the first place.')
