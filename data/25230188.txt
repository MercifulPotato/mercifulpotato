Burke describes going to reenactment festivals to film many of the medieval life scenes.<p>And his journalist background and connections enabled him to have the access necessary to shoot single-take sequences such as this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2WoDQBhJCVQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2WoDQBhJCVQ</a><p>(Hardly the only impressive on-location scene in his work.)<p>Agreed with your comments on the primary importance of writing and research.  I&#x27;d argue that Chris &amp; Evan Hadfield&#x27;s &quot;Rare Earth&quot; is getting close, Tom Scott is doing quite well, and Derrek Muller&#x27;s &quot;Veritasium&quot; and Destin Sandlin&#x27;s &quot;Smarter Every Day&quot; have promise.<p>Several YouTubers have been picked up by traditional broadcasters&#x2F;production organisations, notably Hank Green (&quot;Crash Course&quot;), with PBS, and Emily Graslie (&quot;Prehistoric Road Trip&quot;), with the Chicago Field Museum.  YouTube as a training and recruiting ground has merits.<p>One reason <i>Connections</i> is so hard to compare to is that it&#x27;s pretty incomparable:  forty years on we&#x27;re still discussing it in glowing terms.  It was produced by someone well-established and experienced at least <i>within</i> the BBC, and backed by the organisation.  Notably, little from either national&#x2F;public broadcasting <i>or</i> commercial production has even approached it.  My short list includes  Sagan&#x27;s <i>Cosmos</i>, Burke&#x27;s own <i>The Day the Universe Changed</i>, Ken Burns.  Daniel Yergin&#x27;s <i>The Prize</i>.  And of course Kenneth Clarke&#x27;s <i>Civilisation</i> and Jacob Bronowski&#x27;s <i>The Ascent of Man</i>, which had paved the way for Burke himself.  I might include Adam Curtis&#x27;s works.<p>The role of the author or creative voice --- a Burke, Sagan, Burns, Bronowski, Clark, Curtis --- cannot be overstated.  That talent seems rare, perhaps also the ability to simply get out of its way.  Also realising when it&#x27;s circled too hard back in on itself --- Burke had 2--3 good series in him, but <i>he</i> hasn&#x27;t matched himself in at least three decades.<p>Related HN thread with additional recommendations:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=2698026" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=2698026</a><p>Part of that is a more crowded field: there&#x27;s more produced, it&#x27;s harder to get noticed.  Part my own near-total avoidance of broadcast television.  But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s all of it.<p>And yes my HN history shows I&#x27;m quite the fan of Burke:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=by%3Adredmorbius%20connections%20burke%20&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...</a>')
