Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603133924, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24823786, text='<i>&gt; It still doesn&#x27;t sound physically distinct</i><p>If you try what I described with a light ray, it will be moving away from you at c no matter how much you accelerate in its direction.<p>If you try it with a massive object, even a neutrino with a very, very tiny invariant mass, that will not be the case; its speed relative to you will decrease as you accelerate after it, eventually to zero.<p>There is no continuum between those two possibilities; they are distinct and discrete. The only continuum is in the latter case, where the final speed of the object relative to you will depend continuously on how long you accelerate.<p><i>&gt; even if we accelerated an rocket and somehow checked if a neutrino was at rest relative to it, we might find that it&#x27;s not. That means we won&#x27;t know if we need more speed or if it&#x27;s impossible</i><p>Yes, you <i>will</i> know, because you will know if the neutrino&#x27;s speed relative to you has decreased or not. If it has, it&#x27;s possible to bring it to rest relative to you. If it hasn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s not. See above.<p><i>&gt; I suppose it&#x27;s a bit easier than that because we only have to accelerate the rocket fast enough that the neutrino&#x27;s speed becomes measurably less than c, rather than 0.</i><p>Exactly.<p><i>&gt; But still, what if we can&#x27;t even get it to go fast enough for that?</i><p>That&#x27;s basically the position we are in now: we have no way of building a rocket or other device that can accelerate after a neutrino long enough to tell whether its speed relative to the rocket is measurably decreasing. So we have to resort to indirect measurements. But as I said before, that doesn&#x27;t change the principle.<p><i>&gt; even photons have a nonzero upper bound to their possible rest mass</i><p>Yes, because, as I said, practically speaking we can&#x27;t run the obvious and straightforward experiment I described, to confirm that a photon moves away from you at c no matter how much you accelerate after it. So we have to resort to indirect measurements, like trying to measure its invariant mass by other means. But that doesn&#x27;t change the principle.')
