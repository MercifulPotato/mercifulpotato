My objection was to the point around convenience &amp; cost of time i think.<p>Seeing how much we focus on lowering the friction to onboarding, landing pages and just working in software for a while, i think the private solutions have to be every bit as convenient as the commercial option, otherwise they are not viable. That is just table stakes for mass adoption by a broad audience. Technical users may vote with their feet even when its slightly inconvenient, but its not enough to make a dent in the world.<p>For example, i cannot even imagine how much longer everything would take if every google search i made was replaced with a visit to the library. It would be 5-10x the time, maybe much more. A ton of information would be completely unavailable even given infinite library time. Luckily, I can (and do) just use DuckDuckGo instead.<p>There&#x27;s lots of encouraging progress in these kinds of solutions that are both just as convenient AND private - decentralized web, pinephone, linux adoption, end to end encryption on messengers, personal clouds like NextCloud etc.')
