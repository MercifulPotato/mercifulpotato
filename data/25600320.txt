And Bitcoin is the most careful to make life easy for infrastructure providers.<p>Eth is very challenging to operate securely. Breaking updates are frequent, often with little warning. Bitcoin hasn&#x27;t changed in many years, and new software updates are optional, and don&#x27;t require you to write any new code or change how you operate. Most other cryptos suffer from the same challenges.<p>Eth has more features and flexibility, but for the explicit use case of sovereign money, Bitcoin really stands in a class of its own.')
