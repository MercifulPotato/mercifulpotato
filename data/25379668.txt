There was a time when Python was a niche language you tossed into your &quot;real&quot; program so users could extend it. There was a time when C was a niche language for Unix development. Likewise C++ was this niche object oriented thing that didn&#x27;t even compile to object code... it compled to C.<p>And developers would look at the niche language devs and go, why write in C? I have my COBOL and most production code is written with it. Java? Why? I have Powerbuilder and Delphi. \nMost of the developers with any new language are creating CRUD apps, because well, that&#x27;s what most computer programs do.')
