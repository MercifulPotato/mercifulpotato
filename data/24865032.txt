Much of their income will go towards paying vehicle maintenance costs, and those are not obvious from the start. Your accounting can show you making decent wages for six months and then suddenly you need new tires and recalculating your wage will show you aren&#x27;t making a ton of money. At which point many of them do quit and work somewhere else.')
