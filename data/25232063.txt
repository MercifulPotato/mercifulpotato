Essentially in GA you&#x27;d do your differential geometry assuming a sort of ambient background space.  In regular differential geometry the space of forms and vectors are abstracted and don&#x27;t require a shared geometric embedding.  I&#x27;m not a mathematician, so this is a very non-precise explanation, but that&#x27;s how I understand it.')
