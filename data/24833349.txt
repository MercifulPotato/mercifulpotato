I&#x27;d be interested to know which of the dozens of IRC clients you were using that was so horrible.<p>As for sending files, IRC has no real capacity for this. XDCC exists, but is an extension to IRC and isn&#x27;t guaranteed to be supported by your network&#x2F;server. So yes in this situation you must look to an alternative protocol like FTP (hopefully SFTP or at least FTPS).<p>I do largely agree with most of your points aside from reliability. In my experience large IRC networks with many servers are essentially immune to downtime. The most that happens would be a netsplit, whereupon the two halves of the network continue to operate normally (though separately) before synchronizing. From your description, I would venture a guess that (at least some of) the reliability issues you experienced were also due to your IRC client.<p>Anecdotally, I have certainly experienced far more outages of the centralized Discord service than I have of the IRC networks I frequent.')
