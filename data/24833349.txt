I&#x27;d be interested to know which of the dozens of IRC clients you were using that was so horrible.<p>As for sending files, IRC has no real capacity for this. XDCC exists, but is an extension to IRC and isn&#x27;t guaranteed to be supported by your network&#x2F;server. So yes in this situation you must look to an alternative protocol like FTP.')
