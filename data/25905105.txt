I have come to realize how foundational trust is in a functioning economy and self-governing society.  We in G8 nations often don&#x27;t see it, like fish not thinking about water.  I&#x27;ve been extremely concerned with the efforts of sub-groups in our societies  attacking the foundations of trust.  It&#x27;s like watching people, on a boat at sea, tear up the hull for firewood...  The irony is that the basic nature of people (the world over) really hasn&#x27;t changed: people are msotly good and want to live in a healthy community.  But culture, context, and experience can overrule those tendencies.')
