A &quot;force between two bodies with a magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the displacement between them&quot; seems no different in principle from a &quot;force between two bodies with a magnitude proportional to the product of their electric charges and the inversely proportional to the square of the displacement between them&quot;.<p><i>My point is that it really seems like &quot;gravity&quot; is not a force, it&#x27;s an acceleration, but there is something you could call &quot;force due to gravity&quot; that you reverse-engineer from the known acceleration, and that means you need to multiply by the mass. Clearly different masses will just cancel, so the resulting acceleration is the same.</i><p>We&#x27;re talking Newtonian physics, a model of the world where an acceleration is the <i>result</i> of an unbalanced force applied to a mass.  You don&#x27;t have to &quot;reverse-engineer it from the known acceleration&quot;, you can calculate it as Gm₁m₂&#x2F;r².<p><i>I&#x27;m fine with saying &quot;force due to gravity&quot; or even &quot;gravitational force&quot;. Which is what you&#x27;re describing in your first sentence, and I have no disagreement with that. &quot;Force of gravity&quot; starts to sound a little off, and I bet if I ask &quot;what is gravity at Earth&#x27;s surface?&quot; I&#x27;ll get back &quot;9.8 m&#x2F;s^2&quot;, which is an acceleration not a force. </i><p>You can equally describe the magnitude of the gravitational field as 9.8 Nkg⁻¹.')
