We end up with a cancelled product&#x2F;service, or one maligned beyond recognition by the acquirer, with users having to untangle the service from their lives at last minute, while acquirer holds all the IP.<p>Also, I question the general usefulness of startups created to pursue an exit in the first place. Besides there being often no point in entangling yourself with a service that&#x27;s meant to be transient, the goals will be different too - the company will try to force hypergrowth by underhanded, and ultimately user-hostile means, vs. letting a thing grow on the strength of its usefulness. Myself, I strongly avoid dealing with any startup that I can smell was built for an exit.')
