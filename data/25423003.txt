I also know that it&#x27;s hard enough to generate revenue from podcasting, and audio drama podcast is harder still. I like though that these episodes are apparently build to age well (unlike most pop-culture podcast episodes), so hopefully it will build on itself over time. It&#x27;s a hard thankless job to put significant creative effort into something that isn&#x27;t profitable.
