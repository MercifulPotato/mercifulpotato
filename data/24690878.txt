What the Romans didn&#x27;t do was use vanishing points systematically -- they would have multiple contradictory vanishing points in a single image. Brunelleschi&#x27;s invention of 3-point perspective was much more systematic than what the ancient world had done, but it was very much inspired by the desire to reverse-engineer Roman techniques.')
