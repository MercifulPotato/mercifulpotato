There really are a some models bringing in tens of thousands of dollars a month, but they are few and far between. Often times these girls (I say girls because I never saw a single male performer come close to that amount) were either super niche or mildly famous before joining the site and in either case they treated camming like a full time job.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people talk about girls on OF making hundreds of thousands of dollars a month and while I&#x27;m sure some are, I wish people would understand how few are actually making that amount. In the same way that it&#x27;s possible to &quot;move to Hollywood and get discovered while working tables&quot;, it&#x27;s technically possible, but it requires a lot of work and even more luck. Also, similar to freelancing sites, you&#x27;re competing with (and being undercut by) people from around the world. A huge number of the women on our site were from South America or Eastern Europe earning what would be below average wages in the US, but more than enough for them to live off of.<p>Personally, I have zero problem sex work (clearly, based on my work history), but we still live in a time where many people do. I just want people to be aware of what they are getting themselves into. What goes on the internet stays there forever and you are extremely unlikely to make enough money on these sites to never have to work again. I doubt many people on here are planning on getting into sex work, but I think it needs to more publicized how much of pipe dream &quot;earning $10000 a week&quot; is on these sites.')
