Electron bloat doesn&#x27;t grow with application size. Only incompetence does. By using electron you are basically forcing your application to need around 200-300MB of RAM no matter how trivial it is, but that&#x27;s all there is to it. Poor application performance has more to do with bad application development. Nothing prevents you from e.g. building Atom in a way that lets you view files bigger than 2MB with good performance or building a Slack client that doesn&#x27;t leak memory. I can run lots of tabs in Firefox with good performance but if each tab was using its own browser instance I would run out of memory very quickly.')
