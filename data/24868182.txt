I submit PHP does not belong anywhere outside the request response cycle. If you use it for other stuff, you are not wrong. I mean I’ve used puppeteer and node js to capture screenshots and I still think that ideally JavaScript should only exist in client-side web browser based development. I would never voluntarily do any of the react native or express&#x2F;hapi server side development with JavaScript. I will do it if there is money involved, it just isn’t my preference.<p>It is ok to have a preference to do non web work with PHP but you owe it to yourself to at least try something else before saying you prefer it over everything else.<p>There is nothing wrong with $ though. That’s just insane. Also I’m very excited to see Drupal 9 being released with twig 2 support and more recent symfony support. I just think you should at least evaluate other options before saying “everything goes better with php sauce” just like the JavaScript crowd should stop and get some help before using JavaScript for native development and or server side development.')
