Yes we can&#x27;t have GPU&#x27;s there but having your model train 50% slower (exaggeration) is better than having to spend 150% of the time taken in Pytorch to debug anything in TensorFlow.<p>I may be beating a dead horse here, but why doesn&#x27;t google just accept that TensorFlow needs to be redesigned for more ease of use?<p>Can anyone point out the benefits of TensorFlow over Pytorch (besides TPU&#x27;s) ? It&#x27;s been a few years since I&#x27;ve used TF and I may have missed something.')
