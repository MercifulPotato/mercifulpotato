There is the fact that macOS on ARM does not appear to have a standardized boot method (Apple says the boot sequence is &quot;based on iPadOS&quot;), and there is the fact that Apple also uses their own GPU architecture for which they&#x27;re only motivated to make mac&#x2F;iOS drivers.<p>Getting Windows to run on this is a pretty tall order, and without significant investment it won&#x27;t happen. And significant investment from whom? Not Apple surely. I&#x27;m guessing Microsoft has more stake if anyone. At best we&#x27;re going to see Windows on ARM virtual machines.')
