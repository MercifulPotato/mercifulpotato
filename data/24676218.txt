Facial recognition in policing fails at a mathematical level because of Bayes.<p>Let&#x27;s say I have a database of 10,000 people&#x27;s faces and I&#x27;m looking to match 1 accused criminal from a good quality image. Let&#x27;s also say my algorithm is 99.99% accurate with 100% specificity (i.e., I always ID the bad guy as the bad guy).<p>So I get a true positive, I can correctly ID the guy. But in doing so I am 10 times as likely to get a false positive. at 99.99% accuracy. Scale it to 1,000,000 people and that likelihood of a false positive is 100x. Because you are looking for a small number of people as your database gets larger the value of a positive match (i.e., your positive predictive value) rapidly approaches zero.<p>Yes this is a simplification but the basic idea stands. These algorithms used at scale are flat out unacceptable because the concept of their use makes false positives more likely than true positives.')
