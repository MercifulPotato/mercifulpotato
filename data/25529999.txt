You go to &quot;crates.io&quot;, and it gives you a specific version number to put in your &quot;cargo.toml&quot; file. Now you&#x27;re nailed to that version for your program or crate. Crates have their own &quot;cargo.toml&quot; file, with their own versions, and it&#x27;s quite possible to pull in multiple versions.<p>Right now, I&#x27;m using the latest version of &quot;reqwest&quot; known to &quot;crates.io.&quot; It&#x27;s pulling in Tokio v0.2.23, not the new tokio v1.0.0. No surprise there, the new version only came out yesterday. So we&#x27;ll see how the new version works at some time in the future.<p>It&#x27;s good to get to version 1. The semantic versioning rules allow breaking changes without changing the first digit when the first digit is 0. Typical complaint on forums: &quot;bignum happens to use rand internally, and it happens to only use version 0.5.0, with restrictions against using a higher version due to breaking changes.&quot; Rust still has many low-level crates at version 0.x.x, from &quot;bytes&quot; to &quot;uuid&quot;. Reaching 1 indicates greater stability.')
