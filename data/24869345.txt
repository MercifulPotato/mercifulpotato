For starters this one &quot;supposedly&quot; is a tax for a special group of people (That is, those that for whatever reason spend money in foreign countries) but the reality is that a large group of Argentinians do shop outside of the country.<p>Besides that there&#x27;s a huge discussions since a lot of years ago, because the amount of money you have to earn in order to start paying taxes is rather low, and they don&#x27;t get updated often. Add to that inflation and the end result is a lot of people paying a lot of taxes (And the government being very lazy catching up updating those taxes).')
