Now the scam screens appear.<p>This means there&#x27;s some switch built into the code that changes its behavior, either after a certain date, or on certain known IPs that Apple tests on, or after a certain URL changes value.<p>At this point, the complaints pour in.  People ask for refunds and claim it&#x27;s not as advertised.  The $400 subscription fee has to be mentioned in some complaint.<p>And at this point, Apple falls flat on its face.  It does not investigate any of these serious complaints, which are easily validated.<p>Apple is one of the most profitable companies in the world.  If they can&#x27;t afford to do the right thing, they shouldn&#x27;t run this fake &quot;walled garden&quot; app store.  If 30% of my app dollar goes to them, an app that doesn&#x27;t try to steal hundreds of dollars from me is a very very reasonable expectation.')
