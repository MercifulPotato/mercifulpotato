Alas, I will be able to say a lot less than I had hoped for, and here I have to do something which I very much dislike to do but feel that I mustâ€”call out DeepMind for falling short of the standards of academic communication. What was presented on AF2 at CASP14 barely resembled a methods talk. It was exceedingly high-level, heavy on ideas and insinuations but almost entirely devoid of detail&quot;<p>I agree 100% with this paragraph. I have watched alphafold presentation and was as disappointed as Mohammed. Deepmind kept all the interesting parts of their method secret and Jumper dodged question after the next about the method. I am disappointed because deepmind would not had any chance solving this problem without the CASP community and advances shared over more than 20 years.')
