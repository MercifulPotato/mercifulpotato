I’ve not experienced any of the issues you mention.<p>However:<p>* I had to pay to replace the screen when it suffered the well-recognised broken ribbon cable issue. Unfortunately, Apple only offer free replacements for the 13” model, not the 15” - which is just outrageous, given the identical mechanism of failure. (Some weird ‘Fight Club’ calculations on the background there, I suspect.)<p>* USB-C connections are very unstable (physically) - like, hold your breath and don’t make any sudden moves while you’re copying large files via that route<p>* For some reason only some of the four USB-C ports work for video. This has changed - pretty sure they all did when it was new.<p>* My battery is shot and giving me the service message after about 310 cycles. It’s meant to last 1000, apparently. (I should get in touch with Apple, but after the screen debacle I just get a sense of weariness at the thought.)<p>At some point I’ll need to replace it... and I have no idea what I’ll do. I <i>like</i> MacOS (up to Mojave, at least) and the idea of going back to Windows or struggling with Linux makes me shudder. But likewise I’m not going to buy another Mac laptop, given the huge range of issues they now suffer.<p>Maybe this is what Jobs meant when (referring to Tim Cook) he shook his head and said he’s “not a product guy”? Apple are ultra-successful, but the essential quality of their products is on a downwards trajectory.')
