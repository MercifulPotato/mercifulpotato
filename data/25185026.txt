It&#x27;s unbelievable how powerful a tool it is, and when I watch people doing awkward and error prone simultaneous-editing and remote synching etc, it just doesn&#x27;t compare.<p>But then git is too abstract for many. Your files are a representation of a state of combined changes, the files themselves are not the owners of their content.<p>I even had to have a huge debate with a developer once about how storing a git repo in Dropbox folder so they could have same exact state across two machines was a terrible idea, and already solved with Git itself...<p>And then how few people also know how many places the Linux kernel or derivatives live, or even that many things they use are running something based on Linux.<p>What an incomprehensibly huge achievement on both counts!<p>[Edit] typo')
