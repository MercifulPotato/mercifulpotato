Yes that dropped Tesla market share in Europe, but it also means that many cars wont even be sold in the US.<p>Many of those cars in Europe are also plug-in hybrid, a pass over solution that also has to be replaced. Even more of them are small city cars with short range.<p>The same stories btw were going around about China. Tesla is losing market share in China and so on. And then Tesla opened a factory there, and guess what happened.<p>The same thing will be with Europe, once Tesla has a huge factory there, their market share will grow again.<p>That Tesla has even 12% (again with plug-in hybrids) share in Europe with a factory in California, compared to all the German and French companies who are producing locally is actually impressive.<p>Tesla globally has 28% of the pure BEV market, and that what matter the most.')
