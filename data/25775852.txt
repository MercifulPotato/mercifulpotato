Mill<p>1. It doesn&#x27;t begin from there, it begins with the sentence I pointed out.<p>2. Mill, while not a nobleman, was still deeply rooted in the British upper class - a state functionary from a well-off family. This is a guy who advocated for the benevolent dictatorship of Britain over its colonists. Even if you could describe him as &quot;permissive&quot; (which I doubt) - that&#x27;s already a philosophy for the oppressive masters. They permit, or fail-to-permit. Like I said - the _power_ to disallow speech is problematic, not just what gets permitted.')
