Articles like this are read meat for Hacker News. You endlessly reassert your political bias while pretending you are &quot;informing&quot; some imaginary group of stupid people (who in reality isn&#x27;t even here to be &quot;informed&quot;).<p>[1] Here is a recent discussion about 320 from a few lawyers and an YouTuber who used to work for the mainstream media:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7a5H1A65wOM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7a5H1A65wOM</a><p>As you will see if you watch the video, it is much more nuanced than the aggregate straw-man set up by the article.<p>...<p>The crux of the issue is that Section 320 was drafted with a lot of assumptions in mind. At the time the Web was a fledgling thing. At the time Section 230&#x27;s <i>practical effect</i> was to empower emerging platforms to do some common-sense moderation without fear of being held liable for all content they distributed.<p>Does the law still has this effect? Yes, it does. But that is no longer the <i>primary</i> effect in terms of how this law affect most of the people out there. Today its primary effect is to give an impenetrable legal shield to giant tech corporations that engage in deliberate society-wide manipulation of information. <i>That</i> is what most people out there are unhappy about, even if they don&#x27;t quite know how to phrase it.')
