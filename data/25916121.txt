And in light of that I can see how Bram and the other devs may have a very different view on where the future of Vim should be from where the NeoVim authors think that NeoVim should go.<p>Personally I think the fork to NeoVim was a good thing, giving us an alternative to Vim, and that convergence in itself is not necessarily a goal.<p>Just like with how I am happy that macOS, FreeBSD, and Linux all exist for me to use, and that Windows exists for others to use. Imagine if the whole world decided that only Windows should exist. I would not want to go back to Windows. Yet at the same time I recognize that Windows is the best choice for many other people.<p>Same way here, I switched to NeoVim, but I am happy that Vim continues to exist. Just like I am happy that CLion exists which I also use, and I am happy that other people have emacs and Visual Studio and VS Code and all of the other editors and IDEs.')
