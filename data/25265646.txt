Linux has &#x2F;some&#x2F; related features, but nothing that was feature-parity: SPA roughly corresponds with MD&#x2F;DM subsystem assuming certain plugins in use, DMU is very roughly the equivalent of OSD subsystem, but that one supports only SCSI OSD which has incompatible assumptions etc. - in fact, an OSD implementation on top of DMU should be pretty simple (main differences are due to DMU being a bit explicit on redundancy features, iirc).')
