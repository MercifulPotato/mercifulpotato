If the wiki is truly a list of everything the person knows, then the page contradicts itself: the person does not state that they know how to write, nor how to use dictation services, therefore they do not know how to do either, because the page lists everything they know. Therefore the page would not exist.<p>Instead, a more apt title would just be &#x27;random technical knowledge I picked up over the years and kept notes on&#x27;, which I&#x27;m sure many if not most of us do in some shape or form, and is not at all as notable as &#x27;Everything I Know&#x27;.')
