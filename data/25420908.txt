In particular such massive complexity that agency staff think going around the rules is normal, because it&#x27;s the only way to actually get work done. And then such glaring weaknesses that no one cares to fix. With google I&#x27;ve had one password for 20 years (my google account) which allows a hardware key for 2FA or google authenticator with what I imagine is sensible monitoring, new device authentication etc (I find this pretty secure).<p>Govt you are forced to write down these insanely long passwords with super complexity that cannot be cut and pasted that change very 30 or 60 days.<p>Because lost passwords are so common in these settings, the password reset process is usually a MASSIVE weakspot. I&#x27;ve seen it just be a phone call to a third party, you give them your username, they give you a new temp password - that&#x27;s literally it. And the passwords end up everywhere. In lots of documents that float around, emailed around etc etc. And lots of password sharing when you get locked out of a tool and it will take a long time to get a new account setup (months). Pretty soon the procedures manual also gets you root access to everything.')
