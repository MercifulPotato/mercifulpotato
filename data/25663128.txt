When the government doesn&#x27;t follow the principles and doesn&#x27;t apply the required due process when it needs to be applied, it gets outisde the notion of a just government. The right to the current actions lies in the Constitution itself, as it doesn&#x27;t allow for the current government to exist in its current form (doesn&#x27;t function lawfully), and it doesn&#x27;t fit the notion of a just government.')
