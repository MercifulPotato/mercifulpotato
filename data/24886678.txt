Can you actually cite cases where doxxing &amp; abuse happened over a conversation with a stranger in a cafe? And even if such cases exist I would confidently guess you’re more likely to die in a car crash than get doxxed on twitter by a hate mob. And no one is avoiding ever using cars or being a pedestrian on a street with car traffic to save their lives.<p>Maybe knowing in 2020 one can experience rabid social media mobs, and the newness and degree of its terror is skewing our idea of how likely this kind of event actually is. But I see this view presented regularly as though every one of us lives in active risk of being a single slip of the tongue away from ruining our lives. And it’s so strange and not in line with the reality I live in.')
