I guess denying access is technically a second version of the response body, but that&#x27;s kind of a stretch because the layer where the body lives (ok, the two bodies: one for 200 and one for 403) doesn&#x27;t need to be capable of business logic (like conditionals, db queries, etc.) during the request&#x2F;response cycle. It uses them in perpetuity without tailoring them to the session.')
