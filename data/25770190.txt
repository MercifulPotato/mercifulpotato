New Zealand had an outbreak in winter and a brief lockdown bought it back under control. I agree winter is hard mode, but we were 6 months ahead of the world in that regard, we were the warning that was ignored, we found it the hard way that soft lockdowns don&#x27;t work in winter.<p>&gt; and there&#x27;s still cases recently.<p>Bought back from overseas, unfortunately flight crew are looking like a major vector. Current cases are low enough that good contact tracing is probably enough to keep on top of it, it&#x27;s already stamped out a minor outbreak in Victoria and NSW just hit zero cases and will hopefully stay there.<p>&gt; You have to remain globally isolated until the virus is completely eradicated.<p>We&#x27;ll be globally isolated until enough people are vaccinated that exponential spread isn&#x27;t possible.
