The BLS tracks this stuff because people in the real world need to use it, not because there&#x27;s some disingenuous political purpose.  There are a ton of different metrics to get a broad picture of the labour market, as defined, and they put them out there, free to use.  The idea that the army of economists at the BLS don&#x27;t understand things like people being retired is just wrong.<p>We spend a lot of time criticizing journalists and politicians, but how many people bother to look at the data themselves if interested?')
