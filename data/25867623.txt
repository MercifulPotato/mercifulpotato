In blogging, especially about sports, the content needs to be there when people wake up, head to work, and first arrive at work. That’s the peak reading time (at least when I was doing this). That meant, I had no choice but to get up super early and work to get my writing out before I headed to my day job.<p>That constraint stuck with me. I cannot work on side hustles after work. I always work on them before. My second successful side hustle, Graphite Docs, started that way. It eventually became a full-time gig for me. I shut it down last year, started another company, left that, contracted, then eventually got a day job again.<p>And now, I work on yet another side project in the mornings before starting my day job. Perligo (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;perligo.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;perligo.io</a>), a digital critique group platform for creative writers, is mostly a passion project for me, but even still, I don’t think I could muster the energy to work on it after my day job.<p>So, that’s a long-winded way of saying try working on your side hustle before work instead of after :)')
