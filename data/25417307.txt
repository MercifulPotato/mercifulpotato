There&#x27;s no &quot;next platform&quot;.  PC <i>technology</i> spread is done.  As with other technologies, the next waves will be about efficiency, price and (as TFA does say) changing the way we work and live around PCs&#x2F;smartphones.<p>Consider previous technologies: planes went from the Wright Flyer to the 747 in 50 years or so.  But there&#x27;s little &quot;next gen&quot; for airliners after the 747, other than well, fuel efficiency, operational efficiency, safety, etc.  Which made riding in one a lot more approachable to anyone and eventually made low cost carriers possible and world tourism and Instagram influencers, etc...  But a modern jet engine would be recognizable tech to an engineer from 50 years ago.<p>That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing.  But it&#x27;s no longer a gold rush, it will be an evolution-driven industry just like, well, everything else.')
