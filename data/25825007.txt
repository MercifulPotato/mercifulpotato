XOR anything (text, images, etc) with a random pad or &quot;key&quot; the same length as the  data your are encrypting... and you&#x27;ve got an completely unbreakable cipher.<p>Just be careful as with any one-time-pad cipher. The key needs to be the same length as the data, generated randomly, and you can only use it once... no key reuse ever.')
