If its your personal device, you just say piss off, no you can&#x27;t have it.<p>Telling the courts&#x2F;lawyers to piss off is not a viable option. That&#x27;s not how depositions work. You might be able to get a lawyer to file legal motions with expert testimony attached pointing out they shouldn&#x27;t need access to the whole phone for the reasons you said, but 99% of people will not bother getting a lawyer for something like this.')
