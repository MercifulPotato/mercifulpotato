Repealing section 230 would effectively make courts the moderators of the internet, which is probably the closest institution we have to something that most people would accept as a moderator.<p>It would be prohibitively expensive of course, and would probably mean that social media could not operate as it exists today. But maybe that is the logical conclusion to this whole mess? Maybe the power to reach millions of people shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;cheap&quot;.<p>Perhaps the result is that there would be tiers of social media accounts. People wouldn&#x27;t be going viral at random with stupid hot takes, and it would be expensive (liability insurance?) to be an &quot;influencer&quot;.')
