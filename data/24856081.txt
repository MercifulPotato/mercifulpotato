I still believe that in the meantime, it&#x27;s irresponsible of Musk&#x2F;Tesla to market this as a &quot;full self-driving&quot; system or anything of the sort.<p>There is no doubt in mind my that people will continue to die by allowing this system to &quot;fully self-drive them home&quot;, and also that Tesla will continue to get legal cover for it, because the lawyers ensured to use all the necessary footnotes in the multi-page ToS that nobody ever reads.<p>For instance, they&#x27;ll be adding things like:<p>You can enable self-driving mode, but:<p>- you can never take your hands off the wheel<p>- you can never close your eyes<p>- you can never look at your phone<p>- etc, etc<p>Those footnotes will by default imply that the system isn&#x27;t really fully self-driving, so marketing it as such should be illegal as false advertising, especially since it puts people&#x27;s lives in danger.<p>Humans are not robots, so why expect them to act like robots? You give humans a 99% self-driving system, they are going to die, because they won&#x27;t be able to &quot;look out for that 1% scenario in which they can have an accident&quot;. It&#x27;s crazy to think that it would work like that.')
