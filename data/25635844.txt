Graduated YC W20, we were the most popular B2B software HN launch since 2012. Our GitHub repo [0] has 3.6k stars and a growing and active community. We&#x27;ve raised significant funding with 10 years of runway and are growing quickly. We&#x27;re 10+ people.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a full-stack engineer, someone who knows what a good product should look like. Our stack is Django&#x2F;React&#x2F;Redux (Kea -- main contributor works at PostHog too!).<p>Also looking for an SRE to take care of scaling huge event volumes, both for our cloud offering and larger customers.<p>We have a culture of written async communication (see our handbook [1]), lots of individual responsibility and an opportunity to make a huge impact. Being fully remote means we&#x27;re able to create a team that is truly diverse. We&#x27;re based all over the world, and the team includes ex data team leads from Uber, former YC founders, CTOs turned developers and recent grads.<p>To apply see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posthog.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posthog.com&#x2F;careers</a> or email us careers@posthog.com<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;posthog&#x2F;posthog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;posthog&#x2F;posthog</a> [1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posthog.com&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posthog.com&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;</a>')
