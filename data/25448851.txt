When I&#x27;m not feeling it, I play Thrill of the Fight on my Quest (boxing game - I&#x27;m a casual boxing fan). It&#x27;s the most I sweat out of any workout, and I can go for 45 without getting bored (unlike the rower or going for a run).<p>I actually got the Quest 2 when it came out, but being as the Quest 1 plays that game fine, and I figure I&#x27;ll ruin it by sweating into it so much, I hardly use my Quest 2 at this point.<p>Untethered is the future, and once they get lighter and more comfortable they&#x27;ll be killer devices. I do find the complete shut-off from the real world a little unpleasant, and especially fumbling around for controllers now and again when the unit is on my face. But otherwise, I&#x27;ve gone from skeptic to fan for VR. (And I do think longer term AR is where it will really take off).')
