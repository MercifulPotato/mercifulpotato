I&#x27;ve also theorized that work from home and self-driving vehicles are other trends that may counteract the trend towards urban living. If you have a self-driving vehicle (on the highway at least), longer commutes may be less of an issue if you can work, read, or watch tv (we&#x27;re not there yet.) If you work from home, commute doesn&#x27;t matter at all.<p>That being said, I work from home, but I live in downtown to have easy access to activities, restaurants, and supermarkets without needing a car. The difference in rent is dwarfed by not having the cost or hassle of a vehicle.')
