No, not the &quot;10 different developers&quot; but the person who wrote this. Yes, I get that there was an attempt to sell this a satirical but it&#x27;s just stereo typing mixed in with humble bragging. The average developer, &quot;is perhaps the most common&quot;? No shit. That&#x27;s the definition of average. Good to know out of all the sociopaths listed the one who just does their job isn&#x27;t going to be working there. The only other one you passed on was the &quot;imploder&quot; who is just as screwed up as all the other personalities but doesn&#x27;t buy off on your corporate  bs. I can&#x27;t wait to head over to Glassdoor and see what they have to say about you.<p>I also noticed that every person described here is a dude. Way to telegraph to the entire internet that you don&#x27;t bother hiring women.')
