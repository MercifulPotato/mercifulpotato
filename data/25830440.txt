Even if you knew how you might approach removing such a watermark, you wouldn’t know how sophisticated it is, so you wouldn’t be able to know whether you’d succeeded or not. I’d guess most zoom users wouldn’t even know where to start with removing such a watermark.<p>I personally doubt it’s particularly sophisticated at all. But the fear of getting caught it creates would be enough to deter a significant portion of potential leakers.<p>Why is any watermarking necessary at all? Because DLP (which includes anti-leaking control) is a huge concern for most businesses, and working from home makes the problem even more serious. Zoom is trying very hard to position themselves in this market (and doing a rather good job of it), so in that context the feature makes perfect sense.')
