(I was considering building one my oneself)<p>What I think has to be nailed is that you want to see tips from other users that garden under the same conditions as you. (Good filtering features)<p>Take a tomato for example;<p>- which breed?<p>- what zone? (climate&#x2F;seasons)<p>- how much sun per day hits your garden?<p>- what kind of soil? (Sand, clay etc)<p>- what pests?<p>- what style of garden bed did you use?<p>- how often do you fertilize? (And with what)<p>Now the tricky part is that all those variables affect each other so someone&#x27;s advice should have all of those questions attached and answered. E.g. someone says I use a lot of mulch to grow good tomatoes (when in fact it&#x27;s probably because it doesn&#x27;t rain much where that person lives and the mulch maintains moisture) (someone with a lot of water might benefit from a lot less mulch)<p>Hobbyist &#x2F; permaculture people treat gardening more like an art (I&#x27;d say big ag farmers treat it more like science)<p>I&#x27;d love to see something for the hobbyist, and optimising home growers through simple tips would be valuable. (Home growers can&#x27;t use ag-science easily)<p>===<p>I grow my own vegetables in a yard and it&#x27;s pretty much a joke when it comes to production. You get one harvest per year for most things, and the more you grow, the more pest you get. You need an avid gardener in your house, or a couple decently committed ones.<p>(I actually like just eating vegetables seasonally because I subscribe to the idea that plants are generally toxic and you shouldn&#x27;t eat the same ones every day of the year e.g. kale or beans)<p>If you want to get into gardening, start with potatoes, they are low in toxins, and good for carbs. Best of all, you can just dig a hole, put a potatoe in and grow a plant. (The store so much energy in their bulb that they are almost impossible to not sprout) (I also just plant potatoes from the supermarket if they go green and had no problems with it)')
