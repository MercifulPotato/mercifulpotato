I have a configuration.nix, networking.nix and packages.nix that pretty much covers everything. Then there&#x27;s my .emacs, bashrc and my i3&#x2F;config files. There&#x27;s probably a way to get those last three into my NixOS config, but I haven&#x27;t really investigated that.<p>I only use i3. Haven&#x27;t found a reason to install another WM yet. I tend to use xrandr, pavucontrol and wpa_supplicant quite happily for most of the stuff people use a GUI WM for.')
