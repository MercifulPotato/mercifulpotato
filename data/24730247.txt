I am interested working on contract but I live in NYC and here it seems like it&#x27;s always contract-to-hire situation where they want someone long-term but are using the contract as a way to limit the damage if the hire doesn&#x27;t work out. I&#x27;d love to find a series of 3-6 month contracts like you mention but have had little success.')
