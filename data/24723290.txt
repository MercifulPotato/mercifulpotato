Exciting stuff.<p>It seems like there is an emerging consensus that (a) DL development requires access to massive compute, but (b) if you’re only using off-the-shelf PyTorch or TensorFlow, moving your model from your personal development environment to a cluster or cloud setting is too difficult — it is easy to spend most of your time managing infrastructure rather than developing models. At Determined AI, we’ve spent the last few years building an open source DL training platform that tries to make that process a lot simpler (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;determined-ai&#x2F;determined" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;determined-ai&#x2F;determined</a>), but I think it&#x27;s fair to say that this is still very much an open space and an important problem. Curious to take a look at Grid AI and see how it compares to other tools in the space -- some other alternatives include Kubeflow, Polyaxon, and Spell AI.')
