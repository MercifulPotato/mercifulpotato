Item(by='megameter', descendants=None, kids=[25471843], score=None, time=1608322720, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25470227, text='One of the recurring complaints is with the open-worldiness of CP2077 not being very developed: Police that instantly appear behind you, pedestrians that walk through cars, etc. These are the types of things that mean the world is less a  system to interact with than a glorified maze to navigate.<p>There are really two things that happened, but they have the same underlying cause: The premises of the game weren&#x27;t spelled out coherently. That allowed the production to get out of hand, and the hype to grow to unmanagable expectations and buyers to feel betrayed when it wasn&#x27;t what they imagined.<p>Even the broad title &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; is suggestive of impossible scope, in the way that Microsoft has &quot;Word&quot; and &quot;Office&quot; - it would, at first glance, be claiming to cover all possible aspects of the cyberpunk experience. But it&#x27;s actually an old TTRPG license, and so right off the bat the game is hamstrung in catering to 21st century consumer expectations by also having to incorporate the nostalgic mechanics and lore of a 20th century design.')
