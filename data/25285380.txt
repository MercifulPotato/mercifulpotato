They are less productive because of the toll Apple extracts.<p>App Store rules, policy conformance, release restrictions, and Apple tax impose a huge overhead on everyone. There are higher order, dynamical impacts that tough even non-Apple users. (Kind of like <i>secondhand smoke</i>!)<p>Apple users are serving their device by surrendering freedoms to it. It should be the other way around. Apple users pay more, they get less, and the software delivered to them is 15% less good than it could be.<p>Competition can&#x27;t get started or survive. The ocean is being over-fished, and natural evolution has been artificially controlled by one entity.<p>Apple users are worse off than in the parallel universe where App Store didn&#x27;t happen.')
