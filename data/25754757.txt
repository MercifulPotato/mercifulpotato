I still believe that lies started the legitimate belief. E.g. republican leaders like Trump lied about election fraud, convincing many that a problem exists which does not.</i><p>I have kept coming back to this over the last five years:<p>&gt; <i>On Bullshit is a 2005 book (originally a 1986 essay) by philosopher Harry G. Frankfurt which presents a theory of bullshit that defines the concept and analyzes the applications of bullshit in the context of communication. Frankfurt determines that bullshit is speech intended to persuade without regard for truth. The liar cares about the truth and attempts to hide it; the bullshitter doesn&#x27;t care if what they say is true or false, but rather only cares whether their listener is persuaded.[1] Frankfurt&#x27;s philosophical analysis of bullshit has been analysed, criticised and adopted by academics since its publication.[2]</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;On_Bullshit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;On_Bullshit</a><p>IMHO this applies 100% to Trump (and many of his enablers). He will say different things days apart and cares not what was uttered before: he just spits out whatever he thinks will work in the moment, and if it sticks, he&#x27;ll run with it until it stops working.')
