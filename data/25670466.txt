Everyone is free to interpret it as they will, he washes his hands of all this. If he really wanted to send people home, he could just have said: please go home. Or even: look, we&#x27;ve tried everything, we were wrong. I&#x27;m sure president Biden will take best care of this country. Please go home.<p>Even if he didn&#x27;t think it, as what he thinks shouldn&#x27;t matter <i>unless</i> he wants the stirrup to continue. He&#x27;s supposed to be a politician, or even just a grown up person after all, not a child who cannot control himself.<p>Living in Hungary, living through this very same shit for 10, or maybe 14 years now, I&#x27;ve watched the whole Trump story in horror, but also thinking most of the time: yeah, this is kind of expected. This double talk thing is something our PM (Viktor Orban) does a lot of time. So yeah, Trump didn&#x27;t want to calm these guys down, or to be more objective, that&#x27;s not what he DID (even if we believe he&#x27;s totally childish and dumb).')
