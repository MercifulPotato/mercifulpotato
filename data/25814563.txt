Clearly the company should have decided on its price limit up front and brought in chairs that conformed. It&#x27;s not even really unreasonable to decide that the price of Mirra 2s (which are perfectly good chairs) is fine but Aerons is not. But, in that case, don&#x27;t bring in Aerons for people to try.')
