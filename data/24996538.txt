Or two if you want, RA and ND. Router advertisement, neighbour discovery.<p>&gt; DHCPv6 does exist, but I don&#x27;t really understand what it offers over RA+ND.<p>How does RA&#x2F;ND solve the problem of client auto-configuration of services? Rightly or wrongly, DHCP has been traditionally used for service discovery (&quot;Hey! Here&#x27;s some NTP servers, a TFTP server and a SIP server&quot;) as well as config discovery (useful for autoprovisioning of many devices) and I didn&#x27;t think you could achieve that just with RA&#x2F;ND.<p>Has anyone managed to get netboot or PXE working on IPv6 without DHCP?<p><i>Edit</i> just saw a sibling thread about DNS adverts in RA. I guess RA could do all these things, but if it doesn&#x27;t support it today, DHCP is going to fill the gap.')
