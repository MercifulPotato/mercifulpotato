And Madison writing so in not an accident -- it&#x27;s a direct consequence of the ideas of Enlightenment which he accepted:<p>&quot;Madison&#x27;s ideas on philosophy and morality were strongly shaped by Witherspoon, who converted him to the philosophy, values, and modes of thinking of the Age of Enlightenment. Biographer Terence Ball wrote that at Princeton, Madison<p>was immersed in the liberalism of the Enlightenment, and converted to eighteenth-century political radicalism. From then on James Madison&#x27;s theories would advance the rights of happiness of man, and his most active efforts would serve devotedly the cause of civil and political liberty.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;James_Madison" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;James_Madison</a><p>Ideas of Enlightenment and humanism are exactly the opposite of what the &quot;corporate Christian&quot; ideologists would like to sell everybody today.<p>Regarding the use of &quot;religious&quot; influence for political purposes, I also recommend the book:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Power-Worshippers-Dangerous-Religious-Nationalism&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1635573432&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Power-Worshippers-Dangerous-Religious...</a>')
