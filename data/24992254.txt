I gave the example that Graal is extremely powerful with a huge amount of money and effort behind it, but doesn&#x27;t really bother at all with serious register allocation or clever instruction selection as suggested you should in text books. It uses the most basic algorithm and doesn&#x27;t see any need to do any more, even when they&#x27;re still keen on tiny improvements to the output. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth it.<p>But it does put a lot of effort into object allocation, boxing, inlining, specialisation, etc. So those seem in practice to be worth it.')
