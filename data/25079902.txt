Item(by='m0zg', descendants=None, kids=[25082435], score=None, time=1605252426, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25079276, text='Bannon isn&#x27;t calling for their literal decapitation either. &quot;Head on a pike&quot; is an euphemism for getting fired. Another way to say this is &quot;heads should roll&quot; which also does not mean decapitation. Also, when someone &quot;eviscerates&quot; someone, that doesn&#x27;t mean literal disembowelment, just so we&#x27;re clear. Nor does &quot;raking over coals&quot; or &quot;drawing and quartering&quot; mean literal torture. But people here just pretend to be obtuse and feign outrage instead. Zuck chooses not to do that because he&#x27;s an adult. Kudos to Zuck.')
