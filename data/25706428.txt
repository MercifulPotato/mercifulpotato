Do you think there&#x27;s potential for abuse with different rulesets for different people?</i><p>Oh, most certainly. The same structure allows for racial discrimination, which I do not believe is a sensible angle of discrimination: i.e. I think Ben Carson should not be discriminated against for being black. Too high value as a top surgeon.<p>On the whole I accept it, though, because I don&#x27;t want Elon Musk prosecuted by the SEC and the instrument that permits both is blunt.<p>&gt; <i>The measure of a crime is subjective and objective. Subjectively, the victim notices they have been wronged. Objectively, there is a claim by a plaintiff against a defendant. A claim either exists or it does not, there is no sorites.</i><p>Indeed. When there is a threshold. However, the costs imposed on society by drug users are dispersed. You can&#x27;t Categorical Imperative them because some people are not capable enough to handle the responsibility.<p>Other times the crime is exposure to increased risk: no actual harm may occur. For instance, if you do burnouts on city roads there is little concrete harm, only increased exposure to risk.<p>It&#x27;s the same with many things: public drunkenness, drink driving, jaywalking. And society reacts to these by permitting these activities in practice for high-value individuals while proselytizing against them at the same time.<p>I don&#x27;t drink-drive but I happily do the other two.')
