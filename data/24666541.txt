Item(by='timr', descendants=None, kids=[24667948], score=None, time=1601669237, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24665719, text='<i>&quot;Perhaps, but Iâ€™m awed with how much we do know and how quickly systems have come into place.&quot;</i><p>Unfortunately, there&#x27;s a lot of unknown-unknownism going on in that stuff. I&#x27;ve had to watch painfully while people (even &quot;experts&quot;) discover things like false-positive rates and PCR cycle count for the first time. It&#x27;s a bit like living through years of undergraduate science education on fast-forward, but people only read the section headers and never fully grasp the details. Anyone who has actually done a lot of PCR could tell you, for example, that a cycle count in the high-30s is prone to noise, but somehow this became the broad standard we&#x27;re using in the US.<p>It&#x27;s relevant to your comment because a lot of these systems are shoddy (as you would expect), and the confidence in their performance is based more on a faith in shiny things than actual science. So we do things like set up large-scale PCR surveillance, and forget to validate the overall false-positive rate of the system before we start drawing huge extrapolations from the data. Years later, we&#x27;ll find out that the conclusions were wrong, but nobody will be paying attention by then.')
