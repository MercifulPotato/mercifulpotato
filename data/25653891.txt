As a member of the energy storage industry I give this a hard pass, this is also old news, costly and not multi functional.  Pumped storage makes sense in some specific cases.<p>Look to lithium ion for short time high cycle&#x2F;fast response, vanadium flow for long duration (expensive currently, large sites), hydrogen potentially and fascinating long duration start up out of Massachusetts (forget the name right now).  More tech will come down the pipeline soon.<p>Compressed air possibly but hasnâ€™t really progress much over its existence so far (geological restraints too).  My two cents')
