Also note that Apple didn&#x27;t just come out with the M1 out of nowhere: it&#x27;s the result of iterative improvements on the A-series chips for over a decade.<p>That&#x27;s not to say it would be impossible for another company to try to get themselves to where Apple is today—but it would be far from trivial.')
