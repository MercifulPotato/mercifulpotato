You aren&#x27;t wrong that some people misunderstand what it is to support science, and conflate that with certain policy preferences. I also think the blame for that can be placed squarely with those who have chosen to attack institutions of scientific truth because they are opposed to policy that might result from what is clearly true. Blame the politicization of &quot;science&quot; on the pro oil propagandists that put in the effort to make it that way. The naive &quot;pro-science&quot; stance is a reaction.')
