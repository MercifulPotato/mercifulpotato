Item(by='pdevr', descendants=None, kids=[25109616], score=None, time=1605514624, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25108675, text='You have two choices:<p>* Explore faith under the guidance of an organized religion or movement or school of thought<p>* Explore faith all by yourself<p>There is the obvious third option of combining these two options, but you are going to do that anyway.<p>The first choice will right away give you an initial path for faith. You can create your own, once you have mastered theirs.<p>The second option involves creating a path all by yourself. When you do this, look at existing schools of thought, and use them as a foundation to create your own path.<p>Regarding rationality:<p>Faith, by its very nature, is relative. What is rational to one person is irrational to another. That is why we have well-intentioned and highly intelligent atheists, agnosts, and religious followers arguing (let us consider only the mutually respectful arguments and discussions of the past, because the rest require their own topic) for eons, without reaching a common consensus.<p>Your rationality can also change with time. What is rational to you today may not be rational to you tomorrow.<p>So what should you do?<p>You need rationalism NOW. So, follow the rational path, based on how rationalism appears to you TODAY. Just accept that it will change, as time goes on and the neurons in your brain change&#x2F;evolve. Do not be afraid of change.')
