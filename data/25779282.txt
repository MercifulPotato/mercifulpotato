Item(by='Daniel_sk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610645497, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25779162, text='Survival &#x2F; military e-shops are quite popular in EU, although they mostly target people that play airsoft, do reenactment, survival, bushcraft and so on. Preparing for a coup or for protection against the government is not a standard target group in Europe :-). \nIn Slovakia and Czech republic you can own basically any short or long weapon and any caliber as long as it&#x27;s not full-auto. But you can of course only bring it to an official shooting range or match. Owning a weapon for self defense is possible for regular citizen and you can carry it with you (only concealed), but only for short weapons (pistols, revolvers). But it&#x27;s not a constitutional right, it&#x27;s a privilege and you have to meet certain condition. It&#x27;s a longer topic. But I wanted to say that even though we have a lot of weapons, the gun crime rate is extremely low. Maybe that&#x27;s also because every gun is registered, you have to take all the exams (medical, psychological, background check, weapon law test) and so on... It&#x27;s also forbidden to bring a weapon (even if concealed) to a protest, your weapon license would be taken and say good bye to your guns.\nWeapons in hands of citizen doesn&#x27;t equal to gun crime (also check Switzerland), but I am also not a proponent of constitutional right for everyone to carry a weapon. \nSo it&#x27;s maybe similar to social networks - they can become a danger if they are not regulated (same as weapons, if they are unregulated and freely available).')
