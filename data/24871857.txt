But I don&#x27;t get why people want to use Firefox. Not today, at least.<p>Firefox came out in 2002, when Internet Explorer had 90% of the market share. It would take 8 years for Firefox&#x27;s popularity to peak, capturing about 1&#x2F;3rd of the market, still leaving about 50% to IE.<p>2010 was also about a year after the first release of Google Chrome. It&#x27;s been a downward slide ever since then. Chrome passed it within 2 years. In another 2 years, Chrome passed IE. Now, Firefox currently sits at 4%.<p>4% of the market, and yet the bug reports I get on my open source projects are almost all from Firefox users. They are issues of Firefox not implementing the full spec of one Web standard or another. (Oh, and the reporters are usually not particularly nice about it, either). One might argue the particular parts that aren&#x27;t implemented haven&#x27;t completed the standardization process. That is true, for many APIs. But it&#x27;s a ridiculous state of affairs. A lot of these APIs have been locked up in the standardization process for years. For example, WebRTC took nearly 8 years to get a finalized standard.<p>The reason for this foot-dragging? &quot;Lack of consensus on implementations&quot;. It has been Mozilla&#x27;s inability to compete that has held the Web back. I run headlong into issues with Firefox nearly every day that have a BugZilla ticket attached that dates back 5, sometimes 10 years. Often, the answer to why it&#x27;s not been fixed: &quot;this is really hard&quot;. Well, if you had started, maybe you&#x27;d be done by now.<p>As a long-time web developer, having lived through the death of Netscape, the dominance of IE, the rise of Chromium, I understand the importance of having multiple, competing browser vendors. We need diversity. We need competition. Standards are supposed to make that possible. Mozilla is not giving it to us.<p>People say that the Chromium hegemony is going to hold the Web back. I think it&#x27;s Mozilla, failing to be good stewards of their products, that is holding the Web back.')
