Item(by='bachmeier', descendants=None, kids=[25362726], score=None, time=1607533833, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25359951, text='&gt; With the advent of DevOps and SRE, businesses and startups are moving away from the old-school concept of traditional server clusters to running their applications on disposable containers. The trend is clear and true. Developers are increasingly less reliant on a tried-and-true Linux distribution that lasts for a decade. With containers, developers can develop, test, deploy, and rollback with blazing fast velocity.<p>As a user of Linux as my main OS since 2005, and using it partially for years before that, I think another issue is that the quality of software releases is just much higher than it used to be. There used to be a tradeoff between &quot;trustworthy&quot; and &quot;recent&quot;. These days it&#x27;s more &quot;possibility of a problem&quot; vs &quot;absolutely rock solid&quot;.<p>And of course the general move to the web. Apps that run in your browser no longer need to run on a server. When I started in my current job in 2004, there was a Debian stable server used for teaching. (It might still be in use for all I know.) This semester I used CoCalc. That&#x27;s one less use for an ultrastable server.')
