Someone&#x27;s going to eventually build a big business with a power delivery company.  They bring their battery-laden van to your location and charge your vehicle, either for emergency assistance or for scheduled charging.<p>Or, you have some special trains (not in the US of course, since trains are an evil liberal vehicle) where your car is parked for some journey and charged at the same time; you take a nice break, get some food, visit the WC, and then take your car at a stop at the next major city.<p>Lastly there&#x27;s the battery swap option, which is probably the best overall solution.  Batteries get mass transported, and a smart logistics system ensures that everyone has power when and where they need it.')
