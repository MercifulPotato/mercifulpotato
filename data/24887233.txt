I hadn&#x27;t actually considered that i was &quot;using techempower as a way to boost experimental projects&quot; but i can understand you seeing it that way now that you have said it! =)<p>I&#x27;ve been working on this in my spare time for quite a while and one of the primary goals of the project is to be &quot;fast&quot; out of the box. I&#x27;ve been following and enjoying the Techempower reports since they started and set myself an initial goal of scoring well on it so I can use that as a performance baseline for further work. I&#x27;ve also seen a number of other experimental&#x2F;early stage frameworks on there and didn&#x27;t receive any pushback from the very kind folks at Techempower when I submitted it. I was clear with them about what it is: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TechEmpower&#x2F;FrameworkBenchmarks&#x2F;pull&#x2F;5969" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TechEmpower&#x2F;FrameworkBenchmarks&#x2F;pull&#x2F;5969</a>.<p>Re. calling it &quot;JavaScript&quot; - you do have a point as I am not keen on having to support the full API implemented in browsers. I see this very much as a server side only &quot;toolkit&quot; for folks who want to build fast network servers and other systems software and enjoy using Javascript and being able to take advantage of the amazing v8 engine and the huge base of existing JS code in the wild.<p>Thanks again.')
