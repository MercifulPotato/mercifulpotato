In general it seems dumb that any manufacturer isn&#x27;t just selling direct to consumer if they have a consumer finished product on Amazon.<p>However one insight into the reason is embedded in this anecdote: My friend was asked by a Chinese supplier to sell a thing on Amazon. But the seller then went on to try and transfer all of the inventory risk, and customer support risk to my friend. They then also refused to give a unique license to the product for Amazon to my friend and also undercut their offer to my friend with another random person in the USA. 6 months later the supplier listed V2 themselves on Amazon once the first person had built them a market and they could copy pasta all the english product info. Seller was left half their V1 inventory and had to sell at a loss to clear it.<p>Luckily my friend only burned the Amazon seller fee during the trial period and their time.')
