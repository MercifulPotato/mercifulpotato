Those people have always been there and have always been the majority. America Online back in the 1990s was even more of a walled garden than Facebook is today. Most Facebook users today at least know that there is a &quot;web&quot; other than Facebook, if for no other reason than they see links to it in their feed. AOL users back in the day might never see <i>anything</i> that wasn&#x27;t hosted by AOL. And there were the 10% or so of us who used the open web back then, just as there are today. For one of us to try to explain to an AOL user what &quot;the open web&quot; was and why it was a good idea back then was even more of a challenge than trying to explain that to a Facebook user today.')
