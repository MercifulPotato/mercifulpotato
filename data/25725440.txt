Gcc is very frequently ported <i>anyway</i>, for practical reasons, via cross-compilation. Being coded in C++, and capable of compiling <i>and</i> cross-compiling itself, Gcc remains quite portable, as is repeatedly demonstrated by notedly frequent ports.<p>It is hard to imagine what could be considered a &quot;deal-breaker&quot; in this context. By the evidence, portability of C++ is <i>never</i> a dealbreaker as implementation language for a compiler, as in fact the compilers actually used in &quot;get[ting] any other system going&quot; are, with only rare exceptions, compilers in fact coded in C++.<p>(Exceptions are found not to be about portability, but about the memory footprint of the resulting compiler, which is not a product of its source language, but rather of the power of the compiler&#x27;s optimizer, which is not always seen as necessary.)<p>In any case, the implementation language used for the compiler has <i>absolutely no effect</i> on the stability of an ABI for any target language. ABI stability is a <i>choice</i> made by language designers to favor backward link-compatibility over convenient expression of new features or bug fixes. It is hard for me to imagine the level of confusion that would produce this error.')
