There is nothing super complicated here.<p>It&#x27;s an inverted cyclotron built in a penning trap. Instead of all ions orbiting a single point, they all pass through that point.<p>The scatterplot is from a penning trap simulator showing the motion of individual particles. What you are seeing is periodic implosions similar to the IEC fusion machines. Instead of compressing a pellet with lasers and getting one pulse, this design gives you many implosions for free once the motion is created.<p>I HOPE it will work, but without ANY experimental data, nobody can say for sure. If it does work the payoff would be huge, and if it doesn&#x27;t, the cost of trying it is relatively small.<p>It seems like a fantastic bet to me, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m trying my best to fund the initial experiment myself. That&#x27;s the biggest hurdle, and also the most risky. Once that threshold is passed, if it works as intended, I should have no problem getting as much funding as I want while giving up a miniscule amount of equity.<p>At the end of the day, results are all that matter. If it&#x27;s not solid, then there&#x27;s no point.')
