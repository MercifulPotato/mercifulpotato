This is because you are following a playbook from inside an echo chamber that hasn&#x27;t looked to the reality of new tech that&#x27;s developing.<p>I said, the cost to generate electricity <i>when asked to</i>, i.e. whatever is needed to make the grid function. I talked about capacity markets, the guarantees against &quot;parasitism.&quot;<p>Therefore, the cost is actually reflected in the functioning of the grid.<p>The idea of &quot;parasitic&quot; energy sources is preposterous. If they can&#x27;t be relied upon, then during those unreliable moments the fuel-based generators can make all their profits.<p>If it were actually somehow cheaper to keep these fossil-based plants in force, point out the market failure to us. We have two <i>entirely</i> different market structures, energy-only in ERCOT, and energy+capacity in PJM, and they are both coalescing away from fossil fuels and towards renewables and storage.<p>Your arguments are years out of date. Everybody knows that fossil fuels have limited lifespan on the grid, the only question is how much they can manipulate market regulations to keep them going for a few more years. Exxon is already paying heavily for their foolishness in overinvesting in assets that were clearly stranded at the time of purchase.  How many more years of taking out loans to pay dividends can these companies endure?')
