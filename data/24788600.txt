To think they impeached a sitting President who was lawfully investigating the crime his predecessor committed and accused him of the very crime he was investigating. The only indictment that even stuck was obstruction... Of an investigation that did in fact turn out to have no merit. It was, in the end, a witch hunt like Trump said.<p>And all anyone can think about is the election. Maybe this is proof to those of you who still only trust the legacy media that many of the things Trump has been accused of are in fact projection.<p>The fact that BIDEN COLLUDED and Trump was impeached because of it is just the tip of the iceberg. Then there&#x27;s Crossfire Hurricane and the interference with Trump&#x27;s campaign by the Obama administration during the last election.<p>Election interference and collision? Whoops that was the Democrats, not Trump.<p>Quid pro quo with the Ukraine? Turns out that was Vice President Biden. Oops again! Impeached the wrong guy!<p>Vote Trump; he&#x27;s not the corrupt one. Can you believe it?')
