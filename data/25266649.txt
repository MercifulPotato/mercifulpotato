Item(by='yorwba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606840247, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25266113, text='&gt; We arenâ€™t obligated to abstractly uphold democracy in the face of a majority holding Nazi symbols.<p>What if those people holding Nazi symbols want human-rights respecting outcomes that are very different from the ideology of the German Nazi party? If democracy is not just abstract and symbolic, you shouldn&#x27;t dismiss a political party as undemocratic just because they use the wrong symbols, but look at the specific actions they take (the same holds for parties using the &quot;right&quot; symbols and paying lip service to democracy while trying to subvert it).<p>For example, the Indian state of Kerala is currently ruled by a government led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), not in a one-party dictatorship, but as a coalition government of several parties. They have transitioned peacefully from government to opposition and back again multiple times over the decades. And yes, their party flag is red with a big hammer-and-sickle emblem. Does that last detail make them undemocratic?')
