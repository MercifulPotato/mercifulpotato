(This includes function calls that don’t return a value, since you’re asking for a value that wasn’t produced—again different from null, which is explicitly producing a value.)<p>Node.firstChild being null for a node with no children is absolutely correct. Undefined would be incorrect.<p>Seeking past the end of an array finds elements that have not been defined, so undefined is correct and null would be incorrect.')
