If you had a good rent contract in a central location, you were sitting pretty and could probably count on a decrease in rent. If you had done the responsible thing and rented in a further away location, no such luck. If you are looking for an apartment now, supply has been dramatically reduced. Great for the haves, not so much for the have nots.')
