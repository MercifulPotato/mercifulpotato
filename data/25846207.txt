We&#x27;re imagining things moving (hopefully) along similar lines to how GPUs have developed, with dedicated processors for audio processing. It&#x27;s pretty clear though that the current model of distributing binaries for the CPU is not magically going to enable hardware vendors to sell audio accelerator cards, and hence why we feel a change of direction for the audio industry is required.<p>The way we see this being enabled would be a JIT based approach where the audio driver translates device independent code to run on their given hardware (and the &#x27;soft&#x27; rendering on the CPU which is where we currently are for machines without dedicated audio accelerators).<p>The design of SOUL has this sort of support in mind, with per sample processing and the parallel structure of the DSP still visible within the language, which allows the driver to make threading decisions at the JIT stage, enabling parallelism.')
