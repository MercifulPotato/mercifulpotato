A friend suggested I check out Raymond Carver which blew my mind.<p>His prose is one of a kind and his stories usually leave me floored.<p>I recommend the collection, &quot;What we talk about when we talk about love&quot; (the title of one story) -- which, by the way, is the play central to the (excellent) movie Birdman.<p>Man, typing this got me excited. Think I&#x27;m gonna pour a glass of Teacher&#x27;s and see if anyone wants to dance.')
