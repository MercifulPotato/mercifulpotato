If it&#x27;s possible to win a suit against an exchange halting trades, institutional investors would be suing exchanges on a regular basis.<p>Also the creation of the SEC was essentially to protect retail investors from speculative investments (that typically cleaned them out). It would be less likely to see a trade halt as going &quot;against the people&quot; but as a consumer protection practice, so it&#x27;s doubtful it will be wagging too many fingers at RH.')
