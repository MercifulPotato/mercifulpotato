I tried but there are some deficiencies.<p>- Apple Map : Better street view than Google. The scenes look more natural and having a higher point of view is much better but the point of interest is quite unfocused and their map app acts quite weirdly and very laggy under 3D and almost unusable. Funny their UI guideline always says not to block UI process but they can&#x27;t do that themselves.<p>- Bing map : Map is very good. Point of interest is fairly placed but their satellite view is very rough in Japan.\nSearching is weird. If I search for &quot;California&quot; I get taken to some location in Columbia with that name...\nAnd not sure how they don&#x27;t support Android? I get redirected to their search site when I visit maps.<p>- HERE map : I suppose this is US only? I checked a Japanese location and there&#x27;s 1 big road in a major city and nothing else...<p>- MapQuest : Not really competing...<p>All in all, there are a few better things here and there for other maps, but nothing really beats the overall quality of Google maps at this point.')
