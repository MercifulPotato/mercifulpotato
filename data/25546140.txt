A few years ago I had to drive a Mercedes S-Class every so often. Ironically, it was easily the least pleasant driving experience I&#x27;ve ever had short of a U-Haul. This was entirely because they decided to get creative with the controls, and did a bad job of it. The first time I drove it, I ended up having to pull off the road in order to safely figure out how to change the radio station. Operating the cruise control wasn&#x27;t worth the effort. And I never did figure out advanced tasks like turning off the air conditioning.')
