Item(by='jimkleiber', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610243019, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25707003, text='&gt; When Trump called the national guard to deal with rioters during the summer it was globally criticized.<p>At least from what I recall, it was criticized because the President was ordering the national guard into a state, whereas I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the state&#x27;s decision whether it wants to deploy its national guard or not, not the President&#x27;s.<p>&gt; The military do not have the training to deal with rioting citizens. They do not have the right equipment to deal with rioting citizens. They do not have the right organizational structure to deal with rioting citizens. The result of sending the military against your own citizen is always unnecessary violence and death.<p>I don&#x27;t have a military or law-enforcement background so I don&#x27;t know if they have the skills or equipment or not. You seem to speak with utmost certainty on this so I assume you may know more than me, but with the anonymity of the internet, I have no idea.<p>I don&#x27;t know <i>why</i> the national guard seemed to be delayed, I don&#x27;t know if that were because someone thought they weren&#x27;t the right ones to do the job or if it would be too much of an escalation, or adversely, they thought they would do a really good job at protecting and not harming people. I have no idea.<p>What I was trying to say is that I don&#x27;t know what the plans were, what the coordination was behind the scenes, and how few of us actually know the full scope of actions that were planned or intended and that just because a plan fails doesn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t break the law in a serious way.')
