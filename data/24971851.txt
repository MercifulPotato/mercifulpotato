I just don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re getting at.<p>&gt;the purity of haskell does not remove the necessity of mutating data in that database.<p>That&#x27;s great, because the purity of Haskell does not inhibit mutability. It just constrains it to lie within some mutable context.<p>&gt;Modelling mutation with purity does not eliminate the problem it only moves the problem to another location.<p>Location? What is a location? It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re saying you can&#x27;t <i>truly</i> add 3 + 3, because someone still has to add 1s under the hood. It&#x27;s just a different model of the same problem.<p>Honestly, it sounds to me like you&#x27;ve never used the language, and your criticisms come off a bit like standing on an aircraft carrier shouting about how iron boats will never float.')
