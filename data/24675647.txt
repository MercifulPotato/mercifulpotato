Recursion is not the important part. The ownership model is hierarchical. If your structure is a directed tree with all links (pointers) flowing out from the root, it can easily be built. As soon have you have cycles or multiple parents, you&#x27;ll need either unsafe or some ownership extension like shared ownership (Rc&#x2F;Arc).<p>Singly linked list =&gt; Easy<p>Tree =&gt; Easy<p>Tree with backreferences =&gt; probably best to use unsafe<p>Graph =&gt; probably needs unsafe for best performance')
