Using a &quot;cloud&quot; to store potentially sensitive documents or information is not comparable to collating your digital movements, usage history, habits, purchase information, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not just about controlling the information, it&#x27;s about collection in the first place. I want to store photos, and I need to store documents that are sensitive in a place that I can access them easily, and securely. These things are important to me.
