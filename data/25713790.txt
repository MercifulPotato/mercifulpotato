Item(by='defx', descendants=None, kids=[25717421], score=None, time=1610279602, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25701439, text='I haven&#x27;t looked too closely at Lit source code recently so I couldn&#x27;t really comment on that but, from a high level, they differ in the sense that lit uses render function (like react) that mixes HTML&#x2F;JS whereas synergy separates the two between view&#x2F;template. Neither is better or worse of course, its all about trade-offs and preferences. Lit elements are described with classes whereas synergy uses factory functions. Lit uses Shadow DOM by default, whereas synergy makes it optional.')
