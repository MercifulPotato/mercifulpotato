UK demand curves today don&#x27;t show this much - presumably because people still leave their office computers, servers, etc. on over lunch and overnight.<p>There&#x27;s also a smaller bump at 22h in the 1954 data and it&#x27;s still somewhat present today in the summer data. I can&#x27;t think of a good explanation for it. Perhaps street lighting, only visible as a second bump when they turn on only much later (summer) than the tapering off industrial demand? (An example of different demand types: those following fixed working hours and those following varying day&#x2F;night light hours).')
