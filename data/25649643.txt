Sure, we could overthrow the government, but you can&#x27;t just go &quot;my way or the highway&quot; with policies; you&#x27;ll never get support doing that. As spoonjim said, Trump wasn&#x27;t elected for no reason; He was elected because 62 million plus people voted for him. And with this past election, that number went up to <i>74 million</i>. And the opposition (Biden&#x2F;Harris) got <i>81 million</i>. For comparison, George Washington&#x27;s support was almost unanimous. Sure, it&#x27;s not exactly the same, but Washington had the support he did because everyone believed in a common &quot;enemy&quot;, the British Empire. Today, depending on who you ask, the enemy is either &quot;the Demonrats&quot; or &quot;the Trumpanzees&quot;.[a]<p>Not to mention that the United States itself wasn&#x27;t formed overnight; it was the product of <i>many</i> compromises. There&#x27;s even a whole Broadway play about it: <i>Hamilton</i>[b].<p>[a]: Yes, these are actual &quot;names&quot; I&#x27;ve read online.<p>[b]: Sure, it&#x27;s exaggerated, but it&#x27;s pretty accurate')
