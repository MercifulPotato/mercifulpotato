When I buy something from a company that produces their goods in China, I&#x27;m not saying I want Uyghurs to be slaughtered en masse.<p>In fact, in every single one of these instances, I&#x27;m not actively giving a shit - or making a statement - about either of those things... I&#x27;m doing it because I haven&#x27;t eaten since 6 a.m., or because I need a USB-C cable, not because I hate gay people and Chinese Muslims.')
