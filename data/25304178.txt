Item(by='yrro', descendants=None, kids=[25315945, 25306982], score=None, time=1607099323, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303987, text='The new design literally doesn&#x27;t work!<p>Trying to follow a link is now all but impossible - clicking a link takes me to the comments page. Not what I want. But on that page, the link that I expect to see at the top of the page doesn&#x27;t load! So I shrug and go back to the index page, and now the link or image or whatever is attached to the post is gone from _that_ page too. Reloading the page doesn&#x27;t fix it. So for that particular link or image, it&#x27;s now impossible to even see it let alone have any hope of ever viewing the image or following the link...<p>And I&#x27;ve given up trying to write comments or upvote&#x2F;downvote anything because usually tapping the arrows or whatever just redirects me to a page saying you&#x27;ve signed out, we&#x27;ll sign you back in... followed by .... a reload where I&#x27;m back into the same state where I appear to be logged in but any interaction redirects me back to this page ....<p>The new design is complete garbage and I cannot understand how it has been allowed to get this bad.')
