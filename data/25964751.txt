Have RH sit down with people who say they were affected, and go through the transaction log. Honestly I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there were a bug that caused unintentional selling like this, because it sounds like RH was acting on the boundaries of their abilities. This was an edge case that their systems weren&#x27;t designed to handle, and they didn&#x27;t have a good way to work around it besides shutting off trading.')
