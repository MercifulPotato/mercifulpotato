The opposite problem is provisioning way too many new tools, rushing the rollout with only the most basic integration, and calling it a victory. Even worse is opting in to all of the “advanced configuration” simply because it’s there, or even worse, not following the documented methods of configuring the tool in the first place. You end up not knowing which tool is meant to do what, rushed rollout means you may be fighting bugs with the integration itself, sometimes there is tool overlap and you’re just expected to know which one is the right one, etc.<p>My point is not “build PagerDuty etc in-house” it’s more the following:\n1. Use as few external solutions as possible\n2. Do not overconfigure the tools you do use, and do not stray from the documented paths for as long as possible (this is usually a testament to the quality of the tool itself)\n3. If this is at a company, on a team, you HAVE to go the extra mile and do the full rollout. If it replaces something, it’s on YOU to go do the replacing, and it’s on YOU to let people know what you are doing and what they should expect going forward<p>If you strictly apply discipline here, you should become very good at a small number of tools over time.')
