Until then, it is just burnt money with no return.<p>Batching up many changes and features over longer and longer release periods brings so many issues, and definitely greater risks when actually deployed as the scale of change is larger.<p>What the article perhaps doesn&#x27;t pick up on so well is that poor or difficult deployment processes lead to this behaviour of batching and putting-off the deployments. Do them less often, have less periods of service impact. Is the logic.<p>Which of course is one of the key points about DevOps, feedback loops, and CI&#x2F;CD processes to simplify things.<p>If you can make deployment easier, you can do them more often.\nMaking the changes smaller can help ease deployments, so can be a virtuous circle. Though not if deployments are not reliable or repeatable.')
