You can export a Scrivener-flavored file from Markdown to LaTeX without a problem. For that matter, you can also export to Word and directly to pdf. There&#x27;s an import feature in Scrivener to bring in Word files, I&#x27;m not sure how it deals with changes made by others with respect to the original exported file.<p>Scrivener is a terrific first draft program.<p>And for the guy who asked, it does an excellent job of exporting to epub.')
