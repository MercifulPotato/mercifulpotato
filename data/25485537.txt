They bought via TAS, but that&#x27;s a promise to buy futures, no? So it&#x27;s a promise on a promise?<p>The TAS contract is a future itself to buy actual oil, but at a price determined in the future. The holder of the TAS ends up with physical oil, just like any other future.<p>&gt; 2. They sold futures over the course of the day.<p>Selling a future is providing a place for the oil that you&#x27;re going to end up with to go. Futures traders often don&#x27;t want the actual commodity, so if they commit to buy something, they have to also commit to selling it to someone else. The trick is to buy low, sell high.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any &quot;future-on-a-future&quot; thing here, it&#x27;s just straightforward futures arbitrage. What makes it special is the mechanics of the TAS contract, which effectively means you&#x27;re contracted to buy&#x2F;sell oil at a price <i>you don&#x27;t know yet</i>.')
