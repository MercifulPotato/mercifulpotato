At the end of the day you can&#x27;t seperate the obfuscatory encryption mechanisms from those for repudiation, and even if you did, nothing would stop a government from tending to create carve-outs for itself for obfuscatory encryption, and by denying it to everyone else you&#x27;ve paved the way for abuse of those without encryption by those who do.<p>You&#x27;re right in the sense Encryption does not fix the problem of securing human rights. That is absolutely true. By definition though, the only safeguard one has from their self-sovereignty (in the John Locke-ian sense, not the Sov Citizen sense) being violated is the tools, technology, and relationships at their disposal. Human Rights security is not guaranteed for anyone from anyone. There is only a collective commitment amongst particular groups of citizens to only breach those rights in certain ways, and the agreements brokered between that particular group, another groups on how things will be done.<p>Also, to be frank, ubiquitous end to end encryption merely resets us back to the pre-telephony or dragnet metadata collection days of investigation. Before SMS, and internet traffic was all in the clear with enough third parties collecting enough metadata to make a data trail, no one had the ability or means to know your thoughts or social network, or all of your interactions trivially. Before digital payment processors, the couldn&#x27;t even know what your financial activity was with a quick call to your bank&#x2F;Credit card company.<p>This is what everyone out there seems to hope everyone forgets. Investigation was hard. It was necer intended to be easy, and arguably, shouldn&#x27;t be. Networking, and by extension Third Party Doctrine changed the face of it. Encryption may restore some of it.<p>People may be uncomfortable with the idea, but at the end of the day, tge scale of atrocity enabled by preventing people from looking after themselves is always greater in scale than that resulting from the small portion of the population that abuses it. You can work around that small group. History has proved that is a rare thing indeed once something has been taken away, for it to either be restored, or for it&#x27;s restriction to do anything but disempower the law abiding citizen, who was never the issue anyway.')
