Thus, you probably won&#x27;t have to make an effort to avoid them.<p>Again, this suggestion is for the new to programming segment of people; so also assuming these are undergraduate or younger level, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest something like Haskell.  While it is probably an excellent language to learn as part of one&#x27;s path to being a good developer, it might be a bit steep for someone new to programming.<p>Instead, I would choose F#, Clojure, or Elixir in that order.  I would not choose Scala, because there&#x27;s more of a chance that some early educational material would be from the OOP perspective.')
