What&#x27;s the point of open source if companies just steal it, build billion dollar industries on top, and then lock everything down?<p>I work on pg8000 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tlocke&#x2F;pg8000" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tlocke&#x2F;pg8000</a> which is used by Amazon, Google etc. I&#x27;d argue that pg8000 and any Open Source software doesn&#x27;t give them a competitive advantage, because in order to have a competitive advantage you have to have something that your competitors don&#x27;t have. It&#x27;s more that they&#x27;d be at a competitive disadvantage if they didn&#x27;t use Open Source software.<p>That&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t problems with the big tech companies, but I&#x27;d say that Open Source isn&#x27;t where the problems lie. In my view the problems stem from the nature of the web, in that it is a centralized architecture that inevitably concentrates power. Something like IPFS <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipfs.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipfs.io</a> would help liberate the web?')
