Tried looking at qt and flutter but they feel like visual basic to me, a handful of components to arrange according to their rules. HTML is like paper, I can cut out pieces in whatever shape I want.<p>(Then again, it took me a long time to get my head around html&#x2F;css so now I&#x27;m building a GUI&#x2F;no-code site builder, but of course the output is HTML&#x2F;SVG so it can render anywhere. And I only use JS to update attributes instead of waiting for a page reload. I figure if amazon.com can work without javascript, it must not be very necessary :)')
