But it does suck if you live somewhere that doesn’t have wired Ethernet ports on every room.<p>However I’ve found that mesh works surprisingly well these days. With 3 access points I’m able to cover ~2200 sqft with no problems, and it works well enough that I haven’t bothered setting up wired backhaul even though I have Ethernet ports in every room.')
