Item(by='Sodman', descendants=None, kids=[24944715], score=None, time=1604078666, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24944360, text='&gt; No, at least outside of the US roads were there before the car even existed<p>I mean yes, obviously the concept of a road does literally predate cars. But no roads that modern cars drive on today were built 200 years ago for cattle and wagons to use. Modern city planners built (or re-built) these roads specifically with vehicle traffic in mind (and in some cases maybe bikes). If they didn&#x27;t want them to support vehicle traffic, they would have built them using different materials and designs.<p>&gt; No I don&#x27;t think you should be able to unreasonably obstruct the highway. You can&#x27;t do that no matter what vehicle or no vehicle you&#x27;re in. But crossing is completely reasonable in my mind.<p>This reads like you&#x27;re saying you think it&#x27;s completely reasonable to cross the highway even if it obstructs traffic? I could be misinterpreting the connection between your first and last sentences here...<p>Either way, at the end of the day I think it comes down to the fact that we disagree on what constitutes &quot;unreasonable obstruction&quot;. I believe a single pedestrian wanting to slow down dozens of cars so they can cross the street 30 seconds quicker is unreasonable. Even if we&#x27;re talking about <i>all</i> pedestrians, the aggregate time saved by pedestrians crossing slightly earlier is far outweighed by the time <i>lost</i> by everyone in a car who&#x27;s now traveling at 5mph instead of 40mph. I believe the current system we have of batching pedestrians crossing using traffic lights is far more efficient overall. The &quot;should there be roads here in the first place&quot; argument is a totally different one however.')
