Item(by='klyrs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604522740, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24992312, text='&gt; It costs $60-70 million to build a 200-unit &quot;affordable&quot; apartment building with ground-floor retail. That&#x27;s like 5-10 mid-sized series As. Just to build a damn building.<p>At $200k a head,  that $60M would provide 300 employees with a year of runway.
