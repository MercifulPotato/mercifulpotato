I have so many open that I wrote a small webext for it that shows a page of all your tabs that you can click on to navigate to that tab with a click. just a nicer interface to see all the windows open and all the tabs. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fiveNinePlusR&#x2F;tabist" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fiveNinePlusR&#x2F;tabist</a>')
