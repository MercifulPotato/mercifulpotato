That&#x27;s just how I read Jeff Dean&#x27;s document posted here the other day.<p>Assuming I am wrong about that, I&#x27;m not sure it changes much about my comment. Presumably Google has the authority to ask for a publication to be pulled, and responding with an unprofessional email to a wide list is not ideal. On the matter of not agreeing on an end date, Gebru raised resignation and Google picked the date.<p>I just put it in context by thinking about myself. If I acted the way Gebru did when I was upset by a professional setback, would I expect to be fired? Yes, unequivocally.<p>You mention her having a research career - but she&#x27;s not in research. She works at Google. Her job, however they try to fancy it up, is to sell ads. Explaining to people that language models are racist and energy inefficient is not a good way to sell more ads, which is why Google wanted her paper pulled (I assume). If Gebru wants to be an academic she should work at a university. If she wants to work at Google she should realize her job is to sell ads. If her paper made Google look good (here&#x27;s what Google is doing to combat the racism latent in our competitor&#x27;s language models) then I have zero doubt Google would&#x27;ve been pleased by her work.')
