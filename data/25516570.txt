QALY analysis is used to allocate <i>all treatment</i> in places like the UK, realistically in other places too. Basically a very expensive treatment that is only expected to increase your lifespan by a few months if you&#x27;re already very elderly may not get funded if there are other interventions with better cost&#x2F;benefit ratios available in the queue.
