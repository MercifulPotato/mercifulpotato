If you sit there making 600 dohickys in a 40 hour week, and reduce hours to 32 hours, and you make more than 480, your productivity has increased. If you make 300, it&#x27;s gone down.<p>If you work a 6 hour day or 10 hour day instead of an 8 hour day, do you have more or less output as a developer? If you&#x27;re a sysadmin, what&#x27;s more productive, the admin who automates everything and sits there on call in case something breaks, but otherwise watching TV or riding a bike, or the person who spends weeks doing repetitive work which looks busy but leads to a far worse outcome?')
