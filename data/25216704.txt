I&#x27;m just tired of the poor quality of most websites I visit and tired of feeling tracked all the time.<p>I just feel like stop using seach engines at all (I use Startpage, btw), since I rarely find anything useful through them, and stop using any website besides Wikipedia and libgen, really. And maybe checking out HN once a month.<p>Anyway, how do you use the Web these days? Any thoughts?')
