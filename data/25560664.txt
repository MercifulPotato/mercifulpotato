As soon as winner crosses finish line, confiscate skis for testing. Negative = win, positive = disqualified. Ah, but then I suppose you have to test 2nd place&#x27;s skis to see if they deserved to be bumped to first in the case of DQ... and this process has O(n) worst case where you would have to test literally every competitor&#x27;s skis to find a winner...<p>I suppose you could just say &quot;if you are in top 3 and you cheated, you are disqualified for life and nobody gets that medal&quot; and then just let the communities sort it out.')
