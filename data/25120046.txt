The problem with current DKIM configurations is that it provides that assurance to <i>everybody</i>, including strangers who have no business having it. Which is why the ask here is for Google to do with DKIM what OTR does with MAC keys: burn them periodically, so that only people who have explicitly arranged to share authentication do so.')
