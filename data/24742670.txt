For me it was very helpful for two reasons:<p>1. Unlike a fixed diet or meal plan, it freed me to keep eating the things I wanted to eat. Not exactly as before, but to a large degree. I really enjoy my food, so not being forced to eat stuff I didn&#x27;t want or like was crucial. Instead I focused finding ways of keeping the calories per day roughly at a target value. This simplified things a lot for me, as it was a clear and very tangible goal.<p>2. If I failed one day, say maybe I went out with some friends or I just had to have some ice cream or whatever, it allowed me to not feel bad about it. I knew this process would take a year at least, so &quot;calories in &#x2F; calories out&quot; meant whatever I do today doesn&#x27;t matter much, it&#x27;s what I do every day that matters.')
