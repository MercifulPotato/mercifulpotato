They had a program once where employees could submit ideas for efficieny improvements and would get a reward of 10% of the savings (or something along those lines).  There was some process whereby parts were coming off the line and 100% needed additional work for final install (I believe it was hoods of Impalas or something).  My dad had proposed this change to the stamping that would have made this extra work unecessary and had calculated a savings of nearly $30 million given the number of Impalas built, the hours needed for the part and the average wage of the employee.  Management blew him off and low and behold, a few months down the road he was asked to build the tooling for the change.  He is not $3 million richer.')
