It&#x27;s by choice. I am quite comfortable in my own company; which was not the case, when I was younger.<p>I won&#x27;t go into the nitty-gritty, but there&#x27;s a lot of unusual circumstances in my life. I know that the life I lead is pretty different from most folks.<p>But I would not be comfortable assuming that something &quot;isn&#x27;t true,&quot; simply because it doesn&#x27;t apply to me.')
