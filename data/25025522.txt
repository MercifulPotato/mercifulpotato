My coworker has a top 40 playlist running all day so they have over 2000 streams a month.<p>If we each pay $11 their artists will get $20 while mine will only get $2.<p>I.e. even though I never listened to a top 40 song, the artists I listened to will only get $2 from my subscription, the rest will go to the artists my coworker follows')
