I&#x27;d like to comment on a few things and I hope to hear your thoughts on them.<p>&gt; Australia had been opposed to Chinese policy in the South China Sea, in Hong Kong and in Tibet, but didn&#x27;t do anything to help Trump in his stupid trade war.<p>South China Sea: okay. I also agree that this South China Sea thing needs to be resolved.<p>But Tibet and Hong Kong? Those are landmines. As far as China is concerned, those are sovereignty issues, and any poking by outsiders is seen as neo-imperialism. And I&#x27;m not just talking about the government: the <i>population</i> at large is also not pleased at how foreigners keep poking into Chinese territorial issues. It&#x27;s seen ast the last remains of 19th century humiliation, where western powers could walk all over China with guns and warships and put people on drugs (literally). I think many westerners don&#x27;t realize just how sensitive those topics are, in part because they have a bad understanding of China&#x27;s history (or just don&#x27;t care at all).<p>&gt; I can&#x27;t emphasise enough how strange it is to hear someone claim that. Over 1&#x2F;3 the population of Australia was born outside Australia, and China is the second most common place of birth of those. I worked in the university sector and we funded almost as many PhD students from China as were born in Australia.<p>What do you think of these events? Demanding that Chinese-Australians (who were born in Australia) testify in front of parliament that they unconditionally condemn CCP. This looks like &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; to me?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;PwwXN" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;PwwXN</a> (bypasses SCMP paywall)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smh.com.au&#x2F;national&#x2F;i-was-born-in-australia-why-do-i-need-to-renounce-the-chinese-communist-party-20201014-p5655j.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smh.com.au&#x2F;national&#x2F;i-was-born-in-australia-why-...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;australia-news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;oct&#x2F;16&#x2F;eric-abetz-refuses-to-apologise-for-demanding-chinese-australians-denounce-communist-party" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;australia-news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;oct&#x2F;16&#x2F;eric-...</a><p>&gt; My point is that if China had been smarter about this they could have come out ahead in Australia while making the US look bad. Instead they play the &quot;oh we are offended&quot; card and have lost a lot of the support they enjoyed in Australia over it.<p>Oh yes, I agree with that. China&#x27;s public communications and attitude is terrible. They have problems dealing with things in a way that makes westerners comfortable.<p>Oh the other hand, the reverse is also true: many westerners lack an understanding of China&#x27;s history, as well as what topics are sensitive and why. They believe western ideology is (or ought to be) universal, and dismiss alternative perspectives out of hand. That doesn&#x27;t help either.<p>China is like that Asian kid who&#x27;s had to endure racism all his life but was afraid to speak up. Now that he built muscles he overcompensates by getting angry at everything he doesn&#x27;t like. Everybody gets surprised at that behavior and thinks he&#x27;s just being sensitive for nothing.<p>I hope both sides can work towards better mutual understanding and cooperation.')
