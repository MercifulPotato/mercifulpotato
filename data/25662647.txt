The moment I watch a gun video, I immediately get shown Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, and The Blaze instead of all the cooking videos etc.<p>And yet none of the gun videos I watch are remotely political.  They are exclusively about sports and history, and don’t even talk about gun politics, let alone politics in general.')
