For example, the argument about &quot;shifting deaths up&quot; is also one you might be able to make with different data sets, but certainly not what was presented in this original article. Indeed, the data on the Financial Times website shows an excess of just under 6k deaths in Sweden that has <i>not</i>, as of yet, resulted in some lower number of deaths later in the year.<p>Whether or not other countries overreacted is a fine thing to have a debate about, but that debate needs to be made around not just pulling bullshit numbers out of thin air.')
