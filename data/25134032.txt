When you leave the company, discard the account and create a new one for your new job.<p>Your &quot;social self&quot; who keeps in touch with friends and family has a separate browser profile just for facebook. There may or may not be an extra google account to go with your personal email address.<p>Your &quot;privacy-nerd self&quot; uses a completely separate email address unknown to either colleagues, friends or family, and a separate browser profile again which is only used over a VPN.<p>With network namespaces, you can even simultaneously run multiple VPN sessions, one per browser profile ...<p>And since your identity is fragmented, it doesn&#x27;t matter too much if you have to burn one.
