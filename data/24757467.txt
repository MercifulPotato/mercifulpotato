Item(by='legitster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602526147, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756077, text='Here are a whole bunch of problems we are having:<p>- My home&#x2F;life balance is shot to shit. I can&#x27;t just leave work at work \nanymore. And now I have a toddler and a dozen other distractions as part of my workday.<p>- Also, I am not reading anything anymore. It turns out my commute was the only time I got any reading done, and that 40 mins of cooldown between work and home was actually important in some way to my personal life.<p>- Any meeting virtually takes about half-again as long.<p>- Sure, no one is dropping in to bug you. But we are now missing deadlines like crazy because people will just work on whatever and never bother to check in on each other. It turns out that 16 hours on a project someone could have told you was about to be canned is less productive than 5 minutes of someone dropping in on you and telling you that it&#x27;s about to be canned.<p>- Burnout is crazy high because now nobody cares about your life and how you are doing. Some people effectively lost all of their friends overnight.<p>- The quiet, conscientious people who make up the bread and butter of an organization will never have the assertiveness to be heard in a virtual setting. The only people who are consistently getting things done are the bullies.<p>- Promotions and advancements will be a shitshow. No one knows what an effective employee looks like right now, even less a manager.<p>- In the case this does workout then corporate has is considering hiring people from wherever they are cheapest since there are no geographic constraints.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to everyone&#x27;s experience, but as someone who has shifted back and forth in my career between technical and business roles, I can confirm that I was much more productive at home when working on technical problems, and much MUCH less effective when working on business problems.')
