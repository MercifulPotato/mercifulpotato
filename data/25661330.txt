Maybe for a week after I would catch myself subconsciously opening a new tab and typing `fb.com` when I was bored before realizing what I was doing.<p>I held out on deleting Instagram for literal years until about 2 months ago. I finally got fed up when they overhauled the UI to focus on selling cheap and crappy goods. I always thought it provided a lot of benefit to my life because it was fun to share pictures. Turns out I didn&#x27;t even care when I deleted it lol.<p>I think about deleting Twitter too, but it&#x27;s just so darn useful for breaking news. And I could never get rid of Reddit. It is certainly an echo chamber but unless something bad happens it&#x27;s basically the best website to find other hobbyists and even ask technical questions.')
