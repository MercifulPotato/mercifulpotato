Definitively.<p>As far as I know, the reason no company divulges information like this is to stop the endless protests and appeals from people. Dealing with people who believe they&#x27;ve done nothing wrong even though they have is tiresome and expensive and the more information you give them, the more ammunition they have to protest.<p>The result is innocent people like (presumably) OP&#x27;s husband getting shafted by a short email without any details, but it&#x27;s finanicially unattractive to change the system so without court or legislative action I doubt Google will improve their services any time soon.')
