There are some older ones in LA, but Bali Hai is more of an experience. (And actually has good drinks and food, from what I remember, unlike its closest surviving relative in San Francisco, the Tonga Room.)<p>I expected real estate prices to start going down, well, any year now, and they&#x27;re definitely a drag on things. I&#x27;m likely to have to leave California in a year or so for family obligations; moving back a few years after that will prove difficult, I suspect, unless I find one of those &quot;merely&quot; $300K desert cabins!')
