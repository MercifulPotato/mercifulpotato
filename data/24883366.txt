I have started to wonder if its worth trying to self learn mathematics at all since even when I do make progress its so hard to remember. If there were a well categorized Leetcode for math problems some more might stick but I feel like thats not really the point since people always say higher math is about proving or understanding things not mechanically solving problems.')
