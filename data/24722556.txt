As an example, if you look at California propositions, these aren&#x27;t necessarily all that well drafted. Often propositions are created by business interests and approved by people coming out of stores who aren&#x27;t thinking very carefully about what petitions they sign.<p>And after that point, you&#x27;re putting an algorithm is in charge of making the final decision. This isn&#x27;t necessarily better than having a leader in charge, because the leader can maybe think of creative compromises and the algorithm can&#x27;t.<p>If you study voting systems you&#x27;ll see they all have flaws, and they are all very simple-minded algorithms compared to people. Whether they actually capture the &quot;will of the people&quot; is impossible to say since the &quot;will of the people&quot; isn&#x27;t really a thing. There are just people with a lot of different opinions.')
