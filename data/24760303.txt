I&#x27;ve known plenty of extremely competent engineers who either don&#x27;t do side projects or simply don&#x27;t want to invite their coworkers into talking about their personal lives.  I do a ton of small side projects and I haven&#x27;t been asked about <i>any</i> of them in interviews, nor have I advertised my github on my resume or anything like that.<p>Out of all 9 members of my current team, the only ones I can remember ever talking about any side projects are the dev manager, who is obviously addicted to setting up tech stacks like he did when he was a developer (we recently compared notes about our experience using prometheus and grafana on home servers, for example), and one guy whose side project is a heavy metal band.  Everyone else?  Nothing I&#x27;ve been told about.  Maybe they occupy their time with being a parent, or SCCA racing, or mountain climbing, or building dollhouses; I don&#x27;t know and it&#x27;s not really my business.<p>I think there&#x27;s a lot of value in being able to confidently say &quot;yeah, I&#x27;ve got different hobbies &lt;shrug&gt;.&quot;')
