Item(by='gumby', descendants=None, kids=[25240621], score=None, time=1606591699, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25238610, text='&gt; I wish all schools&#x27;d put up their classes online for free.<p>By the way you can thank Hal Abelson* (also known for SCIP, patronage of the FSF, and many other things) for making this happen almost 20 years ago.  And “making it happen” was more than just sticking some videos online — which wasn’t even the first thing — but aiming to put <i>all</i> the course material online and encouraging others to use it for their own courses.<p>It’s particularly striking to me that it was MIT that did this as the institute is notorious for feeling and acting like it considers the educational part of its mission as an annoying distraction.<p>* Don’t get me wrong — many people were involved.  But Hal was IMHO the most instrumental.')
