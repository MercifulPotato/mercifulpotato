I have been using for example NewPipe from FDroid which is autobuild regularly as native Android program.<p>I would no longer expect FDroid now to keep doing this if they risk a DCMA letter that takes out their entire repo.<p>And I would assume a shitton of users use yt-dl code through another GUI application, rather than directly through an EasyInstall&#x2F;virtualenv&#x2F;whatever. And will most py repos still dare to host&#x2F;link this code if the risk is a DMCA letter to their ISP?')
