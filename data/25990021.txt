They&#x27;ll likely be willing to work purely for 50% commission, because it&#x27;ll be a slam dunk in court.<p>First of all nothing is a slam dunk in court.<p>Second even if you win you still have to collect and that assumes no delays and no appeals and no feet dragging.<p>Third it&#x27;s not like you file and the court says &#x27;oh we can fit you in next Tuesday&#x27; (sorry for the tone of that btw but I am trying to make a point).<p>Fourth, go try and actually find a lawyer that is willing to take such a small case. (ie &#x27;up to $350k&#x27; is exactly that. Any opponent would settle for vastly less money. If not they just drag things on.).<p>&gt; Of course, one would hope that Apple will do the right thing, but it&#x27;s also reasonably easy to force their hand.<p>Apple also has a motivation to not create a precedent by settling a case that might just insure future cases against them.<p>Not saying impossible. But all of this assumes even there is a case and not some legal carve out for Apple (or whoever you are suing) or leg to stand on.')
