I miss nights, but I keep at it), and as I wrote that comment I had a thought. I&#x27;m not sure I would have reflected so positively or even realized that I&#x27;d accomplished a dream of mine if I hadn&#x27;t been &#x27;practising gratitude&#x27; so to speak. It seems to me like it&#x27;s an important thing to do and believe in. There&#x27;s so much to be glad about that I&#x27;ve often missed.<p>Granted there&#x27;s plenty to be unhappy about, but that&#x27;s too easy and not rewarding at all. Anyone can plainly see what&#x27;s bad. But to find the good, it&#x27;s sort of a treasure hunt before bed. What was awesome today? As it turns out, plenty. Maybe even more was bad, but the good parts were still good, and that&#x27;s enough most days.')
