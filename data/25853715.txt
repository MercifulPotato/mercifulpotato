My Linux (work) laptop is an XPS15. Now that optimus on Linux is completely transparent (merged into Xorg in April &#x27;20). Sleep doesn&#x27;t seem to work well though. Fans keep spinning and it drains about 10% of the battery per hour. If anyone knows how to get around that &quot;active sleep&quot; mode I&#x27;d appreciate it.<p>My personal laptop is an HP Envy X360 with a Ryzen 5 2500U. That was rough when it came out. Windows update updated the bios on the laptop which installed a new GPU firmware that wasn&#x27;t supported by the Linux driver for a few months. It&#x27;s been solid since kernel 5.0 came out.<p>IMHO, the Linux experience on the AMD APUs is better than the Windows experience due to how rough the AMD windows drivers can be for the APUs. The fans are always shrieking at me under Windows but at idle they are off in Linux and the battery lasts significantly longer.')
