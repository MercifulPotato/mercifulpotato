I&#x27;ve been using the beta for about a year (or more) and have provided some feedback to Theodore a few times.  This eventuality was almost certain because of the App Store restrictions that have been in place since before the iSH project was launched.  In this way, Apple sucks.  They have complete control over what an app can and cannot do.  There is no alternative (besides jailbreaking) to the Apple App Store for iOS apps.  This is part of the deal that you should know about when you buy an iOS product.')
