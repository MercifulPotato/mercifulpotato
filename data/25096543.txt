Here&#x27;s the description given in the group policy editor:<p>&quot;By configuring this setting in Windows 10, end users will not be able to opt into a higher level of telemetry collection than you have set for your organization.&quot; (Plus some clarification of how broadly this applies.)<p>That doesn&#x27;t disable telemetry. It just stops individuals enabling more telemetry than you already had enabled.')
