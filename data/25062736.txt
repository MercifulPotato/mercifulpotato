There are various extensions for Firefox which will save to Pinboard (one of them is mine!) but to work with them - you have the option of going to the website or using the mobile site in a sidebar (I do this, with some custom css to make it more readable for me).<p>There’s a nice MacOS application (sorry can’t remember the name right now) which gives you a better interface, but... they’re bookmarks. I would like them to be integrated with rather browser bookmarks. And to be usable when the site is down or I’m offline. And to appear when I search... lots of possibilities there.')
