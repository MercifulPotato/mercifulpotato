Electric bikes are around £2000-£3000 (though both the new Vanmoof and Cowboy are right at £2000), so this seems to be just priced a bit more premium for a presumably lighter and more premium bike.<p>Sadly it lacks things like the insurace&#x2F;bike theft protection that others have, which is a huge deal breaker.<p>I do like the look of this bike, and if i was a bit more richer i would definitely one. Looks nicer than my Vanmoof.<p>&gt; wouldn’t they rather go for a scooter&#x2F;Vespa at that price<p>They&#x27;re different things. You can ride a bike in places where you can&#x27;t ride a Vespa.')
