New instructions (probably not), new modes (looks like), dunno (definitely).<p>However, Apple is one of the founding ARM partners and it is rumored they have a special license (not all licenses are created equal). Clearly they are doing this mode thing. Whether Samsung could get away with the exact same thing is a good question. I&#x27;m going to guess that NVidia can.')
