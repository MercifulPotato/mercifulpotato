My monitor is a 24&quot; 1080 Samsung bought new in 2009 for ~$120 at Frys if I recall. All in all, this package cost me $1,300 (there was a sale on the i7 at purchase).<p>I use it heavily for photography, occasional video and audio, and I&#x27;m currently playing Fallen Order (released Nov. 2019) with Medium+ settings (Texture is high) loading from a SSD bought in 2016. There is admittedly some weakness in the gaming department, but otherwise, zero issues. But I do think I&#x27;ll buy a used 1660&#x2F;2070 GPU and monitor in a few months to upgrade.<p>I have an iPad Mini 4 I use when traveling and going to coffee shops and that pretty much always fits my mobility needs.<p>Too many people are buying $1.5k+ plus laptops that they don&#x27;t maximize usage of, then chuck away in 3 years because they either die due to the compromising form factor or because they want an unnecessary upgrade to browse the internet.')
