You personally don&#x27;t like Johnson, and think his policies are far from optimal, but you think calling his policies &quot;fascist&quot;, or implying he wants to kill anyone, is clearly over the top. However, instead of protesting, you nod your head and keep quiet, because defending Johnson&#x27;s policies means that you&#x27;re a fan of Johnson, and so basically a fascist, and you fear the general opprobrium among your colleagues, and would prefer to avoid anonymous HR complaints of your person.<p>This is the reality of working for large tech companies in the US, just with Trump instead of Johnson.')
