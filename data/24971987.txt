So in the US you can get total nonsense in staffing, no show &#x2F; low work jobs - the EU puts up with a lot less of that from casual observation (at least germany, maybe Italy &#x2F; Greece have more of an issue here). Unions seems reasonably productive in Germany - does someone have more data here? I don&#x27;t know the details, just my impression.')
