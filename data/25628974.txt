Item(by='xondono', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609750122, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25625604, text='&gt; There&#x27;s something about software workplaces that discourages thinking out loud and exploring ideas.<p>I actually encourage it (or at least try). I just prefer it to be 1 on 1 (not necessarily with me), because we can’t really afford doing all of our work on a whiteboard, at some point we have to deliver. Also, I think this exercises are useful up to 3 people, then conversations quickly become too unfocused.<p>What I meant is that a lot of people are unable to recognize that they are stuck or very behind the schedule, and fear saying so, even if it’s not their fault.<p>I get it, I also had bosses who “killed the messenger”, and I’m convinced that this is in some sense a feedback loop. My point is that it’s very hard to break this loop with most people, they seem to either get it immediately or to be incapable of it, no matter how much I try.')
