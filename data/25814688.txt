It&#x27;s for hypertext documents and nothing else.<p>But one can pervert any tech to do any kind of stuff. So people started to build &quot;HTML apps&quot;.<p>Using inappropriate tools results in abysmal results. Simple like that.<p>If you use the right tool you can render GUI components even with microcontrollers. Have a look at Qt for example.<p>One could have of course all the nice things about &quot;HTML apps&quot;, even if the GUI tech would be purposely build and separated from the rest of the stack.<p>It&#x27;s just the &quot;Web Platform&quot; that&#x27;s a completely inadequate base for app development. But nobody cares as &quot;it works fine&quot;. The mantra is even: Oh, we have so much compute power and RAM! It would be a pity if we wouldn&#x27;t use it to the limit of what&#x27;s available. The idea behind: If your &quot;app&quot; doesn&#x27;t use all the available resources &quot;it wastes resources, as unused resources are wasted resources&quot;.<p>I for my part just can&#x27;t put in words how completely nuts this line of reasoning appears to me!<p>Especially as on the other side of the fence people complaining about the massive waste of resources by &quot;web tech&quot;...<p>The solution is of course also simple: Just don&#x27;t use the wrong tool for the job!<p>If you&#x27;re not writing hypertext documents, but want to build an application, just use technology that was purposely build to support efficient (along all kind of axis) application development. With &quot;native&quot; tech there&#x27;s no problem to render some GUI components. That worked flawless even back than on i486 PCs. The stuff in the past even felt much more responsive than todays web-tech GUIs.<p>But of course Google &amp; Co. will tell you that you should build apps for their &quot;operating system&quot; (the &quot;Web Platform&quot;), or else...<p>(There is even a broader parallel to be drawn to the satiation in the 90&#x27;ies: Just think for a moment about Kubernetes and PWAs, about Google and MS Windows ;-) But this rant is already too long. I&#x27;m sure the people here are able to see that parallels without further explanation).')
