You&#x27;d pay what, 10-15k per year in extra rent in the second residence? Probably acceptable if you have 1M.<p>That way you&#x27;re &quot;clean&quot; when it comes to taxes, and don&#x27;t have the downside of leaving everything behind. Easier said than done of course.<p>(Implicit assumption you&#x27;re the boss of your thing, so you can work remotely as you want.)<p>As others said, getting new friends in a new place (especially abroad) when you&#x27;re, say, over 30, is really tough.')
