Greyhound and Trailways were historically the most famous, but there are still lots of long and intermediate distance services (i.e. not just shuttling you around a town) that are still completely private bus services. Today, Megabus and Bolt would be contemporary examples. They are subject to some regulation as a kind of &quot;public transportation&quot;, but their services, facilities, investment and staff are in any significant way controlled by governments.')
