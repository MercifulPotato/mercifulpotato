Probably going to renew the TinkerCrates for my son, and drop the Doodle and Maker crates for my daughter and wife, they just didn&#x27;t end up doing them but my son can&#x27;t get enough of them.<p>Bought my wife the Paprika recipe app on the black friday sale so she automatically had the recipes I had been entering for the last year.  I mean, it was $3 instead of $5 or something, but she hasn&#x27;t really felt the need for a recipe app.  I&#x27;ve loved Paprika if for no other reason than 95% of the time I can point it at a web page and it strips off all the surrounding prose and just gives me the recipe.<p>Some random crafting stuff to make home-made Christmas gifts and ornaments.  My wife was just selecting some 3D ornament models to print as samples to select from earlier today.')
