Soon enough, it becomes <i>harder</i> to defend something, and this means the path-of-least-resistance is to <i>not</i> defend something, or to attack those that try. Anyone defending it has to adopt a &quot;contrarian&quot; style and tone, and sometimes hedge a little with &quot;provocateur&quot; behaviour to give themselves an out in case things come back on them (I wasn&#x27;t really serious, lol).<p>I personally hate so-called &quot;identity politics&quot; because it gives people a personal, group-identity stake in things that not only bias their perspective, but often add a strong emotive current to topics that fuels the creation of stigmas and taboos as above.<p>&gt; This was how I &quot;got sick of philosophy&quot; at Uni.<p>I did philosophy at uni. OMG stay away from the continental stuff. The (often American aka logical positivists) stuff that intersected with logic and mathematics was great though, although much of it seemed to be a study in semantics&#x2F;language&#x2F;meaning.<p>Check out Rudolf Carnaps &quot;philosophical nonsense&quot; stuff:<p><pre><code>  Such metaphysical sentences—into which we can be misled by the logical shortcomings of natural languages—are revealed to be pseudo-sentences by logical analysis. They are nonsense, in the sense of not having any theoretical content; they are not answers to any coherently expressible questions.\n</code></pre>\nTBH, I think the answer to such things might be: revise the traditional list of fallacies. what a task this would be though..')
