I don&#x27;t believe Parler was putting Amazon&#x2F;AWS at risk in terms of legal liability (I&#x27;m pretty sure in the US you can only sue a hosting provider for material they host if it is copyrighted material and they don&#x27;t take it down when they receive notices. A Google search didn&#x27;t turn up anything else.) They also weren&#x27;t at risk of bringing AWS down.<p>You seriously don&#x27;t think with the amount of publicity Parler was getting, that AWS&#x27; reputation was going to be hurt?  When my Dad is talking about Parler and AWS it has become a PR nightmare...<p>&gt;I often hear the argument &quot;Private company, they can do what they want&quot; but at what point does a private company become so powerful that we really do need the government to step in?<p>If the private company is &quot;so powerful the government needs to step in&quot; then it should be through breaking up a monopoly.  But it turns out AWS doesn&#x27;t have anything approaching a monopoly in hosting, so it would be absurd for the government to step in.  There are literally THOUSANDS of other hosting providers out there.<p>What you&#x27;re seeing is that nobody agrees with the hate speech Parler is selling, and nobody wants to host it.  That is the free market at work.<p>&gt;Vaping isn&#x27;t illegal. It isn&#x27;t hateful. It also isn&#x27;t inherently harmful. People used those apps for legitimate reasons. Some of them used iPhone sensors through APIs that aren&#x27;t available for websites&#x2F;web apps. And Apple just decided &quot;Nope, you don&#x27;t get to exist anymore&quot;.<p>So don&#x27;t buy an iPhone?  Buy any number of android phones that don&#x27;t require Apple or Google&#x27;s app store.  If you want the government to dictate who companies do business with, you aren&#x27;t for capitalism or free market, that&#x27;s all there is to it.  Parler isn&#x27;t a protected class, vaping isn&#x27;t a protected class, nobody should be forced to do business with them if they don&#x27;t want to.')
