Infinitely customizable doesn&#x27;t matter to me anymore, sane defaults do.<p>I think it was putting work into a vimrc that finally changed my mind. It was great customizing vim, getting it to be just right for myself. But there were a few things that ended up bothering me over time:<p>* No end state meant I was just constantly toying with it and wasting time. Sometimes the changes would be minor things that barely mattered, but I couldn&#x27;t decide which way I liked things more\n* Not always available, leading to needing to essentially remember two different versions of vim. Mine, and the default.\n* Keybind clashes. Bringing in new plugins was always a pain because there was a good chance that one of my custom keybinds clashed with the plugin, requiring me to make a mess of the plugin&#x27;s default bindings or to reassign and relearn the colliding binding.<p>With sane defaults, these problems nearly disappear.')
