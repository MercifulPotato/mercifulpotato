For example, I (and many othersâ€“watch some WWDC presentations closely and you&#x27;ll see this) use the &quot;display zoom&quot; feature during presentations and when doing UI work to focus on things. The feature where you wiggle the mouse cursor to make it big? That&#x27;s an accessibility feature, but it got a prime spot at the keynote when it was announced. I have subtitles enabled all the time since it helps me catch things in videos if I miss what someone said. macOS has text-to-speech, which is quite useful to read me back things I write for grammatical errors or typos. Accessibility features can and are used by <i>everyone</i>. (Disclaimer: I have partial colorblindness and wear glasses.)')
