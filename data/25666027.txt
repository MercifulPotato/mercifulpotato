I&#x27;d bet you cry and whine if you were banned. Also if you are right then we are fucked since 70+ million people voted for the &quot;terrorist&quot;.<p>But of course you don&#x27;t really believe it.

So more like defusing the situation rather than igniting it.<p>But regardless, you&#x27;d have to be an idiot to support a bunch of unelected tech elites censoring elected government officials. Whether it is democrat or republican or independent, sane people would say it&#x27;s not for the tech elites to decide which politician gets to say what.<p>For all the talk about &quot;democracy&quot;, those purporting to support it sure love censorship and authoritarianism.')
