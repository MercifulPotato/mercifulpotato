It wasn&#x27;t then. It was one of the pain points many users faced. One of the issues I faced was scheduled tasks wouldn&#x27;t show up in Flower. There was no way for me to know if a task was run without monitoring the database. I didn&#x27;t follow after that as I moved to Dramatiq.<p>I am so glad to hear that the community has listened and picked it up again. Thank you for pointing it out.')
