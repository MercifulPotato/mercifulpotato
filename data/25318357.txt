In my experience, I can actually get content up more quickly than a traditional CMS-type system.<p>Gatsby does some intelligent bundling so each page is pretty much self-bundled.<p>* Root HTML file<p>* Core, common JS  (cached after first load)<p>* Page specific JS (also cached on subsequent loads)<p>For me, this is 257 kB uncompressed - with most of that being the Root HTML file (I realized I don&#x27;t have minification or Gzip on - which takes that down substantially). Not a tiny payload, but the content is all static so the response comes back extremely quickly.<p>Even at slow 3G speeds, I barely get a flash. The actual page loads just about as quickly as HN.<p>With modern internet, the load time is nearly instant AND is literally instant on subsequent page loads (since most of the payload is locally cached).')
