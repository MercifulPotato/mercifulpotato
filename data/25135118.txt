Item(by='YokoZar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605694649, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25132563, text='&gt; What ends up happening is that people on these sites don&#x27;t get any value from betting on events that are 90%+ likely.<p>Sure they do.  Even if you never reinvest your money and pay the entire withdrawal fee, it&#x27;s still worth betting on a sure-thing when PredictIt is selling you dollars for 92 cents.<p>This profitability threshold keeps increasing the more you&#x27;re willing to stay on the site and let the money ride - a bettor on PredictIt can consistently get minor returns just betting on events that have essentially already happened.<p>The $850 cap per market and research required make it a bit of a tedious endeavor, however, which is why there&#x27;s still pennies to pick up so often.')
