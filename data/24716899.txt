Population matters for consumption, and emissions (if they were producing 5% of US CO2, it would really look bad for Norway; but they don&#x27;t - per capita the emit half than what US does per capita[1]). I guess it could matter in &quot;benefit per capita&quot;... if that were a thing (outside Norway maybe). I.e. how much did you benefit from US oil production, vs. how much Exxon benefited? I mean, yeah US citizens benefited from cheap gas - but that&#x27;s because of middle-east production, so in reality the production elsewhere in the world should count on the US as &quot;pollution&quot;.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;co2&#x2F;country&#x2F;norway?country=~NOR#per-capita-how-much-co2-does-the-average-person-emit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;co2&#x2F;country&#x2F;norway?country=~NOR#p...</a>')
