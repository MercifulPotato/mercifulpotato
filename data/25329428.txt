Item(by='jsnell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607316775, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25329056, text='&gt; For all the highly paid data scientists google paid, they somehow thought IAC&#x27;s business in this space was consumer positive when every metric must have been screaming that it was user unfriendly.<p>How do you get to that idea from the article? To me it seems to be saying the opposite: the Chrome Trust &amp; Safety has been saying the extensions were malicious, not that these are positive to the consumers. It also states that the reason the extensions haven&#x27;t been removed are anti-trust fears.<p>Are those fears justified? Given the quote from IAC in that article, that&#x27;s clearly how they&#x27;re going to spin it. And various competition authorities seem to very sympathetic the idea that Google should continue serving search results for garbage sites that real users aren&#x27;t interested in as long as there&#x27;s any appearance of conflict of interest. This seems analogous to that.')
