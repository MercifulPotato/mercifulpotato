Item(by='smsm42', descendants=None, kids=[25099752], score=None, time=1605330438, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25090245, text='&gt; I sort-of know that it means the phenomenon where Harvey Weinstein<p>I think you are confusing your imagination with reality. Nobody - and by that I mean literally, without exaggeration, no single person who lives or ever lived - ever pretended that Harvey Weinstein raping women is the reason they don&#x27;t want women on their team. Not &quot;everybody&quot;, not somebody - literally no single person is pretending or ever pretended that. Moreover, you know that as well as I do, I am certain of that (because you don&#x27;t know any such person, by virtue of such person not existing). So why are you writing these obviously false words?<p>&gt; Because apparently &quot;showing up at their colleagues&#x27; hotel room doors, naked and at night&quot; is somehow just bound to happen in the course of standard operating procedures.<p>I do not know who told you that (I suspect you imagined it just as you did the above) but it certainly is not the course of any operating procedures at all. None of them.<p>&gt; Also the related phenomenon where people walk through cities being casually and formally anti-semitic, deliberately crashing cars into groups of people, but call the other side &quot;mob&quot;, because they complain about that on Twitter.<p>People who walk through cities being anti-semitic and people who complain about cancel culture are distinct sets of people whose intersection is minuscule. And you also know it. Also, cancel culture is not complaining on Twitter about somebody marching somewhere, and you also know it too. Again, you are writing words which both you and everybody reading them knows are false. What for?')
