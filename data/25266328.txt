The only practical improvement you can make is containers (or similar).<p>Static binaries cannot deal with external dependencies, and many applications <i>require</i> external dependencies that <i>cannot be compiled in</i>. But even by trying to compile-in all the dependencies, you&#x27;ve only shifted the complexity from the filesystem to the build system, and you still have applications with incompatible features and interfaces across versions.')
