My insurer is one of the large well known providers.<p>Our insurance is very mediocre.  We pay the first $3,000 out of pocket and 20% of the cost beyond that, but that&#x27;s only if a doctor is &quot;in network&quot; (which is sometimes hard to find).  Out of network doctors have a separate deductible.<p>I also pay 1.45% of my paycheck to Medicare, and my employer pays another 1.45% on my behalf. Plus my wife and I pay an extra 0.9% of our paychecks for all combined wages above $250,000.  But I won&#x27;t be eligible for Medicare until I&#x27;m 65 years old.')
