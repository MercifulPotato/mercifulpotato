We&#x27;re a patient engagement platform used by most the nation&#x27;s GPs and a quarter of the population. We&#x27;re growing to tackle other parts of the health system.<p>We&#x27;re an ethics-driven team of around 100 people working mostly out of our office in Melbourne CBD (ex. COVID), though with full-time remote folks everywhere from Perth to New Zealand.<p>We value empathetic and pragmatic people, and use mostly Ruby on Rails, Node, and Ember. We have Product Engineering challenges  figuring out how to make software that&#x27;s usable and viable in healthcare, along with data syncing, integration with medical systems, and a consumer-facing hybrid app with a few million monthly users.')
