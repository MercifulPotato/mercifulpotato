What happens when the dictates are not as benevolent?<p>&gt; Then I&#x27;ll have to switch to a different phone maker.<p>That&#x27;s great for you, and that you can afford that, but what of the person that&#x27;s already invested a few thousand dollars into apps and accessories for the iPhone and iOS?  Many, possibly <i>every single one</i> of those things won&#x27;t work anywhere else.  And that&#x27;s not a coincidence, or people making informed choices, Apple in many of those cases has enforced their will on those components or how they are allowed to interact.<p>If I want something other than iOS can I put it on my iPhone?  No.  Not because nobody values that, but because Apple has arbitrarily restricted what you can do with the hardware you purchased.<p>If I want to run iOS on non-Apple hardware. Also a nope.<p>What if I want to move to Android and use my chargers or peripherals that connect to my iPhone?  Not if they use Apple&#x27;s proprietary lightning connector.<p>What about any apps you purchased through the App store?  Sorry, even if they wanted to many couldn&#x27;t offer you a tree version even if they wanted to, Apple has started completely anonymizing users and emails and ids for people using their apps.  They say it protects users, and it does in some respects, but it also means that Apple is right there between all interactions, enforcing whatever rules they deem prudent.<p>It&#x27;s obviously not as simple as just deciding that the next time you buy a new phone, you&#x27;ll opt for the other one and spend roughly the same amount of money.  You are literally at the same time likely obsoleting hundreds or thousands of dollars of investment in a platform.  These are forces that work to stifle and manipulate a free market, where people choose the best choice given the attributes of what they are buying.  Our current economic system is predicated on the idea that the free market works and should be unfettered unless it&#x27;s to protect the system or consumers from abuse.  Placing barriers to people making informed choices or acting on the choices they would like to make because or arbitrary limitations is hurting us all by extension.<p>&gt; because I like what I have now<p>This is ultimately what it comes down to in all these comments.  &quot;You want change, but I&#x27;m happy and comfortable, so I don&#x27;t care if this is problematic for others or causes harm or is setting up a problem for down the road, I&#x27;ll fight you all the way&quot;.  How is this different than climate change, or civil rights?  The scope on those may seem larger, but what we&#x27;re ultimately discussing is consumer rights, and while not <i>as</i> important, it&#x27;s still important, and why are the incentives and behaviors any different?<p>That&#x27;s not do equate you to specific bad historical behavior, but <i>that mindset</i> is specifically responsible for horrific things in the past.  The &quot;I like what I have, so leave me alone&quot; position should <i>always</i> be dissected for what it might unintentionally be allowing.  In this case, maybe it&#x27;s not that bad.  But maybe it is pretty bad.  That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re discussing.  I surely won&#x27;t take that position alone as reasoning for why to relent on my side of an argument though.')
