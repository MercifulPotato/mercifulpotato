Your McDonalds example is fallacious, as McDonalds is not bound by the first amendment. Someone protesting on the sidewalk outside of McDonalds certainly has that right, even if McDonalds has bought the local government.<p>Freedom of speech is not simply being able to wear a Pepsi shirt in downtown Atlanta, but about viewpoints that necessarily make us uncomfortable. &quot;I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it&quot;. That so many are willing to discard our hard-earned freedoms for the lure of simplistic neo-fascism [0] is harrowing. Our society has been whipped into a stupor by the specter of foreign strawmen, while the real threats to the US are the domestic powers doing the whipping. If you can&#x27;t see how this action is utterly anti-American, you are contributing to our destruction.<p>[0] One telltale indicator of neo-fascism is the analogizing of state activity to business activity.')
