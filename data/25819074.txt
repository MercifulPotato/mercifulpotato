Establishing a complex managerial democracy is way excessive for mom and pop shops or businesses with less than a half dozen employees and then those dictatorships scale up into larger and larger enterprises with no incentive to transition away from top down power structures. The benefits are largely for those who, under the current regime, have no power or say anyway, and thus the utility of more stable, productive, or resilient businesses is lost when it would cost the founders and owners their potential for ludicrous wealth and unquestionable power.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siepr.stanford.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;publications&#x2F;12-003_0.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siepr.stanford.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;publications&#x2F;...</a>')
