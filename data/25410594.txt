Item(by='jonathansampson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607895770, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390402, text='There are more problems facing the Web than just &quot;Google&quot;. Removing Google is good, and necessary, and solves a lot of problems. It&#x27;s why we excise much of Google and Chromium from our own code-base with each update [1].<p>Blocking harmful ads and trackers is a necessity; users were already doing it in growing numbers before Brave came along. But this trend, while it yields safer users, cuts into the support given to the sites we visit and love. And asking users to send money to sites isn&#x27;t necessarily a solid solution either.<p>So Brave aims to address both issues: 1) User Privacy, and 2) Creator Support. What&#x27;s interesting about this is that Ads are both the problem and solution. But not in their present form. Presently, ads on the Web harvest user information, auction it off to third-parties, and build up profiles on remote servers, far beyond user control.<p>Brave&#x27;s privacy-respecting ad model uses client-side matching against regional catalogs (avoiding fingerprinting) with machine-learning. This model ensures privacy. And when an ad is displayed, 70% of the revenue goes into the user&#x27;s cryptographically-secured wallet. This is where the second challenge (supporting content creators) comes in. As you browse, the ad-revenue you&#x27;ve generated gets queued up for the sites you visit. The privacy-respecting ads you view are translated into real-world support for the sites you visit.<p>This is one of the reasons why users prefer Brave. We aren&#x27;t trying to solve half of the problem; we&#x27;re trying to reform the Web such that it remains free, equitable, and open.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brave&#x2F;brave-browser&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deviations-from-Chromium-(features-we-disable-or-remove)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brave&#x2F;brave-browser&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deviations-from-...</a>')
