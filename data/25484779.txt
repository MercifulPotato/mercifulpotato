Best to be aware of your own biases, and try to be as objective as you can in your decisions.<p>Experience matters, and there <i>are</i> new solutions that are inferior to older ones in many cases (yes, there is plenty of &quot;snake oil&quot; for sale).  However, sometimes new people look at an old problem with fresh eyes and come up with better ideas on how to solve it.<p>This really isn&#x27;t anything new.  When I was fresh out of college I remember older programmers talking about &quot;such-and-such&quot; is just the old way of doing it repackaged.  There is lots of oscillation in the computer industry.')
