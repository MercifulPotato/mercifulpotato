Item(by='ALittleLight', descendants=None, kids=[25526270], score=None, time=1608801556, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25525939, text='I took a paragraph from the article and said why I thought it was wrong. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s pedantry to point out that the author&#x27;s claim is wrong. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s wrong in some technical, hair splitting sense, but just completely wrong. The author observes modern diversity and suggests it helped in a past struggle, but the modern diversity actually didn&#x27;t exist then.<p>If it&#x27;s pedantry to point out this is wrong, then that&#x27;s a greater criticism of the article because the author is including a paragraph that is so unimportant it apparently doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s true or false.<p>You mention that Nazi Germany was big on supremacy and homogeneity and the US isn&#x27;t, but I think that&#x27;s the same mistake I originally pointed out. You are conflating modern ideals (don&#x27;t care about homogeneity or [racial] supremacy) with past ideals. America of the pre-war was actually concerned with those things. I could point to the power of the Klu Klux Klan or the fact that the Nazi eugenics movement was influenced by the American eugenics movement.<p>It&#x27;s not the case that &quot;We&quot; won the second world war. Our forbears did, and in some ways they were similar to us and in some different.<p>My overarching point is that it doesn&#x27;t really make sense to use the second world war as an example of the strength of modern diversity because modern diversity wasn&#x27;t in place at that time.')
