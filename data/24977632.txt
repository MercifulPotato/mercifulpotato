Fuzzy matching it against a list doesn&#x27;t break any flow for me on the other hand.<p>Which matches how my memory works: I cannot remember hard facts and data well (function DoSomethingVeryHardCore). However I&#x27;m good at remembering abstract things (function which does something hardcore). I am pretty sure learning many things by heart from the many very different codebases I work on would be a complete waste of time. Instead learning some abstract mental model of the codebases architecture, and how to navigate through it in text, is what makes me fast and efficient.')
