Catalina routinely forgets the monitor is portrait and requires manually changing it back _every time the machine is locked_.<p>Why is this relevant? I&#x27;m seriously considering a 1440p 32:9 240hz Samsung G9 so that I can ditch multiple monitors and move to a single display with similar overall screen space just to dodge pesky multi-screen bugs like this. Just docking my laptop and using a massive screen would be SO NICE!<p>Only thing that&#x27;s holding me back is I really want 2160p tall in that form factor. Will probably need to wait for DisplayPort2.0')
