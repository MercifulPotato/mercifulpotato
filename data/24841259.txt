Julia is composable -- Suppose I want to write a library to find compression polynomials for reed-solomon encoding system (see mary wootters&#x27; talks on youtube) for my storage product.  I need a LU decomposition algorithm that operates on GF256 (which is just an 8-bit int).  But the +&#x2F;-&#x2F;x&#x2F;divide operations are all messed up.  I&#x27;d have to rewrite LU decomposition.  How confident are you that you can get even that right?  I&#x27;m pretty good at implementing algorithms, but I&#x27;ve messed up LU decomposition before.<p>Then suppose I rewrite the LU decomposition algorithm, using python.  Now I want to accelerate the search by running the  search on GPUs.  I have to re-rewrite the code from scratch.  Each GF256 encoding has to have rejiggered operators, and so I need to rewrite custom GPU kernels, then figure out how to resequence the operations (* looks different for each GF256 encoding), etc.<p>This is all SUPER easy in julia.')
