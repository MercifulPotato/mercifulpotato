The embedded market can operate at a loss because their revenue is based on subscription services. The recent releases of new NVidia and AMD parts is a perfect example: AMD&#x27;s share of TSMC&#x27;s capacity was allocated mostly to produce the PS 5 and the Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, while Samsung (NVidia&#x27;s fab) clearly couldn&#x27;t handle the sheer demand for the RTX 3000 series. Fortunately there are several OEM PC manufacturers still, but in the long term they will follow where the market forces blow too.')
