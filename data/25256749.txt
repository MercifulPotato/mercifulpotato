What about billionares flying around the world in private jets or cruising in their yachts?<p>Moreover, if carbon emissions are the issue, why not tax it directly (aka carbon tax), rather than indirectly via a &quot;sin&quot; tax? That would have the effect of incentivizing the reduction of carbon emissions economy wide, rather than in a tiny sector.')
