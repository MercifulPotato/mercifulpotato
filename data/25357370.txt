But that&#x27;s not what we expect to see on HN&#x2F;Reddit&#x2F;open source projects.<p>You seem to not like that dev tools are not a sustainable business today. That was kind of inevitable. Using paid dev tools alienates contributors in open source development, and students&#x2F;3rd world can&#x27;t afford them, and lot of paid tools are specialized to some domains (think SAP). Doesn&#x27;t help that proprietary vendors try to lock down stuff and lot of rent seeking behavior (Oracle, qt company)..<p>Atlassian made some steps in lowering this barrier of entry, and built a pretty good business IMO, though not much developer specific.<p>If there&#x27;s anything to learn, unless there&#x27;s an app store like low barrier to entry platform for dev tools with student discounts, free trials etc.. people may learn paying for high quality developer tools.')
