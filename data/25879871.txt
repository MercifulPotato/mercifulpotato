The atmosphere isn&#x27;t even thick enough to slow down properly from the massive speed you need to get there at a time scale that works.  How do you land large colonization facilities, landers, etc. in an atmosphere that is 1% as dense as Earth&#x27;s?  How do you then have enough fuel to leave?  I know there are workarounds for everything but there are some hard physics walls here.<p>&gt;The highest atmospheric density on Mars is equal to the density found 35 km above the Earth&#x27;s surface.')
