My wife recently bought a flat to rent out, she&#x27;s been handling all the comms and paperwork with the solicitors, mortgage company, etc. I only own a 5% share, but when it came to closing the (female) solicitor (attorney?) called me first every single time she had a question, even though I told her every time she should call my wife as she&#x27;s handling all the arrangements.')
