People will put them accessible to the driveways, from the garage. In normal parts of the world, people would actually be parking inside of their garages rather than using them as storage space or living space, as happens in the Bay Area.<p>But as somebody who also lives in a Bay Area suburban hell that is trying desperately to pretend it can get by with bad planning of suburban sprawl, this are is not a problem at all. People in my neighborhood work around that just fine! I see many electric cars on my street, mostly charging close to the house. Some people run wires to the sidewalk for curbside charging, but not many.<p>The harder areas are places like SF where there&#x27;s even more limited driveway access. That&#x27;s where streetlights come in.<p>If your neighborhood isn&#x27;t dense enough to have streetlight, no problem.<p>Edit: one key piece to charging from a garage 220V outlet is that you don&#x27;t need to charge every single day. Charging every other day or every four days is just fine. So if you have 4 single people living in a 4 bedroom house, each with cars, that&#x27;s just enough to get by in one charger.')
