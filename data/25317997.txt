I get better life on Linux, by far. Are you aware of the powertop tools &amp; the tuning it can do? tlp? These tweaks buy me less than 20% more life, but that might change. Newer kernel versions are much better, and they also have far more aggressive defaults. If you were running an 18.04 Ubuntu that 4.15 kernel is not doing you any favors.<p>* No face recognition login is not something I&#x27;m interested in. It is nice to get back in the game fast, but worrying about 5s to throw in a password, to me, is small fries. And I don&#x27;t really like or trust these systems in the first place.<p>But in general, what is notable about your post to me is that it&#x27;s a weird laundry list of concerns that doesn&#x27;t talk to the overarching experience. I&#x27;ve had detachable 2-in-1 computers for near to a decade, before that a Fujitsu P-series touchscreen+pen, all running Linux, but so far I&#x27;ve only ever used any of them in a more conventional computing mode. I have yet to break out Gnome or other mainstream multi-paradigm computing environments, but I am so interested to know, what is the workflow like, how would I use these things in tablet mode? As it is, if I want something portable, I reach for my Android phone. I&#x27;d like, some day to change that. These specific concerns you&#x27;ve listed seem low on my priority list, far below knowing &amp; thinking about the overall general experience.')
