It&#x27;s incredibly difficult to assess compliance with a diet (especially when the diet does not call for precise to-the-gram measurement of ingredients). The best way to make this work is to feed the subjects in the lab (and pray that they don&#x27;t cheat!). This is expensive, and it&#x27;s difficult to recruit subject for such constrictive experimental parameters.<p>Also it goes without saying, but statistical tools won&#x27;t save you if your data is garbage.')
