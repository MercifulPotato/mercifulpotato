I&#x27;m pretty sure they are under insane external pressure to meet a deadline and to fit everything into a media friendly slot. Delays in communication feed will not be met with nods of approval over their commitment to accuracy - it&#x27;ll feed into the narrative that no-one knows what they&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;ve no time at all for the British government but I have to chuckle at some commentary. &quot;It&#x27;s easy bro, just take your time.&quot;<p>More generally I feel like this is an instance where our reporting&#x2F;visualisation tools have totally outpaced the data pipeline. We&#x27;ve got interactive dashboards with integrated maps and widgets showing us global figures in real time and they&#x27;re great. And yes, I was one of those people who morbidly kept the Johns Hopkins dashboard open at the start of all this. But the data that&#x27;s feeding these is coming from a various Excel spreadsheets updated (partly updated by hand) once a day (but maybe not weekend). These in turn are based on other spreadsheets&#x2F;CSV files (probably sent by email). The flashy &quot;real time&quot; element gives us a warped perception of what we&#x27;re looking at. Yes, last weeks figures may change tomorrow - not because of a cover up (or even individual incompetence) - it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re adding in the cases that didn&#x27;t come through last week from one lab&#x2F;region because someone was on holiday or the file wasn&#x27;t ready by the deadline.<p>There was a delay the other day updating the UK daily figures and the data.gov.uk website had a note  saying &quot;Last updated : invalid date&quot;. I think it was there for an hour or so but even that brief period was enough to invite mocking commentary.')
