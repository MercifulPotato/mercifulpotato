I&#x27;m not too familiar with logic programming myself, but my impression is that miniKanren, core.logic, and Prolog all use basically the same algorithm, operate on the same type of data, and try to solve the same set of problems. The advantages&#x2F;disadvantages are probably external to the core problem space, e.g. do you prefer an embedded DSL better to a full-blown logic programming language and so on.<p>I&#x27;m a hardcore Clojure advocate (it&#x27;s a fantastic programming language with a great ecosystem of libraries), but there&#x27;s no doubt that the amount of resources available for learning the API of core.logic is less than what&#x27;s available for Prolog. If the objective is to learn logic programming from the available resources, Prolog is probably the better option.')
