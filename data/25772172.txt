I&#x27;m pretty relaxed about some percentage of welfare going to people who are gaming the system and don&#x27;t want to work as long as the people who need it are getting it.<p>In the UK: &quot;A poll conducted by the Trades Union Congress in 2012 found that perceptions among the British public were that benefit fraud was high â€“ on average people thought that 27% of the British welfare budget is claimed fraudulently; however, official UK Government figures have stated that the proportion of fraud stands at 0.7% of the total welfare budget in 2011&#x2F;12.&quot;<p>Hard to know what percentage the people would accept in practice, but I&#x27;ve gotta suspect it&#x27;s higher than the actual percentage that exists.')
