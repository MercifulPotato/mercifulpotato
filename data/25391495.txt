Item(by='CivBase', descendants=None, kids=[25394809], score=None, time=1607723044, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25389971, text='&gt; Your right to swing your fists ends where my nose begins.<p>I keep seeing this analogy when it comes to masks and COVID-19, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a great one.  The difference between me punching your face and not wearing a mask is risk and intent.<p>The overwhelming majority of people do not intend to transmit any virus to those around them.  It&#x27;s pretty difficult to punch someone in the face without intending to harm them.<p>We also cannot avoid risking harm to someone else.  Despite my best efforts, I risk hurting someone every time I sit behind the wheel of a motor vehicle.  However, there are clearly some risks that are too great.  If I punch you in the nose, it&#x27;s a pretty sure thing you will be harmed.  But if I do not wear a mask in a public space... the odds aren&#x27;t particularly bad on any single outing.<p>What makes the mask thing really troublesome is pinning down just what the risks of transmission are with and without masks over an extended period of time in a variety of normal scenarios.  I&#x27;ve seen enough to personally conclude that wearing a mask in public spaces is probably a good idea if I cannot avoid public spaces altogether.  It&#x27;s just hard to convince everybody that masks are effective enough at reducing risk - <i>and</i> that the risk is great enough to warrant the (very minor) sacrifice of freedom - to mandate them without also overstating their effectiveness.<p>I stand by the gist of your argument, though.  There is a significant difference between risking harm to yourself and risking harm to those around you.  I just wanted to address that analogy since I&#x27;ve been seeing it everywhere and I think it oversimplifies the conflict.')
