Item(by='rualca', descendants=None, kids=[25554616], score=None, time=1609104778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25554258, text='&gt; I personally prefer null and exceptions over Option types and Results.<p>Personal preferences and all, I feel the comparison between Result and exceptions is somewhere between misguided and miopic. The Result type and exceptions do not serve the same purpose. Exceptions are not intended to handle control flow, and the Result type is not intended to handle exceptional behavior. Moreover, they are not mutually exclusive.<p>To provide an example, a Result type would be returned by a database query, and it would return Ok if an element was found or return a Fail if either an element didn&#x27;t existed or was not valid. Meanwhile an exception would be thrown if a memory allocation error happened somewhere.')
