I think (without looking it up) recent iMacs bumped the specs. It is one of my few disappointments with this machine. OTOH, my workplace doesn&#x27;t use cameras on online meetings. My musical jam group does, though. And I paid about $3K for this machine, so it shouldn&#x27;t even be a discussion.')
