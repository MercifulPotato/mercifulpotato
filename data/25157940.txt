At the growth capital level, terms for QPs ($5+ million) and QIBs ($100+ million) are night and day. (Accredited investors aren’t on the field. To say nothing of smaller fish.)<p>This partly stems from liability. Small investors have an easier time convincing regulators, judges and juries they got screwed and deserve compensation. It also deals with sophistication. A complex win-win structure might not market well, but they regularly happen with hedge funds.<p>But it is mostly about efficiency. A single institutional investor setting deal terms will fill the rest of the deal on their brand. That lets you negotiate once and be certain of closing. You get a tight list of LPs or investors and know no cheques will bounce. If someone misbehaves, you can complain to the lead who will tell them to knock it off or risk losing future deal flow.<p>Capital markets have economies of scale. Just looking at venture secondary markets, pricing on SharesPost and EquityZen is regularly 20% to 50% worse than what even a moderate cheque writer could get. And that’s before considering the preferences on better classes of stock.')
