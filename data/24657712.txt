Spending time on improvements elsewhere will not help the bottleneck, you&#x27;re just wasting time&#x2F;money. Data&#x2F;material is going into it too fast to process (work is building up). Improving before the bottleneck just makes its queue fill faster. Improving after the bottleneck just creates a segment of the system that&#x27;s starved for work. So focus on the problem at hand, once it&#x27;s addressed, focus on the next bottleneck.')
