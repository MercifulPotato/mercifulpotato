This puts military personnel in hairy areas where they have to know what the UCMJ states on the subject of the order, and make a decision whether or not an order is lawful.<p>I know you followed up with &quot;It&#x27;s only a personal judgment whether you follow an order. Soldiers aren&#x27;t the legal arbiters.&quot;, but what your statement comes down to is that the person following the order needs to decide on the spot whether it&#x27;s lawful or not, and sometimes may have to argue their decision in a Military Court. This makes them de facto legal arbiters.')
