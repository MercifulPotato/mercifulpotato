If everyone on the East Coast uses AT&amp;T to the exclusion of any other provider, and you could only communicate with AT&amp;T customers by becoming an AT&amp;T customer, that&#x27;s a monopoly on the customers on the East Coast. Even if everyone on the West Coast used Verizon.<p>The fact that the Facebook customers aren&#x27;t all concentrated in a specific geographic area doesn&#x27;t really change anything. If the only way to communicate with a large population of specific individuals is to use Facebook, they have a monopoly on the market for communication with those individuals.<p>That wouldn&#x27;t be true if they were using a federated protocol -- like the telephone network is in real life, but like Facebook is not -- because then you could sign up for some other service and still &quot;call&quot; the people on Facebook.')
