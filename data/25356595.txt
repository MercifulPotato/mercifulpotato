I almost became desperate enough to buy one several months ago when I was having difficulty standing all day, but I just could not part with the $8k. Biking, running, stretching and so on I want to believe help with the pain but if they do it makes so little difference that I cannot be sure.<p>I&#x27;ve looked into other workstations but most of them only go between sitting and reclining. Unfortunately, I think the ability to convert to a standing desk for pain relief will continue to be a necessity based on my experience with recliners (the only recliner I can actually sit in cost me quite a pretty penny), so a station with only two positions is no better than my standing desk now.<p>I can&#x27;t wait until workstations like this one are affordable.')
