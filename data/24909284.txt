On this page, for example, they are the equivalent of SVG icons.<p>This allowed me to rapidly scroll to the bottom of the page and parse the topics instantly in my head. Especially since they had a &quot;legend&quot; at the beginning in the overview section.<p>It&#x27;s not as if they add :) and :P everywhere. They simply made the choice to skip custom icons that every single sites out there use and instead use a common set of icons (emojis).<p>As more and more apps and service use those, this make parsing those page very quick. I know that if I see a &quot;globe with meridians&quot; emoji, it&#x27;s going to be about the internet, etc. That way, you don&#x27;t have to learn a new set of icons for every site you go to.')
