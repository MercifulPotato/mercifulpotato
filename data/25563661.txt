I&#x27;d happily pay a single subscription which gave me access to ALL the news websites, and divided payment up based on which articles people click on. Do that without tracking me between the different sites and I&#x27;m sold.<p>Pressreader gets close but it only gives you yesterday&#x27;s print versions (not current online content), it has a few notable gaps which matter to me (the FT, The Times (of London), Bloomberg news among others) and it doesn&#x27;t really collate different sources for the same story very well. Though I have to say it&#x27;s great for magazines.')
