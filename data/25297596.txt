If Apple is reserving all of TSMC&#x27;s 5nm (and probably 3nm) node output, is Samsung a viable competitor?<p>Does the world of ultra-cheap (i.e. &lt;$500) laptops come back to ARM Chromebooks? Qualcomm be able to mimic Apple&#x27;s design success?<p>I&#x27;m kind of with Gruber that this is a game changer, but what does it mean for the ecosystem?')
