The rows I&#x27;ve mentioned were clearly the rows of <i>bits</i> (represented by presence or absence of a hole). From a pure theoretical point of view it still appears to be wasteful (as the used character set encodings didn&#x27;t use all representations of 12 bits), but there were &quot;good enough&quot; reasons behind that decision too: It all started from the design of the tabulating punched card from the 19th century, and from every digit 0-9 having its own row, and two more rows for other marks. The hardware depended on these properties.<p>125 years ago, the logic I&#x27;ve described was already there, 12 rows but still less columns on this card:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Hollerith_Punched_Card.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Hollerith_Punched_Card.jp...</a><p>Increasing the number of columns was obviously later technical improvement.')
