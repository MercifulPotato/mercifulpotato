Item(by='monocasa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612036439, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25972305, text='&gt; What this means is that timeBeginPeriod still sets the global timer interrupt interval, on all versions of Window. We can tell from the results of timeGetTime() that the interrupt fires on at least one CPU core at that rate, and the time is updated.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding that sentence, but it doesn&#x27;t sound tickless.  Digging into dynamictick, it sounds like they can suspend the timer interrupt for some ticks, but there&#x27;s still a regular timer tick going off rather than setting up the timer for each next event like you&#x27;d see in a tickless design.')
