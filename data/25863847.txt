With such a small fraction I don&#x27;t think you can draw conclusions in either direction.&quot;)<p>However I then, uh, went on to draw a conclusion anyway in contradiction of my own statement saying we shouldn&#x27;t draw conclusions because of the sample size. Methinks it&#x27;s time for more coffee :).')
