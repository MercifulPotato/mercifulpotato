I&#x27;ve found WSL2+Docker support to be excellent and hope to see similar levels of integration with OSX before too long.<p>Using the CLI to connect to a VM isn&#x27;t so bad, did this a lot before Docker Desktop was even a thing, though I generally just ran an SSH shelled into the VM full time.  With VS Code&#x27;s remote extension, it&#x27;s roughly the same either way.')
