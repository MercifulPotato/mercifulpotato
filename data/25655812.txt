Considering the circumstances. They treat many employees like slaves with something just above minimum wage. Anti transparent pricing on everything from video to aws. Horrible ui on the platform with an incredible amount of fake reviews and products. The prices arent even better than elsewhere. I will boycott until they treat staff fairly or replace them with robots, they can treat the robots as they please but having working conditions similar to a north korean re eduction gulag is something I will not be supporting.')
