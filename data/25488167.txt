Yes, this hurt those businesses, but as someone who was absolutely sick of them in search results it was WONDERFUL to see them go down in flames.<p>To be clear, places like nextag were paid &quot;comparison&quot; shopping engines. To have enough margin to win the &quot;comparison&quot; you often had just total trash products advertising impossible claims.<p>Anti-trust seems focused on the harm shutting these folks did to these businesses, but no one asks if users actually liked these folks (or the auto review sites that someone generated just boilerplate but clearly never actually had product in hand). Again, SO glad they pushed some of these down, lots of complaints.<p>If you think people want this trash, just start your own search engine that emphasizes this junk.')
