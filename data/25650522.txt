Virtually every vaccine ever discovered provides more immunity on first dose, than the incremental gain on subsequent boosters.<p>You certainly can&#x27;t be <i>sure</i> of this, but pre-existing evidence would strongly suggest that this vaccine is subject to the law of diminishing returns. At the end of the day, we&#x27;re just trying to maximize infections prevented. If the two-dose schedule confers 95% immunity, then as long as we expect over 50% immunity from a single dose, then First Dose First is best policy.')
