I have it, it&#x27;s cheaper than ever, like RPis are given away in cereal boxes.<p>I also have an iPad. I know I lose some software access (e.g. Facebook streaming games) but I also gain software, like Slay the Spire and FTL and Bastion. These games are iOS exclusive in part because iOS effectively prevents piracy, which is another way of saying that users cannot run whatever software they want.<p>I&#x27;m quite happy having some general-purpose computers, and also some purpose-built app-console devices. Why must every device be general purpose?')
