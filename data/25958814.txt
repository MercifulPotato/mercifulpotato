Space science money more limited. Space science money to get components on rovers yet more limited. Telescope time is also limited. Mission time on remote probes is also limited.<p>So you devise an experiment to measure oxygen absorption that uses a probe&#x27;s existing mass spectrometer. Your experiment doesn&#x27;t cut into the probe&#x27;s mass budget so it basically is just a scheduling issue. If your experiment is bumped from the mission schedule there&#x27;s not compromising the probe or total mission. You&#x27;ve got a pretty good chance of getting that experiment on the docket.<p>This is contrary to a nutrient experiment that eats into the probe&#x27;s mass budget and mission time. If the sensors are dedicated to the experiment that&#x27;s less mass for other sensors. Even if you got approved if you can&#x27;t built the experiment to be reliable and survivable it won&#x27;t get approved.<p>Similar is true for trying to measure CFCs on exoplanets. There&#x27;s a handful of instruments that can even get spectra from exoplanets and even then only from transiting ones and <i>even then</i> only has giants so far. Even if we could detect CFCs in terrestrial planet atmospheres, CFCs do not stay in the atmosphere very long so you&#x27;d only detect them (from a technological civilization) for a very short window of time. The odds of finding them are vanishingly low with current instruments. No one is going to return your e-mails if you propose observations of CFCs because it&#x27;s a snipe hunt wasting valuable and limited instrument time. If you&#x27;re a serious researcher you&#x27;d know this already and wouldn&#x27;t waste people&#x27;s time. Methane is a general purpose biomarker and is something far more likely to be found. Since you&#x27;ve got a limited stars you can even gather information from the time is better spent on the more likely observation.')
