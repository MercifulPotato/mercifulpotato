They return a state machine. Qualitatively different.<p>Transitioning from a function that returns a scalar, to returning a polynomial, to returning an arbitrary function, and now to returning something <i>stateful</i> is a big difference.  I suppose the next step is to write an algorithm that trains a Turing machine.')
