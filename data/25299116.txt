If it does, how would that government use an obligation to provide you health insurance against you to influence your decisions?<p>People quit jobs far more often than they quit countries, and employer provided insurance does tie you to more strongly to your employer (e.g. I knew someone who needed a heart transplant who would literally die if he went without insurance, because he depended on a heart pump).<p>Also, you have to get insurance&#x2F;healthcare from somewhere, and in a democracy the government is <i>far</i> more accountable to its citizens than an employer typically is to its employees [1].<p>[1] This is very clear in the typical case, but less clear for people with rare in-demand skills (like software engineers).')
