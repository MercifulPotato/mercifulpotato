Compiled from Official State Websites, you can check historical data at<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covidtracking.com&#x2F;data" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covidtracking.com&#x2F;data</a><p>The 2018 flu season was 80K fatalities.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;health&#x2F;flu-deaths-2017--2018-cdc-bn&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;health&#x2F;flu-deaths-2017--2018-...</a><p>So, for the standard four month flu season ending in early August, COVID was roughly twice as bad as a very bad flu season, with per capita death rates varying wildly around the country.  So for that period the commenter is basically correct, unless you have a problem with official State health authorities and the CDC.  <i>These</i> numbers are right.<p>It’s now 360K after 9 months and nationwide, according to the same site compiled from Official State websites.  With 40 of the 50 States with per capita fatality rates within a factor of two of each other (500-1000 people&#x2F;death).<p>So it is back-to-back and twice-as-bad...the very very bad flu season that hasn’t stopped yet and is now pretty evenly distributed nationwide.  Not the plague, but not just a very bad flu (for the elderly at least).<p>The poster never referred to IFR explicitly.  I personally prefer old-fashioned per-capita death rates unless I’m modeling dynamics.  Neater, cleaner.<p>From a policy standpoint, deaths still skews towards the very old.  Median death age in late 70s in my county.  So politics of sending Grandma out of the igloo into the blizzard, and potential confusion of elderly dying with COVID v. dying from COVID still relevant for lockdown policy and the like.')
