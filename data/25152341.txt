Tests and assignments were essentially recreating proofs cherry picked to be similar to ones we walked through in class.<p>I realize that&#x27;s kind of how all my higher level math classes were run. It&#x27;s just that once the cherry picking becomes looser, intuition doesn&#x27;t necessarily catch up :(.')
