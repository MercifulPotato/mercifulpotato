Do you give them more, or do you say “it’s your own fault”?<p>y is good at handling money, but happens to have some expensive disease&#x2F;happens to live till the ripe age of 110&#x2F;whatever, and nevertheless runs out of money. Again, do you say “tough luck. You could have known you might live till 110”?<p>z, at 65, has a terminal disease and knows he’ll live for at most a year. He _can_ go to Vegas, travel the world, etc. One could argue that’s some compensation for dying so young, but is that fair?<p>Those problems can be avoided by just paying out a monthly pension to every 65-year old.<p>Also, but a different subject: what happens to the money invested for those who die before they turn 65? If their spouse&#x2F;children don’t inherit the fund and get the money on the day they would have turned 65, did you really <i>give</i> them that investment fund? If the money is forfeited, it seems more like you gave them a endowment policy (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Endowment_policy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Endowment_policy</a>).')
