Reality often responds accordingly.<p>Generally we seem bad at noticing and rewarding genuine competence and much better at noticing and rewarding confidence, even if it&#x27;s wildly unrealistic. And even if it comes with a spectacular record of failure or obvious evidence of limited integrity.<p>So imposter syndrome may not be so much about an unrealistically low feeling of competence, but about not having internalised the performative social signifiers of confidence - to the point where someone can navigate them without having to second-guess them consciously.<p>In other words there are two different games being played, and being good at something is only one of them.')
