I’m concerned that this “tailoring” puts me in a filter bubble, and locks me in to a narrow set of preferences for the rest of my life.<p>In this regard, Amazon is among the worst of the big tech companies that I interact with. Google lets me turn off personalization—when I go to Youtube, I see an extremely generic set of recommended videos. But I can’t do it on Amazon.<p>(I don’t use Facebook, not sure what can be switched off.)')
