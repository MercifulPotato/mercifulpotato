But the british role in india is relevant today since india gained &quot;independence&quot; only a few decades ago and is still ostensibly a part of the &quot;british empire&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Member_states_of_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Member_states_of_the_Commonwea...</a><p>But ultimately you are correct. India&#x27;s problem isn&#x27;t with dead british people, it&#x27;s ultimately with their traitorous elites who sold out and rejoined the british empire rather than fostering a bit of nationalism and progress in their own country. How can any nation succeed when their elites would rather be subjects of another state than independent leaders of their own people. It&#x27;s not just political leaders, it&#x27;s their business&#x2F;cultural&#x2F;academic leaders as well. It&#x27;s insane that india, a country with 1.4 billion people and a civilization stretching back millenia, is still part of the british empire. You think the chinese would let hong kong back into the british empire let alone join wholesale?<p>India should have done what south korea did after ww2. Completely separate from their former colonial masters and demand reparations and used that money to develop. But I guess it&#x27;s kind of hard to demand reparations when you willingly rejoin your colonial master. They could have followed japan&#x27;s example. They could have even followed china&#x27;s example. Anything would have probably led to better outcomes.<p>Instead, they just wasted the past 75 years doing what? Playing &quot;commonwealth&quot; games? While hundreds of millions of indians have no electricity. No toilets.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;features&#x2F;2017-01-24&#x2F;living-in-the-dark-240-million-indians-have-no-electricity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;features&#x2F;2017-01-24&#x2F;living-in...</a><p>By any logic, india should be a permanent member in the security council as india represents 20% of humanity. It should be a major economic power. It should be a major world player. Instead it&#x27;s a lowly member of the british empire. You would think india of all nations should be working to dismantle it, not perpetuate it. How can india be part of the security council ( a leading nation ) when it is part of the &quot;commonwealth&quot;? Would anyone take france, russia or china ( other security council members ) seriously if they were part of the british empire?<p>Is there any nation that has failed to reach its potential more than india? And by doing so caused so much human misery just by the sheer size of its population? Not only was it shocking to learn that the &quot;british empire&quot; still exists, it was even more shocking to learn that india was still part of it. I just don&#x27;t get it.')
