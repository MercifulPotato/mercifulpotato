So for example you can wear a shirt that says &quot;{Black|Blue} Lives Matter&quot; because there&#x27;s nothing about whose lives matter on the ballot. Same with a MAGA hat. But you can&#x27;t wear a shirt that says &quot;Vote no on 2A&quot;, or &quot;Trump 2020&quot;, because those people&#x2F;issues are on the ballot.<p>Denver != Pennsylvania, obviously, but perhaps it&#x27;s a federal law? I don&#x27;t really know where the rule comes from.<p>Anyway, overall takeaways working were: 1. everyone was super friendly and it was a great experience and 2. Denver+Colorado really have their shit together when it comes to elections. It&#x27;s easy to vote, there&#x27;s a paper trail for everything, and the default is by mail. Everyone should do it like we do.')
