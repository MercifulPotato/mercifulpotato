It&#x27;s just so disappointing you cannot do something like:<p><pre><code>    void myFunc(List&lt;? extends MyDataContainer&lt;?&gt;&gt; list);\n</code></pre>\nInstead you end up with a base class MyDataContiner and then manually extending it with something like MyDataContinerInt or MyDataContinerLong etc...<p>C++ templates may be very powerful, but limitations like this feel out of place in a language as bloated as C++ already is...<p>Admittedly, I still have much to learn about C++. It&#x27;s been quite an experience, frustrating at times, learning this language.')
