Even without being &#x27;social&#x27; it was my way of being social.<p>Now, even though I wake up without an alarm, eat clean, and exercise every day my productivity has tanked. There&#x27;s some deep, human alarm buried somewhere in the reptile part of my brain that is saying <i>&#x27;things are not right...you are not ok...things are not right,&#x27;</i> and it&#x27;s been doing it since March. I can&#x27;t seem to find a breaker to switch it off.<p>There&#x27;s only so many times you can walk around the block.')
