IMHO almost all reviews online are affiliate marketing these days, so what I&#x27;d really be interested in is a site that hosts reviews and doesn&#x27;t allow _any_ affiliate marketing or external links.  IE: No incentive to game the system with inflated review scores.<p>And if you pay attention to those affiliate marketing sites that are disguised as review sites, note how they never give anything a bad review.  &quot;Poisoned my dog, caused my house to be condemned - 4.0&#x2F;5.0 stars.&quot;  Getting you to buy _something_ is the only goal.')
