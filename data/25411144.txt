Item(by='elb2020', descendants=None, kids=[25411291], score=None, time=1607899310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25407930, text='&gt; You can&#x27;t count on project managers to do that.<p>This is one of my pet peeves when it comes to software development. I _really_ think that software development project managers ought to be able to spot the difference between a good architectural decision and a bad architectural decision, a good design decision and a bad design decision, a well implemented function and a badly implemented function. It sinks my heart, as a software development professional, having to work for project managers who, in many cases, would be hard pressed to explain what a byte is. It&#x27;s just so wrong.<p>It&#x27;s like working for a newspaper editor who does not know how to read or write. It does not mean that you cannot produce a newspaper, but it depends upon the workers stepping in and doing all the strategical technical decision behind the project managers back. As an engineer you can live with it for some time, but eventually it ends up feeling fake, and like a masquerade.<p>I&#x27;m much more in favor of hands on leadership types like Microsoft&#x27;s Dave Cutler, with the technical skills to actually lead, and not just superficially &#x27;manage&#x27;.')
