All contact with the department of immigration &#x2F; border protection was via WhatsApp during those two weeks. They would also call us to do control samples at random hours to check that we are in the hotel room.<p>It’s very convenient of the government to do this, but I do find it a bit dubious at time to mix provision of essential services with FBs marketing tracking. The same with government websites that use Google Analytics, I’m not always sure they should be mixed without thinking properly through the privacy considerations first.')
