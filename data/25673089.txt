So what is mastery? To start, mastery is something on which one can be on the path towards, yet mastery is also a thing which has been achieved. So we need to talk about flow along a path and achievement of the objective.<p><i>PATH</i><p>The path to mastery is characterized by humility and child-like exploration combined with an intrinsic drive to integrate learning a and take paths that make individual sense to one on the apprentice’s path towards mastery. It is concerned with thoughtful action and adaptation. The ultimate focus is on the seeking of truth (an intrinsic reward) rather than and sometimes at the detriment to receiving external rewards (accolades, financial renumeration, and other materialistic artifacts). Such sacrifices and focus is made early in the mastery process and pay off once one inevitably achieves it. This is a pattern common in most individuals we would consider to be masters and the difficulty lies in staying on such a path despite internalized intuitions and the listening to an internal voice&#x2F;drive pulling us away from society, the majority of who are not on the path at any given time. Mastery is high risk because it a deviant process often focusing on long term rewards rather than instant gratification or even short-term survival.<p><i>ACHIEVEMENT OF</i><p>What can a master do? Why is that beneficial?<p>Mastery is the seamless ability to fuse the intuitive with the rational while performing and understanding at a high level of competency in a given discipline or domain. It manifests as as such a deep internalization of a domain that one is able to spend cognitive effort on seamless cross-pollination between other disciplines, sculpting domains at will. Mastery is only achieved through embracing the humane, which means internalizing the fact that what makes us human is the blending of the rational (a step-by-step-step process) with the intuitive (a distributed and probabilistic process).<p><i>MASTERY IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</i><p>What is engineering? What is software? What commonalities do they share?<p>Given a definition of mastery, we see that the question of what engineering and software are next to be defined. These three questions should serve to form a foundation for discussion.<p>Engineering is the process of designing reliable processes and systems given constraints on resources, tools, and available thought patterns. It is also fundamentally concerned with risk management on the path to achieving an objective.<p>Software is a system which interfaces with either humans, machines, or both to achieve an objective. It serves as a medium for sending conceptual communicative signals across, within, and between various levels of abstraction to include physical computing done at the level of hardware.<p>As an aside, it must be stated that the delineation we place between software and hardware is an arbitrary though sometimes useful fiction to allow us to get tasks done. With this being stated, such a simplification is often over-used to our collective detriment.<p>The master software engineer understands hardware and software deeply at both the intuitiveness rational levels in order to design systems and process to specifications and with clarity to both machines and humans alike. This ability to provide and communicate with clarity is especially important when we consider that our colloquial models of machines themselves are over-simplified, a fact that one will quickly become aware of when trying to design applications across platforms that perform  “low level” file system operations. In this case, it becomes apparent that even operations such as opening and closing files, tasks which one would think are stable and solved problems, have such variability that cross-platform development is more challenging than it should seem.<p>Not only does a master software engineer have the ability to communicate at different levels of abstraction of hardware and software—such a master also recognizes that communication is the operant word. Communication is signal propagation, filtering, and more, occurring at the personal, interpersonal, and organizational level as well. The master software engineer is seamlessly able to apply all principles of software development to psychological phenomena as well. To such an individual, there is no difference conceptually from a root pattern perspective.')
