Original greek text which amounted to a couple of quotes was replaced with garbage output. Tables were printed but unformatted. Furthermore, it only included the first 1&#x2F;2 of the text. The entire second half of the book was missing. I could look past many of these except for the last. Selling half a book is fraud.')
