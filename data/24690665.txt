But I haven&#x27;t been shot or arrested. I prefer to err on the side of caution so I can go home and sleep in my own bed that evening.<p>I&#x27;m also extremely careful with my table saw. You describe this as fear, I describe it more as risk minimization. It costs me nothing, I am not degrading myself, I simply avoid things that trigger <i>fear in the cop</i>.<p>My father served in combat in WW2 and the KW. He received a couple medals for bravery. But he always did everything he could to minimize any unnecessary risk. If it was a tough mission, he&#x27;d often be asked to lead because the other pilots knew he&#x27;d bring &#x27;em back with fewer holes in their airplanes while still pasting the target.')
