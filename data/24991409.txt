The LED\nis actually controlled by hardware, but has circuitry to delay the hardware\nmute until software mute is complete to avoid any &quot;popping noises&quot;.</i><p>That&#x27;s followed by someone asking about a timeout in case software mute never happens (so that hardware mute still does), and the same person confirms there is a timeout.')
