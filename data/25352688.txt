With modern DAW software, a good autotune, youtube tutorials and some time you can make commercial-sounding music from the comfort of your home with a shoestring budget (especially if you pirate said software).<p>Even if the music industry dies, music itself is going nowhere. It sucks for people who really love making music and want to live from it but from a purely capitalistic perspective it just doesn&#x27;t add up: there&#x27;s a massive amount of offer and a fixed amount of demand. You can find dozens of incredibly gifted artists on Youtube, Twitch or elsewhere who&#x27;ll never manage to live from their craft.<p>It&#x27;s like becoming a pro footballer, it&#x27;s amazing if you make it but it&#x27;s not a reasonable long term career prospect if you&#x27;re not incredibly gifted <i>and</i> incredibly lucky.')
