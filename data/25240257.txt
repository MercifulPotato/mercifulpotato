A conventional roller won&#x27;t need much aligning, but it won&#x27;t do that, it won&#x27;t settle into place before load is applied. Friction scales with force. If that&#x27;s how they teased out a minor delta then it&#x27;s truly very clever (but likely still highly impractical outside the laboratory&#x2F;indoor track setting)<p>[1] idea came while taking a shower, were else. Shower after churning that old Campag 12s chain a little, unfortunately only on Zwift these days')
