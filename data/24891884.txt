I am saying when you say &quot;Twitter is a private company. They can choose without restriction who&#x27;s allowed to use their platform,&quot; you are not saying anything substantively different than those statements.<p>In a universe where the ability to put your speech in front of other people depends on being able to post it online in a place where they might be able to see, there are trade-offs involved that seem to be conveniently shoved aside when it is about news you do not like.<p>I prefer the cacophonous chaos of everyone being able to tell me about stuff they deem important. One step further, I prefer to live a society that can learn to live with that without falling apart.')
