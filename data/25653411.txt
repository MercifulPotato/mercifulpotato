I&#x27;ve already started seeing wages for junior and mid level engineers decreasing because of the flood of new bootcamp graduates.<p>&gt; Appetite for automation, efficiency and software solutions is practically unbounded.<p>Sure, doesn&#x27;t mean that 10x increase in the labor pool won&#x27;t effect wages.<p>&gt; software salaries are sky high because there&#x27;s no union<p>Source needed.<p>&gt; so his salary can be halved<p>You can&#x27;t say mine is not based in fact and that pull numbers out of your ass, too, ya dingus.<p>&gt; Teachers unions ruined education<p>Source needed.<p>&gt; dragging salaries down of high performers.<p>Do you consider yourself a &quot;high performer&quot;? A 10xer? It&#x27;s hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn&#x27;t it?<p>&gt; The best teacher in the US is paid identically to the worst teacher. No wonder education is a disaster.<p>I would think to blame a great many things for this before I&#x27;d put the blame at unions, which have been losing power in the states since at least the 90s, probably earlier. Republicans have been gutting education spending the entire time, too. But sure, it was the big bad unions that did it.<p>All I&#x27;m saying is that tech wages are good right now, but they won&#x27;t be this good forever, and we should use our current leverage to at least try to situate ourselves into a more solid standing. If you don&#x27;t think unions are the way to do that, that&#x27;s fine, but you can&#x27;t disagree with the numbers. There&#x27;s an huge flux of new SWE&#x27;s entering the workforce right now, in 5-10 years it&#x27;s going to start being a significant factor in wages all the way up to the top skill levels.')
