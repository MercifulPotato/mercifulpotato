I don&#x27;t think software is the root problem, but rather the root problem is &quot;there aren&#x27;t incentives for good CMSes&quot;--namely, there&#x27;s no incentive for systems that talk to each other because healthcare consumers don&#x27;t think about this when choosing a hospital and hospitals don&#x27;t have any incentive to make it easier for their customers to leave their system (and EMS vendors certainly don&#x27;t have that incentive). Ultimately the question is &quot;why do we believe EMSes are valuable, but no one can figure out how to make money from making them better?&quot;.')
