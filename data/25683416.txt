They do have a pacemaker-like mode, called overpacing that tries to slow down tachycardia, but their main function is delivering shocks to reset life-threatening arrythmias or to defibrillate in the case of ventricular or atrial fibrilation.  ICDs are also much larger than pacemakers, as they have to have much larger batteries and capacitors.')
