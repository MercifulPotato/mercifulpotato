Both are lightweight consumer products manufacturing - decent margins, probably good markets, and the kind of thing that can be spun up in a garage (and run from there, for at least a couple of years) for less than a modest new car.  Although I&#x27;ve built SaaS startups in the past, I have no desire to do that again until tools and platforms are good enough to eliminate the need for hiring a dev team.  I never want to work with an offshore dev group again.  (There are some decent ones in Eastern Europe and Central&#x2F;South America, but I&#x27;m done with crappy Asian software!)')
