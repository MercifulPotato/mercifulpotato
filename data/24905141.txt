So, I have been around awhile -- 6 presidential elections and many more smaller ones.. I got to thinking about this and I realized that at some point, the national conversation changed from &#x27;who you vote for and why&#x27; to &#x27;who you vote against and what horrible things will happen if they win&#x27;.<p>To be fair that kind of rhetoric has existed since even the earliest days of the US, but I think on the whole voting has historically been seen as something you <i>DO</i> rather than something you use to <i>fight against</i>. The change in balance is... worrying.')
