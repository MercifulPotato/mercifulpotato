You can install this mostly self-contained SDK to a directory of your choosing. Then source the environment file it installed to get the correct build variables setup (CC, CXX, CFLAGS, LD, LDFLAGS, PATH, etc). From there, the variables will be setup to use your embedded image&#x27;s sysroot. I do almost all of my userspace development using the SDK. If you&#x27;re using CMake to build your native code, it will pick up the variables for you.<p>There are some gotchas with it, in particular, there are some modifications that might be necessary for your configuration to get the SDK to include <i>more</i> things relevant to your build. Probably the most notable is that static libraries are not output into the SDK by default.')
