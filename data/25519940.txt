It&#x27;s a net negative. They encourage you to turn your brain off and follow wherever they take you. When you do this with your own thoughts, we consider that a form of mental illness. The inability to engage in executive control over where your mind wanders, resulting in endless chasing of tangents without any purpose is practically the definition of schizophrenia. Yet this is precisely what recommendation algorithms encourage. Better to step back, think about the things that interest you and you actually care about, then directly search for those, with perhaps keyword tagging related videos displayed at most.')
