Even if data cleaning is automated, these skills cannot be easily learned.<p>It&#x27;s not about replacing data scientists with data engineers, it&#x27;s about both roles working together to make everything more efficient.<p>The hiring rate for data scientists has plateaued. The industry doesn&#x27;t need any more of them. Why? Because data scientists often can&#x27;t solve problems fast enough. It&#x27;s a commonly quoted statistic that 70% of any data science task is data cleansing and&#x2F;or etl. A data engineer&#x27;s job is to take that 70% and turn it into 10%. The data engineer saves the data scientist time, meaning they can focus on what they&#x27;re supposed to do -- build models.')
