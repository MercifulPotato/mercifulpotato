You&#x27;re right that the chemical industry does use hydrogen and we have infrastructure to use it in the Haber process, and refining hydrocarbons and more. But this infrastructure doesn&#x27;t translate to using hydrogen as a form of energy storage. The US has less than 1,000 miles of hydrogen pipeline [1]. Most hydrogen production facilities are located close to the point of demand. Our experience manipulating hydrogen has taught us that it&#x27;s important to minimize to minimize the amount of transport required.<p>Also, almost all of these many millions of tons of hydrogen produced each year are produced through steam reformation [2]. This is not carbon neutral, and renewable hydrogen production must be done through electrolysis or thermochemical hydrogen production instead.<p>By comparison, there&#x27;s a larger need to transport hydrogen if we&#x27;re using hydrogen as a form of energy storage. Hydrogen storage is underground, and electrolysis needs to be done by a source of water. The source and destination have different required geographic features - transport is unavoidable. Alternatively you could pipe the water to the electrolysis plant, but then you&#x27;re moving 9 times as much mass through the pipeline - water is 1 part hydrogen to 8 parts oxygen by mass.<p>So the claim that we have extensive infrastructure in manipulating hydrogen wasn&#x27;t a misunderstanding in that natural gas infrastructure can be used to transport hydrogen. It was a misunderstanding in that the infrastructure used to manipulate hydrogen in the context of the chemical industry translates into infrastructure for renewable hydrogen production, and hydrogen transport and storage. It doesn&#x27;t: most of our hydrogen is produced through steam reformation, and our hydrogen infrastructure is built around minimizing need to transport and store hydrogen.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hydrogen_infrastructure#:~:text=Hydrogen%20pipeline%20transport,-Hydrogen%20pipeline%20transport&amp;text=As%20of%202004%2C%20there%20are,(1%2C497%20km)%20in%20Europe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hydrogen_infrastructure#:~:tex...</a>.<p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hydrogen_production" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hydrogen_production</a>')
