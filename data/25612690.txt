Item(by='mariusor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609593955, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25596570, text='I can recommend two strong stories that came out earlier in 2020:<p>&quot;Piranesi&quot; by Susanna Clarke was great. Minimalist and eerie, with a satisfying science-fantasy plot. Very different in size, scope and theme from Clarke&#x27;s previous novel, &quot;Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell&quot;.<p>&quot;The invisible life of Addie La Rue&quot; by V.E. Schwab. A good character and a good story, but with a couple of tropey elements here and there. I had fun with it, but since I can&#x27;t remember its end just a couple of months after reading it, suggests that it (the end) might be a little underwhelming.')
