What happens to our civilization when the primary underpinnings are obviated by technology?  No one knows.<p>So, NASA, FAANG, the Financial Industry, most of the lawyers, accountants, and bureaucrats, etc. are just make-work jobs to occupy productive people to keep them from inadvertently causing the apocalypse.<p>(FWIW Bucky Fuller calculated that the inflection point to runaway wealth was in the mid-1970&#x27;s.  We&#x27;re fifty years over due for the end of history.)')
