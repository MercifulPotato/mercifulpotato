And the article does refute Google&#x27;s claims of quantum advantage with references.<p>&quot;But some quantum researchers contested the claim, on the grounds that a better classical algorithm that would outperform the quantum one could exist3. And researchers at IBM claimed that its classical supercomputers could in principle already run existing algorithms to do the same calculations in 2.5 days.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you would change the title to. This one seems to accurately describe the article.')
