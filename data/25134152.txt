The point being the Iran meddles in their neighbors affairs.<p>&gt;Oh, wow. According to the Iraqi prime minister he was on a diplomatic mission to ease tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia...<p>He was on both the US and EU anti-terrorism list, and there was a Security Council resolution banning him from traveling outside Iran.<p>&gt;And compare the Iran &quot;meddling&quot; with the US openly creating military bases in Syria without any authorization from the Syrian government<p>Iran has military bases and militias on Syria predating the US ones, these took direct part in the mass civilian deaths there.<p>&gt;Also we have the rejection of the Iraqi parliamentâ€²s call to withdraw US troops.<p>Their call was non binding since the agreement was with the Iraqi government (imagine the GOP Senate calling for something ignoring President Biden&#x27;s wishes). The US army does not wish to withdraw since ISIS still exists, we saw what happened last time Iraq tried to deal with them alone.')
