Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605902142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25158089, text='&gt; If you really want to &quot;understand&quot; Microsoft, just take a look at their UI frameworks: WinForms, WPF, UWP, the javascript one I forgot the name of, and now it&#x27;s WinUI.<p>The UI framework inside of UWP is just another name for first two versions of WinUI. That JS one you forget the name of was a version of WinUI in the early UWP era, that Microsoft stopped supporting because everyone told them the priority was Electron and React Native (and also because their browser team moved out of UWP&#x2F;WinUI and over to Chromium). (Unless you are thinking of Silverlight, which was &quot;WPF lite&quot;.) WPF itself can be considered a Version - 1 of UWP&#x2F;WinUI, and today with WinUI 3 allowing you to use many of the controls directly in WPF (and WinForms), further blurring the lines between past&#x2F;present&#x2F;future versions of the same XAML-based rendering stacks that Microsoft has been trying to get right for many versions now.<p>It&#x27;s fun that they never settle on a strong single brand name, of course, but from a technical perspective there&#x27;s a definite through line (all the way back to Longhorn&#x27;s &quot;Avalon&quot; dreams and the original invention of XAML).')
