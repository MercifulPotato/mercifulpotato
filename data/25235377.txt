The Apple Watch is a successful product, but it really didn&#x27;t completely disrupt a large existing industry like the iPhone did.   I think it&#x27;s possible that the M1 will trigger the death of x86 personal computers.   If that happens, it won&#x27;t have been an iPhone-level disruption, but it will be a lot more significant than the watch.')
