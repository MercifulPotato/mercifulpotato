Yet they do because most people prefer to merge upstream if they can, and Amazon is no exception.<p>Frankly Elastic has been very hostile at accepting PRs if they seem like they’d compete with Elastic’s proprietary offerings. Glaring conflict of interest. So I’m glad Elastic forced a full fork.<p>BTW, in case you didn’t realize this license change will not prevent Amazon from running their own fork. So even from a greedy business perspective Elastic made a horrible decision, even ignoring the ethics of lying to the community as they have done repeatedly and without showing any remorse.<p>edit: Fixed typo where I wrote &quot;Elastic&quot; instead of &quot;Amazon&quot; when talking about Amazon being no exception to preferring to merge upstream where possible')
