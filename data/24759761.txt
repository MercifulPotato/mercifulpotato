The &quot;good ones&quot; are, however, seemingly outnumbered by those who simply can&#x27;t be bothered.<p>One reason that is often cited is the lack of a financial incentive to &quot;clean up&quot; their networks. At some point, it may be necessary for the rest of the Internet to &quot;provide&quot; them with one. Note that this is one of the reasons that, to this day, spam e-mail is a thing we all <i>still</i> have to deal with.<p>Unfortunately, especially for all of us &quot;tech&quot; folks (like here on HN), not every problem can be fixed with a technical solution.')
