That public library system is a national treasure and needs to be protected.<p>If virtual book sharing becomes very common online, the majority of public libraries will die. It&#x27;ll consolidate down to a smaller number of large public libraries that do the lending. Even if just half of small public libraries close, it&#x27;ll be an enormous cultural tragedy. It&#x27;s common for small towns and cities in the US to have public libraries, they&#x27;re invaluable resources and part of our national heritage. I&#x27;d rather not see our national public book stock and access relegated to further intense centralization.<p>I grew up in a smaller town in Appalachia, we had a great public library and we were fortunate to have it. It was on the larger side and mostly well run. Everyone used it, everyone had a library card as a rite of passage. It also had community value far beyond the book utility value. (I use the past tense for my own experience, however it&#x27;s still a fully operational library)')
