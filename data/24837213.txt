While the children are definitely seen as mothers primary responsibility, working is part of that. It also means that there is less expectation on women to be artificially nice or helpless and dependent compared to American stereotypes.<p>Unlike in America, woman working is not interpreted as woman being anti-family. Unlike in Germany, mom working is not interpreted as mom failing her kids.<p>Also, it is not like the first women stepped into Russian factory only after revolution. The women did worked prior that, obviously. Whether on rural farms in villages or in factories or as cleaners or selling stuff at marker etc. The aristocracy expected women to not work, but generally Russians have been poor and had to do stuff to survive.')
