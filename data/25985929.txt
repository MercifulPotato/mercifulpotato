If you have a lump sum amount you were going to invest, do it fully at once and let all of the money work. If you divide it and invest over a period of time, you are (1) letting the un-invested money be idle. (2) chasing a market downturn to invest the rest in hopes of &quot;averaging down&quot;. Remember, market goes up more often than it goes down, so you will likely end up increasing your cost basis than if you had invested at once.')
