When a rural area has no hospital, or a city has crumbling roads and transit, yes, people resent enormously wealthy people for whom those are not concerns.  People do not, however, oppose their success at building companies that make money.<p>PG is picking a fight with the least sophisticated form of the anti-billionaire argument (i.e. &quot;billionaires suck&quot;), which is beneath him.  I get that it&#x27;s easier to do that than than argue over how the structural issues that allow massive wealth accumulation also undermine the foundations that markets and societies are built on, but it&#x27;s really beneath PG to choose such a trite argument to oppose.<p>&gt; if we just tax Jeff Bezos more then the Water Authority in Flint, MI will somehow become more competent.<p>That, however, is a strawman.  Nobody suggests that at all.  People who support more progressive taxation point to things like the New Deal and the strong progressive taxation coupled with public investment in infrastructure and education that propelled the United States forward.')
