And that&#x27;s part of what makes Live special and what makes it fun to use, which I do on daily basis.<p>But for professional use, you do end up with a hundred or a few hundred track lanes in your projects, and mixing and tweaking the whole thing becomes an unavoidable disastrous chore.<p>If I understand this correctly, they planned on introducing it in Live 8 (hence a hidden flag in Options.txt which sort-of enables a preview of this feature but is extremely buggy), but it never fully worked out because they also introduced Racks with nested tree-like flow of plugins, which doesn&#x27;t play well with a conventional matrix-like mixer view. That being said, I believe most pro users would be happy with a simplified solution like &quot;if you fork a chain in a rack, its branches won&#x27;t be shown in the mixer&quot;, which would cover the 95% of other simple use cases like, seeing where your compressors are at a glance without having to click on each track a hundred times...<p>There&#x27;s many such things - like proper multi-screen support (e.g. with 3+ screens), which, hypothetically, could also couple well with a separate-window mixer view where they could introduce chain branching and all that (and become the first DAW to do that!). For pro use, there&#x27;s lots of features like this that may sound boring but end up hampering your workflow a lot. It may not be as fun-sounding as &#x27;yet another cool phaser bitcrusher spectral distortion plugin&#x27; but the reality is, professional users that they supposedly aim at do require core functionality that&#x27;s been missing since the start.')
