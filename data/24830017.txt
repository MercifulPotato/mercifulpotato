I have a VPS that&#x27;s been online for years, serving port 22. I average about 200k attempts per year. I have it set to pubkey only, root can&#x27;t login at all. If you connect without sending a pubkey, it pretty much instantly tells you to go away. I don&#x27;t bother with fail2ban.<p>Maybe I should start logging attempted pubkeys as a side project just to see what pops up.')
