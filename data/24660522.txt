Best approach I can think of would be something like:<p><pre><code>  Cool, looks like you&#x27;ve getting the hang of creating Pull\n  Requests on GitHub. :)\n\n  The actual change here though isn&#x27;t useful to us. :(\n\n  Would you be ok spending some time improving [XYZ] instead? :)\n</code></pre>\neg combine encouragement for the bit they got right + info on what needs work, and point them in the right direction for fixing it<p>Some people will probably just not be bothered, but others might get involved in the suggested way.
