The author insists that the Internet has up until recently been mostly American, yet admits that the World Wide Web was made in Switzerland. And about most Internet users being American...does the author think Europe, South America, Africa, and Asia first got connected to the internet in like 2012 or something? In the very early days, yes, the Internet was largely in the U.S., but the Internet has been worldwide for a long time, with large amounts of users outside the U.S. The graph presenting the amount of VC money spent in the U.S. vs. abroad makes me think that the author views “the Internet” as tech startups in the Silicon Valley tradition and not anything else. There is a <i>lot</i> more to the Internet than Google and Yahoo and Facebook and friends. American users might not see these parts of the Internet, but they exist and existed. Just because they weren&#x27;t a hot new SV startup doesn&#x27;t mean they weren&#x27;t a valuable and popular component of the Internet. Other countries besides the U.S. have had large, popular sites and apps for decades.')
