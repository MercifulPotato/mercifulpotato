It hit #4 at the end of the day, but we didn&#x27;t get featured on Twitter or anywhere else. It&#x27;s no wonder since it was a lousy launch. I didn&#x27;t have a subscribe form at the time to start building an audience, and it was my first launch ever. I could&#x27;ve prepared better for it. You live and learn.<p>6 months in, I pivoted the idea, and now I&#x27;m offering a free plan where you can post a 10-day job post for free each month, and $199&#x2F;month flat for unlimited job posts. And since we&#x27;ve gone through the crazy of 2020, I want to celebrate 2021, by offering a 50% discount to the first companies getting the unlimited plan.<p>I want to see if it&#x27;s possible to build a job board without paying for ads, indexing other job posting platforms, or other growth hacks, just purely organic.<p>Transparency is important to me, so I thought it would be helpful for leads to know how much traffic I have if they want to post a job on the platform. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m making the analytics dashboard public: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.usefathom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;kxhjtfau&#x2F;fairremote.com<p>The infrastructure costs are very low so I can keep them running forever ($59&#x2F;mo).<p>Right now I&#x27;m focusing on content, and building an audience via HackerNews, Twitter, and the blog. Anything else worth trying?')
