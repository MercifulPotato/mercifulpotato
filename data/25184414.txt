On the other hand finding problem requires somewhat tedious job to identify a memory leak that is from the app and not supporting library.\nIt would be awesome if there was an ability to do &quot;SQL search&quot; through those, it would be possible to &quot;group by&quot; instances by the same line, which would increase ability to quickly pin point where is the problem. Also it would be possible to reorganize entire structure by sizes etc.<p>Has anyone worked with any similar tool?')
