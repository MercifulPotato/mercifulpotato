Item(by='akiselev', descendants=None, kids=[24783255], score=None, time=1602719129, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24782590, text='According to [1], the Church is estimated to own over 170 million acres worldwide. Assuming that property is distributed evenly by land area, let&#x27;s estimate that the Catholic church owns ~3.5 million acres in the United States and ~1.75 million in Europe (minus Russia). The value ranges from something like $100 million for an acre in NYC to $1,000&#x2F;acre in Wyoming so even if you price each acre as Wyoming uninhabited wilderness they&#x27;d have $3.5 billion in assets. Considering how big churches, hospitals, and schools are and where they&#x27;re built, I&#x27;d assume their assets average closer to $10k or $100k per acre, putting their wealth in the United States alone at $35 to 350 billion. In Europe, the numbers are probably even more skewed towards the higher end.<p>As long as the global average per acre is $500 or more, they&#x27;ve got at least a trillion in wealth. Unlike the corporation, the Church is more decentralized and structured such that most of the revenue moving through that property (donations, tithes, salaries, maintenance, etc.) doesn&#x27;t show up on the books.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.curbed.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;18&#x2F;16483194&#x2F;catholic-church-gis-goodlands-esri-molly-burhans" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.curbed.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;18&#x2F;16483194&#x2F;catholic-chur...</a>')
