Posting a job req with some focused hashtags seems to help get more responses. Posting a few industry-appropriate articles does seem to help keep our company in folks&#x27; minds.<p>In an ideal world every company I work for will be so amazing and so well known that I don&#x27;t have to sell it to folks because the right folks are coming straight to us. Or that all of my friends and all of their friends will magically be capable of switching jobs to come build a new team with me whenever I need to grow.<p>But reality doesn&#x27;t work like that, and so things like LinkedIn end up being table stakes. It isn&#x27;t the whole of my recruitment strategy, but certainly it&#x27;s a functional part.')
