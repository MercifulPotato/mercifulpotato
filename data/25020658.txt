Item(by='pron', descendants=None, kids=[25021883, 25021497], score=None, time=1604790608, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25018382, text='I find this kind epistemology fascinating. Suppose I were to not believe any institutional message, and lend it no credence whatsoever. &quot;Thinking for myself&quot; is not enough. Ultimately, I need information that I can&#x27;t gather myself, and, often enough, some expert who can put it into context, because there are too many things and too little time, and learning anything in depth requires years. So, in the end, you have to trust someone, and it seems to me that the people who say &quot;think for yourself&quot; or &quot;do your own research&quot; might be skeptical of institutional sources, but are quicker to trust <i>other</i> sources than your &quot;excellent sheep,&quot; but why they trust the particular sources they trust is pretty mysterious.<p>I tried, as a &quot;magical mystery tour&quot; exercise of sort, to see if I could get into the conspiracy theories that permeate the Trump world, but found that I was too skeptical and couldn&#x27;t truly bring myself to believe what they believe, even as an experiment, because their entire epistemological system, the philosophy of how they come to &quot;know&quot; something, is something I couldn&#x27;t follow the rules of. How someone&#x27;s reputation is determined was a mystery to me. There are no documented methodologies, no agreed-upon &quot;scientific method&quot;, no peer review. I once asked someone how he knew something, and he said that he&#x27;d done his own research. I asked him which databases and archives they had access to, but then realized that what he meant by &quot;research&quot; was that he&#x27;d read some posts on Facebook by people he didn&#x27;t know and watched some videos on YouTube, also by people he didn&#x27;t know, and he&#x27;d judged their reputation based on the opinions of others, but those others had had just the same corpus of knowledge, and nobody actually had any access to primary data, and no one even thought this should make them skeptical.<p>So how do you know that this conspiracy theory is something you should believe but not that other one? I assumed there was some internal logic, but I just couldn&#x27;t find a pattern. I think it has to do with the aesthetics of the story; how dramatic it is, how good-vs-evil, and whether it fits with an overarching meta-conspiracy-theory of hidden powers. If the story is dramatic, they believe it. In other words, the truth is whatever makes for a good story, where I am played as a pawn of some hidden cabal. But perhaps you can shed some more light on that epistemological process.')
