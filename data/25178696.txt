GIMP is better in every way for me so far (I&#x27;ve just recently become a Photoshop user), except that CMYK doesn&#x27;t work well or seamlessly yet on GIMP, making it unusable in a professional context. Other proprietary photo editors that worked with CMYK from their beginning are passing the GIMP as photoshop competitors.')
