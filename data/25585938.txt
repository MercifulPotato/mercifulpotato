Would also display the number of files, lines changed and what languages.<p>Annoyingly there is no pay via atlassian for bitbucket cloud yet, and I was not prepared to do my own pay,ent which sort of negates the marketplace value.<p>It’s something I plan to launch when that is released eventually though.')
