In other words, it&#x27;s easier to be &quot;successful&quot; (from a monetary point of view) when you don&#x27;t care about others. It&#x27;s also easier to be successful coming from a privileged background. What&#x27;s more, there can be a  correlation between only knowing privilege and not caring about others, which perhaps leads to the number of billionaires who exploit people (double-advantage).<p>But it&#x27;s all very complicated. Sometimes a modest background is an advantage in that you have less to lose, and can provide unique insight in connecting with people. Or a modest background can lead to a survival-of-the-fittest or harsh-world mentality, which leads to the exact opposite, which can also be an advantage.<p>At any rate, I&#x27;ve chosen to play on high-difficulty mode, for better or worse.')
