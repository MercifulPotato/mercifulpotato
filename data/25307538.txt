By this I mean proteins fold into a shape, and DM gives us some idea what that looks like, then it enters into a reaction - what is the shape now? Many are enzymes and snap and release, snap and release. Some poisons have the same initial shape - snap - then no release - reaction site has been poisoned - the body thinks it has lots, but the body dies of the poison. Some toxins that kill by ribosomal inactivation are like this, mushroom poisons, ricin are like this. Mankind would love to be able to reverse ricin and mushroom poisonings, which usually happen days after the toxic event.\nNot being an expert, this is just an analogy.')
