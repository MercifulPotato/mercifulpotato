You&#x27;re shackled to somebody else&#x27;s schedule, whims, priorities, etc. until you have the money to not do that anymore. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean 2.5m liquid though.<p>How much would you need to work if you bought a small-ish house, lived on a very strict budget, and generally kept expenditure to a minimum? There are places in the US where you can buy a house on a bit of land for just over $100k (ex: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;homedetails&#x2F;904-Grant-St-Tupelo-MS-38801&#x2F;78049954_zpid&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;homedetails&#x2F;904-Grant-St-Tupelo-MS-38...</a>). What could you do with half an acre of land, a paid off house, and minimal day-to-day obligations? Imagine: work for an hour or two per day so that you have money to buy food, pay power&#x2F;electric, etc., then idk... read? write that book you&#x27;ve always thought about writing? get in shape? start a garden? go fishing? There are so many possibilities.<p>I recognize that moving across the country, having the money to pay off a $120k house, etc. is an enormous privilege for some people and I&#x27;m certainly not asserting that it&#x27;s an opportunity that anyone could take advantage of. Only pointing out that the bar for FU money might be lower than you might think.')
