The extra sensors in particular would be a welcome improvement. I had the Snap Circuits rover on hand already, so my total outlay was about $20.<p>A big question when building the base is whether it&#x27;s heavy&#x2F;wide enough to be stable. Mounting the tablet up high is great for interaction, but results in a high center of gravity and a long moment arm conspiring to cause instability. From the specs it looks like the iRobot might be both heavier and wider than the Snap Circuits rover, so it might be a great choice.')
