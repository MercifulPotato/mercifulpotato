To both of them you submit a query&#x2F;argument and they return some value. A “function” might “compute” the value after the query is submitted, while the database might “store” a pre-computed value. Especially in physical contexts where there is a natural continuity in the thing being represented (think object density&#x2F;radiance, as opposed to student names), it makes sense to also have the option to interpolate among records in a database.<p>Neural networks (being generic learnable function approximators) are a nice framework to straddle this boundary for generic cases.<p>In the specific example of the Nerf, we use a neural network rather than discrediting space and assigning a value per pixel&#x2F;voxel. A consequent advantage is that we can have an a data description that is adaptive non-uniform in its information density, unlike a voxel grid.<p>There’s more to say, but I hope this gives a feel :-)')
