It takes very little time to teach a kid how to put books on a shelf.  The reason librarians are at libraries is to manage the collection of knowledge and to help people find information.  So I&#x27;d give a lot of weight to a librarian&#x27;s opinion on a search engine.  The hardest part is finding out whether or not someone working at a library is a &quot;real&quot; librarian without being insulting.')
