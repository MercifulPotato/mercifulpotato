Free to generate PDFs. Pay to print. Take a cut from each printing job, but outsource the printing and distribution.<p>I suspect you won&#x27;t find a single mass market for this. The mass market is well served by generically designed notebooks.<p>Instead, you&#x27;ll find a number of highly profitable niche markets. (Like the D&amp;D crowd, the design crowd, the hacker crowd, STEM teachers, etc.) Judging by your homepage, it seems you&#x27;re already on this track.<p>Because of this, your best bet (once developed or at least in early testing) might be to find a few brand ambassadors from each of those niches: a dedicated gamer, a well-known designer, etc. People who can introduce your product into their respective niches.<p>I&#x27;d also make sure the print quality is on par with Field Notes or Moleskin, to make sure you can command a good price.<p>Apologies for the unsolicited advice... just really into this idea.')
