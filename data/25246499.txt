I’ve been putting off learning how to setup and run k8s, and am unfortunately in a situation where I don’t have anyone at work to learn from.<p>For context I’m no stranger to what the shape of production ready systems should be and can fill in the gaps given enough time to research and educate myself, but I don’t do operational work day-to-day.<p>I’m bringing a project to life right now and can’t but feel like while tough to learn and manage, k8s would be a good investment to make. I don’t have anyone using it yet, so I just did the bare minimum to get my docker-compose stack up and running on a Linode box. It works great for making sure what I have now works in a remote environment too, and I had to do a decent amount of configuration rework to get it ready, which should be transferable.<p>Now I’m wondering, how will things like rolling deployments work? I want to decouple the monitoring stack from the application stack, how will I handle adding another physical machine to my setup? I’m sure more questions will come up like this as I run into them, but would be curious to hear initial thoughts from anyone here to help me make a decision :)')
