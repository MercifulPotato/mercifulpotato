They run one or two corporate apps all the time, which probably don&#x27;t need much room anyway since such apps are usually designed to sync stuff with some kind of server in order to not have anything on the phone to back up or be lost in the event of a failure. Nobody shoots videos photos with those phones, and nobody puts music or movies on them. They basically need the space for the OS plus a few gigabytes extra; any additional space is wasted and ideally not there in the first place.')
