Most people don’t know this but in San Francisco ferry market plaza whose first floor is full of restaurants, there is no gas connection. The code doesn’t allow for fire extinguishing infrastructure and the overhead foam sprayers etc. pretty much all of them have electric and semi prepped food made off site made in a commissary kitchen or at another restaurant branch.<p>Restaurant code and permits are notoriously difficult and in San Francisco expensive ..a nightmare actually. If restaurants can do without a stove..cooking in a dorm is easy peasy.')
