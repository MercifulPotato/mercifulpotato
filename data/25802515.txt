It means people don&#x27;t write maven plugins for every single conceivable scenario; usually there will be at most one or two plugins for whatever you wanted to do, properly documented and maintained, whereas with gradle there will be four or five different plugins with no documentation each of which only covers half of the task. And forcing people to put logic in actual released plugins rather than ad-hoc one-liners in the middle of the build definition means you avoid ending up with a bunch of ad-hoc one-liners scattered throughout your build definition, which is much better for long-term maintenance.')
