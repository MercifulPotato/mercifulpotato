I regularly translate English (mostly technical) texts to Japanese, and the translation I get is roughly the same size as the original. Its density is certainly not &quot;very low&quot;.<p>The reason that you might think that Japanese is more &quot;bloated&quot; is probably because the form of the language you hear most - in TV news and speeches - are in the &quot;polite&quot; form. In that case, they mean to be verbose. But in the casual form, the same thing can be said much shorter.<p>Also, keep in mind that Japanese has a very different phonetic system. Their phonetic intuition is mostly based on &quot;mora&quot; and many find the notion of syllable confusing and inconsistent. I don&#x27;t think these two are very comparable (at least mentally).<p>It&#x27;s funny that you mentioned that a Japanese newspaper looks more &quot;crowded&quot; than English one. Japanese people would think the exact opposite. The &quot;information density&quot; is really in the eye of the beholder.')
