I could see a PI saying &quot;well, you&#x27;ll finish your PhD in 5 years if you&#x27;re lucky and most of your experiments are successful.  In the meantime, could I get you to spend 6 months writing up all these unsuccessful experiments?  You&#x27;ll get zero credit for it and it will delay your PhD.  Thanks!&quot;')
