For me this isn&#x27;t a left vs right or Republican vs Democrat issue, its an establishment vs everyone else issue.  If this policy was in effect in 2002 and 2003 people would be getting censored and banned for disputing &quot;the fact&quot; that Iraq had WMD.  Just a few days ago NATO members blocked the former OPCW chief from giving testimony on the (very much disputed) narratives regarding the alleged chemical attacks in Syria.  You can be sure the people being blocked and censored by Twitter won&#x27;t be those pushing the official US government narrative.  The argument Twitter is making that, &quot;people are too dumb to figure out what is true, so we will tell them what is true&quot; is very dangerous when Twitter doesn&#x27;t have a monopoly on the truth, and is run by people with a vested interest and belief in &quot;establishment&quot; narratives - no matter how questionable (or provably false) those narratives are.')
