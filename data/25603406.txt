I just checked, on one of my main work boards, to create a new ticket, there are 33 fields to fill out, at least half of which are mandatory. In the middle of a highsev incident, I absolutely hate the time sink, and have been trying to figure out ways to automate away jira as much as possible. I think Jira can be used correctly, but over time PHB&#x27;s ruin it&#x27;s potential.<p>The other problem with Jira is the Atlassian push into confluence that tends to go with it. Confluence is so infuriating. Oh what, you want to do a simple operation like copy-paste data from one section of a table to another? Fuck you. You want built in markdown? Fuck you. You want to embed github pages? Thats a plugin and an ordeal to get approved...etc<p>People always talk about how it&#x27;s just a wysiwg and so its for the non-techs, but the thing is it&#x27;s so specific and non-standard they are still having to learn how to use it anyway. Why not just get them working on github wikis or something?<p>Also: ffs, stop trying to do &quot;smart searching&quot; for me! It&#x27;s literally the most useless feature ever, and has never returned anything close to what I was looking for. Yay for having to learn JQL just to do a semi-advanced search. How many query languages do we need to know these days?')
