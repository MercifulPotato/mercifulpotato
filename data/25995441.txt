What will happen if Google shut down stadia with the games I purchased? That&#x27;s the main issue I have with the platform, will be a refund or even a steam &#x2F; epic key after?<p>I loved Google Play Music, Reader, Hangouts and god knows how many chat apps google have made over the years to later kill.
