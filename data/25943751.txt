Comments encouraged!<p>Technique: &quot;Neural Geometric LOD (level of detail)&quot;<p>Summary: This technique provides a machine-learning approach to give more efficient representation for 3D surfaces at interactive rates.<p>Related Work: &quot;Our work is most related to prior research on mesh simplification for level of detail (LOD), 3D neural shape representations, and implicit neural rendering.&quot;<p>Method: &quot;Our goal is to design a representation which reconstructs detailed geometry and enables continuous level of detail, all whilst being able to render at interactive rates.&quot;<p>Experiments: &quot;Across all [tested] datasets [(ShapeNet, Thingi10K, TurboSquid, Shadertoy)] and metrics, we achieve state-of-the-art results&quot; relative to DeepSDF, Fourier Feature Networks, SIREN, and Neural Implicits (NI).<p>Generalization: &quot;surface extraction mechanism can generalize to multiple shapes, even from being trained on a single shape.&quot;')
