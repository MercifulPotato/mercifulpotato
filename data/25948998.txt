The ones who manipulated were the reddit and other chat rooms. If Costco doesn&#x27;t want to stock your favorite item any more do you get to sue because you still want to buy it?<p>2- If the customers had no idea of the legal documents they signed when they opened their accounts, their bad, not the broker.<p>3- &#x27;the trust of the retail trading industry&#x27; Certainly not retail investors (who are not the people doing this stuff).  And I doubt also retail traders who are not engaged in mob trades based on what is coming out of internet chat rooms&#x2F;boards. There was day trading prior to the advent of Robinhood and Covid-19, right?<p>4- First off, the shorts are done.  That is a large part of why the price went to where it did.  Second, the brokers are protecting themselves from default on margin loans as well as the headache and aggravation of closeouts when &#x27;traders&#x27; moan about the fills.<p>5- Why on earth should the Biden administration go to bat for a retail trading mob? Many of whom are on record in the press as having used their stimulus and unemployment checks as capital?<p>6- Shorts are not only necessary for a market to function well, they are a common part of the market having nothing at all to do with a view on a company.  The largest example of that are fund managers selling the stock of an aquiring company against a position they own in the company being purchased.  Fund manager could mean pension fund manager, mutual fund manager, or, gasp, a hedge fund manager.')
