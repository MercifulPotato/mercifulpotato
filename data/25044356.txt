It&#x27;s basically like a regular flu or severe cold, and yes rhinovirus can be deadly to the elderly, it&#x27;s just nobody normally notices or cares because rhinovirus isn&#x27;t &quot;new&quot;. If anything it&#x27;s actually less bad than flu because flu kills children too and this one doesn&#x27;t.<p><i>Nonetheless, the original SARS-1 (which is way closer to SARS-2 than say OC43), is known to be causing long term, debilitating health complication among significant number of survivors</i><p>And yet it didn&#x27;t turn into a worldwide outbreak, so one must ask how much value this classification scheme actually has, given that SARS-2 is really nothing like SARS-1 in either infectiousness nor severity.')
