There are so many confounding variables, from quality of healthcare to age demographic of infection, etc. It&#x27;s also noisy. A nursing home getting infected and many older folks dying can completely spike the numbers. So I pretty much don&#x27;t trust their statistics, especially if they are reporting 3 significant figures like &quot;7.49 days doubling the  number of fatalities&quot;. Even just misaligning the starts of the exponential growth phase of curves (does it begin at 1 case per 100k, 5, 100?) can throw this way off.')
