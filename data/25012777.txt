You can&#x27;t put a dollar value on R&amp;D.  You just can&#x27;t.  Anything you do will be a gross approximation, and because the number is so fuzzy, you&#x27;ll be encouraged (even subconsciously) to fudge it around to make other things look better, which will undoubtedly lead you to undervalue R&amp;D to the point where it negatively impacts your business, but you have no idea why, because you&#x27;re solely focused on dollar figures and not what really matters.  Y&#x27;know, like developing the ability to solve actual customer problems in an exceptional manner.  This sort of thing is very difficult to quantify, and any approach that starts from a finance perspective is always going to be sub-optimal at best, but often just flat-out wrong.<p>I see so many people optimizing the things that are quantifiable at the expense of the things that aren&#x27;t, when the loss of the qualitative things is what&#x27;s killing their business.  MBA types seem to never get this, and the form of your reply is basically a textbook example of that.')
