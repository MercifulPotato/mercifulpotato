Great you can buy a Dell server on eBay, or you can build a powerful desktop, or rent a VM or get a droplet or scrape on lowendbox. These are not a secret and there is a great reason no one does this other than hobbyists and neckbeards.<p>You do your testing and it works, then what? You have to deliver scalable reliable systems in production that require identity management, security, backups, resiliency, reliability, various networking services and a million other supporting services and all the systems that come with it. Never-mind actually scaling the application, monitoring it and all the tools, systems and processes needed to run reliable systems in production.<p>The eBay servers provide you exactly zero of that and you&#x27;ve just wasted time setting up an environment that is a snowflake and doesn&#x27;t represent reality. Testing on the cloud on exactly the same platform you would use for production has a lot of benefits when you look at value as limited developer time delivering value to customers and the business.<p>Whilst the $1200 server on eBay might be cheap today, you are entirely missing the hidden cost of lost time when your team of developers costing $M&#x2F;year are wasting on testing in an environment that doesn&#x27;t help them find and solve production issues. You don&#x27;t need many hours of wasted time or downtime to lose all of your so called cost gains.<p>Optimising for absolute minimum cost is a fools errand that only slows down actually delivering production systems that deliver value to your customers.<p>Please spend some time thinking bigger about the opportunity cost and value delivery of technology beyond the immediate dollars and cents - it might surprise you.')
