Item(by='rcoveson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610858320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25806372, text='&gt; It&#x27;s for theft, because getting something of value for free feels good.<p>I love this too. I steal the mountain air when I hit the trails, I steal the sounds of nearby conversations, and I steal the memories of songs I&#x27;ve heard. Sometimes a friend will sing me something, and I steal that too. I play my music loud sometimes, and I hope those around me steal it.<p>I&#x27;ve stolen things at my job from my coworkers, little ideas that belong to my company. They&#x27;ll breed and have child ideas, stolen children, which I will make available for theft by others down the road.<p>I even stole your comment; it had a little value, in its way. I won&#x27;t pay you for it, even if you ask. In fact, if you ever write something and seal it away behind copyright, I can&#x27;t promise I won&#x27;t read it at a library in the future; you wouldn&#x27;t see a dime.<p>Finally: If anybody ever asks me for something I know, or something I am capable of reciting--be it music, poetry, fiction, whatever--I will help them steal it by repeating it. I will not turn them away out of some unnatural commitment to the idea that all valuable information has an owner who must &quot;get theirs&quot; in advance of any transfer.')
