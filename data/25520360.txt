A reliable source of alpha involved mining retail brokerage agreements--particularly the online-only ones, which were the bleeding edge at the time--for these sorts of shenanigans.<p>In some cases, the conflicts were clear. We paid a large brokerage for their options flow. They got a premium because, in part, they didn&#x27;t automatically exercise in-the-money options at expiry. So you&#x27;d have a stream, on every expiry, of free money coming in. It always struck me as odd that one part of their business was profiting from another being deficient.')
