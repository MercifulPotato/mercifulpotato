Intense political pressure from half of the country would have immense negative consequences on whatever Fauci would try to accomplish. He would have instantly lost any credibility with half of Americans who listen primarily to Trump.<p>If Fauci divorced himself from Trump, and the two took opposite stances on masks, can we really conclusively say the public would be <i>more</i> willing to listen to the truth about masks? By playing &quot;both sides&quot; he gets to have greater influence, maybe not in the medical community, but certainly on the public at large.<p>If Trump took a harder stance on HCHQ and replaced Fauci with someone who was also pro HCHQ, do you think the public would be more likely to listen to Fauci who took an opposite stance?')
