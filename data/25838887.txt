It&#x27;s all well and good to imagine what it looks like next to a utopia of angels, but in that case we wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about any system, would we?<p>The question is whether the marketplace of ideas works better than other actual systems or cultures found in the real-world. Here&#x27;s what I do know, the marketplace of ideas was conceived 300 years ago in the Enlightenment. Since then, the amount of human liberty, tolerance, peace, and prosperity has exploded. The societies that adopted the principles of the Enlightenment first experienced the earliest and largest gains along these dimensions. The societies today that most adhere to Enlightenment principles and the marketplace of ideas are by far the freest and most prosperous.  Over any reasonable span of time, tolerance, freedom and peace continue to monotonically improve. Especially for the most marginalized groups. Particularly in the most liberal societies.<p>In what universe could anyone possibly lock at this track record of success and not conclude that the Enlightenment and its principle of the marketplace of ideas has been a resounding success. Arguably the most resounding success in all of human history. Honestly, what possible system, real or imagined, do you believe could have produced better results?')
