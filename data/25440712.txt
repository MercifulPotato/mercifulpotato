Item(by='CaptArmchair', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608112099, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25438388, text='&gt; I exclude all left aligned and right aligned media from credibility<p>Political alignment is a valid criterion to curate your news feed. However, if you apply that as your only criterion, you end up back at square on: getting a colored sliver of the news.<p>There are many more criteria you could apply as well. Is it a non-profit or a for profit outlet? Is the outlet based in the U.S. or is it located abroad, say, the E.U. or Asia? Is it a local, regional or national outlet? Is it an outlet I consider as my primary, daily go-to, or is it an outlet I consider as a weekend read? Is it an outlet focussing on a particular demographic? Which one? Am I part of that demographic? Does the outlet only provide short-form news articles, and&#x2F;or long-reads with background information? Does the outlet report from a single side, or does it pit different perspectives against each other in equal measure?<p>Asking those questions to yourself adds differentiation in your how you curate your news intake.<p>The latter doesn&#x27;t even have to be limited to other news outlets. Reading books is one of the best ways to gain the perspective one needs to digest the daily news.<p>I follow U.S. news sources but that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m willing to accept what they publish at face value. Amending the news with many other sources helps me to gain perspective.<p>The trouble today is how much attention is diverted towards consuming fast digital media and being active in a 24&#x2F;7 economy. If you don&#x27;t take the time to stop, slow down and think about what the news is reporting, you&#x27;re not going to develop the skills and the knowledge to properly digest the news and form nuanced opinions.')
