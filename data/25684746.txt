So in theory payment information isn&#x27;t included.<p>However once you&#x27;ve got someones email or phone number you can ultimately tie it to any other data when you&#x27;ve used it elsewhere - medical records, phone calls to prostitutes, hacker news posts etc.<p>I think the difference is that Apple don&#x27;t (or claim to not) use that data to categorise you and serve ads like Facebook.  Apple make lots of money from hardware sales, a few cents from aggregating data is a drop in the ocean and they can take &#x27;the moral highground&#x27; towards privacy.')
