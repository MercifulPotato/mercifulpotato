Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605245992, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25071311, text='&gt; In Brave New World, it&#x27;s only a meritocracy because they&#x27;ve engineered human embryos to produce the different castes. In the novel, they deliberately induce fetal alcohol syndrome to stunt the intelligence of the lower classes.<p>They also forgoed a lot of automation and engineered society to make use of the stunted lower classes.  I recall a scene where they had elevator operators, even though automatic elevators had been invented when the book was written.<p>&gt; The modern reformulation would be genetic engineering or at least genetic screening. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;re not that far away from the wealthy classes testing their embryos and only implanting the ones that have the highest intelligence, least propensity for disease, etc.<p>That&#x27;s literally the backstory of the movie Gattica.  Though I think the genetic engineering in that movie controlled recombination, so engineered children got all the best genes of their parents.  IIRC, people who weren&#x27;t engineered (like us) lived in slums and were only given menial jobs regardless of talent.')
