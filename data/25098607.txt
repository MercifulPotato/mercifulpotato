Item(by='tluyben2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605419028, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25097164, text='I went to my local home computer club when I was around 12 to soak up information beginning of the 80s; there were all these guys (only guys) there much older than me who knew everything and liked helping a kid who, by then, knew how to program basic, asm + pascal. They taught me eprom programming so I could swap out the basic rom, programming BBS software (I wrote a few BBS systems for myself after that; I had hosted a BBS since age 10 and it was always cool to have different features etc than the rest) and making cartridges for all kinds of purpose.<p>Before that I got most from magazines &amp; books; my grandparents took me to fire sales (lot of magazines there) and &#x27;rubbish sellers&#x27; (not sure of the english word), for instance, Phillips had a quarterly &#x27;dump&#x27; sale under the football stadium; all kinds of electronics, books etc could be had there for next to nothing (money earned with strawberry picking in the summer went to those places). I bought scopes, ham radios etc and documentation there. And my father got me books that were damaged from work (mostly C, Pascal, later Clipper and other things).')
