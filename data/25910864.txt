Very impressive. I have so many questions but my number one is: were you able to evaluate alternatives to your existing vertical scaling based setup? For example, cockroachdb, multi-master postgres, using sharding instead of a single DB, etc. At that database size, you are well past the point in which a more advanced DB technology would theoretically help you scale and simplify your architecture, so I&#x27;m curious why you didn&#x27;t go that route.')
