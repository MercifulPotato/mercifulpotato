I had no reason to buy a new phone other than Google ditching support for the Pixel 2, a high priced flagship, after only 3 years. Combine this with how much more Android phones depreciate compared to iPhones (who wants a device you can’t get security updates for) and it’d have been cheaper to buy an iPhone. Needless to say, I didn’t buy another Android. I don’t think the update situation will improve further to be honest, even Google doesn’t care enough to lead by example.')
