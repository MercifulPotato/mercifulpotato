Instead what they did was make the most power possible available from the battery at all times, and yes that changed over time. This seems like a much better alternative. I really don’t understand the criticism.<p>The marketing is at issue here. If instead of calling it throttling down when the battery was old they called it boosting up when the battery was new it would have been a best in class feature instead of a $100 million dollar settlement.<p>And yes, at the point where the throttling was taking place, the battery wasn’t defective. That was a completely expected place along the performance curve of a consumable part. So why replace it when it’s working as designed? In my opinion this is the opposite of planned obsolescence, they took devices that would otherwise have to be replaced due to shut downs and allow them to remain in service.')
