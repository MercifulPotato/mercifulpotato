They&#x27;ve released products that they purchased (such as RHEV) under free licenses, they do upstream delivery of their work, and they pay for a substantial chunk of the ongoing development of many key free software projects.<p>It was not unreasonable to assume that they would maintain CentOS.<p>This change has occurred now that Red Hat are IBM. I expect to see more, bad, changes. Cutting devs from free software contribution that aren&#x27;t &quot;directly important&quot; enough, killing free software stacks like JBoss that compete with IBM offerings, and so on.')
