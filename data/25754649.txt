For instance, it&#x27;s not clear from the outside how much Double Fine (and thus Microsoft) owns now of the games they managed to remake (Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango). Maybe Microsoft has the movie rights now? That would be funny, though Microsoft&#x27;s attempts at movies to date have all been cursed.')
