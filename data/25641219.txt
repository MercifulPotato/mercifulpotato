I was within a couple of inches of being able to touch opposite walls (the narrow way) with my finger tips.  Hong Kong changed the rules from quarantine-at-home to hotel quarantine while we were out.  (We booked a place 2.25x as big, but had a problem with our booking 6 hours before check-in and had to find another booking last-minute.)<p>I thought I might go stir crazy or have elevated levels of conflict with my wife, but it worked out okay.  On the other hand, I can understand why the Council of Europe deems 8 sq. m. (86 sq. ft.) the minimum prison cell size for two prisoners.')
