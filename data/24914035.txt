But one of these does not feel like the others... (<i>cough</i> &quot;Build a program â†’ Code a function&quot; <i>cough</i>).<p>All the others could be done in the day, except for the vegetable one which is too abstract. And their solution could be done in 2 minutes. The coding one on the other hand... impossible to do in a day and also writing code is imo almost impossible to write in small chunks of time. Brainstorming a feature,thinking about a problem for 2 minutes, deleting&#x2F;cleaning code, or even just opening your IDE and checking where you&#x27;re at and planning the next step, sure. But actual coding, would not recommend. I require at least 30m+, preferably 60m+ to get anything reasonable done.')
