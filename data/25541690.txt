Item(by='rubycon22', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608961453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25541269, text='It seems like what most people in your position do is try to get as rich as possible doing a job they may dislike&#x2F;hate until they can retire and then start doing whatever they love. Often, they may not reach whatever they feel is the appropriate amount of money to retire and they keep wasting time doing what they hate and end up falling out of their passions. Now imagine how it is for people who don&#x27;t have the ability or credentials to get a six figure and beyond job to build up their wealth and retire. You could read this and think about how privileged you are that you have the opportunity to do something like that. Or, you could go the opposite route and take a big risk toward doing what you really want to do and hoping for the best. There is a middle ground somewhere there as well. I&#x27;m not qualified to give any concrete or actionable advice beyond this. I really wish there was a better way. Not just for people like you, but for everyone who doesn&#x27;t wish to waste their life working.')
