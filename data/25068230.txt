No way to really converse and the best you can hope for is to meet someone drunk who wants to fuck. Not ideal for actually meeting people.<p>Most people are actually quite friendly and open to chatting. Talk to the people around you at bars, restaurants, parks. Offer to help people. Conversations happen naturally, just be open and confident. If you struggle with that, maybe some more structured group activities help break the ice (e.g. attend a class, sport, volunteer somewhere, etc.)')
