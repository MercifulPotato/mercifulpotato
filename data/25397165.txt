Item(by='jtwaleson', descendants=None, kids=[25398090, 25397946], score=None, time=1607767301, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25396978, text='I didn&#x27;t mean using the acronym adjectivally, that would be ridiculous as your examples show ;) When  expanding the examples and using the acronym as a noun you can indeed use both forms:<p>Taxol gains quick approval of FDA.<p>Taxol gains quick approval of the FDA.<p>Or others: FDA has approved... vs. The FDA has approved...<p>To most lay persons, omitting &quot;the&quot; will look a bit weird.<p>Now the interesting part is that NASA has become a proper noun (probably because it is an acronym that can be pronounced). No one will say &quot;I work at the NASA&quot;. With FDA you will see people use both forms, even though the final A in both NASA and FDA stands for Administration. I&#x27;m not sure about other government organizations. I don&#x27;t think anyone says &quot;I work at CIA&quot; or FBI for that matter.')
