In Japan this niche was already much more explored, although it is not a pass-time most adults flaunt. While I never got the impression that adult viewers of anime were anything more than a (sizeable) minority, they are certainly a target demographic, and manga (comics) even more so. One example that always stuck out to me was former prime minister Asō Tarō who openly admitted to being quite well-read in manga.')
