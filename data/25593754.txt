Instead of playing around with the technology that brought everyone to the company, they get suckered into bugging people and asking for status.  They get to hear people&#x27;s complaints about inconsequential things.  They get to run meetings and juggle deadlines in spreadsheets and shitty enterprise apps.  And they can&#x27;t be always be friends with their tribe.<p>Back to individual contributors - they get to be less responsible.  They get to play with stuff.  They are more likely to be able to leave it at work. If they can&#x27;t do something, they can ask for help.  And they can &quot;be normal&quot; with the rest of the team.  They can make jokes that arent&#x27; taken seriously and even spend time with others outside work.<p>Now where it could go wrong is power.  If all of this becomes a power relationship it might suck.  so don&#x27;t make it that.')
