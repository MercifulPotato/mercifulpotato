They can then interact with regular appliances by pressing buttons, turning dials and operating touchscreens. Oleynik adds: &quot;Not all appliances can be activated with an API or remote control because of safety issues. A lot are still to be operated by the robot itself, pressing buttons, looking at touchscreens, opening and closing doors...We can teach the robot to do all this.&quot;[..]<p>[..]But despite all that, the price is still massive, at £248,000 ($330,000). That isn&#x27;t a typing error. To help soften the blow, customers can order a Moley IoT kitchen without the robotic arms for £140,000 ($187,000), then add the arms (or a future generation of arms) at a later date, which apparently takes just a day&#x27;s work.[..]<p>[..] Having gone through 11 development cycles since 2014, the robot can retrieve ingredients from the fridge, adjust the stove, use the faucet, pour and mix ingredients, and plate up. It will then partially clean up after itself, wiping down surfaces and using ultraviolet lighting to sterilize equipment.<p>So long as everything it needs to cook with is returned to the correct place, and ingredients are stored in the right containers of the custom fridge, the robot uses its sensors and cameras to interact with ingredients, cookware and utensils. The robot can also spot dropped food and clean it up.[..]')
