The planners and financers and propagandists don&#x27;t tend to kill with their own hands. But they command massive acts of violence.<p>Just one example: A radio station (RTLM) in Rwanda laid the groundwork of genocide by dehumanizing Tutsis, among other things by referring to them as &quot;cockroaches&quot; repeatedly. The station was deemed instrumental in the resulting murders of at least half a million people.<p>It&#x27;s not fear mongering to look at the facts of history and see that propaganda is a primary way that violence scales. Deep fakes are another tool which will certainly be used towards these same ends. What propagandist would <i>not</i> want to use such a tool?')
