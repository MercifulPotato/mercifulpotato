Along with temperance and mostly plants, commonalities included natural exercise and positive disposition, for example.<p>Or perhaps, is our disdain of the simple holistic findings a result of our convenience culture?  Are we actually just unhappy there is <i>not</i> one weird trick, preferably in a tablet form, that wouldn’t inconvenience our own “modern” ways?<p>Disclosure: My mother’s side had many siblings making it to 100, some were part of the California blue zone, while others lived in Scandinavia, farming and fishing by the sea.  The realization these lives are differently healthy is hardly pop: there’s a body of health knowledge behind that tracing back to late 1800s, Kellogg (the family behind the cereal whose home page now says “one of the original plant-based wellbeing companies”), and the like.')
