We were walking through Rome and she steered me to this rather ugly building (at least on the outside). When we got in I was flabbergasted. It is an astonishing space, surpassed only by Saint Peters in Rome to me anyway. I had studied it as a kid but only in books, and never paid much attention to the outside, so the surprise was magnificent. One of the great experiences of my life.')
