It played a role in abandoning legacy technologies like the floppy disk, serial ports, and Apple Desktop Bus in favor of Universal Serial Bus. The product line was updated throughout 1998 until 2001 with new technology and colors, eventually being replaced by the iMac G4 and eMac.<p>&gt; ...<p>&gt; A later hardware update created a sleeker design. This second-generation iMac featured a slot-loading optical drive, FireWire, &quot;fanless&quot; operation (through free convection cooling), a slightly updated shape, and the option of AirPort wireless networking. Apple continued to sell this line of iMacs until March 2003, mainly to customers who wanted the ability to run the older Mac OS 9 operating system. USB and FireWire support, and support for dial-up, Ethernet, and wireless networking (via 802.11b and Bluetooth) soon became standard across Apple&#x27;s entire product line. The addition of high-speed FireWire corrected the deficiencies of the earlier iMacs.<p>USB promptly kicked out the ADB peripherals.')
