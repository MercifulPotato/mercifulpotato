It&#x27;s extremely difficult to be in business against someone that can bring in billions in funding with almost no real obligations by deceiving unsophisticated members of the public.  The lack of enforcement also sends an ambiguous signal that maybe more legitimate efforts will be prosecuted but just haven&#x27;t yet because they haven&#x27;t gotten around to it as evidenced by the lack of prosecution of many of the more obviously sketchy efforts.')
