There&#x27;s still a lot of work to do, I think it&#x27;s pretty neat so far though.<p>It uses ML, NLP and gamification to help with treatment. You take care of yourself, you get a spirit animal based on your personality type computed by the app, then it gets levels and then you get paid money for having taken care of yourself (working out a funding mechanism ASAP, almost there).<p>In terms of how I want to manage privacy, which I think is ridiculous important in building a tool like this, I am trying to implement SOLID (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inrupt.com&#x2F;solid" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inrupt.com&#x2F;solid</a>) as a way to make sure any data that is used is completely under the control of the people who need the tool.<p>Lots of bugs and things to iron out over time, trying to build everything in the open to see what people think (and because I enjoy the feedback!!!)<p>Love to answer any questions !<p>This ML algorithm is still a work in progress in terms of it having a high degree of accuracy for ritalin efficacy treatment, over the next week I should have it being incredibly accurate :D<p>Mike')
