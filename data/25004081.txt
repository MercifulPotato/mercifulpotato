One one hand you want to let the students google material, consult books, use a calculator... on the other hand given free internet access what stops them from just asking (or paying) someone to solve the exam for them, or googling long enough until they found a solution someone posted online and just copy it, or cribbing from their mates?<p>A good balance, I found (pre covid), was having the students sit a test with textbooks of their choosing and&#x2F;or their own cheatsheets and lecture notes.
