I wonder if we’ll get rid of .com anytime soon.<p>While we’re on the topic, I wonder why some websites chose to redirect to www and some keep the apex domain as their homepage. I use the latter because it’s cleaner and, well, my domain is primarily used for my website, but I wonder if there is a technical reason behind choosing one or the other.')
