Special relativity pretty much explicitly states this isn&#x27;t the case, making an exception for events that are causally connected, but there&#x27;s been a slew of experiments over the past several decades that call into question even that exception at long distances, and more recently, even ones for local observers, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;advances.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;5&#x2F;9&#x2F;eaaw9832" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;advances.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;5&#x2F;9&#x2F;eaaw9832</a><p>Personally, I&#x27;m in the Rovelli and loop quantum gravity camp - time probably isn&#x27;t actually a real thing on its own, and what we perceive as time is just an emergent property of thermodynamics.')
