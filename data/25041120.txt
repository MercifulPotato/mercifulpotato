From the perspective of giving entities that we believe are probably conscious and probably feel suffering and pain a fair chance at life, minimizing the amount of dairy and cheese we consume would seem like a good idea. I&#x27;m looking forward to a world where lab-grown cheese substitutes are as good as (or better) than the real thing.')
