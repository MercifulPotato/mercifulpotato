Item(by='jarjoura', descendants=None, kids=[24758552], score=None, time=1602524354, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756077, text='There used to be soooo many small interactions that happen throughout the day that right now require way too much formal structure. For example, after lunch as we&#x27;re walking back to our desks we would randomly chat about an idea. These ideas might grow into a bigger group conversation that clarifies things or shifts how one approaches it. Sometimes just sitting next to someone having that conversation is enough, and sometimes I feel like I have something to contribute to it.<p>These are things that can never be replaced with WFH and shouldn&#x27;t need to be. It&#x27;s not a problem right now since we&#x27;re all WFH as we&#x27;re in the middle of this pandemic. Once we return to safer times, some of us will really want to stay WFH, but they&#x27;ll begin to miss out on a lot of these small interactions. People won&#x27;t realize they missed out, and it&#x27;ll never be intentional, but it&#x27;ll happen. At some point it&#x27;ll become a forcing function to bring everyone back into the office.<p>I am definitely pro-WFH a couple days a week, like Tue&#x2F;Thur or Wed&#x2F;Fri. Make those meeting-less days and I can use those to go into deep focus mode. If the whole company does it then we won&#x27;t miss out on any in-office banter.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say there aren&#x27;t roles that work well fully remote if the entire team is fully remote too. Keep in mind those are going to be less-creative projects and much more task based, and if that appeals to you, those will always exist. They existed before the pandemic, and what&#x27;s different now is that these types of teams can now flourish in bigger companies as well.')
