And if a delimiter appears as part of a multi byte sequence, you may see strange results.<p>In a localized world searching for delimiters also starts to make less sense. Eg. I have been told it doesn&#x27;t make sense to break on whitespace for Chinese text.<p>To be clear, I am not saying these functions are bad or evil or to blame for their limitations (a bunch of the problem space wasn&#x27;t invented yet when they were introduced), just noting they have limits. A bunch of more recent languages and libraries have the same or similar issues, too.')
