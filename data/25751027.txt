The reasons there are regulations prohibiting the shutoff of utilities is that these are basic needs without which people can be directly harmed (often very seriously, if you cut off heating in the winter, etc...).<p>There is no similar human rights mandate for a Parler account.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I disagree that some level of regulation is appropriate.  But this issue is (for somewhat obvious reasons) being wildly overstated.  Parler was shut down for explicitly violent rhetoric which inspired real political violence, period.<p>Surely everyone agrees that this particular speech should have been banned, right?  We just disagree about the specifics of how it should be done.  If so, why are we screaming so loud about &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; showing &quot;Monopolistic Force&quot;?<p>Is hyperbole really the answer here?  Or is it an attempt to deflect discussion from things that seem a little more important at the moment?')
