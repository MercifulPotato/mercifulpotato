But right now, the richest 10% of American households own 84% of the value of all stocks owned by Americans [1]. It is clear that the wealthy benefit massively from these structures and have much more use  and access to them than the &quot;everyman&quot;, who in the U.S. probably lives paycheck-to-paycheck. The fantasy that the &quot;everyman&quot; is this cowboy investor and broker is ridiculous and only makes sense if you define &quot;everyman&quot; as an upper middle class American who has a high-paying job and owns significant investments. Compared to the wealthy, most Americans see no benefit from these global networks of moving money around because they aren&#x27;t rich enough to make the effort and investment worth doing, much less have the  connections necessary to even access them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;money.com&#x2F;stock-ownership-10-percent-richest&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;money.com&#x2F;stock-ownership-10-percent-richest&#x2F;</a>')
