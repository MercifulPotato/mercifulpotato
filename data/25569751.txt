Numerical facilities should not be in the stdlib, they should be <i>in the language</i> itself, without need to &quot;import&quot; anything.  I can create strings and dictionaries without any imports.  I should be able to create a multidimensional array of floats, and perform natural operations with it (like matrix multiplication) without importing anything.<p>As per the dictionaries in Fortran, there are libraries for that.  But I think that not having complex data structures in Fortran is a feature, not a bug.  If you actually need these data structures, many Fortran programmers will tell you to just use a different language.   You&#x27;ll never hear such a plainly honest answer from Python programmers; they&#x27;ll tell you instead to use bizarre libraries with unnatural interfaces, and you&#x27;ll be forced to multiply matrices using a function &quot;numpy.dot&quot; or an ugly operator &quot;@&quot;.')
