So that&#x27;s 25 molecules of gas input -&gt; 34 molecules of gas output.<p>So it seems like more &quot;CO2 + vapor&quot; is created than the number of input O2 molecules. But that only accounts for 34% expansion of the volume of the stroke. (25 mols input -&gt; 34 mols output).<p>The rest of the stroke&#x27;s power comes from the ideal-gas law: higher temperature means higher pressure and larger volume. Literally the heat generated by the chemical reaction.')
