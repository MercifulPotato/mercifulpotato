Blind humans don&#x27;t navigate cities easily, even when cities take them into account. As an example, crossing a street despite tactile surfaces on each side can be a hassle because it&#x27;s difficult to tell if you&#x27;re walking straight or diagonal towards the other end, potentially walking into a car.
