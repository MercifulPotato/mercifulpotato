And every few weeks someone mentions again how something broke, and they need to spend some time fixing it. I think the last one was VMWare not working on a kernel yet.<p>Arch requires more time to maintain, and more manual maintenance. So in order to justify that extra spent time a lot of times they will bring up minor stuff that happens in Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu, like this bug from 12 years ago, in order to justify running Arch, which is more of a &quot;learn Linux&quot; hobby.')
