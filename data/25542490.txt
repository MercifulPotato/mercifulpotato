Think cutting one of your fingers or running off of a cliff, sometimes it&#x27;s intentional but in most cases it&#x27;s likely a mistake.<p>It just seems like such a useless case to treat specially; merging a branch that branched off from the first commit in the repository is equally likely to be a mistake, but the check doesn&#x27;t cover it.
