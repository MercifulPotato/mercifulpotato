Item(by='john-shaffer', descendants=None, kids=[25497628], score=None, time=1608572731, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496968, text='&gt; I wonder whether a naming convention would solve the problem? If all coroutine functions and methods have names like fire-arc* and move* , then your synchronous call to fire-arc* would stick out like a sore thumb.<p>That&#x27;d be fine as long it&#x27;s simple to write a wrapper of a different color. If I change fire-arc to fire-arcSTAR, but I can do a quick (def fire-arc (to-sync fire-arcSTAR)) then I don&#x27;t have to visit call-sites. If it&#x27;s not possible to make a wrapper, then that would be a major pain point.<p>Edit: Can&#x27;t get HN to print the asterisks.')
