Sometimes I wish my stuff broke so I could upgrade it guilt-free, but it just doesn&#x27;t happen.  I have to find some unwilling victim to donate it to so it doesn&#x27;t end up in a landfill.<p>The only thing I own that&#x27;s broken in recent memory is this duvet cover I bought in 2008 that I&#x27;ve used every night since then... it developed some big holes after 13 years and I threw it away.<p>None of my tools, computer parts, furniture, etc. have broken.  I&#x27;ve honestly never even broken a mobile phone, though I have dropped them a couple times.<p>I agree that computers from 10 years ago kind of suck when asked to run modern software.  That&#x27;s not &quot;planned obsolescence&quot;, that&#x27;s more like &quot;software engineers made more complicated stuff more quickly; the downside is that you need a new $300 CPU instead of a decade-old $300 CPU&quot;.  I&#x27;m okay with that.')
