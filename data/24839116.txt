Every other search engine besides Google currently has &lt; 10% of market combined and having literally founded a search engine because of how bad I found Google&#x27;s results I can&#x27;t believe that continued domination is from a quality standpoint. I wholeheartedly believe they do not rank the top results appropriately and that means it actively harms consumers in favor of ads and sponsored results.')
