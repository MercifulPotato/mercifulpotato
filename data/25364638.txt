You can&#x27;t publish child porn.<p>2. You can&#x27;t publish copyrighted work. [EDIT: For which you don&#x27;t have the rights.  I thought that was sufficiently implied.]<p>3. You can&#x27;t defame another person.<p>4. You can&#x27;t threaten someone.<p>5. You can&#x27;t use your speech to invade someone&#x27;s privacy.<p>6. You can&#x27;t use obscenity freely.<p>And this is just freedoms of speech and isn&#x27;t even including the whole controversial money is equal to speech opinion.<p>Freedoms and rights are rarely binary.  There is often a spectrum and there are often complexities regarding where your rights end and mine begin.  All of the above (with maybe the exception of number 6) involve one person using a right to take away someone else&#x27;s rights.  As a society, we have decided to side with that other person in these cases.')
