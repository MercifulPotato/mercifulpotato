The lawsuit is over, essentially, who is responsible for the risk when bids are wasted on fake traffic. The OP is essentially arguing that the entire advertising industry is fraudulent, and that there is no legitimate traffic, which is worlds away from a dispute over how to handle the risk of fraudulent traffic when it does occur.<p>(Again: I work for Google but I don&#x27;t know anything about this case and I&#x27;m speaking only for myself)')
