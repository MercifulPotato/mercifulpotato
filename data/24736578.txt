What do you say to that?<p>I also don&#x27;t like Apple&#x27;s insistence of &quot;only IAP or nothing at all (not even a mention)&quot; but how do you suggest they make profit from the developer side? Or they should not do that at all?<p>It should be 10%? 20? 5%? What will be an acceptable %? Who decides that? What&#x27;s the framework for deciding that?<p>I see one solution, and it&#x27;s far fetched, developers&#x2F;companies should fund and push for an alternative open platform, along with phone&#x2F;device makers. Something that&#x27;s not tightly controlled like iOS and Android. But then they will be losing on iOS. I think they will have a choice to make, consumers as well. Also, it&#x27;s not an easy and short term solution.<p>We gleefully buy Macs, but imagine you buy a Lenovo&#x2F;etc laptop and you are told you can&#x27;t install Linux on this, only Windows. I won&#x27;t be comfortable with that, but I am comfortable with the Mac buy where I Windows can be installed only via Mac (and Linux isn&#x27;t even supported) -  of course there could be work around with lots of circus and you cna live with a broken system.<p>Problem is not the cost. Problem is mono&#x2F;duopoly of walled gardens.')
