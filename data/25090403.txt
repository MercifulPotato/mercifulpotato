E.g. on Big Sur they moved third party kernel extensions to userland ones. That&#x27;s safer, less crash prone (an extension issue doesn&#x27;t bring down the whole system), more modular, makes it possible to upgrade an extension without a reboot, and so on.<p>Check PC forums of pro music users how often they have issues with drivers, incompatibilities, updates, etc.<p>And that&#x27;s not with &quot;switching to a major new architecture&quot; issue, or &quot;moving kernel extensions to userland&quot; type fairs, which are major changes and can understandably bring issues with them (but can be totally worth it long term).<p>It&#x27;s just incompatibilities between the million different hardware combinations you can find in a PC, Windows issues, etc.<p>&gt;<i>Heck every Mac is always on a different update because they are scared to even update in Mac only cooperate networks like mine.</i><p>Actually it has been reported time and again that Macs are among the fastest percentage wise to move to the latest OS version compared to Windows PCs, with something like 70% having moved over in a couple of months...')
