Tech stack? Getting drivers? Getting customers?<p>Uber Eats for example cannot deliver to me, but several others can. Tech stack isn’t that expensive to build. I think it’s easy for programmers to think that the whole world revolves around tech stacks and not see how you can be innovative in getting drivers for example.\nCan’t really say I’m loyal to any platform when it takes less than one min to sign up for another.<p>It’s the same with Amazon which is just the worst shopping experience I’ve ever encountered  and slow deliveries to boot and I’m very happy they have local competition that blows them out the water.')
