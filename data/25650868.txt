Yes, your money is going towards a good cause, but if you accidentally sent the money to the wrong place, you couldn&#x27;t possibly tell. Your donation is never mapped to a specific result. It&#x27;s just added to a much larger pool. You will never get a message saying &quot;your donation paid Paul&#x27;s first month of rent&quot; or something to that effect.<p>By comparison, volunteering at a soup kitchen feels <i>real</i>, regardless of effectiveness. You see the people you help, and I suspect that&#x27;s why people prefer being charitable in less efficient ways.')
