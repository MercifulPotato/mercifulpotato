Yes, that what you described is how boycotting works. It&#x27;s a very common thing. It ranges from civil rights activists boycotting segregated buses to religious conservatives boycotting stores that sell birth control&#x2F;plan B to people using lyft instead of uber because of all the issues at uber. One of my friends refused to buy milk from Oberweis, a dairy company in the Chicago area, because they discriminated against polish immigrants like his grandparents way back when, so his family had decided to boycott them forever. This is not some sort of new concept.')
