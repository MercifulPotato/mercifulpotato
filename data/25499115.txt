Yes, microservices are not a bad idea. They are in fact a great idea and they are needed SOMETIMES. But there is a time and place for everything. They are unnecessary and completely counterproductive and cumbersome unless you have a very large and complex system which needs to be distributed. If that is the case, of course, god speed. But if you can work without them you should not go for a microservice architecture: let&#x27;s face it, they are hard to design, develop and in many cases a nightmare to debug when something goes wrong. Annoyingly the term &quot;microservice&quot; is yet another PR campaign gone horribly wrong. As a consequence it has become a buzzword like blockchain, AI, agile, etc. Just because FAANG is doing it, does not mean that your online shop for selling socks needs microservices in any shape or form.<p>A short while ago a friend dragged me in as a side consultant for one of his clients. He owned a site which is basically craigslist for musical instruments and he was in the process of hiring a company to rebuild and subsequently modernize his site. Realistically the site has around 5k users&#x2F;day tops and no more than a GB of traffc, and a mysql database which over the course of 15 years is less than 50GB. Basically a tiny site. The company he was about to hire had designed an architecture, which involved a large EKS cluster, 15 microservices, mysql, postgeres, elastic, memcache and redis, complicated grpc communication and their claims were that this architecture would make it the best in the business. OK, let&#x27;s give them the benefit of a doubt, I advised him to ask them how much more performance would he gain out of that and if there are any other advantage over the typical vps with a webserver. Their response was &quot;Infinitely more performant, you&#x27;ll be able to scale to 100 million users per day and the system wouldn&#x27;t feel a thing. That is what Google, Facebook and all other large companies are doing&quot;. Yeah... And does he expect to have 100 million users pour in at any point in time? Take a wild guess... Mind you, they asked for the same amount of money for a simple &quot;buy now&quot; website.')
