Yea, you are my boss&#x27;s boss and have a lot more reports, you probably get pulled in a lot more directions than I as an IC. I understand why, as teams and companies grow, things get more distanced. Even Linus over at LTT laments that his new hires never get the same 1:1 time his earlier employees had.<p>But, the topics talked about need to have action take on them. Unless you just don&#x27;t have any power at all, which I can believe. Quarter after quarter at my old company we would mention that the tasks and direction our org were taking weren&#x27;t the best, would lead to problems, and that we weren&#x27;t staffed nor compensated individually enough for the new work and responsibilities being loaded onto us. It fell on deaf ears and when I left we had already had almost a full team leave. Shoot, the whole reason I got that job is because they needed folks so bad they took someone not entirely skilled in that area to pick up the slack. The cycle just kept repeating and here it is, MONTHs later, and I hear the same thing.<p>Suppose grindhouses are good for cutting your teeth at least.')
