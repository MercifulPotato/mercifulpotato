I was excited to complete it (well, the first 3 courses in the roadmap): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;specializations&#x2F;python" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;specializations&#x2F;python</a><p>As a non-programmer but a decent mather, I thought it presented the materials in a way that was easy to understand. In my mid-thirties now, I feel like I could have handled this at 18 just fine--but not in a patronizing way.

I built a few others that were cool but none actually saved me time. Very satisfying! At the end of the 3 courses (~60 hours) and some additional tinkering (~40 hours), I had the skills and that&#x27;s pretty cool.')
