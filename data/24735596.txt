Like, why do you want to pursue the EB-1 route ? I ask because, the way you&#x27;ve phrased the question &quot;satisfy the requirements of EB-1&quot;, I don&#x27;t think you fully understand what it entails. Its not like a driver&#x27;s license you apply at the local DMV - I know how to drive, now give me the license! Its more like - you are making a formal request to the US government. You are then furnishing a <i>ton</i> of documents as proof of your abilities. Even after all that, it&#x27;s still their call. If they turn you down, that&#x27;s fully within their right. And they can always do that - it is their country after all. I was always prepared to return to India if they rejected my application. If they approve, its your privilege. The way I view it - I took a shot &amp; the ball went thru the hoop. Doesn&#x27;t mean everytime I take a shot it will do that. Doesn&#x27;t mean if somebody else takes a shot &amp; it doesn&#x27;t go thru the hoop, they are a worse player. afaik, there is no rule in the constitution that says you have satisfied all the requirements of EB1 so you must get EB1. At best, you can apply, but not appeal.')
