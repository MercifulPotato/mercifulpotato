So far the champ among modern compilers is TCC and Delphi among historical compilers.<p>&gt; Even when running under a Windows 98 VM, Delphi 2 can compile large .pas files at 1.2 million lines per second. TCC comes in at 0.7 million lines per second. This is on a 2.5 GHz Skylake laptop.<p>&gt; All the modern Pascal compilers I could find did very poorly on the same benchmark workloads. Lazarus&#x2F;FreePascal at 55 kloc&#x2F;sec, Embarcadero Delphi at 15 kloc&#x2F;sec.<p>So 1.2 million lines&#x2F;sec, running through a VM, on laptop hardware.')
