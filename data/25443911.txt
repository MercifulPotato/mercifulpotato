When you write a study for publication, or arguably when you report about a study, one of the things you&#x27;re responsible for doing is to define any terms which may otherwise be ambiguous for their usage within the context of the study.  Defining what this one study &#x2F; article means by the word &quot;journalist&quot; is not the same thing as gatekeeping, and it certainly isn&#x27;t some slippery slope of demanding that journalism be a licensed profession.  I haven&#x27;t seen a single comment advocating for that.  What I am consistently seeing is several people asking &quot;For the purposes of this study, what qualifies as a &quot;journalist&quot;.&quot; Which is a very fair question and deserving of a good faith response.')
