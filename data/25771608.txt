(To be precise there is no EU military, just that of all members which makes it fragmented and in many cases is their military isn&#x27;t in the best condition. Also China wouldn&#x27;t declare War as it doesn&#x27;t recognizance Taiwan, i.e. they would instead &quot;use military force to attack rebels and terrorists&quot; or something like that).')
