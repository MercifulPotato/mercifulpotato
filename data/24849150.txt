Antitrust is, at its heart, a tool to subvert the rules because the rules aren&#x27;t fair; left to its own devices, unfettered capitalism is full of positive feedback loops that encourage winner-take-all situations in any case where resources are finite and one set of resources can be spent to acquire another (such as money and attention). Recognizing that doesn&#x27;t make for a good world to live in, we have laws structured so that when you get so big you&#x27;re hurting consumers, the government can step in and break up a company.<p>But the questions of how big is too big, what constitutes &quot;consumer harm,&quot; and how one breaks up a company aren&#x27;t encoded in the law (because the law can&#x27;t predict the evolution of the market itself). Those questions are always going to be obviously &quot;judgement calls&quot; and therefore very political.')
