You can not wear a label everywhere you go with your preferred pronoun, this would lead to people stuffing their bios with all their genes, preferences and believes (eg. gender, race, religion, political view, etc.).<p>The actual problems are:<p>1) People assuming someone&#x27;s gender.<p>2) People getting upset when their gender is incorrectly assumed.<p>3) Not having a well established social protocol to ask someone their gender without one or both of the parties feeling uncomfortable.<p>4) In my opinion it further emphasizes that gender is something really important, that should be mentioned immediately as it changes the way you look at someone. I think the correct progressive way of thinking is to disregard gender entirely and assume everyone is &quot;genderless&quot; unless it actually matters. Does it really matter if he is a he or a she? Does it matter that much if a stranger on the internet uses the wrong pronoun?<p>5) Same issue applies for all other previously mentioned characteristics of an individual (race, religion, political views, etc.).')
