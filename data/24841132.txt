Item(by='x0x0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603220453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24841032, text='Also a hiring manager.<p>If you conceptualize a hire as &quot;this decision costs me $100k to $200k, and six months&quot;, you&#x27;ll understand why folks are conservative.  That&#x27;s my finger in the wind cost of a bad hire, in terms of their salary, the salary and opportunity cost of their first two weeks buddy, plus all the other related efforts to onboard and train.  Plus, again, if it&#x27;s a bad hire, by the time we spend 2 months getting to the termination, and a 2 month search, and a 2 month onboarding, I wait 1&#x2F;2 a year before I get the employee I need.')
