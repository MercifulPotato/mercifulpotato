Twitter, Parler&#x27;s direct competitor, gets away with de-platforming major figures like the President, though they keep the account of the head of Iran, a state that is at this moment on the verge of creating an atomic bomb with the stated purpose of annihilating one of our closest allies.<p>Apple and Google, with control over 99% of the app industry, ganged up and eliminated the Parler app.  When a tiny number of companies collude to destroy the competition, it is known as a &quot;trust&quot;, children. And colluding to destroy a company is known as &quot;racketeering&quot;.<p>The Biden Administration is hiring several people from these companies:  Jessica Hertz of Facebook and Emily Horne of Twitter.<p>It is highly unlikely he will turn around now and push the Justice Dept. to go after these companies.  He&#x27;s glad they banned Trump; it benefited him.  Now he has to pay them back, if he knows what&#x27;s good for him.')
