Let&#x27;s find out.<p>&gt; The Chinese government doesn&#x27;t want such a huge financial entity owned by foreign owners (even though they have claimed they are allowing more foreign entries in financial sectors). Also, China is suffering from dollar shortage&#x2F;flight (foreign manufacturing moving out, foreign retailers moving in), and this IPO could exacerbate it<p>If china is facing &quot;dollar shortage&quot;, then why would they ban foreign money? Wouldn&#x27;t they want more dollars? Also, don&#x27;t people like you claim that china owns us because they own so much of our debt? If so, how can they be experiencing dollar shortage if they own over $1 trillion of US bonds?  Also they are not allowing more &quot;foreign entries&quot; in financial sector but they are allowing more foreign entries in retail? Finally, if you think an IPO is going to affect &quot;dollar shortage&quot; issue, then you haven&#x27;t a clue what you are talking about. What about all the other major tech IPOs, like BABA, which had significant foreign investment. Not to mention all the foreign venture capitalists in china? Why isn&#x27;t china kicking them out? Has china banned foreign investment&#x2F;capital?<p>&gt;  This is a big no no right now, especially since Xi&#x27;s dictatorship is wobbly.<p>I thought he was an &quot;emperor&quot; for life. Now his &quot;dictatorship&quot; is wobbly? Be consistent. What&#x27;s next? You are going to call him a mafia boss?<p>&gt; check out recently delisted Chinese companies in US stock exchanges.<p>Is it misreporting or is it the trade war?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-trade-china-limits-idUSKBN1WC1VP" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-trade-china-limits-id...</a><p>If what you are saying is correct, why isn&#x27;t the other company affiliated with Jack Ma ( BABA ) delisted?<p>&gt; (if you ask me, why would anyone invest in any mafia pyramid scheme with no guarantee you&#x27;ll get your money out...)<p>But you were just complaining that &quot;even though they have claimed they are allowing more foreign entries in financial sectors&quot;.<p>On the one hand, you are whining that the chinese aren&#x27;t allowing more financial entries into their market. And then you claim that it&#x27;s a mafia pyramid scheme that nobody should invest in.  Shouldn&#x27;t you be praising china for keeping &quot;foreign entries&quot; out of their &quot;mafia pyramid scheme&quot;? Once again, be consistent.
