It makes no difference to them otherwise.<p>So who is RH&#x27;s intermediary?<p>I couldn&#x27;t find from a brief google search but I am curious how and why this occurred when it looks like such a bad move for RH. Especially with rumours of them wanting to move for an IPO themselves.<p>1) Something happened here, either they didn&#x27;t have capacity tech wise, which is a legit concern. - I haven&#x27;t heard that being the reason yet.<p>2) Their intermediary blocked their trades, and so they got cucked, can&#x27;t think of a better expression.<p>3) Someone told them to slow that squeeze down - This is probably the most UNLIKELY, but the one that everyone wants to jump to.<p>We might find out why, but really in the end it doesn&#x27;t matter.. WSB and co has proven, the market is as strong as the confidence people give it.<p>Lies propogate when money is involved, shorting +20% is considered risk, +100%.. I&#x27;m sorry but I personally don&#x27;t have sympathy. Infact, I appreciate when it&#x27;s caled out.<p>I&#x27;d rather not bail out any more banks for bad practices that might be legal purely because they haven&#x27;t had a light shone on them.<p>I do worry about the losers in this all though, and it&#x27;s not the people with money. If you&#x27;re in this deep, rent money deep, get out. It&#x27;s a good fight, but there is no unsung hero reward on this one. If you have money, pump that to pluto idk.')
