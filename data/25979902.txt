I went to Rome a couple years ago and this adds a lot to understand what I saw.<p>But there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;d love to see: the filth and life. I want to see horse manure and mud on the streets, urine and faeces pouring from houses, the immense slums that would surround the city but left so few archaeological remains, graffiti on the walls, wear and tear on the streets (like what you can see in Pompei),  the smoke from kitchens, pubs and bakeries, etc.')
