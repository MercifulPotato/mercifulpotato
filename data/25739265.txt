Papers are still being published today about the philosophy of Newtonian mechanics, using it as a gateway and simple test piece for the philosophy of physics or science overall. A common mistake among, I guess you could call them &quot;rookie philosophers of science,&quot; is to look for the grandest examples of the problems they study, and overlook the simplest places where the problem is exhibited. The best philosophy deals with the simplest materials possible, no more than is required to build the case being made.')
