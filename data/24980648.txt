These little things together makes the .NET code run with far less GC pressure and more cache locality like C++ code without making the code non-idiomatic (Yes, A JVM system can be written like QuestDB to achieve similar perf but it won&#x27;t be idiomatic Java code).<p>Then the Kestrel server + new ASP.NET Core runtimes takes advantage of it (for example the new JSON parsing API&#x27;s are built to directly consume byte memory w&#x2F;o sacrificing too much extensibility).')
