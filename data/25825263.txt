To me it is is less about authoritarian versus non-authoritarian as much as competent versus incompetent. Although in Wisconsin&#x27;s case no credits were given to Foxconn (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;madison.com&#x2F;wsj&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;govt-and-politics&#x2F;foxconn-not-expected-to-receive-state-tax-credits-over-next-3-years&#x2F;article_baf42b60-49cb-5816-9e8b-ee7a33ada1e8.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;madison.com&#x2F;wsj&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;govt-and-politics&#x2F;foxconn...</a>), the state did pursue a number of improvements to roads and infrastructure that were not appropriately tied to the agreements with Foxconn. The contract should have clearly required reimbursement (to the state, and by proxy, to affected citizens) if the project were to be canceled. The deal they had forged had bad return on investment and for it to break even would have required an enormous period of time (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reason.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;20&#x2F;wisconsins-foxconn-boondoggle-looks-worse-than-ever&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reason.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;20&#x2F;wisconsins-foxconn-boondoggle-...</a>).<p>Compare this to NYC&#x2F;NY State&#x27;s now-cancelled but well structured deal for Amazon, where they stood to make a 9:1 return on investment, with only $505m in capital outlays for the public, and that itself was tied to a minimum $3b investment from Amazon, with projected new revenue of $28 billion for the city and state over 25 years (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ny.curbed.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;18098589&#x2F;amazon-hq2-nyc-queens-long-island-city-explained" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ny.curbed.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;18098589&#x2F;amazon-hq2-nyc-que...</a>). NY gets a lot of flak for mismanagement on other fronts (for example transit infrastructure) but they were able to select the right incentives, terms, and conditions to create a highly favorable subsidy deal that wouldn&#x27;t have left them high and dry if the company changed direction.<p>My conclusion from all this being - it doesn&#x27;t make sense to demonize either subsidies or eminent domain or whatever else, as much as it does to just demand competence.')
