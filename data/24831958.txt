Now days the devices are personal, you don&#x27;t have to have accounts to be identified.<p>Why would I want every single thing I do online to be directly linked to one physical real world device?<p>It&#x27;s not so much about data loss for me but I don&#x27;t want anything real world linked to me to be used to authenticate me in any way other than monetary transactions or things with tangible physical value.<p>Other than that, I have a range of email addresses and usernames I use depending on the nature of the site and the amount of personal information i&#x27;m willing to disclose.<p>I have a fairly fine grained system for managing my user accounts accross various platforms and i&#x27;m personally finding it more and more aggravating the amount of places that require some kind of google or facebook sign in, let alone the idea that my phone should be my universal user account&#x2F;name.<p>The internet should be like the rest of public life. For the most part, in my day to day life, I get to choose the amount of personally identifiable information I disclose to others. Managing multiple user accounts with differing levels of personal information is the internet equivalent of this.<p>I do not wish to be linked to one &#x27;universal digital me&#x27; my real life interactions are not like that, why should my internet interactions be forced to be that way?<p>I have different groups of friends, acquaintances, coworkers etc. I don&#x27;t act the same way with all of them, I don&#x27;t talk about the same things with all of them, they don&#x27;t all have the same level of information about my life, yet increasingly, online interactions are being pushed into this &#x27;one you for everyone and everything&#x27; paradigm that is completely antithetical to the original values of the early internet and human interaction in general.')
