Not even close. You can update PHP code by just replacing the files, it&#x27;s not compiled. PHP-FPM is just a layer that provides a fastcgi interface and manages processes that run PHP. It&#x27;s super easy to run, super easy to proxy to with Caddy or Nginx or whatever else support fastcgi.<p>Java is compiled, and typically runs its own HTTP server. Python is not compiled, but usually it runs its own HTTP server, or a WSGI server which adds another layer.<p>&gt; Every possible extension baked right into the language as a global function instead of using namespaces and a package manager like other languages.<p>Are you trying to say that global functions are a strength? Namespaces are a big improvement. Many modern PHP extensions provide namespaced classes now, it&#x27;s mainly the older ones that don&#x27;t.')
