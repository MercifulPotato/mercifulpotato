This formula says they&#x27;re nearly 20 years old; I&#x27;d be inclined to say that the &quot;right&quot; answer is more like 15 years, if not less.<p>A 1-year old dog is beyond adolescence but is still maturing, but this formula says they&#x27;re 31 years old, well into adulthood.<p>A 5-year old dog is in the prime of their life; this formula says they&#x27;re 56 years old, well into the range of what we&#x27;d consider a senior.<p>A 30-year old dog would set a new world record. (The oldest dog known was about 29.5 years old.) This formula maps that to 85 years, which is old, but not extraordinarily so.')
