Clearly that is a lower barrier today than it was 20 years ago. Bing, Yandex, Duckduckgo* do as good of a job and in some cases much better as Google hamstrings their results. There are vertical markets where other search engines have been doing a better job for over a decade, such as Indeed. (In which case Google leveraging themselves in to those verticals and destroying those businesses for a few extra dollars in very egregious.)<p>The bigger issue, I believe, is that Google, in its present form in 2020, is not a search engine. It is an ad delivery engine supplemented by organic results which they really do not want users clicking on. The bulk of the searches <i>normal</i> users perform are served ads and those users click on those ads.<p>Really no analogy here close to something like power lines, a sewer system, or roads.')
