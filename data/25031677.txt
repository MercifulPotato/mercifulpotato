They were supposed to stop accepting new ballots, but eh, whatever I guess.<p>&gt; By 4am the D to R ratio was all thrown out of whack. That is because these ballots were not sampled from the real Wisconsin voter population, and they were not randomized in the mail sorting system with the other ballots. They inherently have a different D to R signature...<p>Anyone who knows anything knows Milwaukee (not just as a city but as Wisconsin&#x27;s largest city) votes blue. So as soon as those votes start getting counted the votes will shift blue. You _should_ see this bimodal distribution in vote counts.')
