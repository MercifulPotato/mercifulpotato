I would take an engineer that can compare SQS to Kafka (self-managed vs kinesis), MQQT and RabbitMQ and offer an educated guess on which is better suited on our use case, taking into consideration the context (no of engineers, skillset required, application characteristics, etc.) than someone who&#x27;s going to answer &quot;SQS!&quot; when a service requires a queuing system.')
