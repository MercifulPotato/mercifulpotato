I think they engage in immoral practices and I can&#x27;t in good conscience say I&#x27;m a member. On the other had, I was raised Mormon and my family goes back with the Mormons to the 1830s when the LDS church was founded (technically The Church of Jesus Christ, the original name) so to some degree it&#x27;s a inseparable part of my identity. I try to split the difference in my life, but it gets messy sometimes.')
