But the software does not HAVE to guess the type. If I paste something into Excel, I want what I pasted to be what&#x27;s in Excel. Changing the type and inadvertently affecting the data isn&#x27;t something any data software should do by default. And the fact that OP said they can&#x27;t turn it off means that this is beyond a design mistake, it is a FEATURE. If Excel took itself seriously as a data platform, it would not make a change to any text by default.')
