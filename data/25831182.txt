I&#x27;m all for utilizing Emacs and Vim to do unique things, like ledgers and time tracking, since those are essentially markup formats for text editing. However, crosswords just seems more or less like playing games in Vim. It is cool and all, like I said, but it seems much better suited for at least a semi-interactive text-based CLI app.<p>I applaud the developer regardless, but I personally would be much more keen on using this if it was standalone and not dependent on Emacs.')
