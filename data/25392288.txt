I used to be a free speech fundamentalist, but now I&#x27;m getting more skeptical of that position.  Sort of like how radical Athenian-style direct democracy doesn&#x27;t work, maybe radically giving everyone near-unchecked access to nationwide broadcasting doesn&#x27;t work, either.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not advocating for some kind of universal censorship apparatus, but maybe it&#x27;s would be best if broadcast speech at least passed through some kind of editor (and I mean <i>editor</i>, making editorial decisions, not a censor) to build more <i>judgement</i> into the system.<p>As software engineers, we understand the value of code reviews.  That kind of thing shouldn&#x27;t be anathema.')
