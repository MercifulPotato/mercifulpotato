It is very basic and undisputed science that lower melanin in skin = higher vitamin D absorption. No European educational institution or government wants to publicise research highlighting that ethnic groups indigenous to the northern hemisphere are more suited to the natural environment they are endemic too, and less likely to have vitamin D problems. Of course, the Vitamin D deficiency in people unsuited to non-indigenous European residents will naturally disadvantage them over time in nature.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.longdom.org&#x2F;open-access&#x2F;the-skin-melanin-an-inhibitor-of-vitamind3-biosynthesis-with-special-emphasis-with-structure-of-skin-a-mini-review.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.longdom.org&#x2F;open-access&#x2F;the-skin-melanin-an-inhi...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4272394&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4272394&#x2F;</a><p>To give balance to reinforce that i&#x27;m purely speaking from a scientific-rational viewpoint, in Australia the government is trying to discourage  people from being in the sun at all due to Australia (primarily european ethnic) having one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world, due to also not being suited to their natural environment.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cancer.org.au&#x2F;cancer-information&#x2F;types-of-cancer&#x2F;skin-cancer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cancer.org.au&#x2F;cancer-information&#x2F;types-of-cancer...</a>\n&quot;the incidence of skin cancer is one of the highest in the world, two to three times the rates in Canada, the US and the UK.&quot;<p>The USA approach is quite different though - pills for everyone!
