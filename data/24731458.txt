From right to left, URLs read from least to most specific. Root -&gt; TLD -&gt; domain -&gt; subdomain (eg www). The root domain is almost always left out, because it’s always the same and its presence is implied. But if you include it explicitly, it <i>is</i> a distinct URL.<p>So idk how bloomberg.com works under the hood so I can’t specifically explain this case, but rules that match URLs won’t necessarily see the two versions as identical. This is actually something worth testing your own sites against, to make sure including the root domain doesn’t do something dumb like bypass authentication or whatever.<p>Edit: also, forgive me if I’m explaining things you already know w&#x2F; regard to the root domain and stuff.')
