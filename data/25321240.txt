Walking is my way to detach. I now picked a weird habit of walking at home, inside a room or from room to room. It helps me think and a great break between tasks. My step tracker counts about 6000 steps.\nSo is walking good for me? It definitely is great for my mind. Is it also good for my body, I am sure it is better than doing 12 hrs straight in front of a screen. But I am also sure only running can improve my endurance and decrease my resting heart rate')
