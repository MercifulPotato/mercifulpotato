This is not the normal state of things in policymaking in this extreme form.<p>Also note that values are not as arbitrary as you make them out to. A large part of the history of civilization was in some way about determine which values are good ones to have and which aren&#x27;t.<p>One standard which we honour today are the human rights.<p>Of course you can have a value system which rejects basic human rights, but then I don&#x27;t see a lot of reason to respect people following that value system or make accomodations for them.')
