It couldn&#x27;t keep up with my writing and made a mess of it.<p>Out of curiosity, I tried ziteboard.com (which came up in a search for &quot;online whiteboard&quot;), and it rendered my handwriting perfectly.<p>Here are the results from the two sites:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;nCKMEKE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;nCKMEKE</a><p>I repeated the experiment on my Galaxy Note 8 with its active pen, with similar results on both sites (not included in the images above). Witeboard completely failed, while Ziteboard rendered my handwriting as expected.<p>I also tried conventional touchscreen&#x2F;TrackPoint&#x2F;touchpad input on both devices to make sure it wasn&#x27;t an issue with the active pen, but the results were again the same.<p>As one last test, I connected a mouse to the ThinkPad and tried both sites. Witeboard worked a little better with this pointing device: it mostly kept up but did have a lot of straight lines and sharp angles when I tried to draw scribbly circular patterns. Ziteboard again performed perfectly.<p>I have no affiliation or prior knowledge of either of these sites, I am just reporting my experience in a quick test of each.')
