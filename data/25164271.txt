I was about to dump my iphone next time i had to pick one (and keep my current one for testing), however my laptop is my work computer.<p>I think &quot;stop being part of the ecosystem&quot; isn&#x27;t realistic for many of us. We don&#x27;t want to work on crap hardware, with a crap OS because that would make us unhappy and unproductive (or in my case, would simply not be an option at all).<p>However, we can use this current hardware &#x2F;software to try and build the next generation of tools we would happily be using.
