I get inundated with emails from sellers on AMZN asking&#x2F;suggesting&#x2F;begging for me to review their product.

If they timed it for right at launch before starting anything, maybe I&#x27;d be less irritated, but probably not. Trust me, my talking to my acquaintances carries a lot more weight than a review from some random person on the internet.
