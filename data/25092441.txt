This has the added benefit of allowing us to see which companies might be selling our information to other entities (or which have potentially had data breaches). We&#x27;ve also been able to identify when employees leave a vendor we use and take the mailing list with them. For example, I had several of my clients with a large hosting&#x2F;colo company and created unique account emails for each, e.g. client1.hostingcompany@xxxxxxx.com, client2.hostingcompany@xxxxxxx.com, etc.). When my sales contact left the hosting&#x2F;colo company and joined another unrelated (CRM software) company, whaddya know... each of these truly unique email addresses which had never been used anywhere else suddenly started receiving unsolicited email from the CRM company. \n(2) Spam can be an issue when you use catchalls for several years. Once one of your custom-defined emails finds it way onto a single list, it will suddenly start receiving emails from MANY spammers as the list propagates. This is manageable with filters, but be aware that it carries a bit of time&#x2F;labor cost. \n(3) It is sometimes quite fun (and potentially useful) when a big company asks for your email address on the phone. Let&#x27;s say I am talking to a Seagate support person and they ask for my email address. I tell them &#x27;seagate@xxxxxxx.com&#x27; and there&#x27;s usually a brief pause as they struggle to understand. Sometimes it&#x27;s a bit funny, other times I notice an immediate positive change in their attitude (almost as if they think I am part of some quality control or secret shopper team)\nYMMV.')
