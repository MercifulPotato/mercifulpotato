Those work by virtue of the train&#x27;s wheels and axles creating an electrical connection between the two running rails, and would therefore indeed be likely to be affected by a potentially isolating layer of leaves on the line.<p>Axle counters on the other hand just detect the wheels by other means (usually contactless by magnetic or inductive sensing), so wouldn&#x27;t be affected by the presence of leaves.<p>Again the UK is more susceptible to problems in this regard because it&#x27;s been almost exclusively using track circuits for train detection until comparatively recently â€“ it&#x27;s only in the last two decades that axle counters have started seeing more widespread usage.')
