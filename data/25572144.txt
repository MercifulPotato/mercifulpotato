We Asked Inmates]<p>But what do the workers themselves think?<p>I find Jeremiah Pate in the milking barn, attaching milking machines to the goats&#x27; udders.<p>&quot;This job, how do you feel about it?&quot; I ask him. &quot;A bad thing?

Rather than sitting in your tiny little cell, you get to come out here.&quot;<p>Every man I meet echoes that thought. They aren&#x27;t thinking about what was fair on the outside. They were just thinking about their options in prison, and in that perspective, the farm looked pretty good.')
