At a minimum it&#x27;s more progressive than an income one.<p>What I don&#x27;t like is all the attrition that comes from the government having to put price on things, and mandating liquidity. I also dislike government initiatives that increase the fragility of a society.<p>So, if one gets a proposal that doesn&#x27;t suffer from those problems, I&#x27;m all for it.
