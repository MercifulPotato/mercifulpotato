A policy of allowing the subreddit to be passed on to a new moderator if the previous moderator is gone -- which doesn&#x27;t even remove any existing content -- is eminently reasonable.<p>Blogspot blogs, on the other hand, are primarily about the author&#x27;s content. Destroying that content simply because the author is no longer reachable (e.g. if they have died!) is not a reasonable policy.')
