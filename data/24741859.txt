Managing the “giant floating head CEO” persona on video might make that hard to do, but most others don’t have that issue.<p>“In Nadella&#x27;s case, he believes all those video meetings are merely transactional. The really inspired, creative work happens in casual conversations before and after meetings. Surely, at times, in bars, too.”<p>Or the Teams application isn’t sophisticated enough to allow employees to break down the glass wall and creatively interact with each other within the milieu of the MS microculture.  Or we are just very early in the maturation of this sort of multipoint video technology.<p>Can’t tell whether the CEO or the author made the bar comment.  It leaked from someone’s subconscious.  Perhaps less time with Bill G. and more time with Bill W. is in order.  No mention of opium dens, acid tests or bordellos...wimps.<p>“Stanford economics professor Nicholas Bloom believes working from home is, for many, a ‘productivity disaster.’... His current research is very different: ‘Most of the people I&#x27;ve been interviewing are working in their bedrooms or shared common rooms, with noise from their partners, family or roommates.’”.<p>Any published study based on those interviews might be a valuable read if he sampled approximately.  Research by sound bite is not.  Sounded at first in the press like Bloom was just a “golden Rolodex” academic flogging his one study in the Zeitgeist.<p>Finally, given the author’s continuous mention of being tired after one video meeting, perhaps someone should introduce him to mindfulness exercises or the wonders of caffeine.  Sounds like a cry for help...')
