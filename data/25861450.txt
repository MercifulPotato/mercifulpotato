But it might be that the human brain represents the optimum size and capability possible for a living organism to sustain, based on requirements for energy consumption and evolutionary competitiveness.<p>We know that Neanderthals may have had bigger brains, and may have been pushed to extinction by homo sapiens. A bigger brain will require more food and take longer to develop, potentially putting Neanderthals at an evolutionary disadvantage to humans.<p>Assuming the laws of Physics do not vary throughout the universe and that evolution, if &quot;run more than once&quot; will eventually lead to similar outcomes, that could mean aliens capable of space travel are not significantly more intelligent than us, they&#x27;ve just had longer to develop technology.<p>And given their apparent tendency to crash their spaceships while visiting earth, you might have a reasonable case for &quot;alien idiots&quot;...')
