Item(by='sithadmin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611070322, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25834055, text='IANAL, but my understanding is that including the software package in the product&#x2F;service name this would potentially open your company up to a trademark suit, because it potentiates customer confusion regarding the things that Elastic is complaining about w&#x2F;r&#x2F;t Amazon&#x27;s offerings of Elasticsearch.<p>Personally, I find that thinking about this issue seems more intuitive when imagining tangible physical products. Imagine that Amazon decides to enter the Cookies as a Service market, and starts launching service offerings with names like &#x27;Oreos by Amazon&#x27;. At a glance, would one not assume that this was some sort of collaborative effort between Nabisco and Amazon? I think the average consumer <i>would</i>. And the same probably applies in a situation involving a software product.')
