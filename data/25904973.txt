Fortunately, almost everyone I see in my neighborhood does. I generally feel positively towards my actual neighbors. But based on conversations with friends elsewhere, this is not universally true.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I could ever move to an area that didn&#x27;t have high mask compliance during all this.<p>It&#x27;s like living with someone who doesn&#x27;t think playing with matches is a stupid risk to take. One day the house might burn down. It would be safer to live alone, or with people with similar attitudes to not playing with fire.')
