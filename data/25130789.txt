The first round was quite some years back with Facebook pages beating the restaurants&#x27; own websites. Facebook&#x27;s SEO was so much better than the average  website that many businesses, including restaurants, eventually gave up and just put everything on Facebook.<p>The second round is just starting to happen where I live with a local food delivery startup beginning to beat even the aforementioned FB pages and the official website often being the 3rd or lower link.<p>In terms of what there is to prevent this: Google has a feature where &quot;business owners&quot; can enter an official URL and that gets a pretty nice boost, but that&#x27;s just giving more power to Google, who is already successfully competing with all of the aforementioned parties. Other search engines either don&#x27;t have this feature or do but nobody uses it. Other than that, the only way to combat this is to only ever link to your official site, make it as accessible as possible and try to avoid doing business with a company who is willing to screw you over like that (of course easier said than done).')
