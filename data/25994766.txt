I&#x27;ve found it very easy to keep clean, works really well at increasing the humidity without turning the room into a swamp and I&#x27;ve never had any issues with the wick becoming gross.  I exclusively use RO&#x2F;DI water in the humidifier, never any tap water, so maybe that is helping with a lot of the issues.')
