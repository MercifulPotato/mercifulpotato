It was not drafted overnight, and was not drafted without the consultation of the target of regulation -- in that case, I&#x27;m also sure (but without hard proof as I&#x27;m just nobody) that Ant was one of the companies that the government inquired. So the real question is: Did Ant know about the regulation when it files for IPO, and if so, why didn&#x27;t it disclose it?<p>A second question is: Ant and similar countries have been growing for years and years. Why does the government slam down the regulation in this year? This might not be a legitimate question though, as regulations usually come far behind, so it might be reasonable for the government to act slowly in this case. But still, I believe it&#x27;s about time that some anti-monopoly law fells on head of companies such as Ali and Tencent. They are wayyy more powerful than they appear to be.')
