A team without leaders isn&#x27;t better or worse. It&#x27;s different. When one mode works better, use it. When the other, use the other. When something else, something else.<p>Second, the article shifts back and forth between leadership and management. I just posted to my blog about the difference, with a picture of an apple and an orange. While they overlap, they aren&#x27;t the same. By no means am I suggesting one is better, only that big enough jobs require both.<p>Managers use skills like analysis, planning, record-keeping, and organization on readily measurable things, facts, figures, observable deliverables, and timelines. A successful manager creates compliance. Well-managed teams get the job done.<p>Leaders use skills like listening, vision, support, charisma, and credibility on intangibles, emotions, beliefs, stories, images, and symbols. A successful leader inspires. Well-led teams love their work.<p>Managers work in the system, improving it to meet the values and goals driving it, making it more efficient.<p>Leaders work on systems, adjusting them, leading them to align with values and goals they miss.<p>Managers use incentives—carrots and sticks—based on the outcome desired.<p>Leaders help others do what they already want to but haven&#x27;t figured out how based on attracting and enlisting people whose goals and values align with the team and role.<p>Managers react to the values and goals set by leaders.<p>Leaders are proactive, figuring out what values and goals to prioritize.<p>A manager&#x27;s skills transfer between companies and industries. A manager can succeed without caring about what the team does. Managers get people acting. An effective manager gives people the satisfaction of a job well done.<p>A leader must do what he or she leads others to. A leader believes in the cause. He or she can rarely succeed at leading what he or she doesn&#x27;t care about, but the passion a leader feels for a cause makes the work rewarding and inspiring. An effective leader makes that inspiration infectious.<p>Well-managed, poorly-led teams and people may feel obliged to work hard at something they don&#x27;t care about. They may work for material rewards but not value them. They measure their success by how much they do.\nWell-led, poorly-managed teams and people may feel inspired and passionate but not know what to do. They may feel frustrated with a present inferior to a future vision they aren&#x27;t moving toward. They may lack a meaningful measure of success.<p>Well-led, well-managed teams and people embrace the challenges and use the problems of today to motivate and propel them to a future they love by creating effective strategies and plans and acting effectively. They measure their success by how much they reach their potential.<p>Here&#x27;s my blog post <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshuaspodek.com&#x2F;management-versus-leadership" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joshuaspodek.com&#x2F;management-versus-leadership</a>, but it&#x27;s basically the above.')
