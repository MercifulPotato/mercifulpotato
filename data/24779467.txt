If you want to use intelligence as evidence in a trial then you have to make that evidence available for scrutiny by the defense which is something intelligence agencies almost never want to do.<p>As I understand it (obviously Im not very informed here!) you&#x27;d normally use intelligence to identify suspects, then gather further evidence with which to secure a prosecution so you don&#x27;t have to rely on the original intelligence in court. I believe GCHQ in the UK have in the past gone so far as to abandon a strong cases that hinged on intelligence data so as to not reveal the source of the intelligence.')
