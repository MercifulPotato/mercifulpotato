My generation cares a lot more about facts than the boomer generation which cares a lot more about feelings.<p>That is why when selling to my generation you always want to be upfront with facts and pricing and when selling to older people you want to paint how the product or service are gonna make their lives better and much more about the emotions.<p>My generation is used to being spammed by information since we were small, my parents weren&#x27;t and are much more susceptible to bullshit.')
