I was down that lane too\nand also googled that solution with xrandr on Linux, but at least on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 there is a problem with a nautilus, because it has huge glitches on an emulated xrandr as it is not running on that screen. Also you can&#x27;t drag and drop windows to that screen as well, because window manager does not recognize it as a desktop. But mouse pointer can go there and I was actually able to share it with Deskreen and was able to see mouse pointer moving, but with huge glitches on background. This soulution turned out to be of no use.')
