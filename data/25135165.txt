Item(by='rich_sasha', descendants=None, kids=[25135327, 25135347, 25136268, 25135258, 25135252], score=None, time=1605695187, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25134220, text='This, and similar moans, really misses the point.<p>Employment is a social contract, looking for a compromise between two positions:<p>* Employers want to essentially acquire a good (productive employee) for the best quality &#x2F; price ratio. If a trained monkey could do the job for peanuts, employers would be happy.<p>* Employees, and the society made up of employees, want stability, employment rights etc. as salary work is a backbone of societal stability.<p>Employers will happily pay the lowest amount of salary that will convince someone to work for them - COL being a key consideration. Employees will negotiate on the basis of the value they bring, but in principle, there is no <i>moral</i> obligation for employers to pay a wage that&#x27;s <i>fair</i>, based on the <i>value</i> of the employee work, perhaps above ~subsistence levels.<p>How it works out, we&#x27;ll see. Perhaps societies agree that strong-arming employers to pay equal salaries, regardless of location, will work - that&#x27;s how unions, weekends and paid holidays came to be in the developed world (sorry Americans). But neither is a fundamental human right, and rather a societal contract, negotiated between labour takes and makers.<p>For a different take, should it also be unfair for someone qualified, living in a lower cost-of-living location, to offer their employment to the same company for less? This seems like normal salary negotiation to me.')
