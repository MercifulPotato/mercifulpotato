We’ve implemented a GraphQL gateway to our REST APIs at my company, and IMO it’s been a tremendous waste of time. Tonnes of complexity, performance issues, time writing the server, monitoring problems when calls are no longer to simple endpoints, etc., for almost no tangible gain.<p>Also, a much more minor issue, but when everything is a POST to a single endpoint, debugging network calls in Chrome&#x2F;whatever dev tools is more of a pain in the ass. It’s a lot easy browsing through GET &#x2F;users&#x2F;124, DELETE &#x2F;messages&#x2F;456, etc., and instantly see what’s happening, than having every call be POST &#x2F;graphql, and have to read through all the giant post bodies to figure out what’s going on.<p>IMO GraphQL is no better than all the other multitude of RPC frameworks that everyone eventually realizes are a snake pits of unnecessary complexity when compared to REST. It’s just newer, so people don’t hate it as much YET.')
