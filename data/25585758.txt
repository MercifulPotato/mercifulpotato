We have been making vaccines for a while, we should be able to answer that.<p>Also, how long do we need to wait on P3 before we get the toxicity result?<p>A really rigorous answer is that we need several years because some problems appear very slowly. Yet, we are not waiting those years. We are declaring definitive success with incomplete information. What is very reasonable, because it is very unlikely that those vaccines will have long term toxicity... but then, why are we using that prior, but refuse to use the P2 or early P3 results to make a temporary decision?<p>Why we decided that it was ok to try the vaccine on 10s of thousands in June, but couldn&#x27;t expand that number to 100&#x27;s of thousands on July, or millions by August? The decisions were taken by calgo culting regulations, and caused a lot unnecessary harm.')
