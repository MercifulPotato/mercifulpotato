It failed. Miserably.<p>I gave up and bought a 1-year license to Adobe for $100 for Photoshop and Lightroom.<p>This was one of the few times, where I just could not make it work with open source software.<p>GIMP was just maddening to use. And while Photoshop has its own complexity, at least I was sorta able to understand it.<p>Lightroom was an even better workflow oriented version of Photoshop, for specifically color and lighting correction.<p>Sadly, my 1-year license expired. And I couldn’t justify buying the full version for $1000. Since I don’t think the computer I was installing it on, would even last that long.')
