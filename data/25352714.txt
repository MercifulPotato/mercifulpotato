Otherwise, it is no different than a hobbyist, albeit much more time is dumped on it.<p>In case of streaming, now more people can declare themselves as musicians, since the barrier of publishing has been significantly lowered comparing to physical CDs. But that doesn&#x27;t mean profit would follow.<p>To produce hit music isn&#x27;t easy, and luck is certainly a factor of it.')
