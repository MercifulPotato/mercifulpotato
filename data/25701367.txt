I know a bunch of gun owners too, and the overlap is <i>very</i> substantial.  It&#x27;s all the same people, really.  Obviously not every gun owner is a right wing terrorist, but they all subscribe to the same magazines and subreddits and all imagine the same euphemisms about freedom and protection and self-determinism.<p>&gt; constantly demonizing all gun owners as bad people<p>And see... this sort of defensiveness is why we can&#x27;t solve this.  I know it doesn&#x27;t seem like that to you, but by refusing to call these people out and instead hitting back with statements like that, you are <i>circling the wagons</i> with the terrorists.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to fix this if you won&#x27;t meet the rest of us half way.')
