A cruise ship outbreak is likely to be A) many times more infectious, and B) the countermeasures applied are likely to be many times more intense.<p>For instance, the R_0 of covid on the cruise ship was estimated to be around 15 in a paper published less than 2 weeks later. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7107563&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7107563&#x2F;</a><p>Ultimately, a cruise ship is a bad place to look for estimates on R_0 in more broadly applicable contexts, and trying to calculate R_0 so early, when the number of people actually infected is not well known, is a task doomed to failure.<p>Furthermore, I trust big studies with large confidence intervals done by national laboratories\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwwnc.cdc.gov&#x2F;eid&#x2F;article&#x2F;26&#x2F;7&#x2F;20-0282_article" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwwnc.cdc.gov&#x2F;eid&#x2F;article&#x2F;26&#x2F;7&#x2F;20-0282_article</a>, more than I trust studies done by people whose methods section is &quot;we plugged it into R&quot;.')
