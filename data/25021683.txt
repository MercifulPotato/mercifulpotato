How do you debate with people who don&#x27;t care about facts or reason?</i><p>Your comment about &quot;facts or reason&quot; is sort of odd given your post gives no details concerning what you consider these to be. I mean, I could fill in some but it seems like without you giving a clue as to what you&#x27;re referring to, people can only shout for you or against you.')
