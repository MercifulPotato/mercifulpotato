The suits in the offices of Boeing and FAA wantonly misled and hid data that undermined the safety of a plane which was clearly a bad idea to begin with. If a similar incident is uncovered in the auto industry they should also be held accountable to the same extent. Automakers are constantly forced to recall their cars for faults which are not even deliberate so it looks like that system is at least somewhat working. We cannot excuse Boeing with such whataboutism especially safety is at stake.<p>Flying on an absolute sense is an insane activity. As Louis CK put it, you&#x27;re &quot;sitting on a chair, IN THE SKY!&quot; The only reason we take it for granted is the Stellar safety record (which is even better than cars?). If all you do is just match the safety profile of ground transportation, the optics of the combination of perception and real events would just grind this industry down. In some ways it&#x27;s actually bad for the industry in the long term but these suits and their next quarter bonuses don&#x27;t care about that! Only the public can.')
