Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607503361, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25354905, text='&gt; Who is offering new grads $150k regularly?<p>Google, Amazon (and subsidiaries like Twitch), Microsoft (and subsidiaries like Github), Facebook, Linkedin, Stripe, Square, Lyft, Uber, Snap, Oracle, Apple, Dropbox, Box, Nvidia, Twitter, Slack, Salesforce, ByteDance and a slew of others. And I&#x27;m including only companies that pay out 150K in cash equivalents (cash + annual bonus + liquid stock) in that list.<p>After a promotion, that list probably doubles in size.<p>&gt; What new grad making $150k is going to qualify for a loan on a million dollar house?<p>I don&#x27;t think I ever suggested this. What I did suggest is that someone who graduates at 22 or 23 (and, with the big caveat that they do so with little to no existing debt), gets a 150K starting comp, and has even a modest amount of career growth will be able to save a whole bunch of money in their late twenties.<p>&gt; A SWE in their 20s banking $100k a year? Must be nice.<p>Like I said, its absolutely ridiculous.')
