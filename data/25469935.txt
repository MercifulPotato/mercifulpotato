The US has tons of it. What’s miraculous and wonderful is the capacity for acculturation and assimilation where there’s an exchange of cultural knowledge and character.<p>Obviously forcing social ideas (as academic, theoretical and blatantly activist political as CRT) is bound to be met with anger. But rightly so - diversity training and corporate HR types are insufferable and making them agents of social change is a disaster in the making if you’re trying to be persuasive to people about diversity.')
