For an engineer to respect his manager, you expect the manager to be technically competent and in tune with recent technological developments. But as a manger you are most likely to be bit removed from technological changes given that most of the time is spent in meetings, talking, keeping people engaged etc. A few things I can think of but I don&#x27;t know how effective they could be:<p><pre><code>  * keep reading technical books, well-known&#x2F;reputed engineering blogs with the intent of not understanding everything but atlas to get a gist of the technology changes\n\n  * be engaged and attend some of the technical discussion meetings (not as an enforcer of some decision) but mostly as a keen observer.</code></pre>')
