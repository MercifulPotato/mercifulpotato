For your integer overflow example, you made 2 mistakes already, first is that anything that is expected to be positive should be unsigned integer and secondly, when you parse the string, you fail to check against max integer value.<p>&gt;Unless it&#x27;s unicode of course<p>Then validate unicode, lol. All this stuff has defined rules. Furthermore you design your code not to support unicode, and then someone inputs a name in non ASCII, the request will be rejected, which is a much better issue to have security wise rather than blindly accepting any and all input without validation.<p>&gt;This is provably false though<p>Based on what, an opinion of some programmers? Thats not really &quot;proving&quot; anything. If you want to make a statement that most programmers don&#x27;t understand things like why you should never rely on strlen, Id probably agree.<p>But Im not really concerned with distribution of skill within the modern programmers, I against the assumption that &quot;you should not write stuff in C because its very hard to write safe C code&quot;.')
