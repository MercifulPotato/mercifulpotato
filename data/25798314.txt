Most of the example code that comes out of ms is just downright terrible, and encourages terrible code. They&#x27;re always writing as if you&#x27;re working for Reddit or Facebook scale, not the code 99.99% of their customers should be writing. I downloaded a random git project to load test a signalr app yesterday because for whatever silly compile reason I couldn&#x27;t get the one inside aspnetcore to compile (which is a whole massive problem with &quot;modern&quot; .net in itself, how are we back to DLL hell?).<p>It was hundreds of lines long, didn&#x27;t work properly, and once I&#x27;d culled the crap, pointless, boilerplate was a whole 20 lines.<p>C# really is great, you can write a lot with some really clear, obvious, terse code. But the awful, over-engineered, useless code that seemingly 75% of C# developers write is not, it&#x27;s unreadable crap that adds nothing to performance, massively hinders readability and tarnishes the language.')
