It doesn&#x27;t change how your body fights the virus compared to traditional vaccine methods.<p>(mRNA vaccines have also been undergoing safety tests for years, these ones for covid are the first approved but not because previous&#x2F;ongoing ones were shown to be unsafe.)<p>e.g. info from CDC: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;different-vaccines&#x2F;mrna.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;different...</a>')
