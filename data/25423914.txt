It&#x27;s a quick flight and even a quick train during the day but if you want to spend Saturday and Sunday you&#x27;d have to get up early on Saturday to catch a plane or train which would get you in by noon.<p>Instead you take the Caledonian Sleeper on Friday evening and arrive in the morning in Edinburgh, ready to start the day.<p>Although you won&#x27;t get the absolute best night&#x27;s sleep, if you come prepared (sleeping mask + ear plugs) you&#x27;ll get a very decent night&#x27;s sleep (better than having to wake up early on Saturday).<p>It&#x27;s also fun going to sleep and waking up somewhere different!')
