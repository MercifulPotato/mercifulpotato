The late 2015 MBPs moved a bunch of peripherals off of the USB bus making them harder to use with linux at the time. In the years since, support has been added for all those peripherals.<p>I still use my late 2013 MBP running nixos. That machine was a great piece of hardware at the time and still works fantastically well even today. (Its really sad how terrible most most non-Apple speakers are in laptops).<p>I would buy an M1 Macbook Air if it could run linux and had good power management. (I&#x27;ll say the same about an M1 MBP in the generation where they give up on the touchbar and go back to hardware buttons.)')
