Are the (unaffiliated) Linux developers mad that DigitalOcean makes money via a compute offering? Are the (unaffiliated) Kubernetes developers mad that Microsoft sells their product on Azure?<p>Unaffiliated being a critical part there, because of course Microsoft, AWS, etc contribute back to these projects. But, many, many of the developers on these projects are unaffiliated, often working at smaller companies&#x2F;consultancies with no affiliation to the megacorps that make billions on the software.<p>Yet, I&#x27;ve not once noticed a single instance of aforementioned drama. What makes Docker, MongoDB, etc different? They&#x27;re open source products developed and monetized by singular corporations, not communities or non-profit cross-functional organizations like The Linux Foundation. Its a big corporation slighting a smaller corporation.<p>This may reveal a bias in online discourse, especially on HN; we revere corporations, not people. We want to protect venture-backed Docker, but the individual developers working on, say, Postgres? Less deserving. Peter Eisentraut, Bruce Momjian, and Dave Page are core maintainers of Postgres, all working at a company named EnterpriseDB, who sell managed Postgres offerings. Why doesn&#x27;t anyone complain about AWS screwing over Postgres?<p>Well, there&#x27;s something bigger at play: Its actually, totally alright if megacorps use Linux, Postgres, whatever in this way. Developers enter these projects knowing it&#x27;ll happen, and these projects are healthier than ever. That&#x27;s a beautiful relationship right there! No drama. No one slighted. If these companies give open source back, that&#x27;s great, but I don&#x27;t expect them to (exempting GPL requirements of course), just like no one expects me to contribute every bit of code I write just because I coded it on Ubuntu using vim and linux and gnome and docker and such.<p>With Docker (and similar corporations), someone is slighted; its the company that was also trying to make money on it. And I think that&#x27;s just mismanaged expectations at every level; the company believing they could build an OSS community of users and builders while still extracting profit, the leaders for accepting venture capital, and the users believing a company could solely develop and distribute something as complex as core application containerization or a database.<p>To be clear: I have a lot of respect for Docker continuing to run Hub for free as long as they did. They&#x27;re an awesome company. No qualifications around that; I hope they find success in the market. I just don&#x27;t believe that success will come at the scale and valuation they expect, because they aren&#x27;t selling what customers want to pay for. AWS is.')
