Compare that to the US.<p>The ultimate tragedy (for me) is how countries have ceded their digital lives&#x2F;capabilities to American media companies.\nThere&#x27;s little reason for a South African messaging platform to not survive, given that the average South African only speaks to people in South Africa (those abroad could still use such service).')
