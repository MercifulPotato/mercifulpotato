Item(by='mhh__', descendants=None, kids=[25462164], score=None, time=1608248998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25461255, text='DLSS is game-changingly brilliant if it continues to improve.<p>&quot;DLSS is just [an approximation]&quot; is a common comment, but it&#x27;s bollocks because everything in a modern game engine is an approximation to some underlying phenomenon. Even raytracing is basically a bunch of noise to our eyes before the magic makes it viewable.<p>Is it perfect? Of course not, but being able to fake detail that our eyes don&#x27;t take issue with could be enormously helpful to smaller game studios who can&#x27;t achieve the same results - I&#x27;m specifically thinking of flight simulators which often don&#x27;t run very well, where 60% of the pixels on the screens are effectively filler (Terrain, Clouds etc.)')
