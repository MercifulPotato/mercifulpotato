This article is predicated on the assumption Austria asking Facebook to ban some comment about a greens politician means all such posting are banned from the internet.  Clearly, they aren&#x27;t.  At worst, that comment might be banned from web sites owned companies operating in Europe.  Obviously, there are a lot of web sites out there owned by people who won&#x27;t care what Europe thinks.  If you don&#x27;t like any of them create your own.<p>The &quot;internet&quot; is bigger than one site, or country, or even the EU.  If you doubt that, just ask the MPA how they are going with eliminating links to pirated content from the internet.  If you asked them in a bar, after a few drinks and out of earshot of their paymasters, I reckon there is a good chance you might even hear them say &quot;it isn&#x27;t possible&quot;.  Or you could ask some UK pollie whether they think it&#x27;s possible to prevent kids from seeing hard porn.  I don&#x27;t have to guess their response - they tried, and gave up.')
