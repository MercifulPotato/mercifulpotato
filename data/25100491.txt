There are some benefits to it, however these benefits are starting to get less and less with other IDEs&#x2F;Editors adopting some of the functionality. I now use VS Code with vim keys.<p>So as from my point of view of would highlight the following reasons:<p>- Keyboard, for even a bad typer like myself the vim keys and chords are very efficient.<p>- The not using a mouse is good also, your hands do not move far. \n- Fast<p>- Widely available<p>- Cross platform<p>- I can use it in a SSH session.<p>- When you use it for a while you do build an attachment to it. It might sound strange but I feel good using vim.<p>I think my vim experience has one major benefit also. I have been able to jump from one ide&#x2F;editor to another and if there is support for vim keys then I can navigate and do basic to mid level editing quite efficiently.<p>I like VS Code now, it is consistent, plugins work consistently (one problem with Vim). I would still recommend people to learn vim.')
