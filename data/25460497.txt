These days, I end up attaching `expand` to most API requests, because they&#x27;ve become addicted to overly nested data structures. And for some reason you have to include array brackets within the parameter name, so really it&#x27;s `expand[]`, which is awkward in many contexts. The length of property names has gone up significantly and now often use multiple words separated by underscores, e.g. `statement_descriptor_suffix`, which is also awkward, especially in JavaScript. The docs still mention Sources and Tokens in many cases, without a clear translation to Payment Methods and usually without even mentioning that those concepts are deprecated or outdated.<p>Tangential to that, while the post seems to hint at trying to make a unified and cohesive experience, I can only see that happening for simple one-time payments. Subscriptions and Connect still seem like an afterthought. For the longest time, you could do destination charges for one-time payments but not subscriptions. Additionally, when using subscriptions with Connect, you have to specify the application fee as a percentage, which is painful for us because we want to charge a flat rate, so we have to fudge it with some math using hardcoded values to properly take into account coupons and Stripe&#x27;s fees and we end up having to round to the nearest penny. It&#x27;s just an unnecessarily messy headache. One-time payments are pretty easy with Stripe, the rest seems bolted on.')
