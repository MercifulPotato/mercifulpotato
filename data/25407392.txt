Speed limits are simply a bad idea. A much better idea is speed constraints - roundabouts, speed bumps, chicanes [0] - i.e. actually forcing people to drive slower or else they ruin their cars.<p>how do you constrain speed on a motorway?<p>&gt; The fact that governments default to traffic cameras etc. is proof (revealed preference) that they don&#x27;t actually care about safety and people driving slowly, but what they want most is making their citizens live in fear, punishing them and extracting money from them. This is particularly obvious when there&#x27;s a hidden police &#x2F; traffic control on some section of the road where it&#x27;s obviously safe to drive fast, but it&#x27;s just technically within city limits so it has a low speed limit.<p>In this country (UK) there is this myth that the cameras are money making devices, when during the 2008 crisis they were turned off to save money for some constabularies, this is the same type of argument.')
