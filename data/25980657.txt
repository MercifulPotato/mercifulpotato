Assassin&#x27;s Creed games are often set in places and time periods where they can have the assassin climb on famous landmarks and ancient architectures.<p>Rome was a location you could visit in at least one of the games (I want to say both Assassin&#x27;s Creed 2 and Assassin&#x27;s Creed Brotherhood), and you could even climb the Colosseum itself. So when I saw the video, it instantly made me think of the game.<p>As for the haystack reference, a common trope in Assassin&#x27;s Creed games is to reveal a region you have to find a tall structure and climb to the top. Usually they let you jump off from the very top and fall into something to break your fall, usually a haystack. It&#x27;s super unrealistic but saves you the effort of climbing back down again.<p>You can see the Colosseum climbing in action in this video, although the time period in the game it&#x27;s a ruin already, including the fall into a haystack: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gkHTYydSPks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gkHTYydSPks</a>')
