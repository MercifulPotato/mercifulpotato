This is a fundamental aspect of market dynamics. There is less demand for labor from region A, so the price of that labor (e.g. the wage) is lower.<p>If society deems this undesirable, the government can create polices to try to achieve a different outcome. This would be a complex undertaking. But I imagine there are beneficial options that exist, especially if the goal is to merely reduce or mitigate the harshest aspects of the labor markets. We already do this in many cases. Employment law is a big area of law.')
