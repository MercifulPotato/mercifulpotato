Walmart has a major shareholding stake in Flipkart since a few years now.<p>PayTM is also fully developed and operated in India, but yes, it does have Alibaba backing it. However, it was not at all considered for an app ban. If at all, many cash less policies by government are aimed to help it to move the country to digital payments.<p>No, there are not 20 something messengers. There is one mainly used messenger called WhatsApp.<p>Yes, there were a few Chinese apps &#x2F; chinese owned apps, widely popular. They were PubG, TikTok and UC browser. All of them were fungible, and have been banned.<p>Also, no, Indian Android phones are not &quot;cheap third world phones without Google App Store pre-installed&quot;. A lot of them do come in the 150$-300$ price range, but all of them have fully certified Android, passing VTS. In the 100s of phones I have seen, I haven&#x27;t seen a single such phone.\nThere are some phones (JioPhones) which do exist, but they are built on KaiOS which is a fork of Firefox OS. They obviously don&#x27;t have Play Store installed.<p>Also you have really funny spelling skills.')
