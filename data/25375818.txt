Some areas would look ok (as both views saw the same distant object) and some would be less ok (of objects that are closer).<p>If you have a DSLR take the lens off and put a sheet with holes in front. Just try it.<p>Now as you add more holes you get more and more overlapping images on the same area of the sensor and eventually end up with a blur.<p>This blur is the same blur you see with a single large hole. It&#x27;s just that with a large hole you had infinitely many overlaps!<p>Even cooler, if you happen to arrange the holes in a specific pattern you could capture images with different combinations of perspectives from different holes and you may even undo the overlaps. This is called coded aperture imaging:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulcarlisle.net&#x2F;codedaperture&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulcarlisle.net&#x2F;codedaperture&#x2F;</a><p>This doesn&#x27;t just solve the biggest problem (limited light) of a single hole, but also captures depth information and you can use it for 3d reconstruction, refocusing etc.<p>One final bit, with a warning of a deep rabbit hole:<p>That &quot;infinitely many overlaps&quot; I was talking about happens with lenses too and is essentially a convolution where you convolve the image with itself (actually many different perspectives of itself if I am correct). Which is just the Fourier transform.')
