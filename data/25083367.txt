Item(by='jleach82', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605282050, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25080903, text='I got fed up with Win10 last year and finally switched to a Mint distro.  I run a software development company that works on the MS stack.  I stuck with Mint for six months and finally switched back to Windows.<p>I didn&#x27;t find it particularly difficult to set up.  Some things are much easier (TAP drivers for connecting to multiple VPNs and running side by side remote sessions to difficult workstations across different networks, for instance).  Even setting up a Windows virtual box was no biggie.<p>There&#x27;s two reasons I switched back: 1) lack of consistency across applications is hampering to productivity, and 2) lack of stability in the application&#x2F;tooling is hampering to productivity.<p>I gave myself 6 months to let myself get used to it, and there&#x27;s a great many things I loved about it, but in the end it was less of a hurdle to deal with Win10&#x27;s oddities than it was do deal with various inconsistencies and &quot;usage maintenance&quot; of getting having a suitable, productive workspace across Linux (and yes, I realize a large part of this was due to the fact I essentially run an MS-development shop and therefore have to work with MS tooling, but on the other hand, everyone working in any end-user business scenario has to work with Office documents, etc.)')
