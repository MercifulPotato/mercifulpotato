But ultimately it was Trump&#x27;s decision, and Nethanyahu would have had to live with it had Trump made a different call.<p>Aside, note that nobody even thinks of easing up US sanctions on Cuba again or rejoining that agreement with Cuba. The Democratic party got such a signal from Hispanics last elections it&#x27;s not even on the agenda.')
