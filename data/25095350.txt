That company building hydrofoil cargo ships. Hydrofoils are not new and have been working for half a century in harsh weather conditions. Please look up the Pegasus class ships from the US navy. Technology has changed in the last 50 years which means we can greatly improve efficiency and practicality of foiling ships especially in the world of airfreight.<p>Foiling vessels can be built to handle any weather condition of a buoyancy based ship. And because we&#x27;re at sea for no more than 6 days we have a much greater weather prediction to avoid storm swells compared to a tradition ship who might be at see for more than 30 days and cannot go around the storm.<p>For 99% of the time, the ocean is pretty flat so we can still have 99% on time delivery.<p>LOL, I appreciate your words about vagueness. We have not been specific about how we will achieve our goals, but watch out of the coming months for a lot more details. I do love a good hater, it&#x27;s a promising sign.')
