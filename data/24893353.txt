Fixed radiator, hard connected to a pump. Nothing you can route out of your PC.<p>And historically, bigger case fans have been problematic, those 200mm fans they tried to introduce some years ago. Bad static pressure if I recall correctly?<p>Also, I wouldn&#x27;t call having a radiator and fan inside the PC silly. The case eats a lot of the noise already, it&#x27;s the easy and the common setup, and good AIOs are quiet and cool well. But maybe you just wanted to share a cool big water cooling setup with everything noisy routed into the basement ;)')
