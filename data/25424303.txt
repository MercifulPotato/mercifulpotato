They should evolve, parameter by parameter, as more and more configuration is needed in the original application, until they can be effortlessly lifted to another application. Everytime I&#x27;ve thought: &quot;I&#x27;ll abstract this so I can one day use it elsewhere&quot; it&#x27;s ended in failure--a working but overengineered, complex solution that I&#x27;d rather leave where it is and start afresh rather than reuse.')
