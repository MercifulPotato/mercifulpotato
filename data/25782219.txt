I also have a theory that those that don&#x27;t wear condoms or use protection don&#x27;t wear masks. And that a large percentage of the more religious are less likely to wear masks.<p>There are several buckets of people in those groups and they&#x27;re pretty sizable. Crosses several races and several age groups.<p>EDIT: got some downvotes on this. Probably mentioning words like &quot;race&quot; and &quot;age&quot; which is a no-no for some people.<p>To clarify the intent of my comment - I think in order to provide a better response to a pandemic I think it is important to understand those groups which would be better served with different communications.<p>If you don&#x27;t care about the risk of STDs or an unplanned pregnancy or your faith in God is the primary driver of your health and well-being response, you probably aren&#x27;t going to care as much as others about wearing a mask.<p>I had one young pregnant acquaintance of ours, who lives with her grandmother, tell my wife that she knows she will be ok because of her faith in God. This young woman had at least one large family gathering. She didn&#x27;t quarantine or test before seeing people. Her fiance was actually going to the gym regularly. Her grandmother got covid and luckily she made it.<p>Repeating all the same directives (social distance, mask, wash hands) has clearly NOT worked. Even saying the hospitals are overwhelmed hasn&#x27;t seemed to matter.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can prepare a good response without difficult conversations and an understanding of why people might do what they do and how that perspective developed.<p>And politicians would rather speak vaguely and not make tough calls lest they inflame some of their supporters.')
