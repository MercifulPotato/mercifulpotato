As a remark, this is how LDAP is structured: entries (files) are &quot;tagged&quot; by attributes (directories) and you access them with the same pseudo-paths which are actually conjunctions of filters.<p>I must say honestly i&#x27;m not so fond of using ordered sequences (posix paths) in place of the unordered sets which they should be. I guess my question is really why you wanted to make a fuse fs out of it (versus say some tag-based filtering script like notmuch). (just for fun is surely a valid answer)')
