Or what level of shipping that would be (postal or private). Or if they even ship to my country at all, with so many websites not having a &quot;where do you ship?&quot; FAQ. (Or an &quot;estimate shipping&quot; button)<p>So to find out it&#x27;s $50 plain mail shipping, or worse, they don&#x27;t ship at all and <i>still</i> get a &quot;please come back!&quot; email was very annoying.')
