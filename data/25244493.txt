Make them accessible through a simple website. Games like Eggs[1] used to be my favorite pastimes. Of course, we have moved on to better entertainment, but there&#x27;s still value in these short games, something you can just play for five minutes to take a break from work.<p>I would love to play these games, not just for the nostalgia but being quick, small, and not too addictive. Hopefully, I am not alone.<p>I think, HTML5 would have done the same job, but the number of HTML5 games is surprisingly low in comparison and wesbites are generally ad-infested.<p>[1]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vagenisonline.com&#x2F;flash&#x2F;eggs.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vagenisonline.com&#x2F;flash&#x2F;eggs.html</a>')
