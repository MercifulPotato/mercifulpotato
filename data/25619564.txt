I&#x27;m mostly center left. For the most part I&#x27;m convinced that all politicians are self-serving idiots. \nAll of these criticisms I&#x27;m levelling have come at this administration from both sides.<p>If there&#x27;s any blinders, its the fawning treatment he received form the press for largely doing nothing or worse than nothing.  Notice how much more criticism has come at him from the left since leaving office.<p>He&#x27;s an adored president with an abysmal legacy. I voted for him, by the way.  I&#x27;m vocal with the criticism because I feel I share in the responsibility for what happened.<p>&gt; Huh.. and you&#x27;re asserting that Obama didn&#x27;t continue that policy? Sorry but Iraq didn&#x27;t turn to a peaceful and solved problem in 2008.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that it was, but we and our allies already had troops committed in the region. If we&#x27;d left, we would have been leaving our allies holding the bag.<p>I was comparing Iraq to Libya, where after we removed Gaddafi, we didn&#x27;t do shit.  That situation created all of those other things that I mentioned.')
