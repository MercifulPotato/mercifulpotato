They are just nice-to-haves. Really low priority among my “Ways to Spend&#x2F;Waste My Money”, more like “Doodads I Might Buy One Day If I Have Waaay Too Much Money”.<p>Establishing this list at least ultimately caps how much money I’ll waste in a certain kind of things. In contrast, I’m unable to establish such a list about books and video games. At this point I don’t even know how much money I’ve spent buying my hundreds of books and hundreds of games (although “fortunately”, the vast majority of them were bought at heavy discount).')
