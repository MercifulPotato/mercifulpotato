Item(by='badsectoracula', descendants=None, kids=[25974086, 25974432], score=None, time=1612048750, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25973925, text='&gt;  The &quot;Wayland Way&quot; is for the compoisitor to relay information (monitor-reported scale, etc) to the client, and have the client figure out how to scale itself correctly.<p>FWIW this is also the &quot;Xorg Way&quot; (RandR provides all the necessary information), it is just that clients do not bother.<p>Ideally the window manager would use the information provided by RandR to set up default scale levels for each monitor and then send notifications to the applications whenever the window changes monitor to alter their scale levels (this would also allow for custom per-window scale level that is applied on top of the per-monitor scale level in case someone wants to scale up&#x2F;down a specific window - e.g. scaling up some notepad-like editor for a screencast).<p>This does require each client (and toolkit) to support arbitrary scaling... and window managers to agree on such a message, though i do remember an email about this topic being posted on Xorg mailing list some time ago. AFAIK Qt should already provide the necessary functionality for this.')
