If it isn&#x27;t mentioned, it is assumed it includes VAT. They don&#x27;t get away with &quot;oh sorry, forgot to mention VAT&quot; at checkout.<p>Contrast that to every time I buy something from USA its like &quot;oh, you gotta pay your duties&quot; <i>bwam extra ~20+% on price</i>, and all prices in online discussions which are US-centric (e.g. comparisons on products such as recently Airpods Max) do not include tax (whatever you want to call it).<p>Different VAT throughout EU can be annoying though. Price comparisons within EU, for example. Regularly, Amazon Germany seems cheap or cheaper than Amazon Netherlands. With Prime, shipping is free either way, so sounds good, right? Until you go to checkout, they figure you really do want to ship to The Netherlands (my default and only address whilst logged in, go figure) and <i>bwam price adjusted without being mentioned</i>. Though that might be an Amazon specific issue.')
