From what I can gather, git&#x27;s storage engine uses conventional compression (zlib), deduplication (exactly identical files need not be stored twice) and delta compression (between similar files).<p>The question was <i>does git&#x27;s implementation store - in full - every version of a tracked file?</i> The answer is that it doesn&#x27;t. git has a sophisticated storage engine precisely to avoid the inefficiencies of the naive approach.')
