You, and many people, are likely able to manage that yourselves.  Some people can&#x27;t.  They may already be poor and behind on their bills, so they&#x27;ll put that 3% towards fixing the transmission in their car that hasn&#x27;t worked for 3 months.  They might be an entrepreneur with a poor sense of risk, that empties that money to start an underwater basket weaving college.  Or they might just be bad for money.<p>If we let people manage that themselves, what do we do when someone has to retire because of medical issues, but can&#x27;t afford health insurance or the medical care they need?  Do we just let them die?  If we treat them, then everyone is subsidizing their healthcare, at which point you&#x27;re investing 3%, but you&#x27;re also paying a 1% tax to help cover all the people that didn&#x27;t invest their 3%.  At a certain point, the most sensible thing is just to not save your 3% and join the people the government takes care of.  At some critical mass, we&#x27;re just back to Medicare.<p>Of course, if we&#x27;re willing to tell people &quot;You should have saved money, we&#x27;re not going to help you.  Please die close to the graveyard to make our lives easier.&quot; then that arithmetic changes dramatically, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a world I care to live in.')
