Item(by='jrek', descendants=None, kids=[25147181], score=None, time=1605759588, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25146051, text='In what way is apple any more &#x27;abusive&#x27; than microsoft, sony, or nintendo are? What difference does it make, legally, whether the iDevices are &#x27;portable computers&#x27; or not? Why shouldn&#x27;t a private business be allowed to control what third party software it allows on its platform? There&#x27;s no misrepresentation to the customer, and the customer has other options if they aren&#x27;t happy with it. Naturally the developers want to keep more money (motivated by the same fundamental drive - greed), but again, if they consider it uncommercial they don&#x27;t have to release anything on ios and develop for android only.<p>Obviously they don&#x27;t, because they won&#x27;t make any money - but it&#x27;s disingenuous to pretend that apple&#x27;s dominance of the mobile application market and its ability to produce the best consumer hardware and software is a fact distinct from the way it has structured its business and revenue. Developers benefit from apple&#x27;s strengths and relation with its customers. It&#x27;s a fantasy to pretend that disruption to the model will simply rearrange the bottom line without doing structural damage to the entire endeavor.')
