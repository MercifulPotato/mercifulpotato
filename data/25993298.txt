Think of us as Bloomberg for Medicine (or Quandl&#x2F;Quantconnect for medicine). We ingest and analyze huge amounts of medical data (right now: focusing on radiology), structure it in a database and allow researchers from around the world to safely access it.<p>We are a startup of 4 cofounders, including ex-Apple&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Ericsson&#x2F;Xilinx&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Salesforce people with a Stanford radiology expert in the cofounding team. We came out of the Stanford Ignite program, and were in the YC Winter 2020 batch. We&#x27;re backed by Blumberg Capital, Y Combinator, nina.capital, Alchemist Accelerator, and several prominent angels from the medical industry.<p>Our core product is a Segmed Insight web platform for dataset building, along with our CLI product for data ingesting.<p>The current team size: 12<p>*Open roles*:<p>- Full-stack engineer, data pipeline (Golang&#x2F;Postgres&#x2F;AWS) -- You will join our team and get an opportunity to work on refactoring &#x2F; improving &#x2F; scaling our ETL pipeline, where millions of DICOM files need to be unified, organized in the cloud, and exposed in a safe way to the research community. We have a prototype of a search engine running on top of it, and there&#x27;s a huge opportunity to learn more about scalability here.<p>- Full-stack engineer, web platform (Golang&#x2F;PostgreSQL&#x2F;Javascript) -- You will be taking a feature request from our users&#x2F;customers and developing it from A to Z, and shipping it to our backend&#x2F;web platform. We have an early version of our webapp up and running, and you&#x27;ll be responsible for making it fast and usable. The team has a pretty good usability sense and we&#x27;re working with a great UX&#x2F;UI expert. We use React.JS for the exiting frontend.<p>- Sales person: you will spend time lining up more data partners (hospitals&#x2F;medical imaging clinics) and customers (AI companies). You will help with outreach, taking introductory calls, pitching our products and interacting with customers on a daily basis.<p>Send resumes to me: wkoszek@segmed.ai\nMore info: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.segmed.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.segmed.ai</a>')
