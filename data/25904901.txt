However, many individual cities are either unwilling or unable to actually build and designate housing for the unhoused.<p>The fact that San Francisco spends so much and is largely ineffective at solving this issue might imply that cities are not, in fact, suitably equipped to tackle this issue (even if well funded and motivated), and that instead a group which can centralize planning, concentrate resources and expertise, and deploy them where they are currently needed would do better.')
