Incest-shaming is not a desirable property of our society.<p>Its laughable that you think they&#x27;re crusading against consensual incest and that they don&#x27;t mean sexual abuse of minors by their parents. Then again, given the rest of the comments in this chain, I&#x27;m not surprised.<p>&gt; Mozilla&#x27;s mismanagement of funds and overpayment of executive staff is objective.<p>Compensation is always subjective. What one organization feels is supremely generous compensation is viewed by another as hiring that executive at an absolute steal.<p>&gt; I also don&#x27;t appreciate your tone.<p>Let me guess, you&#x27;re used to people who defer to your opinion.')
