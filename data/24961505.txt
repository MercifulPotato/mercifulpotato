High profits attract competition; competitors look at the price of the output and the prices of the input and see that they can do better by building something cheaper. This competition drives efficiency and reduces prices.<p>Whether competition is banned, or improvements are banned, or prices are exogenously set, it&#x27;s all approximately equivalent to mucking with price as information.')
