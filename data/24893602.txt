Using something like `readFile` without carefully exhausting it is absolutely a mistake in a long lived application or a high volume web server, and in a setting like that reaching for that kind of an interface and hoping future modifications preserve the &quot;reads to exhaustion in reasonable time&quot; is questionable at best.<p>On the other hand, in a program that handles a small number of files and doesn&#x27;t live long after file access anyway (say a small script to do grab a couple things, crunch a few numbers, and throw the result at pandoc), there&#x27;s nothing wrong with lazy IO and it can be quite convenient.')
