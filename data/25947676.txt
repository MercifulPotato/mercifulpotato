No one racing to buy GME is doing so because a genuine desire to receive dividends, exercise voting power over corporate governance, etc...  They&#x27;re doing it because they read on wallstreetbets that a magical &quot;short call&quot; was coming tomorrow which would spike the stock.<p>That&#x27;s a SCAM.  It&#x27;s not going to happen that way.  The owners of all those early shorts have already settled their positions (and, yes, lost a lot of money in the process) and all you&#x27;re seeing now is a tulip-style pump and dump.<p>You got scammed.  You&#x27;re not a hero.  Robinhood might well not be acting in your best interests but they almost certainly saved you money.')
