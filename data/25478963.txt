Making a privacy setting default to private but still allowing the user to change it leaves the user in control. Apple isn&#x27;t forcing the customer to do anything.<p>Facebook objects to this because nobody <i>wants</i> to be tracked, so nobody is going to turn it back on. But doing something by default that nearly every user <i>wants</i> while giving the 0.0% of users who don&#x27;t want that the option to do it the other way is not monopolizing anything.<p>Compare this to the app store where they&#x27;re actually restricting what the user can do by prohibiting competing stores.')
