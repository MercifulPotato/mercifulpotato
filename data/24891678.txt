With Windows using nearly 2 GB on boot and a chunk being used for the GPU, that doesn&#x27;t leave much for applications.  Having a non-upgradable CPU is not a huge issue in my opinion, except the performance of low end models is astoundingly abysmal.  I doubt that many of them could keep up with my 8 year old desktop, which was not a high end build at the time.  Not only is the hardware disposable, in many cases it is intended to have a very short life.')
