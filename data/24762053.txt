The entire trick, as presented, turns typing into an adhoc shorthand.</i><p>Yes, and I in fact said the same thing in the post you&#x27;re replying to.<p>Typing competitions have existed for far longer than personal computers, and the value of typing fast was being able to produce a complete typewritten document. Steno machines coexisted, and had their own competitions, so the parameters of these things were set before it became possible to &#x27;reconstitute&#x27; stenography into full text on an automatic basis.<p>All games have rules, and they&#x27;re always somewhat-to-completely arbitrary. An &quot;open category&quot; would reduce to whomever can talk fastest, since text transcription is a basically solved problem and the sound sample can be slowed until it&#x27;s in the pocket for the transcribing software to work on it. Steve Woodmore can articulate 637 words per minute: no one is touching that with their fingers.')
