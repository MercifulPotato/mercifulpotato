The JavaScript standard has a function called setTimeout which asks the browser to call a JavaScript function some number of milliseconds later. Chromium uses timers (mostly WaitForSingleObject with timeouts rather than Sleep) to implement this and other functionality. This often requires raising the timer interrupt frequency.<p>Why does it require that? Timeouts should normally be on the order of minutes. Why does Chrome need timer interrupts to happen many times per second?')
