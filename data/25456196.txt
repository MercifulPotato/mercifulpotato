FWIW, it looks like Heroku is using Kubernetes these days. It&#x27;s a platform built on a platform.<p>If you want open platforms we can talk about cloud foundry. If a base image or buildpack has a vulnerability there is a process to update it and rebuild the containers for the running application without and app dev ever needing to know about or deal with it. This is considered a feature.<p>The idea is to look at the architecture, concerns, and how to handle different roles with different needs at different layers of the concerns.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to hold up Heroku or Cloud Foundry as some amazing thing. Just that you can have an architecture that solves for these problems with containers.')
