It doesn&#x27;t go far enough. This isn&#x27;t social credit. It&#x27;s life credit or maybe existence credit.<p>You&#x27;re gaining or losing credit from merely the way you exist or live. It&#x27;s essentially a hidden tax on life itself and everything you do.<p>Every thought, belief, action, piece of information you read, media you consume, basically every single thing you do will have some kind of value placed on it.<p>In my opinion, this goes far beyond social credit.')
