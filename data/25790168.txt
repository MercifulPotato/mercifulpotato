When you said,<p>&gt; <i>In the days of the Amiga or the Archimedes, it was quite possible to boot entire app or os&#x2F;app combo and just leave the computer on indefinitely, without it crashing itself even if untouched.</i><p>You&#x27;ve mixed up reliability with understandably &amp; maintainability. In an uptime competition, a retrocomputer will lose the game to many modern computers, it&#x27;s almost guaranteed. But it&#x27;s not the point. The point is what happens after it&#x27;s down. If it&#x27;s a retrocomputer, it&#x27;s possible for a single person to understand every aspect of the computer and to perform troubleshooting down to the component level. It&#x27;s also easy for a single hobbyist to build one&#x27;s own computer using the 6502 chip. But it&#x27;s usually impractical or impossible on modern hardware. My personal understanding on the thesis of the talk is that modern computers have much less understandably &amp; maintainability than retrocomputers, and this, in the long term, makes the civilization as a whole, less reliable. It&#x27;s not a question of how durable we can make a single computer to be.<p>You can make a better argument if you stop saying how reliable retrocomputers are and focusing on understandably and complexity.')
