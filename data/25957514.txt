Facial Recognition software is not free.<p>The basic steps to stop these issues are<p>1. (The local authority) mandates that all contracts with vendors indicate that they do not perform facial recognition services for the police\n2. (The local authority&#x27;s) lawyers sign off on vendor contracts ( already happens )\n3. The auditors verify that no one is paying&#x2F;expensing a facial recognition vendor.<p>Generally, working around your employers legal&#x2F;audit mechanisms is grounds for termination.  If the problem is data sharing with partner agencies... then the local authority needs a privacy law on criminal evidence that could be used for facial recognition.')
