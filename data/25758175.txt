It used to be that many Usenet groups had problems every fall when new college students would discover Usenet after getting internet access for the first time at their university. In general this meant posts that went against the norms of many groups. It would usually straighten itself out after a few months, but in general, September was a rougher month.<p>Then, sometime in the mid 90’s (maybe 95?), AOL gave its users access to Usenet. This meant a steady flow of new users who didn’t adhere to norms of the newsgroups. Therefore, the Eternal September.<p>Same concern now as it seems like everyone is discovering Signal. I’m not sure how much I agree as signal is primarily small group chats where norms can be better enforced.')
