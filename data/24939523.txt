See &quot;Misogyny was par for the course&quot;. I understand that&#x27;s not what you are getting at specifically, but the whole point is that just because it&#x27;s been acceptable before doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s right.<p>&gt; We don&#x27;t all agree on the new rules, and CoCs are a method of making everyone follow them.<p>Exactly! The intent is to cause a change in behavior, and that&#x27;s not going to happen if <i>everybody</i> has to sign off on it. Most people don&#x27;t like having to change their behavior.<p>Again, CoC enforcement is not without its flaws, and policing interpersonal interaction is never going to be a hard and fast thing. But CoCs give everyone tools to nudge behavior away from what is objectively causing (subjective) distress.')
