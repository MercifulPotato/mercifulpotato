In it they stated:\n&quot;...we have access to the [community] website\nagain. It can be found at[New URL]&quot;<p>My question is: Why would they change their URL because they &quot;lost access&quot; to their website. The site its self is still hosted in the same place (squarespace, same IP address and everything) and nothing has changed only the URL. What do you think the story is here?')
