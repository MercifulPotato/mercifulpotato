Both provide similar and really good security compared to popular authentication mechanisms like static password, sms, and even authenticator apps.<p>But a sophisticated attack could still use your credentials if the yubikey was stolen, and the attacker had your fingerprint (plausible with the OPM personal info leak) or had captured your pin (maybe from a keylogger installed on a compromised device you had used).<p>It seems like the most secure method (albeit impractical) would be to have a &quot;what you know&quot; challenge built into the yubikey, like a pin pad or dial.  At that point though, one would probably have to worry about other attacks, like physical intrusion and kidnapping as well.')
