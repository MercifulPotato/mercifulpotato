Vacant land has little value in that sense until it&#x27;s improved. You can&#x27;t separate the land value from the investment in the improvements made that actually generate income. It&#x27;s not quite that simple because a vacant lot in a trendy area has more potential value than a lot in a run-down area. But only because of the improvements on other nearby properties. That&#x27;s what makes the land valuable -- not anything intrinsic about the land itself.')
