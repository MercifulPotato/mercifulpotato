That copying could perhaps be extended to strings in some limited way, but I agree it is generally much more limited.<p>Not needing superuser&#x2F;any special capability is also nice, though.  Not sure of the current status&#x2F;plans, but I am pretty sure eBPF needed root that for a very long time.<p>Anyway, I was not trying to &quot;compete&quot; with you or try to &quot;get into mainline&quot;.  A module works fine for me.  Was just exhibiting an easy possibility about some points discussed.<p>EDIT: and thanks for the pointer.  I will check it out.<p>EDIT2: and much like the word copy is a fake syscall, other fake syscalls like a &quot;value test&quot; could be added to forge a sort of if condition jump forward thing.  My little repo there is more a proof of concept than anything else.')
