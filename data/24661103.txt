Easy to argue about the details, because the author is describing what they&#x27;ve discovered or bumped into, not what they&#x27;ve studied.  But I still think its a nice intro that may make other programmers think.<p>The article could explore open-addressing in hash-tables, and it could explore a switch statement for the vowels.<p>Tangent: I&#x27;ve often wondered where the double-hashing tables are, and whether they could use the high and low bits of a single hash rather than the low bits of two hashes...?')
