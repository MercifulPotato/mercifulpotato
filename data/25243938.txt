The ip connection on a device is a gateway towards a service, and the telecoms want to be providers of services, and the differentiator from competitors is having better and different services.<p>In my opinion the biggest fear of those business development teams is to be treated as or thought of just as providing internet on a device. As being just the pipe is not considered a lucrative market, and open to lots of competition where the race is to the bottom on price. This is also where you get lots of the anti-competitive behaviors, like not investing the effort to make a competitors service optimal within a network, as the carriers would rather launch their own service instead of making someone elses service they don&#x27;t generate revenue off of work great.<p>To be fair, in the older gen access technologies, all internet access isn&#x27;t equal. The access network was optimized for the usage patterns of a mobile browser, in the way it scheduled and idled the radio (I&#x27;m glossing over a large number of details). So connecting a computer via tethering that behaves differently and is far more chatty on the network, is actually a much costlier device to support. The current gen techs like LTE do operate much differently, to support chatty devices and apps. With a better optimized network and devices loaded with chatty apps, this difference is probably disappearing.<p>So if you put yourself in the shoes of a business dev person at a wireless carrier. They&#x27;ll look at this and say, well we can have a $40 plan for just internet access. Or we can have a $35 plan for just mobile browsing, since that&#x27;s more efficient and allows us to be more competitive when using the phones browser, and a $15 add on for tethering for those who want it and cost the company more. There are entire teams dedicated to just figuring this stuff out.<p>And this leads to some of the stuff I would get thrown from time to time, like the $60k bills (no longer allowed in canada, a rule was created to prevent surprise bills, but used to be a thing) when someone bought unlimited mobile browser for $7, and thought that meant unlimited usage for their tethered computer and started torrenting all day which was pay per use.<p>An unlimited $7 plan only works in the context of the way a user can use a mobile browser, and that&#x27;s why the carriers think they can dictate how you use the internet connection. They have departments to tailor make plans that only work if they&#x27;re able to dictate how the internet is used.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I agree or disagree with this model, I&#x27;m just trying to explain where I believe this perspective comes from based on my experience. I&#x27;ve been out of the industry several years now, and my opinions are my own.')
