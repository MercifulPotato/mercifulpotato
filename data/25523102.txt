It may be expressed as such, but Crichton was talking about the habits of readers.<p>Determining whether a source is trustworthy is an ongoing process: you&#x27;re seeing one portion where you have some expertise or evidence and then another portion where you don&#x27;t. You have to extrapolate from what you can validate to whether what you can&#x27;t is valid.<p>The complaint behind Gell-Mann amnesia is that we&#x27;re too quick to dismiss clear evidence that a source is untrustworthy, that we have a bias towards trust.<p>To put it in perspective, let&#x27;s imagine the opposite, call it Crank Awareness. If you see a document and it&#x27;s laid out poorly, uses weird boldface, all caps, colors and blinking text, you&#x27;ll, at the very least, get the impression it&#x27;s written by a crank before you even start reading.<p>&gt; But believing they are always bad is the same logical fallacy as believing they are always good.<p>Again, this comes back to the problem of strict logical reasoning vs. treating trust as a larger process. We have limited resources to evaluate sources, so we&#x27;re stuck making fallacious generalizations when we need to make a decision based on our sources. What we want in the long run is to incentivize authors to exercise care and diligence.<p>That would indicate we should punish known bad information by deprecating the authors. So another way of reading Gell-Mann amnesia is that readers aren&#x27;t doing this. They&#x27;re seeing stuff that they know is wrong and continuing to patronize the publications regardless, thus authors can be untrustworthy and still collect a paycheck.')
