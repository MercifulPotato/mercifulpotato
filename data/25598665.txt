If we assume the market is efficiently pricing these assets (like AirBnB&#x27;s IPO) then it could very well be that the actual value of a fiat dollar has dropped dramatically -- making sky-high valuations more reasonable<p>To me, the most reasonable interpretation of these valuations is a savings glut. People are being given extra income, but instead of going out and spending it on more impulse purchases (such as fine dining or an exotic vacation), they&#x27;re shoveling that into savings accounts. And assets that reflect a long-term saving mindset--real estate, stocks--are going up in price, while more immediate consumptive assets (e.g., food) are staying stable.<p>&gt; wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see the price of things like groceries, beer and travel double or triple what they were in 2019.<p>That would be an effective inflation rate of 100-200%. If you&#x27;re assuming that would happen within a year, the number of countries right now with that high of an inflation rate is 3: Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Iran. Even the developing world doesn&#x27;t regularly see inflation quite that high, you&#x27;d expect more like 10-30% annual inflation for those countries.')
