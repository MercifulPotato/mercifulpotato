The entire Vive PC VR era was a complete false start and had no chance of ever becoming mainstream. Every time I demoed it to people who were totally floored they completely lost interest in buying it the second I told them it needed a tower PC.<p>Oculus Quest (just looking at the hardware) may as well by the first VR headset because it’s the first that is both feature complete with full head and hand presence and doesn’t have to be tethered to another bulky system and doesn’t cost $1000+ to get started.<p>First time I demoed quest to a friend he had ordered one off Amazon 2 minutes seconds after taking it off and him demoing it to his family and friends sold 4 more.')
