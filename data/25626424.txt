Perhaps all the diamond ring money would have gone into other things.<p>It&#x27;s a hard point to prove or disprove, but even if advertising overall deceases the consumer saving rate, sure the vast majority of advertising cancels out.

And it&#x27;s rather an embarrassment to Capitalism for the primary non-price information exchanged by market actors to be bullshit noise, even if it isn&#x27;t a &quot;real problem&quot; compared to global warming or something.')
