In the &quot;Maslow&#x27;s pyramid of government-related needs&quot;, the doxxing is near the top. People are much more worried with stuff like not dying to covid, not being kidnapped, not dying in traffic, paying the dreaded Boletos (bills), etc. Internet doxxing is dwarfed by the more urgent needs. Brazilians are also sure that exactly zero things are going to be done about these leaks. Some government representative is going to say &quot;we&#x27;re going to investigate&quot; and that&#x27;s as much as we&#x27;re going to get.<p>I would love to be wrong here, by the way.')
