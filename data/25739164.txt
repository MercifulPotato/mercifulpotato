Hardly a landmark or anything, but the characters actually have character, the plotline has sufficient depth to actually pay attention to (though by no means amazing), and perhaps most importantly of all, it <i>doesn&#x27;t try to stop you from playing the fucking game</i> because it has a narrative to tell -- a feat accomplished very rarely in non-sandbox games..<p>TBC, it physically stops you from playing, but it&#x27;s told in small enough bursts with sufficiently fast text rendering&#x2F;animations that it doesn&#x27;t <i>feel</i> like a real interruption; where most games will happily sit you through unskippable cutscenes and long monologues because gameplay is largely the means to reach the next narrative checkpoint')
