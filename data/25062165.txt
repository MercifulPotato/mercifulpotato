Growing up, we all subconsciously build mental models of the minds of others that help us interpret the motivations behind the actions of others and anticipate future actions.  For many women, their fathers play a dominant part in their modelling of the minds of men that help them sort out situations where there&#x27;s conflicting information.  This is clearly a generalization, but my experiences are close enough to what I&#x27;ve read.<p>I&#x27;ve had one girlfriend who was essentially abandoned by her father and another whose father was essentially indifferent to her emotional well being or success in life.  It was pretty obvious that at least for both of them, they always had a nagging feeling that I seemed to love and support them, but maybe it was just a charade.  After noticing the connection, I actively sought out women with supportive fathers who clearly cared for their daughters.<p>My father-in-law is strict, but unquestionably supportive of my wife.  My wife talks to her dad on the phone at least 5 times per week.  When we were first dating, I consciously asked my wife about her father and watched her body language and listened to the way she talked about him.<p>Even early in our dating, my wife was far more likely to have a charitable interpretation of my actions&#x2F;motivations vs. my ex-girlfriends whose fathers showed little evidence of caring.  On the other hand, my wife still calls me 2-3 times per day at work, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for her subconsciously believing I genuinely have an altruistic interest in her well being.')
