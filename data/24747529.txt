The following WHO write-up provides a full breakdown by category. [1] The 30-60K number is scaremongering. The UNSCEAR report is about 600 pages and took 20 years to compile, and included 8 intergovernmental organizations and all the local affected governments.<p>&quot;Alongside radiation-induced deaths and diseases, the report labels the mental health impact of Chernobyl as &#x27;the largest public health problem created by the accident&#x27; and partially attributes this damaging psychological impact to a lack of accurate information.&quot; [1] This was a material problem, as many people killed themselves believing they were &quot;contaminated&quot; when, in reality, that were just fine.<p>As the link covers (both yours and mine), the primary cancers attributable to Chernobyl are thyroid cancer, due to radioactive iodine. Thyroid cancers have a 99% survival rate. This is curiously omitted in your link. Thankfully, I-131 has a half-life of just 8 days and is long, long gone.<p>Major incidents should not, in my opinion, dominate the discourse. After all, we&#x27;re fine with hydro power when the Bangqiao Dam incident killed up to 200,000 people in one fell swoop. A single dam failure could easily cause drastically more harm than a nuclear incident.<p>&gt; &quot;Can you imagine it? A European catastrophe.&quot;<p>26% of all power generated in Europe comes from nuclear today. Luckily, they have learned from their mistakes and improved processes and safety measures.<p>[edit] The discrepancy in your link I suspect comes from this: &quot;Excess cancer deaths can be estimated from published collective doses.&quot;<p>Further, I suspect the actual extent of future deaths will be lower than even UNSCEAR. They support the &quot;linear no-threshold dose response&quot; model, where any amount of increased radiation exposure leads to a proportional increase cancer deaths. However, this model is being challenged, as experimental evidence shows this is not consistent with biological and experimental data [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;news-room&#x2F;detail&#x2F;05-09-2005-chernobyl-the-true-scale-of-the-accident" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;news-room&#x2F;detail&#x2F;05-09-2005-chernobyl-th...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2663584&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2663584&#x2F;</a>')
