The streaming services have really dropped the ball in this area. They either don&#x27;t simulcast to other parts of the world (netflix), offer terrible subtitles that are worse than fan translations (netflix, crunchyroll), or just plain never release content for international audiences.<p>I pay for every relevant streaming service I can, and even when I can access legal, official distributions, I <i>still</i> generally prefer fan releases. It&#x27;s embarrassing.<p>I&#x27;m so tired of the rent seeking in the entertainment industry. I want to pay artists and content creators, not an ever growing pile of mediocre middlemen and their lawyers. How can we pool our money to hire lobbyists and change the landscape of this industry?')
