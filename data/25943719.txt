A mob with pitchforks makes a run at a Facebook HQ.  Do they kidnap employees until they find one with the access to re-initialize the account?  I guess they would have to keep the hostages forever, else the accounts be disabled again the next day.  Do they setup a camp outside with the declared intent to launch an attack should certain accounts not get enough likes?  How long could that last? \n Or do they break into a datacenter and attempt to do it themselves?  I&#x27;m reminded of that iMac scene in Zoolander.')
