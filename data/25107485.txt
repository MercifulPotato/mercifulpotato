A monolithic app vs services.<p>Why split up the serverless functionality into separate functions connected with SNS etc?  You can call the same ruby code from a single serverless lambda endpoint invoked from a http call in the same way you would from a rails process.<p>Rails is great, but you could run Rails on a serverless architecture (AWS) too if you really wanted to, and you could create a multi service architecture of Rails components that would be equally hard to maintain and develop.')
