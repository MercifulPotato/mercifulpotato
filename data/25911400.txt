The OpenBSD folks have a great license page where they explain their take on why two-clause BSD serves them well[1]:<p>&gt; [...]putting code under an ISC or two-clause BSD license essentially makes the code as free as it can possibly get. Modifying the wording of these licenses can only result in one of the three following effects:<p>&gt;    making the code less free by adding additional restrictions regarding its use, copying, modification or distribution;<p>&gt;    or effectively not changing anything by merely changing the wording, but not changing anything substantial regarding the legal content;<p>&gt;    or making the license illegal by attempting to deprive the authors of rights they cannot legally give away.<p>PfSense ought not lie about what they do, but it&#x27;s important to note that they are <i>completely</i> within their rights to take FreeBSD, extend it in any way they wish, and never share that back with the community.<p>Other licenses[2] feel differently, and before you release code to the world you should carefully consider where you fall.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openbsd.org&#x2F;policy.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openbsd.org&#x2F;policy.html</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;agpl-3.0.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;agpl-3.0.html</a>')
