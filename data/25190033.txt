These bacteria couldn&#x27;t cause widespread infections in the host, but had seemingly found pockets where they were safe from the immune system.<p>A virus, however, can&#x27;t find a &quot;safe pocket&quot; away from the immune system in which to survive and multiply. It needs to use the body&#x27;s own cells and machinery to do so, and (outside of the blood-brain barriers) there aren&#x27;t cells hidden from the immune system.')
