You can call speak() on animal and get either ruff or meow depending on what animal is. Animal is a virtual object. The system needs to do some work to figure out which speak to call every time, the work isn&#x27;t too bad, but it turns out that cpus basically never have the right thing in the cache, so it ends up being very slow compared to most of what you are doing.<p>When we say devirtualize we mean that we know animal is always a cat so we don&#x27;t have to look up which speak to use.')
