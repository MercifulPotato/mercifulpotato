When and how you use them has a significant impact on actual ROI, just like anything else in business. Part of the value of these adtech companies is that they can do most of the heavy lifting for you, so even small businesses can target and optimize without a large team.<p>If you want to target river rafters then you can just target people with &quot;river rafting, outdoors, adventurer, travel&quot; interests, or followers of your page, or upload emails of existing customers. Then let Facebook find similar people automatically. It&#x27;s that easy.<p>Everything else being equal, targeted ads still do better than non-targeted ads.
