Item(by='michaelt', descendants=None, kids=[24989061], score=None, time=1604494788, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24988222, text='<i>&gt; The obviously best solution to keep track of inventory would be &quot;smart racks&quot; with RFID tags on each product</i><p>As someone who&#x27;s deployed several industrial RFID systems: I doubt we&#x27;ll ever see an RFID tag on every item in Walmart.<p>The first reason is the cost of tags: Even the cheapest EPC Gen2 RFID tags cost more than 1 cent - and nobody selling a 20 cent can of beans is going to pay that. Barcodes, on the other hand, come free with the product&#x27;s printed packaging.<p>And the tag&#x27;s performance varies - the super-low-price tags might work fine for cardboard packages, but not work on metal cans, for example, as sticking a radio antenna to a bit of metal and having it work is a complex business.<p>The second reason is reliability: Even in a highly controlled environment, where every tag is on an identical item and you&#x27;re willing to spend 20 cents per tag, RFID is hard to get right.<p>One thing that causes reliability problems is RFID is tough to test. Reflections and interference patterns mean you&#x27;ll get areas where reading will fail, even when inches away reading works very well - and if you move metal in the environment around, it all changes and the nulls move.<p>And that&#x27;s before you get into having a thousand different products from a hundred different suppliers, all of whom now have to learn this new RFID technology.<p>Another thing that leads to reliability problems is simple mechanical matters: It&#x27;s tough for an RFID tag to survive being in between two metal cans that bump together.<p>And if you&#x27;re hoping to do something like detecting thefts, a system that is merely 99.99% reliable is going to generate far more false alarms than it does real alarms.')
