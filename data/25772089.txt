His plain language has been analyzed by qualified legal scholars and they conclude it does not meet the very high threshold of “fighting words”.<p>None of the major tests of whether speech is protected apply to the decontextualized plain language of the utterance in isolation, and the “fighting words” test is particularly non-germane here in any case, since it is a test that specifically relates to provocation of an audience hostile to one’s ideas, so you&#x27;d have to be either grossly incompetent or intensely dishonest to measure something suggested to be incitement of a friendly crowd to violence against a common enemy against it.<p>&gt; Second, as we can clearly see, the attacks on the capital were planned well in advance of Trump’s speech and therefore could not have been incited by that speech in the first place.<p>That&#x27;s...not how incitement works. It is not the case that once a a breach of the peace has been planned, encouragement immediately proximate to the planned breach to steal the nerves of either those who were in on the plan, or to fire up other susceptible persons in the area to join in, is no longer incitement. That&#x27;s nonsense.<p>The only relevance that the prior planning has to incitement is that, if Trump knew about that planning, assessment of intent and reasonably forseeable effect of his words would have to be made in light of that knowledge.<p>&gt; Third, the violent protesters had already started breaching the capital while Trump was still speaking a mile away.<p>Again, that&#x27;s not how incitement works. The fact that a riot or other ongoing breach of the peace has begun doesn&#x27;t make further immediate encouragement not incitement.<p>As with the last point, this is only relevant at all to the extent that, if Trump knew of it, assessment of his intent and the reasonably forseeable consequences of his action must be made with that knowledge in mind.<p>&gt; The people that planned and executed the violence should be charged with crimes and face a jury of their peers.<p>Sure. That&#x27;s not exclusive of accountability for incitement, whether by Trump or others.<p>&gt; So I think there are important facts on the ground that do not support the allegation that Trump’s speech on the 6th incited a spontaneous mob.<p>No one made the allegation that Trump incited a <i>spontaneous</i> mob.')
