What misinformation was spread?<p>Was it something like masks work or don’t work or something like Black Lives are more important than stopping the spread or outdoor activities are safe?<p>Ok, first search result says:<p>* The article, titled “How Medical ‘Chickenpox Parties’ Could Turn The Tide Of The Wuhan Virus,” argued that a “controlled voluntary infection” program could allow young people to return to work after contracting and recovering from the virus.*<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;25&#x2F;us&#x2F;chickenpox-parties-federalist-twitter.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;25&#x2F;us&#x2F;chickenpox-parties-fed...</a><p>The Times quotes the MD whose conjecture published by The Federalist caused so much twit-concern and then goes on to quote criticism of two not-MDs (using their title of “Dr.” but not establishing that they are academics and not medical doctors).
