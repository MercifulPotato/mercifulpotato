Because of that, I&#x27;ve spent a bit of time thinking about this for practical reasons. I prefer heavier sans-serif fonts with no character ligatures, but I like symbol ligatures and glyphs; they&#x27;re not deal breakers. I&#x27;ve been using Cascadia Code, and find it usable, don&#x27;t like the dotted 0 (the fact that the top and bottom of the 8 round in sharply helps offset this) or the few serifs it has. I&#x27;ve used Ubuntu Mono (spacing is too tight) and Source Code Pro (lines are too light) in the past.<p>What I look for is legibility between things like ({}), l1!|I, Oo08, mwnu, tl bpdq, ecoa, and being able to distinguish repetitio and symbols like --, ==, !!, &quot;&#x27;`, :;, _-, and even ,.. (Something&#x27;s going to try to parse that and absolutely shit itself)<p>I just grabbed B612 Mono.<p>n.b. I hadn&#x27;t actually assembled those thoughts into one place before now.
