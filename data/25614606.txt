As a very experienced programmer who has now learned more languages than I can remember, I generally look for these kinds of cheatsheets whenever I&#x27;m learning a new language, followed by the official documentation. Other than that, I don&#x27;t personally find tutorials very useful.<p>The cheatsheets give me a quick intro to syntax conventions, and then the official documentation provides all the detail on specifics. I&#x27;m looking to mentally map how different PL constructs common across different languages are expressed in the new language I&#x27;m learning.<p>Along the way, I end up learning one or two new PL concepts. Fewer these days than in the beginning, hence it gets easier and easier to learn new languages.')
