There is no business in the world outside of news media (which includes the author) that makes or preserves money from the middle class fighting with the lower class. They&#x27;d rather the power classes get over their differences so they can make money off them. The top 1% in US pay more taxes in taxes than the bottom 90%. Before you ask, I do think that they should be paying more rather than less.')
