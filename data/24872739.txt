It&#x27;s a very different system from the one that existed prior to WWI.<p>...<p>Although, that&#x27;s not to say that trade did not play a role in WWI!<p>Incidentally, the German pre-WWI german economy was dependent on migrant labor from Poland and Russia to exercise successful harvests in Prussia. When WWI broke out, they were not able to replace these migrant laborers in the fields, and experienced crop failures.<p>This led to significant food shortages during the war, signaled by large increases in the price of bread, in particular.<p>The military elites (Luddendort, Hindenburg) of the country must have known why prices were rising (because there was a gaping hole in supply), but successfully spun the narrative for the common folk that it was merchants (price-setters) who were to blame for the war.<p>Needless to say, price being a function of supply and demand, and the post-zollvereini&#x2F;unification interdependence of the German commodities economy was not as popularly-understood of a concept as antisemitism.<p>The reality was that the war was poorly-planned and poorly-executed, but this was an unconscionable admission for the Prussian elites.<p>This was one of the load-bearing columns for the dolchstoss myth that was weaponized to develop German anti-semitism in the interwar years.')
