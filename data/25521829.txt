But just a single Makefile at the project root with phony targets for all common tasks is a godsend.<p>One pet peeve of mine is to make `make` the only requirement to bootstrap a project dev environment from scratch. Since make is so ubiquitous you can pull in just about any requirement and dependency with clever use of targets, order only prerequisites, and files.')
