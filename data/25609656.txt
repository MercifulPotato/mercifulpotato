It doesn&#x27;t really mean that they thought it through or cared enough when they left them out of the fridge. For all we know, they might have taken them out to reach something in the back and forgot to put them back in. In other words, it&#x27;s not necessarily out of malice if that&#x27;s what you meant to imply by quoting that. It would be negligent in that case, though.')
