I worked on their adwords integration then. Good fun.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t immediately consider the hotel metasearch products a problem for booking. It shifts traffic to <i>different</i> paid channels with different tradeoffs (eg. less fine grained control of spend if it&#x27;s a revshare model). I ran the product development in marketing for a little while. Some years ago (ie. late in the game, largely due to politics), we started investing in cross channel attribution models to better direct spending.<p>Disclosure: I no longer work for Booking, though. I do work for Google, but am in NO way involved in Ads or travel and an not trying to comment on the company&#x27;s business.')
