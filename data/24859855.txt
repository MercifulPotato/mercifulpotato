I wouldn&#x27;t sit in traffic fumes, I do think pranayama breathing, Wim Hof, etc are excellent.  I try to go outdoors, in nature daily, breathing deeply as I go.<p>The mandatory mask wearing is anti-peace, anti-life, anti-&#x27;all the good stuff mentioned above&#x27;.  And governments have made this mandatory in many places.  I can&#x27;t think of something more anti-life than restricting free breathing.<p>Governments are mandating anti-life activity, and this is accepted!<p>This has been rolled out and is encouraged by most.  Its even actually considered ok to shame and snitch on others who don&#x27;t accept it.<p>For me, the mask &#x27;cure&#x27; is worse than the disease.  How many people will suffer known health effects from wearing masks, for the sake of the unproven hypothesis that they mitigate something?<p>I don&#x27;t understand those on this thread who are happy to upvote the nice comments, while overlooking the elephant in the room.  Perhaps you didn&#x27;t recognise it as the mask is covering its whole trunk!!')
