After few days when i review my work, I was like, wow that&#x27;s a lot of code and serious work and not much mistakes or rewrites. My best works for which I got lot appreciated. I had wondered how I got there in first place. It&#x27;s sort of ritual but it&#x27;s not the same.<p>1. As everybody said media is off atleast 3 days before I got into this state. Nothing chatty or noisy in the environment. \n2. No too much thoughts in the head, like decision making(not even like should I write this down or keep it in the mind). \n3. Slowing down thought process like thinking yes I have time(relaxed mode). \n4. Papers, pen and pencils to write down pseudo code, flowchart or algorithm. It can be a mixture of that as well, just going with the flow not trying to be perfect here. Being perfect stresses out the flow. Mainly it doesn&#x27;t have to be complete. \n5. I start to code with the incomplete design or logic and change on the go till part I had designed. Write down the next steps descriptively as next day I might not be in the flow.\n6. It&#x27;s good when i do this alone at home and occasionally walk to all the rooms just thinking about the logics. As I found when people are around when they speak I tend to context switch to eavesdrop what they are talking. \n7. During these times I check emails only in the evening, when I am almost done and close off. If it&#x27;s important they will call.<p>8. It also really helps when they&#x27;re are people to take care of you and home. Make Food &amp; Tea. You can ask them not to distrub you for anything. Sometimes felt keeping doors open was lot better than closing stops people from knocking doors and you go to open it.<p>This sort of worked for me. Deepwork max time 10hrs per day.<p>I would say people are lucky who can do this much often. 10times in 15years is too less. But that state of work and clarity of thought process, it doesn&#x27;t stress out as well. For me music during that time doesn&#x27;t help, TV can be low volume(once in that mood, I won&#x27;t know if tv is on or not), at home if people don&#x27;t scream or talk loud that will be fine.<p>Sometimes motivations to finished that todo triggers the mood of deep work.<p>There is also some amount of luck also to it. How often do you find answers to what you were looking for in less than 5 search results and enough to test and proceed.<p>Everything has to play out. To many variables I think.')
