It was a nightmare. In SharePoint you are supposed to &quot;check out&quot; documents, edit them, and &quot;check in&quot; the document afterward. The problem was that SharePoint was slow, so it was more convenient to work from local copies. And many people couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to send documents as attachments when requesting feedback from someone else, thus breaking the version control system. And if someone already had &quot;checked out&quot; the document, there was nothing stopping someone from just working from a local copy, making changes, emailing it to me, and saying &quot;Incorporate these changes into the final version.&quot;<p>It was common for someone to work from an outdated version and accidentally overwrite someone else&#x27;s changes. Even though SharePoint stored every version, it was still a lot of manual work on my part to be a human git, manually combine edits from multiple reviewers, and update revision history tables on the first few pages of every document because nobody else had the time to do that. There were a lot of manual, human errors introduced by me and others. Partly because sometimes people would make minor changes without updating the version of the document, and then you&#x27;d have no idea that you were looking at an older version.<p>I use git for docs version control now, and sometimes I think of ways to make documentation controlled by git while still making it user friendly for non-technical people to contribute to it. What if you could send someone a file as an attachment, they could edit it locally (perhaps in Markdown or similar, with a text editor that has a Markdown preview), then open it in a special text editor let them click a button that would make a pull request for them without them having to understand anything about git? Maybe the special text editor would also notify them as soon as the doc became outdated.<p>And if even that was too hard, maybe they could save changes, return it to the sender as an email attachment, then the recipient could quicky make a pull request.<p>It would be glorious.')
