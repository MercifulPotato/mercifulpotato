If you want to have a political discussion with coworkers do so outside the office at a social event, but even that is risky depending upon the subject matter and company culture. It’s best to play this one safe and not mix politics and work.<p>* Always be helpful and supportive to your teammates. Be an advocate that supports positive growth but not a team player that supports mutual defense. That is the difference between being a leader versus cronyism.<p>* Never make your boss look bad, which includes taking all initiative to stay off the various shit lists.<p>* Always be honest. An unwelcome truth is better than a lie. That goes to character, dependability, and trustworthiness.<p>* Be firm when you are an expert. I have had employers in the past that encouraged positive confrontations such that discussions arrive at an ideal compromise instead of tacit agreements from personality cults.<p>* Learn to enjoy writing documentation. If you want to be competitive against your peers without becoming a toxic asshole do so by contributing the most back to the team, which includes great writing.<p>* Always put the product first. This is likely to cause a fair amount of friction with your developer peers who put their code preferences first. Always do right by the business and keep the moral high ground. Your best defense is good writing.')
