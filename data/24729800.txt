Love isn&#x27;t something you have a finite supply of that you have to dole out sparingly. Loving your job or your city or your dog or whatever else doesn&#x27;t &quot;use up&quot; love that you then no longer have available to give to your friends or family or devalue it or whatever. Love is something that you generate more of as you give it away.<p>My wife is a musician, I used to be a musician, I have a lot of friends in the arts of one kind or another.  You can be damn sure they love their jobs (because basically noone goes into most kinds of artistic careers thinking they will make any sort of living over and above the barest kind of subsistance).')
