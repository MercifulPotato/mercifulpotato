The experience is nowhere as good as Chrome.<p>It takes FOREVER after starting Firefox to load saved tabs -- like 30 seconds to 1 minute of delay before the first tab starts to load.<p>Recently, it also has been updating quietly in the background and FORCING me to restart Firefox to view any content.
