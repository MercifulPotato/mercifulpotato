The reality is that if you want to be able to get a good job in an area you are interested in, you will need to be able to work with others, and get up on time, and work at a task you might not be as excited about. And you need to have a basic understanding of math, language, writing reports, etc. Most kids aren&#x27;t going to learn any of that if they are free to sleep in and browse the web and learn whatever they want. Sure some kids might be motivated enough to learn that on their own, but based on what I have seen from my parents grade 5 class, most of them will just spend all day on Fortnight.<p>And maybe for some people it&#x27;s OK to never learn those things, and be stuck working at lower skill jobs. That&#x27;s legitimately an option, there are probably many people who are happy with a simpler life. But for me, I&#x27;m glad I went to a proper school and learned everything that I did there, and didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to have a great career taken from me because I didn&#x27;t go to a traditional school.<p>I find the reason for the family in the article to be pretty poor<p><i>Fear of school shootings and concern over “the racial bias in schools, the school-to-prison pipeline,” as well as many schools’ stunted curriculum in Black history, drove the McQueens to begin their experiment with at-home learning in 2015</i><p>Fear of school shootings is obviously a bad reason to avoid school given how many people die in car crashes each year, statistically the risk is negligible. And if you want more black history curriculum it&#x27;s not hard to supliment it at home. I think you are much more likely to go to prison if you are uneducated. Racial bias concerns is a legitimate reason to avoid traditional schools though.')
