That criteria is usually how many coins one has.<p>Since the original bitcoin concept was solving the byzantine generals problem, the entire point of all the cryptographic work was to be trustless.<p>If you are cool with trust, you can have reversibility, lost password retrieval, anti-money laundering checks, and all the other features of the existing financial system.<p>It would be a carbon copy of that, of course, which would raise the question of what problem this system is solving for people.<p>But I understand that Ethereum is about distributed computing, not transactions, so the calculus may be different. The point being to replace AWS, not Western Union.<p>I&#x27;m personally not sold on why a distributed trust algorithm would be superior to trusting AWS or Azure, given that those services can give you a refund for errors, are subject to the legal system, have a brand reputation to maintain, and so on.')
