I do spend more time than I should on HN but I really don’t conflate it with social media. As far as I know HN has a no procrastination mode and no such feature can be found on Twitter&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;etc and as far as I can tell HN isn’t designed to be addictive, not in the same sense Facebook is. But no matter how I look at it I do spend too much time here and do feel a bit guilty about it.<p>I noticed that the main page is more or less stable and the top 30 stories stay put throghout the day and that helps quite a bit with me not needing to frequently check what’s going on on HN. One look is sufficient for that. My conclusion is that HN is not predatory in cahsing the last drop of engagement the same way for profit social media like FB&#x2F;twitter&#x2F;reddit are.')
