I don&#x27;t have a partner adding random devices without oversight.<p>I have plenty of public domains. .lan is short and easy, hence my preference for it.<p>Ideally there would be one or two private tlds codified just as there are private ip ranges (my hypothetical partner could also add random devices with conflicting IP, businesses have problems with conflicting IP&#x2F;subnets often, these are just problems that need to be solved through proper organisation, so I fail to see why dns is somehow different).')
