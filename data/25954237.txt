That data is not subject to HIPAA regulations. When your doctor takes your blood pressure and records it in your chart, it is subject to those regulations (as you say, it would be wildly unethical for them to sell it).<p>Separately, even if the two scenarios were subject to the same regulations, I would still expect the doctor&#x27;s office scenario to be more secure. I think that any given patient&#x27;s home network&#x2F;device&#x2F;security practices are more lax than those of most healthcare organizations.')
