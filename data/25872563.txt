I maintain a VS Code extension that allows creating, editing and commenting on gists, directly within the editor: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aka.ms&#x2F;gistpad" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aka.ms&#x2F;gistpad</a>. I’d be interested to explore an integration here, since it would be cool to author gists in your existing dev tool, and then share&#x2F;publish them to gist.cafe.<p>I also maintain a VS Code extension for building CodePen-like playgrounds, which can either be stored locally, or in gists: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aka.codeswing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aka.codeswing</a>.
