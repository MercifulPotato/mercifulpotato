I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 hours a day for the past month. It is absolutely beyond being a fun gadget. I am completely convinced that some form of VR&#x2F;AR is the future of computing and in many ways that future is here now. A month ago I thought it was going to be a fun toy at best and I was completely wrong.<p>I like to think of products in terms of the ah-ha moments they can deliver, so here are mine:<p><pre><code>  - The sense of presence is incredible. When you slip it on, you go to another place. When you take it off, you are surprised you are still at home. Every time.\n\n  - The intuition of using your hands and body to interact with the world reminds me of the very first time I used an iPhone touchscreen. The best games let you pick up familiar objects and interact with them in expected ways without instructions or tutorials.\n\n  - The amount of information that can be displayed. A web browser the size of a room. A YouTube video the size of an IMAX screen. I am very interested in Facebook&#x27;s Infinite Office app they&#x27;ll be releasing for productivity work.\n\n  - Social experiences that are absolutely unlike talking on the phone or video chat and very close to hanging out in person. The social dynamics are also changed and people tend to be much kinder, less like they are screaming into the twitter void and much like they would be in person. I think this has the potential to save us from the social media death spiral and get us talking to each other again like decent human beings. I have witnessed several actual heartfelt apologies when people get offended and it gives me hope.\n</code></pre>\nI think there are a couple of hurdles still:<p><pre><code>  - The social experiences currently can work, but without eye tracking and facial expressions you need a good amount of distracting game or group activity to cover over the gap. I think the facial expressions could work on lower fidelity cartoon avatars just fine, sort of like Apple&#x27;s AR emoji.\n\n  - The screen quality is pretty much there and the rendering quality from the mobile GPU could use a boost but it&#x27;s also serviceable. The biggest issue is that the fresnel lenses currently used have too much distortion and blur and cause eye strain and make the headset fidgety and uncomfortable.\n\n  - The headset is heavy and awkward to wear and put on. It really needs to be closer to a pair of big sunglasses.\n\n  - The apps and games are still in their infancy, though I think this is largely a factor of # of units sold and the low amount of development dollars invested. Facebook and Valve have been making good contributions here but it will take more before there is a self-sustaining software ecosystem.\n</code></pre>\nSo overall, I&#x27;d estimate we are 2-3 generations of the current hardware and one spot-on social experience app away from this hitting truly billion unit potential, but it is already so, so close. It feels like smartphones in 2005 or the internet in 1996.')
