Audio decompression is pretty light on CPUs these days.<p>It takes about half a second in a single core to decompress a 4 min MP3 to WAV in my 2012 MB Air, including writing to disk. In a gaming machine it will be way less. If anything, the audio could be decompressed and cached on demand, when loading levels, or even during installation.<p>Also sound cards do not participate on the decompression process. It&#x27;s been CPU from the start, baring rare exceptions. Sound cards just receive raw PCM. There used to be hardware codecs but they&#x27;re not really common, especially in consumer&#x2F;gamer-grade soundcards.')
