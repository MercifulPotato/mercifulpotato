E.g. Blockbuster Video went from having a market cap worth billions to being worth <i>nothing</i> because of competition from Netflix.  Blockbuster went from being profitable to <i>losing money</i>.  In one way, Slack is even worse than Blockbuster as it has yet to turn a profit.<p>Setting your snark aside, what justifies your confidence about Slack&#x27;s possible independent future more than the company&#x27;s insiders who have <i>all the internal metrics and private financial data</i> to analyze?')
