Item(by='justinclift', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604384320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24974892, text='&gt; their support is excellent<p>Maybe you&#x27;ve gotten lucky?  We left them for Digital Ocean ~9 months ago.<p>When using Scaleway, they migrated some of our (and other peoples) public servers <i>without</i> telling customers.<p>That changed some of the public and private IP(v6?) addressing for those servers.  The public address change meant our users could no longer access them, and the private address changes meant the firewalls on our other servers stopped them connecting to anything.<p>Thankfully, our monitoring system alerted us, but for over 24 hours (!) Scaleway&#x27;s support didn&#x27;t answer any of our (frantic, high priority) support questions asking why some of our VM&#x27;s suddenly had new addresses.<p>Their support also claimed migrations don&#x27;t change any public addresses.<p>So the whole &quot;people suddenly can&#x27;t access our servers&quot; and &quot;oh look, they can again now after I updated DNS&quot;... must have been my imagination then?  <i>Frigging morons</i><p>When I asked them to <i>please</i> at least update their processes to include &quot;notify customers when migrating their servers&quot;, they just responded with the equivalent of &quot;yeah, sure, we&#x27;ll think about it&quot;.<p>Then there was the time they locked our entire account during a server migration, because one of our team members also had a <i>personal account</i> with them with an overdue bill.  For about 2.99 Euros (from memory).  Their support wouldn&#x27;t give us any details of which team member, what was going on, (etc).  Took hours to go through process of elimination, and again more than a day to get our account unlocked.<p>We have <i>many</i> more Scaleway stories of incompetence.  Not just from their technical staff, but also their accounts team, credit card payment people, etc.<p>From my perspective, avoid them if you&#x27;ve any choice at all in the matter.<p>Seriously, F<i></i>K Scaleway and the horse they rode in on. :( :(')
