Maybe a crash, maybe a panic, maybe a kernel dump...<p>But.. in all my time operating servers over 3 decades, it&#x27;s always been bad drivers, bad code and problematic hardware that&#x27;s caused most of my headaches.<p>Have i seen ECC error correction in logs? yeah.. I don&#x27;t advocate against it but, i&#x27;ve found for most people you design around multiple failure scenarios more than you design around preventing specific ones.<p>Take the average web app - you run it on 10 commodity systems and distribute the load.. if one crashes, so what. Chances are, a node will crash for many more reasons other than memory issues.<p>If you have an app that requires massive amounts of ram or you do put all of your begs in one basket, then ECC makes sense...<p>I just know i like going horizontal and I avoid vertical monoliths.')
