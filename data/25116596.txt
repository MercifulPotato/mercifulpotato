Nor does the US state of Oregon.<p>The margin is much thinner, though <i>reported</i> data still give the edge to the EU.  Given that Spain and the UK represent large current EU outbreaks, that margin could shift to the advantage of the US.<p>I&#x27;ll note that US cases are continuing to grow largely unhindered whilst several EU outbreaks (notably France) may have peaked as lockdowns&#x27; impacts are seen.')
