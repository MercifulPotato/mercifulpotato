I do believe it will increase as more and more companies need in-house software. Also, it is worth noting QT has ~60 million dollars in revenue and that is definitely in the ballpark of VC backed money. You would probably have to deliver 10 million on a 1 million investment.<p>It mostly boils down to marketing and some quality of life improvements. Do you got a sales staff? Again, I&#x27;m in the gamedev business so I got no deep-down knowledge about GUI designer market but marketing costs are about 100% of development costs for desktop games (at the very very low end) and up to 1000% of development cost for mobile games. So in game development, marketing is the bulk of the cost, and development costs aren&#x27;t all that important.<p>What do you think marketing costs are for GUI designers, or do you know how much QT spends on that? As an user I feel like Sciter is lacking good marketing at this stage but you can only know that and chart your way.<p>Please don&#x27;t take any of the above advice too seriously because again I&#x27;m just a game developer, you will have to figure out this stuff yourself.')
