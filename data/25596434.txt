Item(by='scythmic_waves', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609444624, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25595583, text='&gt; I found that even Introduction to Statistical Learning made a few too many assumptions when I tried to work through it.<p>Not at all surprising. From the preface:<p>&gt; One of the reasons for ESL&#x27;s popularity is its relatively accessible style. But ESL is intended for individuals with advanced training in the mathematical sciences.<p>&gt; ... [ISL] is appropriate for advanced undergraduates or master&#x27;s students in statistics or related quantitative fields or for individuals in other disciplines who wish to use statistical learning tools to analyze their data.<p>So by that reading, the authors simplified ESL&#x27;s material from &quot;advanced training in the mathematical sciences&quot; down to &quot;advanced undergraduates or master&#x27;s students in statistics or related quantitative fields&quot;. I think that tells you all you need to know about how difficult ISL ESL should be expected to be.<p>Given that even ISL expects you to be partway through a university education in math and stats, if it&#x27;s been a while or if you never studied linear algebra, statistics, or probability at that level in the first place, you won&#x27;t be ready. That&#x27;s probably why it irks me so much that ESL gets brought up so much as the starting point for a lot of folks. It&#x27;s a good starting point for a Ph.D. from another field, but not for, like, a random software developer who&#x27;s got an interest in ML. It&#x27;s just setting them up for failure when the SIMPLIFIED version expects them to be partway through a relevant degree.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m planning to focus on statistics next with Blitzstein and Hwang&#x27;s Introduction to Probability [4] before returning to ISLR.<p>I think your references form a really solid sequence of prerequisites. I&#x27;ll again plug what I&#x27;ve been plugging in a few other comments: [1]. In that one, you could probably get through ISL after the Hogg text. But yours is totally fine as well.<p>One other thing I&#x27;ll add: I found stat110 and its companion book to focus a little too much on the &quot;challenging&quot; problems. It&#x27;s like Blitzstein reveled in tricking you with the unintuitive parts of probability. Maybe because of his background in competition math? IDK. I like the novelty of the challenging problems, but I wish they weren&#x27;t so front and center in his presentation. (I also found the whole story-proof concept a little strange.) Still, the fact that so much is online for free -- including video lectures -- makes it a great resource.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;learnmachinelearning&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ggpzk2&#x2F;a_comprehensive_selfstudy_guide_for_the_math&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;learnmachinelearning&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ggpzk...</a>')
