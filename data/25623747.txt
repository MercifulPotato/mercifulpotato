Item(by='doonesbury', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609698504, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25621939, text='I am happy to read to a piece which gives friendly fire to the left and the right. We need more of these.<p>My own tired example &quot;half of the fraud&quot; is fiscal management: one-half focus only on income (via raising taxes) and the others on cutting expenses. No successful family or company does fiscal management this way. It&#x27;s both sides, and it&#x27;s even deeper than that: usually we need to re-assess the priorities which underpin expenses and taxing strategies. And fix those too. Heck, the GOP has even given up on talking the talk. Not even that is around anymore.<p>Like other commenters here outrage isn&#x27;t an answer. Yes, it&#x27;s the present currency for talking heads on TV and crap talkers on the radio. Like a Woody Allen movie without the humor or intellect or pretense of trying, each side tries extract more outrage, more anger, and to guilt the other side into change. It&#x27;s stupid. As one corporate owner put it (paraphrasing) Americans prefer to be entertained than to deal better with the truth. So we play into this.<p>Why outrage? Because we have no agency in the present. We gotta fix that.<p>MLK had two easy outs: give up beating a dead horse, and open a barber shop or preach. Or payback. He, thankfully, chose the middle course. The middle course in America will travel through both political parties re-examining their political planks, since without them, they are lobbying fodder.')
