The outrage will be unbundled by niche companies.<p>I actually think this is a good thing. Seeing conspiracy theories on the same platform as your cousin&#x27;s family photos, or nobel winners, has a legitimacy-building effect on the outrage content. Maybe on its own platform it will look more like what it actually is. Nobody mistakes the tabloids in the checkout aisle for a legitimate newspaper.')
