The reason it has double the deaths is because it has double the old people. That counts for a lot when age is the largest risk factor.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoplease.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;census&#x2F;california&#x2F;demographic-statistics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoplease.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;census&#x2F;california&#x2F;demographic-...</a>')
