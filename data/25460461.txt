I cannot imagine eating fast foods. Cooking is cheaper, besides the healthy thing. It&#x27;s also FUN.<p>I mostly cook German stuff, some French, a little Chinese and a fair few BBQs in the summer. I have quick and easy things I make, and more elaborate stuff that tastes unlike anything you can buy ready-made.<p>I shop at local markets where you get to know the farmers, smallholders who sell what they grow. Food is way too important to me to not put the effort into it that I do.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;m not a health nut. I don&#x27;t go to the gym. I see my GP once a year and age usually tells me to try get more sunlight in the winter but otherwise gives me a clean bill of health. I&#x27;m approaching 50 and sleep 8 hours most nights.')
