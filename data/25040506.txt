The fact is that Obama&#x27;s Iran deal could have been a shakeup of the middle east and led to lasting peace. With Trump&#x27;s tilting everything towards Israel and Saudi Arabia I don&#x27;t see any end game for Iran besides catastrophe and potentially war. Maybe the idea is to oppress Iran for decades with superior weapons and money like Israel has done to Palestine. But even if they are able to pull that off it is an evil strategy.')
