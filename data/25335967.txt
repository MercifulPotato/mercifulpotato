What non-technical management sees is an engineer at the center of efforts to fix an issue in the midst of a crisis. What they don&#x27;t see is that the work done by competent engineers doesn&#x27;t blow up and become a visible crisis.<p>IMO this is a big red flag that something is wrong with both the technical and non-technical culture. Technical management isn&#x27;t happening, at least not effectively, and non-technical management is getting too far into the weeds on technical details of production issues.')
