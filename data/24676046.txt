You&#x27;re right.<p>I know we joke about left-pad, but like you pointed out, a lot of big js hitters don&#x27;t have many if any dependencies. That&#x27;s true, but irrelevant.<p>Those dev-dependencies are still potential security threats, with all the minification and other crap, it&#x27;s really hard to know what gets injected into the final runtime. And if not security, it&#x27;s still development hell. Development, yes, but that&#x27;s a if not the thing that programmers really care about.<p>And even if runtime dependencies are less common, there are a lot of developers that still do ascribe to using as many deps as possible especially because the web can be quite fragmented and they have to support a myriad of different target platforms. So even if it&#x27;s a lesser issue, I think it&#x27;s fair to talk about the js ecosystem as a whole when making criticisms about it&#x27;s dependency disasters.')
