The decryption is orders of magnitude faster than reading from the drive in the first place.<p>And 10 seconds is still nearly 1000 subjective years. A Commodore 64 boots faster than the CRT can warm up and, while certainly doing less in the process, does it with a 1Mhz processor. Which, for reference, is 3000 times slower than our single core 3Ghz example not even accounting for CPI=&gt;IPC inversion.<p>Computers are ludicrously fast, but we&#x27;ve apparently worked hard as an industry to slow them down as much as possible even for the simplest of tasks.')
