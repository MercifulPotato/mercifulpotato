Let&#x27;s say I have a User object. How do I get their (calculated) age? In OO, I can pretty much guess and let autocomplete do the rest: u.get&lt;TAB&gt; and I immediately see getAge(), along with everything else I can get from the object - much easier than looking through documentation or a huge list of functions.<p>I used to teach highschoolers how to write basic Minecraft plugins as quick intro to Java and the first thing I taught them was to write the name of the variable, then a dot, then press CTRL+Space. This worked absolutely brilliantly and it meant that they really didn&#x27;t have to think about types and naming conventions all that much. Is it player_teleport() or entity_teleport()? What about NPCs? Nobody cares! thing.teleport() worked on anything you could reasonably be expected to teleport and everyone just understood that with basically no prior programming experience.')
