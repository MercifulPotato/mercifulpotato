I&#x27;m talking about people who join projects like a hurricane, don&#x27;t pull in all the relevant data before making a technical call, and their work &#x2F;always&#x2F; has to be replaced or cleaned up 6 months later.<p>I finally realized that there&#x27;s usually not a &quot;perfect&quot; engineering solution, and you can spend weeks or months going back and forth on a plan.  So the people that just plow ahead --even if not great-- wind up delivering &quot;something&quot;, which is better than nothing.  And put another way, they land 2 failures and one moderate success in the same amount of time the rest of us are busy landing our one single success... which also winds up being only a moderate success at best because writing good software systems is hard!')
