Note that GLR isn&#x27;t exactly modern (1974). However, I would also remove &quot;modern&quot; as a requirement here... what really matters is how good the algorithm is, not how old it is. &quot;Modern&quot; algorithms easily end up being less powerful than the old ones... they just end up becoming popular due to other factors, e.g. simplicity.')
