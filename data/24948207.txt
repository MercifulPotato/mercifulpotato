You could argue, though, that this system doesn&#x27;t fully keep single-member districts because some of the representatives are chosen from a national or regional list and such lists are effectively giant districts.<p>There is still much to be said in support of non-FPTP single-member systems, though, since they allow factions within a party to break off and present their own policies.  Even if such a splinter party never replaced the party it split from, it could still prevent the bigger party from becoming too complacent and reliant on being the lesser of two evils.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mixed-member_proportional_representation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mixed-member_proportional_repr...</a>')
