The word <i>scandal</i> implies this is a one and done thing, you&#x27;ve seen the thing, and there is absolutely nothing else to see. This was an outlier.<p>But was it? I think this one story itself is a canary in the coal mine. Extrapolate this to the long tail of stories for which their potential suppression won&#x27;t make enough waves, and this is a much much bigger problem than what your non-tech acquaintances might hear.<p>This concentrated of a narrative shaping power is certainly not unprecedented but is something we would normally associate with totalitarian regimes. And even then it would be easy for people to assume the suppression from state channels. What we have today is a much knife-edge mixture of truths, non-truths and missing truths, coming from hundreds to thousands of micro channels with people&#x27;s faces attached to it. I think the grand total of its effects will indeed be unprecedented.')
