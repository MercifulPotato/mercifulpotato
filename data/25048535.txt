We know cockroach is a SQL database but the scaling properties are nice, we know the team and we think we&#x27;ll leverage the SQL layer too so it&#x27;s a good fit. On events the reason we chose nats-streaming over Kafka is because of the low memory footprint and because we&#x27;ve been using nats for a long time in Micro and know the creator Derek Collison pretty well. We trust these technologies a lot.<p>Over time we&#x27;ll offload these to managed services and potentially allow people to plug and play based on their needs.')
