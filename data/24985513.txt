No official HP ink cartridge bought in the UK would work with it and there was nothing official I could do to change it. Had to muck about with refills, blank chips and ink systems for years until the happy day when the thing broke and I threw it as hard as I could into the e-waste skip.<p>The rot set in with printers when the technology got good enough for there not to be any  easy improvements and the mindset changed from building a tool to help people create, to seeing customers as a resource to be exploited.<p>Every user-hostile bit of nonsense from shoddy software to region-locked, staggeringly overpriced ink stems from there.')
