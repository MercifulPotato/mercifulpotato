The idea behind demanding consistency is that you can get lucky with one trade, but that over the long run, your luck will average out, and your true ability will show. The EMH says that your true ability to judge value won&#x27;t be greater than the market&#x27;s ability to judge value. But there are cases where it&#x27;s clear that the trade wasn&#x27;t merely luck. That&#x27;s why I gave the example of the housing bubble: people using only public information were able to better judge the value of MBSs, and it wasn&#x27;t just luck. They were objectively smarter than the market, because they did something that most people weren&#x27;t doing: <i>they analyzed the underlying assets</i>. Put another way, the market can behave irrationally, and can seriously mis-price assets. In fact, it often does so, and the reason is not simply that there&#x27;s missing information. The reason is that people are irrational, lazy, hubristic, etc.<p>&gt; In fact, following your reasoning every trade would invalidate the EMH.<p>No, only trades in which the person making the right call was right by something other than luck.<p>The strongest version of the EMH that actually holds is probably something on the order of, &quot;If you pick a random investor, their expected returns are the same as those of the broader market.&quot; That is, you have to weaken it until it&#x27;s trivially correct.')
