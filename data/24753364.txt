Some comments:<p>- Your &quot;Which resume would you choose?&quot; To be honest, I&#x27;d choose the one one the left, it&#x27;s cleaner and gives just the information I want from a candidate.<p>- As a &quot;stand out&quot; resume, the one on the right has some rough edges, it has emojis, &quot;cv&#x27;s&quot; would be better &quot;CVs&quot;, resume and CV are synonyms, no need to list both, the non-English quotes, using a hyphen where you should use an en-dash &quot;January 2020 â€“ present&quot;, definitely needs polish.<p>- In lots of places your would never put a photo of yourself on a CV, there are quite a few locale-specific conventions like that, do you have the flexibility for that?  Perhaps have locale-specific templates?<p>- If aiming for a US audience (and I guess you are, resume is the usual US name for what would be a CV in the UK), you&#x27;d be better posting this late afternoon in Europe :-)<p>Good luck!')
