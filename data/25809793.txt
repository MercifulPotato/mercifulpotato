I don’t expect it to last too long in the wild (at least at any scale, obviously some smart contracts that exist now will technically be around forever) or make it into many real world uses of the tech.<p>Well functioning markets have protection against extreme price moves, including flash crashes, whether caused by flash loans or other algorithms.<p>It might even turn out that good decentralised markets end up being resistant to atomically chaining trading transactions with other actions generally.<p>[1] An example of this in action can be seen here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RudolphTamlyn&#x2F;status&#x2F;1349719025933291520" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RudolphTamlyn&#x2F;status&#x2F;1349719025933291520</a>')
