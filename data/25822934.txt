All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is missing. Find this missing number.<p>We can &quot;find the missing number&quot;, but we don&#x27;t know where to &quot;put&quot; the missing number. If you want to put the &quot;missing number&quot; back into the sequence, you still need to know the location to put it into from some other mechanism. (Ex: hard drive #5 failed, so you know to put the number into slot#5).<p>----------------<p>Application 4 starts to get into &quot;partitioning&quot;, which is getting dangerously close to sparse parity-check matrix and LDPC graphs.')
