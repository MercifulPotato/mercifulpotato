If the side effects of the &quot;lockdown cure&quot; are going to be exorbitant poverty and starvation, doesn&#x27;t that make the cure worse than the disease?<p>In addition to this article, UNICEF says[0] up to 132 million people will face starvation related to the lockdowns in 2020.<p>Just cursory searching yields the current COVID-19 death count at 1.6m[1] (a total which is disputed due to the &quot;died from COVID-19&quot; vs &quot;died with COVID-19&quot; distinction).<p>It seems like the starvation and poverty numbers from the lockdowns are likely to exceed any potential COVID-19 death count (even with no lockdowns).<p>And none of the aforementioned includes lockdown-related suicides, lack of medical care for existing medical conditions, and other impacts from being isolated or stuck inside.<p>Is this all emotional&#x2F;fear-based&#x2F;CYA decision making?
