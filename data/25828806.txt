In many cases citizens from country &#x27;A&#x27; can use healthcare in &#x27;B&#x27; as long as their own citizens will be granted the same treatment in exchange when visiting &#x27;A&#x27;. It depends on the treatises signed between the two countries.<p>Allowing foreigners to use the health care system for free is sometimes allowed (or even encouraged) if that protects the interests of the country.')
