I have feeling that even if mother ship appeared one day I would have the same reaction. So, I am not sure what is there to hide. And how exactly would that change our perception about humanity. \nReligions will still exist, corrupt people will still exist, corporate greed, corruption, global warming and everything else will just continue as usual...\nWhy anyone even thinks that some kind of external agent will save us from our selves and give us even more technology, when we are not capable of handling technology we have now?!')
