Specifically that National News controlled by professional journalistic outlets which set the tone and heavily moderated what the public saw.<p>In other words we replaced a pretty gatekept national media environment with one that was a civil liberties free for all on social media. Now the pendulum is perhaps feeling like it’s going back the other way where Major social media now will be more moderated around what’s considered a core set of values and facts, a little closer in feel to the boring 6:30 news of our childhood.<p>I don’t say that to draw judgment either way, but only to give context.')
