Here&#x27;s another example of fake legal threats in this affair, from what I would consider the canonical site about it.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;conjugalfelicity.com&#x2F;robert-stanek&#x2F;stanek-responds-to-his-critics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;conjugalfelicity.com&#x2F;robert-stanek&#x2F;stanek-responds-to...</a><p>IIRC (it <i>was</i> a long time ago) the email I received wasn&#x27;t quite the same, but it was broadly similar - fake identity, clearly from someone barely educated let alone educated in law, same general amateurishness as Stanek&#x27;s books and reviews.<p>BTW, while I&#x27;m here: this deep dive into l&#x27;Affaire Stanek might seem indulgent and off topic, but it&#x27;s not. <i>This is the archetype.</i> This is how online defamation and anti-defamation campaigns play out. They&#x27;re ugly, they&#x27;re messy, lots of third parties get dragged in, and people do get hurt. To a defamer, merely getting your target involved in something so obviously tawdry is almost as good as having the initial accusations stick. The internet&#x27;s infinite memory can be used in more than one way to get revenge, and I think that&#x27;s important to know.')
