Let&#x27;s see some web search results for variations of &quot;windows audio problem&quot;:<p><pre><code>    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;answers.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;forum&#x2F;windows_10-other_settings-winpc&#x2F;volume-control-at-100-cant-mute-or-reduce-sound&#x2F;f54ce430-1a73-410a-8abc-720c5e73cfaa\n</code></pre>\n&gt;Then...  I called Dell.  Spent FOUR HOURS on the phone last night, resetting&#x2F;restoring operating system. Not fixed.<p>---<p><pre><code>    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;fix-sound-problems-in-windows-10-73025246-b61c-40fb-671a-2535c7cd56c8\n</code></pre>\n&gt;3. Verify that all Windows Updates are installed<p>&gt;6. Fix your audio drivers<p>&gt;9. Restart Audio Services<p>&gt;11. Restart to apply installed updates<p>---<p><pre><code>    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;answers.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;forum&#x2F;windows_10-update&#x2F;audio-problems-after-windows-10-update&#x2F;c4586688-176f-41ef-9be8-33748a811fc3\n</code></pre>\n&gt;In this case I would look to reinstall the manufacturer audio drivers as they have probably been replaced by Windows 10 built in drivers.<p>&gt;ok after testing this on several games the sound is noticeably better but not completely normal should i download another driver ?<p>---<p>Some lets-players I watch regularly complain about how W10 updates break their audio capture &#x2F; microphone settings. They work around it by uninstalling the update and trying as hard as possible to not let it be reinstalled automatically.<p>---<p>Like I said, not only are there problems, but nobody knows how to figure out what the problem is. Just &quot;run the built-in troubleshooter&quot; (which both clueful and clueless Windows users will tell you rarely fixes anything), &quot;update your drivers&quot;, &quot;install Windows updates&quot;, &quot;restart your computer&quot;.<p>When I have issues with OSS on Linux, I have logs with filenames and distinctive error messages, publicly viewable sources that I can correlate the logs to if I want to, and forums of other people who can do that if I don&#x27;t. If it&#x27;s an absolutely novel problem, I can contact the authors of the code and have a high expectation of getting a response. If it&#x27;s an issue that needs a fix, I can track the progress and release of the fix.<p>And before you say &quot;I don&#x27;t have any of these problems with audio on Windows&quot;, I too haven&#x27;t had any problems with pulseaudio for the almost 10 years that I&#x27;ve used it.')
