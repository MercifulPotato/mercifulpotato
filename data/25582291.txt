Item(by='cesarb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609341066, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25580849, text='&gt; Isn&#x27;t this sort of reinventing USB on top of USB?<p>It&#x27;s not on top of USB, it&#x27;s a completely independent side-channel. And it cannot be on top of USB, since its second main use (besides negotiating the voltage and current in the main power pins) is to negotiate the alternate modes used for the pins which normally carry USB (not only the USB 3.x pins, but also the USB 2 pins in the VirtualLink alternate mode). You could think as USB-PD being below USB, except that it&#x27;s also not true since you can use USB-C without USB-PD (using only the resistors in the CC pins to detect cable orientation and maximum current).')
