Making significant money from an ownership share like that takes decades of disciplined saving and investing. The narrative of WSB that &quot;the rich won&#x27;t let poor people invest in the stock market like they do&quot; is ridiculous; most of the rich would be very happy with 8% per year on average.<p>There might be something to the idea that an internet forum will have a harder time getting away with the sort of market manipulation that the most unscrupulous hedge funds do all the time, but that&#x27;s a different discussion entirely.<p>There&#x27;s of course a related discussion of how much some people can <i>afford</i> to invest in the stock market each year, but it&#x27;s really only partially related.
