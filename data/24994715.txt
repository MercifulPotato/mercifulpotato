If you saw someone trying to saw something out of their arm, would you think &quot;whatever, it&#x27;s their arm,&quot; or &quot;this person is having a psychotic break and desperately needs medical attention, including restraint?&quot; A lot of people would extend that to most forms of irrational self-harm. I don&#x27;t want anyone to extend it to anything <i>I</i> do, though, so applying the principle of liberty even when it involves letting people destroy themselves for no reason, still seems attractive.')
