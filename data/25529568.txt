If we scale up to lots of developers and sub-teams, we’d have dedicated tech leads also being developers.<p>Regarding senior engineers; we have multiple seniors on the team anyway, seniority doesn’t necessarily put you in an influential position.<p>We use the SA basically as a technical coach. They are not the boss, and they don’t own the solution or push decisions, we practice collaborative ownership in that regard. I like to say the SA is our development scrum master.<p>We run like this on projects for banks or insurances. Allows us to execute in an agile fashion (we actually use XP) while still being able to plan months ahead (high level) - those types of customers love their Gantt charts and solution architecture documentation ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
