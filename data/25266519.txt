Example, marriage of their kdis, fixing their house etc. Most of them have small patches of land and depend entirely on monsoon rains.\nSo if the rains fail in a given year OR the supply is too high  in the market, farmers don&#x27;t even break even.<p>So to protect farmers, Govt of India and the state govts provide lot of subsidies and incentives.\nHere is a short list:\n1) They don&#x27;t pay taxes on their income.\n2) Get loans at a very low interest rates. Most of the time loans are waived off.\n3) They don&#x27;t pay for the electricity used for farming.\n4) They get subsidized prices on the seeds, fertilizers etc.')
