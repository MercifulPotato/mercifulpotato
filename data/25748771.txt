It&#x27;s still in beta, and the drag&#x2F;drop animations are rough around the edges, but it appears to be targeting an enterprise-grade set of features, including accessibility support.<p>Its core + plugin model will likely be the closest you can get to bundle size minimization.<p>Until the situation improves, for production, I use react-beautiful-dnd.<p>Long term, I think this might actually be a good problem to be solved in web components (e.g., using something like Stencil), then output targets for React, Svelte, Angular, etc can be generated.')
