Scratch2 is a real programming language, but geared towards visually teaching kids (probably adults, too) how programming and programming languages work.<p>Raspberry Pi was developed specifically to teach children computing. Scratch2 is a graphical programming language that comes with the default OS. There&#x27;s also a special version of Minecraft that is basically meant to be hacked.<p>Personally I think every kid should have one, replaced freely (with limits) as necessary, automatically as part of the Education portion of your property taxes.<p>There are so many cool things you can connect to it (sensors, audio amplifiers, several types of cameras, robot kits, monitors, etc) and it rarely gets expensive.

Dual HDMI monitor outputs, too.<p>I sound like a salesman. I&#x27;m not. I just really like them and have a bunch of different models. The Pi 4 is so fast it really surprised me for the price. It&#x27;s how I&#x27;d teach anybody to program.<p>As for Lego, here&#x27;s how Raspberry Pi plays well with them: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=u4l6N_6PEbU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=u4l6N_6PEbU</a><p>You can buy it inside a keyboard now.
