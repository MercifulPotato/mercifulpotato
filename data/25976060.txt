Item(by='carapace', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612068486, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25974887, text='&gt; If we&#x27;re talking about what we want society to look like,<p>Just to be clear, I want the world you&#x27;re describing.\nI don&#x27;t want the world I&#x27;m describing\nI just don&#x27;t see how to avoid ubiquitous surveillance.\nIt seems to me that either the good guys use it or the bad guys will.<p>&gt; then I might as well say that in the world I&#x27;m envisioning, we don&#x27;t\nhave concentration camps or kidnapping or mass surveillance. Let&#x27;s\nimagine that we&#x27;ve figured out a way to get rid of all of it without any\ncameras anywhere.<p>I would love for that to happen.<p>&gt; But having an end goal isn&#x27;t enough, you need a feasible path to get\nthere.<p>Sure, but I&#x27;d say that we already have that in the form of Jesus or\nSathya Sai Baba.  If we would just follow the advice of the holy people\nwe would do just fine.  You don&#x27;t need mass surveillance, or even\ngovernment, to manage <i>good</i> people.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t believe there is any possible world where you have perfect\nmass surveillance that doesn&#x27;t result in totalitarianism.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that either.<p>Mass surveillance -&gt; totalitarianism.  I&#x27;m with you on that.<p>&gt; I think it is a trade between kidnappers and totalitarianism,<p>I don&#x27;t.  I think techno-totalitarianism can&#x27;t be stopped short of either\na terrible collapse in civilization.  It&#x27;s already happening.  You&#x27;re\ngetting whether you like it or not.<p>&gt; and saying you&#x27;d prefer it not to be a trade... well, great, but it is.<p>I prefer my life unsurveilled.  However, in real life, my phone, my car,\nmy TV, my electric meter, my browser, my ISP, etc., these things are all\nalready reporting on me.<p>Never mind the word &quot;trade&quot;.<p>If you&#x27;re getting surveilled anyway, you should get the benefits too.<p>The Chinese are already catching kidnappers in near-realtime.<p>&gt; If you have an actionable plan to get to the society you&#x27;re envisioning\nthen go for it,<p>I don&#x27;t.  I wouldn&#x27;t &quot;go for it&quot; even if I did.  I&#x27;m not the type.<p>&gt; but in the meantime let the rest of us try to invent\ninvisibility cloaks, and build E2E encrypted chat apps, and promote Tor,\nand legislate&#x2F;restrict State surveillance, because even if those\nsolutions are imperfect we still want to try and protect the people who\nare suffering under the oppressive regimes that exist right now.<p>I am not about to stop you or anyone from doing anything.  I think it&#x27;s a silly\nthing to do and a waste of time, but then 99% of\neverything humans do seems that way to me so don&#x27;t let it get you down.<p>(Be aware it&#x27;s potentially unhealthy.  You&#x27;ve heard of COINTELPRO?  Have fun\nwith your new friends.)<p>&gt; At the very least, even if privacy can&#x27;t be preserved forever, every\nday that we delay the world of perfect mass surveillance is another day\nthat people like you get to spend figuring out how to create the utopian\nsociety you&#x27;re imagining.<p>Just to be clear, I don&#x27;t think the end result I&#x27;m imagining is utopian,\nand I&#x27;m <i>not</i> trying to bring it about, because on the one hand I don&#x27;t\nlike it and on the other I think it&#x27;s inevitable (or something so bad\nwill happen that I won&#x27;t want to participate anyway.  I don&#x27;t have any\nchildren so if the world goes to shit too badly I can go live under a rock\nsomewhere until I die or something eats me.)<p>&gt; And frankly, it kinda sounds like you could use all the time you can\nget, because I don&#x27;t see how you plan to get from point A to point B.<p>I don&#x27;t.  I gave up trying to predict things when Twitter became a thing, let alone plan how to pilot world society.<p>&gt; So if it helps, think of the privacy advocates as buying you time to\nmake sure that facial recognition won&#x27;t be applied selectively against\ncivilian populations while police officers don masks and cover up their\nbadge numbers.<p>Instead of letting people get away with crime, police officers shall be\nsubject to the panopticon along with everyone else.<p>&gt; Once you&#x27;ve figured out the laws that need to be passed to make your\nutopia, and once they&#x27;re far enough in the process that they have a\npretty good chance of passing, then we can stop advocating for privacy.<p>I&#x27;m not about to figure out any laws, aside from that, AFAIC you can\nadvocate for privacy all you want, I won&#x27;t try to stop you. I&#x27;m rooting\nfor you more-or-less.  I just think it&#x27;s a waste of time.<p>I mean, let me ask you this: How are you going to know that any of that (&quot;invisibility cloaks, ... E2E encrypted chat apps, ... Tor,\nand [laws]&quot;) is working?  The NSA isn&#x27;t going to drive by your house and give you a respectful nod?<p>The sooner we get used to the idea that the only privacy we have is a\npolite fiction the sooner we can round up all the kidnappers and\nkiddie-molesters and rapists and murderers and other monsters.<p>We can put them on Antarctica or something.<p>(BTW thanks for engaging in debate.  I don&#x27;t know if we got anywhere but I&#x27;m glad to be able to hash this out with other folks who care.  Cheers!)')
