No login&#x2F;account creation required. No analytics&#x2F;trackers. No ads.

Plenary tries to solve this in novel ways:<p><i>Local News:</i><p>Select a country and Plenary will show a list of top news sources for that country. Tapping on any news source will open a webpage containing all the RSS feeds available of that source.<p><i>RSS Assistant:</i><p>Create RSS feed from top sites such as Reddit, Google News, YouTube, Medium, Wordpress, Wikipedia, Tumblr in 2-3 simple steps (some of the assistant options are part of Plenary premium)<p><i>Recommended Feeds:</i><p>Curated list of more than 200+ recommended feeds spread across various categories which include Programming, Technology, Web Development, Android Development etc<p>There is also full support of OPML import&#x2F;export. So if you are already using any RSS reader, it&#x27;s simple to get started.<p>Plenary can also be used as a complete offline article downloader app (similar to Read it later apps) and a Podcast player. Other features of the app include searching, filtering, backup&#x2F;restore on Google drive&#x2F;Dropbox, YouTube playback support, custom syncing intervals, notifications, multiple theming options etc.<p>Please try them out and let us know your feedback!')
