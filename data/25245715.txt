I wonder if they could make the area around threaded screw on the bottom for attaching to tripods a heat spreader.  These are usually made out of metal already, and have to be structurally sound for the camera to be attached there.  If the attached base was a block of aluminum or copper, it could probably suck the heat out of there.')
