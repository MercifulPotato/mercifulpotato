I&#x27;m very uneasy about the vaccine, but I also don&#x27;t want COVID. \nI&#x27;m likely going to end up taking the vaccine as soon as it&#x27;s available and hoping GBS doesn&#x27;t happen again, just so I can go back to my life ASAP. Depends on how the risk of GBS with the vaccine compares with the risk of GBS from COVID.')
