It has been governed by the Republic of China, which predates PRC by many decades, since Japan’s defeat in WWII and subsequent surrender of its colonies. A unification scenario is less likely today than it has ever been before, and grows less likely every year. Millions of Taiwanese outright reject the idea that they are part of China. A diminishing minority of waishengren that evacuated the mainland to Taiwan in 1949 are about the only people who would favor unification.<p>Nothing wrong with considering that scenario, but as for a national referendum resulting in a peaceful unification? Chances are basically zero.')
