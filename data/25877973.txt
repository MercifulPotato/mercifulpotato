We need decentralized free software versions of Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube so that not a single actor has veto power over what content is allowed. Something like torrents, but without torrent sites (which are single points of failure).<p>There&#x27;s FreeNet, but it&#x27;s crap and contains child porn. We need something new that ensures the right of Socialist parties (and Nazi parties too, for that matter) to spread their <i>legal</i> propaganda, but can&#x27;t be used for pedophiles to distribute child porn. Technically, it can&#x27;t be impossible to create something like that. People have tons of bandwidth and disk space to spare so that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem either.')
