It sounds like linux is becoming more of an option though for people that don&#x27;t care about those things.<p>From your description it sounds like baseline functionality mostly works (particularly on a desktop).<p>The other Apple hardware advantage is the trackpad which even windows machines can&#x27;t compete with. I suspect this is because Apple factored a lot of their iOS multitouch research into their trackpad support. It&#x27;d be hard for me to use a non-apple laptop, but linux on a desktop would probably be fine.')
