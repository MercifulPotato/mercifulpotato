The exact details will vary based on the type of service, of course.<p>One particularly egregious misuse of captcha in a service I use presents one <i>after</i> I enter a correct username and password. An incorrect login says so without presenting a captcha. The potential reward for an attacker who successfully gains access to an account is high, so it seems almost certain anyone running a targeted attack would defeat this by handing it off to a human upon detecting that they had a good account.')
