Institutionally zero tech knowledge, but a very pro copyright legislature and political caste (that, at a high level, is also very corrupt. Think Wirecard and add Kohls schwarze Kassen). Even with its own evidently corrupt court that always sides with copyright holders, regardless how absurd the claim and even if the law does not agree with the judges at all. Of course that&#x27;s a country where law firms like that can prosper.')
