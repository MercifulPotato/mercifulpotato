Cavalry was a very specilised, powerful and effective tool. But the real world wasn&#x27;t what the English guy said in Braveheart (&quot;We have the heavy cavalry, we win&quot;). Many knights fought on foot as well.<p>Cavalry could not break many infantry formations. You were safe in a square.<p>Cavalry was great at harassing supply lines in raids, and importantly running down fleeing infantry.<p>This is all purely a European perspective, steepe cavalry was very different, but many of their benefits were at a larger scale than a single battle.<p>Generally the whole thing is too complicated to draw some simple conclusion from. War is, and always has been complicated and messey, not a game of chess.')
