Most ThreadRipper CPUs cost more by themselves than does the entire Mac mini.<p>A 16-core ThreadRipper starts at 180 watts and costs more than the Mac mini at $699. Duh—it&#x27;s <i>supposed</i> to be faster.<p>On the other hand, the Mac mini and the other M1 Macs are entry level machines that put almost all Intel and some AMD processors to shame, running at 20-24 watts TDP—so cool that the MacBook Air doesn&#x27;t need a fan and the one in the MacBook Pro is silent.<p>From the AnandTech review [1]:\n&quot;The M1 undisputedly outperforms the core performance of everything Intel has to offer, and battles it with AMD’s new Zen3, winning some, losing some. And in the mobile space in particular, there doesn’t seem to be an equivalent in either ST or MT performance – at least within the same power budgets.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s pretty good for entry-level, consumer hardware. The professional level processors should make things quite interesting.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-tested&#x2F;7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-teste...</a>')
