Item(by='spacephysics', descendants=None, kids=[25369942, 25381848, 25370669, 25377574], score=None, time=1607573332, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25369278, text='I feel like this is a slow-creep argument (unsure of the actual term, thinking similarly of the Overton window)<p>Back before we humanly killed animals, an argument could be made<p>“well it would be better to humanly kill animals as painlessly as possible, versus a painful death. Therefore I’d prefer and support the humane killing”<p>Now that humane killing is the norm, the act of killing became bad, or at least has become more popular. Obviously the more popular today notion of killing animals being unethical existed back then.<p>Now we’re onto the argument of consent, regardless of pain (sampling cultures versus not). The next step will be, even having these animals on pastures is unethical, as they cannot be free to go where they want (despite these essentially domesticated livestock being unable to live in the wild without heavy evolutionary pressures I.e. massive death or extinction)<p>So as “extreme” as it may seem to proclaim that it’s unethical to sample cells from an animal, regardless of pain, I think it’ll surely shift to being more mainstream and acceptable as a viewpoint.<p>I also think the latter vs in your statement is a straw man, and a poor one at that. To say all livestock grown for meat consumption are “tortured” is a gross generalization.<p>Sure it exists, but so does ethically raised, pasture raised livestock that are humanly killed (and such practices increasing at a great rate, as grass fed&#x2F;finished becomes more desirable)<p>Lastly, this personification of all animals is a misrepresentation of many species. I think there are a few animals we can truly question their sentience (dolphins come to mind), while others I think we can say to a reasonable degree are less sentient than humans, and therefore if killed in the most painless way possible is ethically okay. Obviously this is a philosophical can of worms.')
