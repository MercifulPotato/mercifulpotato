The blue and red portions of the US are too economically interdependent for dissolution to be readily feasible absent a <i>catastrophic</i> political crisis, such as a military coup or a Republican president declaring himself dictator for life.<p>However, if dissolution did happen, it wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be a bad thing. Most of America&#x27;s current political strife and dysfunction is caused by incompatible, and increasingly divergent, visions for America&#x27;s future. Splitting the country is the only way for those two visions to get what they want without persecuting (or killing) large numbers of people.')
