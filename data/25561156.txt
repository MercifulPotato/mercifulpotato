I guess you are talking about foreign functions defined in a dynamic library. Calling a foreign function (regardless of linkage) will just evaluate the arguments and pass them according to the calling convention of the foreign ABI. If you link to library dynamically and it gets updated (in an ABI compatible way) you don&#x27;t have to recompile anything, it just works as you would expect.')
