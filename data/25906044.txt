Be better prepared to jump back into a different task by knowing exactly where you left off, problem state, and what the next step is.<p>A special, limited case of this is ending your workday. While you&#x27;re in the zone, and wrapping up your day set yourself up for success by preplanning your next action. If you&#x27;re coding something and just committed your day&#x27;s last checkin, write a quick sentence indicating what you&#x27;re going to be working on <i>tomorrow</i>. When I am able to do this, regaining context next day is much simpler and easier for me.')
