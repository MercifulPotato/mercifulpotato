This is close to something like Excel where code changes are instantly and visually applied to the input data.<p>There&#x27;s incredible promise here, and I believe similar fast-feedback paradigms will become the mainstream programming experience within 30-40 years. We&#x27;ve already had a taste of this with Jupyter Notebook&#x27;s ubiquity across data science; despite its many flaws it lets people iterate just a little faster.<p>As for Dark itself, it feels they put too much emphasis on language and not enough on ecosystem. I wish they had focused on a fresh new IDE experience for Django or Rails rather than additionally building a entire language and syntax from scratch.')
