The only way for this to make any sense is to imagine the audience is an ADD 3 year old.  Here were some of the factors that determined an executive summary:<p>* Very few words, and no jargon.  Every statement is a meaningful fragment, like a subtitle.<p>* Colors, but not too many.  Think of a pie chart.<p>* Numbers.  Executives love numbers, but be careful.  The numbers have to mean something that contains very few words and no jargon.<p>* Keep it short, because they don&#x27;t care anyway.  They are just concerned that something was wrong, something was done, and finally risk was reduced.  All your words and fancy colors are quickly discarded so that a quick pass reassures them emotionally.<p>That is exactly how I would brief a business partner today unless I have full faith they are actively involved in the health of the product.  It isn&#x27;t that they are stupid, but that they don&#x27;t care and you cannot make them care.')
