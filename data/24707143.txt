If they had a separate brand for these experimental projects they would have avoided a lot of headaches.<p>Google Cloud isn&#x27;t someone&#x27;s side project though so the risk is much lower. You&#x27;re right that  services can be shut down at moment&#x27;s notice but that applies to any service of any kind. Unless you host with multiple cloud providers at the same time you cannot avoid that risk.')
