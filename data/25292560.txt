It&#x27;s impossible. All it provides is a pork barrel for drug agencies, weapons manufacturers etc. It escalates the price. They haven&#x27;t made a dent in the 40 years of the war on drugs. When the demand doesn&#x27;t cease, all you do is make the product more expensive and the ones that provide it more powerful.<p>After many years on this planet, I&#x27;ve reached the conclusion that when bodies of people decide over other bodies of people, they don&#x27;t always have their best intention for them, even if they tell you so.<p>The War on Drugs has not been good for anyone except for the people who been waging it. If you&#x27;re in the business of making weapons, you need a threat. If there is none, you need to make up one. If you&#x27;re low on criminals, make more stuff illegal. Bam, now you have a lot of criminals, and some of them armed, even better.<p>The dream of &quot;War on Drugs&quot; is not to stop drugs. It&#x27;s to make money will proclaiming you&#x27;re against drugs.')
