They covered all the possible explanations I can think of (the source of the signal was orbiting, an object accelerating toward us, or the raw signal itself had increasing frequency). However, I don&#x27;t see why they need more than one data sample to calculate the rate of acceleration. Also, what benefit might there be to using a chirp signal like this to communicate?<p>The article also does a great job of explaining that it really is quite likely that we will only detect broadcast signals from closer systems. It is simply too expensive and wasteful to broadcast RF out into the abyss. And if there is even just one species a mere million years more advanced than us in the galaxy, they would have had the capability to colonize every system by now, even using chemical based propulsion.<p>Overall, it seems promising, but as with everything in this field, unlikely to be reproducible (which some people will use to dismiss it). Determining the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence is less of a scientific method project than an intelligence gathering one, and many otherwise intelligent science-types struggle to understand that.')
