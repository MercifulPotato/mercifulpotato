Item(by='aljp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606781504, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25259775, text='&gt; First, the author goes straight to the ventilator as a fear tactic.<p>This is brought up in the second last paragraph, well over half way through the article, after they discuss the situation for ICU patients and staff.  They go on to provide more information about the other sorts of interventions required for a critically ill Covid patient.  I think it is less insidious than your criticism implies.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a FUD style hit piece, it reads to me as a genuine and emphatic article from someone working in health care, expressing their point of view and experience as a health care worker.  It is perhaps more genuine than mainstream news media. Of course it&#x27;s not a peer-reviewed scientific publication, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a sensationalised hit piece either.<p>Saying that these sort of articles should &quot;stop with the emotional pleas&quot; feels derisive to me, if health care workers can&#x27;t give an honest, if emotional, discussion about their experience during Covid, are you saying we should simply ignore them or tell them to shut up?  I don&#x27;t think so.  Healthcare workers are stressed, working overtime, arguably underpaid for the dangerous work they are doing.  Let them express their pleas in their blogs.<p>As for the risks that people are and are not willing to take, I think there&#x27;s enough precedent that behaving in a way that endangers others is something we try to avoid for a communal good, we are in a community and society where we should care for and respect one another as a principle, whilst also taking into account civil liberties.  We do not have the right to drink and drive because we have accepted that the risks and consequences are not tolerable.  Most importantly we should respect what they say at the end:<p>Staying home (The specifics of which I feel are very much debatable though because it impacts people&#x27;s lifestyles and civil liberties)<p>Social distancing<p>Mask wearing<p>Hand washing<p>I think it is really not that imposing or unreasonable during a pandemic!')
