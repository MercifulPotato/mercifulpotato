The truth allows us to address costs better.<p>Additional suicides &#x27;due&#x27; to Covid lockdown in October was only ~600 deaths vs 2000 direct Covid deaths for the year.<p>This years suicide count in Japan is overall the same as last year at the same time.<p>More men are dying from Covid lockdown suicides.<p>This month is the first month it became about women, and only this particular month. Not when you look at yearly data.<p>You could argue when we see such a big jump in one month for women it means we need to start targeting them. This is 100% true. Sadly the reverse about men has not happened for the other months so if we are gender neutral about people dying it&#x27;s be nice to target everyone, just a thought.<p>I&#x27;d speculate Japan will foretell the USA. This will keep increasing. We are just starting to hit the economic and social downfall stage. But suicide will jump back to men, and I&#x27;d guess again forgotten.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nippon.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;japan-data&#x2F;h00864&#x2F;october-saw-rapid-increase-in-suicides-in-japan.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nippon.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;japan-data&#x2F;h00864&#x2F;october-saw-rapi...</a>')
