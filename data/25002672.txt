What are they? Who sells these many other smartphones that have had 3 or more years of updates from last sale?<p>Certainly not the Pixel phones, they get 3 years support from first launch only, and they&#x27;re supposedly the gold standard for Android software support. It&#x27;s pretty much the reason they exist. Yet after last sale support for the 5S matched the Pixel&#x27;s from launch support, and we don&#x27;t even know that this is the last update the 5S will get.')
