Item(by='sickcodebruh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603460383, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24869178, text='&gt; The best antidote for bad ideas and conspiracy theories is transparency and public debate.<p>This is only true when people participating in the debate operate in good faith and are able and willing to genuinely consider other ideas. Conspiracy theories often have more to do with faith than facts, there are no ideas to debate, so giving them room to breath becomes an opportunity for believers to proselytize. Traditionally, this has been somewhere between funny and annoying, but this is different.<p>&gt; Flat earthers? 9&#x2F;11 truthers? Who&#x27;s next?<p>Well that&#x27;s the thing, as far as I know, the big tech companies clamping down on QAnon haven&#x27;t gone after flat earthers or 9&#x2F;11 truthers because those believers haven&#x27;t been connected to multiple violent crimes. Flat Earth &quot;thought leaders&quot; aren&#x27;t telling believers that elected officials are cult members who kill children, urging them to action. So to your statement, &quot;It&#x27;s also not clear where this is supposed to end?&quot; I&#x27;d say that the response to QAnon is a demonstration of the end -- it is the destination reached when one starts with more benign conspiracy theories.')
