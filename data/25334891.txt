Nice; that cost them a pretty penny. My other option was a Thinkpad but it ran Windows.<p>But ... but ... this 2019 Macbook has %^#$#@ GD ^&amp;&amp;^$%@#@#  piece of ^&amp;%^#$ control strip.<p>Almost every time my fingers move too close to the strip the software &quot;<i></i>HELPS<i></i> me&quot; by changing desktops, applications, and all other manner of complete BS. I have yet to find how I can disable it from having a context sensitive menu.<p>This is what I think stands up the FSF, FOSS, and some of the push back on Ubuntu&#x27;s new package manager. If the supplier wants to innovate their way - more power to them. But provide an opt out option for God sakes. The enlightened Nanny state is something that at least for me, is wholly intolerable.<p>Apple has a lot of overpaid, and under utilized programmers apparently: they&#x27;ve wormed themselves into every possible interaction in all permutations of all power sets of all keyboard, mouse, track pad scenarios so that if you blink wrong it runs Reddit for you. Fuck that.<p>(After I wrote about this, and got that off my mind, I think I fixed it. But geez it wasn&#x27;t obvious.)')
