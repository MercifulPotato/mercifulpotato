The card holder<p>1. The card brand (TreeCard)<p>2. The issuing bank (unknown right now, but this is usually a bank like HSBC, Citi, Wells Fargo, etc)<p>3. The card network itself (MasterCard)<p>4. The merchant<p>5. The merchant&#x27;s acquirer (Square, for example)<p>6. The merchant&#x27;s acquiring bank (whoever Square uses as their baking provider)<p>Each entity other than the card holder and the merchant charge fees. The card holder _sometimes_ is charged a fee, but in this case TreeCard does not. The merchant is always charged a fee (which they can pass onto the customer in certain countries&#x2F;circumstances).<p>The per-transaction fee the merchant pays is split between the card network and the issuing bank. The issuing bank then generally will share a portion of this revenue with the card brand.<p>Merchants are also charged by their acquiring bank, either on a per-transaction basis or a flat monthly fee.')
