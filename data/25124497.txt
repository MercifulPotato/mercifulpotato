Do you always commit everything before pulling?<p>You also need the log daily to know things like &quot;what changes made it into this build&quot;, or almost everytime I fix a merge conflict, to understand why something is the way it is.<p>I can grant that cherry-pick &amp; blame are more rarely used, though blame is often on by default in many editors, and cherry-pick is something my team does daily around every release (since we don&#x27;t want to merge the trunk into the release branch the day of the release for 1 bugfix).')
