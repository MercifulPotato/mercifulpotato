But obviously Obama, Obamacare, &amp; racism played big role too.<p>It&#x27;s palpable and poll-able how pissed off everyone except the top top % is.<p>I work in Democratic politics, am a relatively good earner, clearly engaged, and I&#x27;m pissed. I have a hard time understanding the other side (MAGA) but they seem even more angry all around - enough to attempt to murder Congress.<p>Maybe the best hope we have is the &#x27;working class&#x27; (at this point I would categorize that as anyone making under $500k) getting pushed so far that we see real change to redistribute wealth and power back down.<p>I&#x27;m skeptical though because the other type of political polarization doesn&#x27;t help; half these voters identify more for Trump &#x2F; religious issues than their own interests.')
