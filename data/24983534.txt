It&#x27;s one thing to be mistaken for subtle or deep reasons and say &quot;this is how science works&quot;.  It&#x27;s another to be sloppy and say &quot;this is how science works&quot;.  I&#x27;m not even saying scientists shouldn&#x27;t ever be sloppy, you should definitely start sloppy and there&#x27;s also a sense in which if observations are reproducible across sloppy setups it&#x27;s more robust - but also, maybe <i>one should not take out a headline-grabbing presser</i> based on sloppy or shaky work.<p>And it&#x27;s hard to argue that the social structure of contemporary scientific discovery doesn&#x27;t incentives this sort of sloppiness.')
