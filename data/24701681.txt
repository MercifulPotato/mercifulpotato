The test data (input&#x2F;expected output) was anyway in the Excel sheet, so why not. We did not have other software available at the time, so Excel+VBA it is.<p>It was one of my nicest testing gigs ever. A test session would take only minutes, all results documented to the t. And fiddling around with the test data was so easy. Would be interesting to know if this thing is still in use.<p>Not sure the customer liked it that much, I regression tested the 6 previous - still running - versions of the service, something no one had cared to do for years. We found bugs both in the Spec and in the Code for nearly all old versions...')
