I didn&#x27;t say that there was more sex going on, not that student debt was great, not that Tinder was awesome.<p>Your whole argument seems to be &#x27;there is less sex available because fewer people want to have sex&#x27;. This is, of course, a somewhat one-sided view of the situation. It does not contradict my suggestion that younger people are choosing to have less sex. Nor does it disprove the theory that the availability of alternatives to in-person sex has made it less attractive.')
