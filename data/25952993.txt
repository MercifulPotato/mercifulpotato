Item(by='vkou', descendants=None, kids=[25953773], score=None, time=1611887782, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25950896, text='I&#x27;m not entirely sure if I&#x27;m the idiot, or if the talking lady on television is, but what she is saying sounds like complete nonsense.<p>It sounds like nonsense, because what she&#x27;s describing is not Robinhood&#x27;s problem. The shorts are predominantly being done by hedge funds (with only a few retail investors here and there). Hedge funds aren&#x27;t trading on retail platforms, like Robinhood. It&#x27;s not Robinhood&#x27;s problem that the hedge funds are being eaten alive on margins, or if the hedge funds are having problems with the clearing houses.<p>If margins, and the Robinhood&#x2F;clearing house relationship were the problem, then Robinhood would stop people from opening new margin positions on GME. But that&#x27;s not the case, here. They are preventing people from entering non-margin long positions.<p>Do you have a different take on this?<p>Edit: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25951475" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25951475</a> seems to be a different take on this. One that makes a lot more sense then the lady on television. The tl;dr of it is that even for a simple, non-margin stock trade, RobinHood needs to put dollars up as collateral... And they ran out of dollars.')
