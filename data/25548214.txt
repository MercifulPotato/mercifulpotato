Item(by='et1337', descendants=None, kids=[25549582, 25548335, 25549252], score=None, time=1609034908, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25547716, text='Another reason to use cursors is to avoid the problem of repeated or skipped elements caused by concurrent edits. If you use offsets and you’re on page 10, and someone deletes an item on page 1, the whole list shifts and you can accidentally skip an item on page 11. Likewise if someone adds an item on page 1 and you’re on page 10, one of the page 10 items will also show up on page 11.<p>Cursors elegantly sidestep these issues.')
