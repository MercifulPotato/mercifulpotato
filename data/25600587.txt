Yet it still makes economic sense in many situations.<p>Why would people invest capital in capture technology that only gets used a fraction of the time? Whether it be at a solar plant, or a refinary, people will choose to invest that capital where it&#x27;s use can be maximized. There are certainly situations where it makes sense economically, but many where it doesn&#x27;t, and more situations where the capital can be better spent elsewhere.<p>Similarly, if a hypothetical town gets 15kw solar power during the day, and 15kw of hydro or wind during night, and needs 20kw backup&#x2F;surge capacity from gas&#x2F;nuclear&#x2F;other, you&#x27;ve designed a system that requires a surplus of capacity, not just in generation, but also in transmission and distribution. In that context, surplus==inefficiencies.<p>This can be somewhat minimized by so-called smart-grid technology, but people tend to focus on technical capabilities and not what makes economical sense, which is much more limiting than people realize.')
