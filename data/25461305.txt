Here are four ways to increase one&#x27;s wealth, which of the four is an extraction:<p>1. Earning a salary. Generally speaking, the larger the organization and the higher the position the higher the salary.<p>2. Investing in stock. The more a company grows, the more valuable the stock becomes, the more the investor&#x27;s stock is worth.<p>3. Owning a home. The more people there are, and the more desirable a location is, the more valuable the property is, and the more the home is worth.<p>4. Owning a business. The harder and smarter your work, the more the business is worth. As the owner, that grows your wealth.<p>How do these methods of increasing wealth make it worse for other people? Or are you referring to another way? For example, a drug pusher who gets people hooked and then sells them drugs is for sure extracting. Or a monopolist who can charge any price he wishes is extracting if he chooses to exploit that position.<p>However, the majority of wealthy people are not of that type.')
