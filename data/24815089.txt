My boss&#x2F;team expect me to work on The Things We Agreed on, in The Order We Agreed On, and I&#x27;m expected to start as soon as I wrap up my WIP from our last round of planning.<p>Sometimes I get deadlines, and sometimes it&#x27;s more that the team expressed confidence we could do certain tasks in a certain amount of time each, and then someone went and made a GANTT chart planning our whole next quarter, even though everyone knows it&#x27;ll get changed up in a couple weeks, because the business needs to make related plans. Then the schedule is treated a plan and not a prediction, and people get frowny when you don&#x27;t hit target dates because they&#x27;re also being held to not-really-plans they based on your schedule.<p>There are plenty of legitimate (and illegitimate) reasons the business would want to hold you to a date pulled out of thin air, but for this discussion the important point is that the entire system is predicated against rogue individuals making unilateral plans to prioritize or delay work for opaque, arbitrary reasons without the involvement of the stakeholders who presumably were the impetus for those tasks. I.e., &quot;theme days&quot;, 1-3-5, etc. don&#x27;t seem workable in the environments I&#x27;ve worked in.')
