Given the insidiousness of the problem (and the psychological cost it has imposed on a generation of engineers; not to mention the sheer time cost) -- public exposure, followed by heaping mounds of ridicule (you can call that &quot;complaining&quot; if you like) would seem to be not only a valid, but unfortunately necessary part of our suppression strategy.<p>Otherwise, the people who keep foisting these questions us (as if they were a cool and nifty way to size up candidates) -- just aren&#x27;t going to get it through their heads.<p><i>Personally, I would like to see what people thing about the actual solution to this particular problem...</i><p>I used to enjoy solving problems like these, during my high school and college years.  Sometimes really, really enjoy it.<p>But now that I build real systems for a living (which generally involves much meatier problems to solve) -- and it&#x27;s become part of the standard hazing process in far too many shops, for far too long -- I couldn&#x27;t begin to care less.')
