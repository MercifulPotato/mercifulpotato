Heck, running big debts on credit cards is a pretty unique US thing, because usually the limits are either little and&#x2F;or the interest rate is prohibitive.<p>I agree the risk taking is smaller in Europe,  but if you need a loan go talk to your bank, putting a debt in a credit card is a stupid idea period even in the US.')
