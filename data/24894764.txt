Sure they still have the occasional accident, but it <i>feels</i> (I don&#x27;t have any data) that reliability is improving dramatically? It felt before like the rocket blowing up on take off was a bit of a high-odds roll the dice thing, but already even SpaceX <i>landings</i> have become somewhat routine.<p>I think USNT&#x27;s fuel canisters are inert outside of the reactor and something small like 2cm-diameter each (1).  Maybe stick the fuel canisters in a Dragon-type capsule complete with escape system for extra peace-of-mind? Send the reactor up in a cargo launcher, then have astronauts load the fuel in orbit?<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;usnc.com&#x2F;fcm-fuel&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;usnc.com&#x2F;fcm-fuel&#x2F;</a>')
