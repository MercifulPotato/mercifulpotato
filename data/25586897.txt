While there certainly <i>do</i> exist instances of labor without consent in the world today, Chobani employees seem a pretty far cry from that.<p>Likewise, in nearly all businesses, there is an added value to the employees that justifies the ceding of a share of the fruits of one&#x27;s labor. Someone working at a full-time job <i>always</i> provides more value to their company than their paycheck provides in the long run. In return, however, you get benefits that you wouldn&#x27;t otherwise: a stable and predictable paycheck, the ability to specialize in one area, institutional stability, existing business relationships that you can utilize.<p>I definitely agree that there are lots of mismatches between business practices and what employees would prefer (I tend to be pretty content with my career compensation, but I would definitely rather they paid me more, without question). To say that the profits reserved for a business are taken without consent from the laborers, however, seems disingenuous at best: if employees truly weren&#x27;t getting any advantage from working at a company, what reason would there possibly be from not just doing the exact same work for themselves and reserving <i>all</i> the profits for themselves? It seems that the advantages of an employee-employer relationship are taken for granted until the alternative option of labor-without-an-employer is explored.<p>To be clear, I think workers starting their own businesses and deciding that they would be better off doing something different (e.g. worker-owned models or co-ops) is fantastic! However, I also think that businesses which decide to take a portion of their labor force&#x27;s work as profit are also totally fine and reasonable, even from an employee&#x27;s point of view.')
