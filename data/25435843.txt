I also think it&#x27;s become just another &quot;Terms and Conditions&quot; - something that people reflexively accept because they want to get on with using a product.<p>Future regulations with teeth, but don&#x27;t exist yet, are things like:<p>- Data portability: I should be able to export my entire Facebook account in full in a standardized format and easily transfer it to any other social network of my choosing.<p>- Algorithmic control: I should be able to choose which recommendation algorithms are being used on me, or opt out of algorithms entirely.<p>- Algorithmic transparency: As a consumer, I should be able to see something similar to what Facebook&#x27;s growth team sees. What specific changes caused people in my cohort to increase their watch time by 2%? Was it better button placement, which I&#x27;d be okay with, or was it an increase in conspiracy content, which might not be?<p>All of these things might be huge overhauls and difficult for the social media companies to deliver, but if you are pushing content in front of billions of people&#x27;s faces for hours a day you should have an equivalent immense level of responsibility.')
