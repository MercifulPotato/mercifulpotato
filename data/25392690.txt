These platforms are designed for feedback loops. That has nothing to do with free speech or a legal protection to spread libel.<p>People need to realize that ANY website where a user submits content for is not classified as free speech.\nA tweet isn’t free speech.\nA post on Reddit isn’t free speech.\nThese are “articles and or content provided by the public for enhancements to our platform” or whatever EULA legalese they use.<p>Yeah, like I said, banning a bunch of videos from one genre right now looks bad and people have a right to be upset over it.

Specialized businesses based on a supply of value from another business. It’s not a sustainable model for anyone on the 3rd rung.')
