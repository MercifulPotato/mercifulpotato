You can&#x27;t escape that which you can&#x27;t see. A high-altitude UAV is the nightmare, whether it shoots missiles or bullets. We&#x27;re just used to them (but not being a target of them), so it doesn&#x27;t feel so scary as imaginary close combat with a robot.<p>(To this day I remember this one thing about US drone strikes in Pakistan I read in an article many years ago: the people living there became literally <i>afraid of the blue sky</i> - as the drone strikes tended to happen during good weather. That&#x27;s terror.)')
