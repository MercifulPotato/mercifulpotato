Kind of the same but with more choice with the original Unix vendors forced by competition to adopt Linux.<p>- Kubernetes and the ecosystem around it will make zero sense  for you if you haven&#x27;t adopted &quot;devops culture&quot; (meaning that at the very least devs care about operations and IT guys put their things in git) AND you use microservices or the very least more than ten different servies or replicas.<p>- Vendor spam is real. YAGNI most of the time. But also different strokes for different folks.<p>- If you think that many cloud native things are just classic open source software needlessly rewritten in Golang and overengineered - you are probably right.')
