This notion of objective journalism is a US disease, and it needs to be stamped out as rapidly and as widely as possible. I view NPR as an excellent source of reporting on &quot;people&#x27;s lives as they experience them&quot; and &quot;the political status quo&quot;. I would never dream of considering NPR to be how I found out about ideas and practices outside of the political status quo - that&#x27;s just not what they (or any other mainstream media) does.')
