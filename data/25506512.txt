But as larger sensor appear (to my surprise - a sensor is a fixed area of Si!) to become cheaper to make I think this problem will go away.<p>Also, these are problems that companies like Apple excel at smashing. Apple disdains what the consumer thinks they want and they have a legion of fan boys to become early adopters and proselytize the masses. Incidentally, I think the founder of Lytro now works for Apple.')
