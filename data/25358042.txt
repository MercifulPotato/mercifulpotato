Bluetooth on Linux isn&#x27;t great, that&#x27;s totally true, but a big source of problems is the device makers.  They often test against only the system they are targeting, and leave the rest.  Nearly every bluetooth implementation has issues, but the Linux one is never tested&#x2F;developed with like others.<p>&gt; <i>Then there are minor annoyances like plugging in an external monitor and keyboard to a closed laptop (thinkpad) and not having it wake up (need to open and close the case), or closing the case but then the power management doesn’t work properly so if it’s not plugged in to power, then when I open it the next day the battery is drained and the laptop has shutdown - losing any unsaved state.</i><p>I agree, this is insanely stupid.  By all means I don&#x27;t think things are perfect yet, but they are definitely better than they used to be.  There are also easy things you can do to avoid these things, such as sleeping your laptop from the Gnome widget (or just run `systemctl suspend -i`) and it works every time.  just open the lid to resume working.  It&#x27;s annoying that you have to do that for sure, but in my opinion learning simple workflow changes like that aren&#x27;t a big deal in exchange for the FLOSS aspects, but everyone is different.  Choice is what makes things great!')
