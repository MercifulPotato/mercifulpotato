I think I can handle that :-)<p>It would have cost twice as much to run everything with the generator, and that isn&#x27;t really necessary, so it&#x27;s a smaller one.<p>I worried about the battery being dead and no way to hand crank the generator, so I made sure that the generator could be started from a car battery or one of those zap-o-matic car jumpstarters.
