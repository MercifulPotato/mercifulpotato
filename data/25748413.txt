Item(by='jgimenez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610466515, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25728453, text='&quot;Guaranteeing&quot; is a strong word. For now they want manufacturers to label products with the estimated time it&#x27;s going to last. I&#x27;m not sure if this is going to be useful at all if there is no economic incentive (eg. offering a warranty during that time frame).<p>Example: Opel just stopped providing the OnStar service, rendering the hardware useless. My car is only 3 years old, still under warranty, but they&#x27;re no longer providing service (nor offering an alternative == a repair)')
