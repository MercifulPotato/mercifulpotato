You had to take cash and pay the host directly.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;6f-how-to-plan-an-mvp<p>He also made the point that you need to stop thinking of your MVP as &quot;special&quot; and think of it like you are looking for an old shirt in your closet to paint in and destroy. And I really liked that.<p>I also remember reading a comment on HN by a YC company saying they didn&#x27;t even have any tech yet. They were doing intake via email and manually pairing up matches in their two-sided market.<p>I searched the web for &quot;pre tech MVP&quot; and it thinks I typoed that. I searched HN and I like the top comment on this piece, but the article is no longer even available:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=1503867<p>Personal anecdotes, links to articles or suggested search terms are all equally welcome.')
