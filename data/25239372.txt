I&#x27;m paying them money, and if it wasn&#x27;t for the hope I have that maybe this is just a (way too long) blip, I&#x27;d switch over to normal Mullvad tomorrow (which they&#x27;re using on the backend anyway).<p>It&#x27;s not just a priorities shift when you&#x27;re doing badly at both things and losing incredible people, it&#x27;s straight-up organizational dysfunction and managerial incompetence.')
