I ended up skipping through the book and skimming past dialogue as it was so bad that it hurt to read. But the idea of the book was utterly fascinating, and I still think about it now and then, years after reading it. Definitely worth reading (or skimming) if you are the type that likes science fiction for the big ideas.')
