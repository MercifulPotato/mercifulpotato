My Swift lang knowledge is pretty decent, but many jobs I would like to apply for require &quot;experience with C&#x2F;C++&quot;. Having a good understanding of Swift and general concepts of programming language I&#x27;m wondering what to do... Learn C&#x2F;C++ and do some OpenSource work before applying? Tell them &quot;Hey, I don&#x27;t fulfill your requirements, but here is my application. Oh an no worries I will be able to read your C code somehow&quot;?')
