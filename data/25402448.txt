Certainly SaaSs don&#x27;t let you choose a dot release for the most part.<p>Not all of us are happy with having to follow the update treadmill. Software is a tool, like an electric drill; one doesn&#x27;t update their electric drill every day, otherwise we would be wasting all our time updating and dealing with the fallout of updates, instead of drilling holes in wood. If you develop (or do anything) on top of software, you want a stable base, instead of one shifting all the time; one builds castles in rock, not in quicksand.')
