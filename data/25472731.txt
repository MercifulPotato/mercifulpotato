Back when I was a gen-x kid amsat was about 20 years old and had just barely broken two digits of launched satellites and there were never more than a couple in orbit at a time.  Now a days there&#x27;s two digits of ham radio satellites launched per year...<p>The satnogs project is pretty interesting to see what goes into the ground station for a small satellite.  Maybe start there.<p>AFAIK other than some obscure situations involving the ISS and some APRS satellites, there has never been any AMSAT multi-satellite networking, but at the current incredible rate of expansion I&#x27;d expect to see hobbyists having something like that by 2030 or so.')
