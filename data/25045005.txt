Item(by='alkdjalsdjad', descendants=None, kids=[25045240], score=None, time=1605009692, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25044877, text='That is the most stupid comparison I have seen lately in HN. A kid &quot;with a grudge and a stick&quot; could likely never &quot;flip you off your expensive shinny horse&quot; because, well, sticks cannot do that. The AK kid can kill you because, I don&#x27;t know if you are aware of this, AKs can shoot things from distance.<p>Also, AKs kill you when a shot hits your head&#x2F;torso. A stick won&#x27;t kill you on-hit. Being a knight also meant having proper armor and training.<p>Of course a kid could kill a knight, say, in their sleep, but in that case being a knight would be irrelevant, and the most appropriate description would be: a kid killed a sleeping person.')
