Privacy, security and harm&#x2F;abuse mitigation <i>must</i> be one of the considerations when you&#x27;re writing a project. This isn&#x27;t even anonymity, these are basic safeguards one should put in place. Not doing so is like selling a car with no seatbelts, and arguing that there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that unless you&#x27;re specifically manufacturing to defend against car crashes.<p>This isn&#x27;t like the argument about how many tests you should have and what kind; this absolutely must be one of the key things to consider when you&#x27;re creating a project that&#x27;s going to be used by people to communicate with one another.')
