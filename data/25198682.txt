Science can tell you how little product material you need so that it performs to spec and it can tell you how much you need so that it&#x27;ll perform it&#x27;s function as long as possible. The balance informs the price of the product but politically capitalism wants you to prefer a low price, similar to how capitalism will prefer no quarantine and lockdown.')
