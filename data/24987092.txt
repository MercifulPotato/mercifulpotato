At least they should have let you mark values as immutable, or communicated entirely via copying like Erlang.)<p>Yes, tuples are a really weird thing with Go.  If they had completely left them, that would be bad but sort of defendable.  But instead they give you a half-baked implementation of some of what tuples do with their &#x27;multiple return types&#x27;.<p>(And multiple return types aren&#x27;t even a good fit for signaling errors.  For error-handling you want to return _either_ the result _or_ the error, in a way that the compiler can check that you handled the error.<p>Instead as far as the types are concerned they are always returning both the result and an error, and human reviewers have to make sure that they are checked properly.)')
