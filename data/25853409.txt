I don&#x27;t know the exact process details, but integration density has been going up( putting gates vertical with FinFET), together with better electrostatic control (GAAFET, kind of a step uf from FDSOI), while gate length remains the same.<p>Think about it this way: you&#x27;re doping semiconductors by adding a few other atoms. On the order of 1 dopant atom per 1M intrinsic (undopped) semiconductor. How thin can you make it before there&#x27;s only a dozen dopant atoms? And then, how do you make sure they are evenly distributed? And in the same way across multiple transistors, to guarantee a consistent performance? Yield is key, at this scale.<p>Technically, they can still improve density by embracing 3D. A friend of mine works on multi-gate vertical nanowire transistors, for instance, but that&#x27;s still a few years (or a decade?) away from the fab.')
