Some of these parts have never been the case - MongoDB has never been &quot;eventually consistent&quot; - updates are streamed and applied sequentially to secondary nodes, so although they might be behind, they&#x27;re never inconsistent.<p>This is what eventually consistent means! If i wrote (key=X, value=Y) to a primary, then read X and see a value thats not Y (because the secondary node hasn&#x27;t caught up yet), that is inconsistency. Strong consistency (e.g in a single node SQL database) would mean its impossible to read stale values.')
