I want to allow people to raise and issue, and then crowdfund a bounty for it. And I think that adding a minimum dollar amount would limit people posting new issues.<p>But I also don&#x27;t want the site filled up with $0.00 issues.<p>If anything, I may do a small minimum. Like $5, so that way every issue has some value to it.<p>And for #2: I&#x27;d like to add in some collaboration features so people could split the bounty if they both worked on the solution.')
