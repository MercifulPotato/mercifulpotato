Item(by='enriquto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609276396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25574535, text='&gt; In my opinion it&#x27;s math not python which got the matrix multiply operator wrong. It&#x27;s not commutative so it shouldn&#x27;t be written with the same operator as the regular product.<p>The &quot;regular product&quot; in math is never intended to be commutative (e.g., the product in a group or in a ring, and that includes the matrix product).  If you want to indicate that an operator is commutative, in math, you use always the &quot;+&quot; operator.  Thus, it is python that gets it wrong by using a blatantly commutative operator for non-commutative operations such as string concatenation.  That python was designed by a mathematician adds sadness to this notational tragedy.')
