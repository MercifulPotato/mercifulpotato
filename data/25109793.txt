All Science started this way i.e. an attempt to model&#x2F;understand the World and one&#x27;s place in it.<p>Faith in the context of Organized Religion&#x2F;Rituals without understanding the Philosophy behind it should be rejected. Doesn&#x27;t matter who is pushing it.<p>There are Six major accepted schools of &quot;Orthodox&quot; philosophies under the umbrella term &quot;Hinduism&quot;. But due to historical reasons, at current time the Vedanta&#x2F;Upanishadic school is dominant and is conflated with the whole of &quot;Hinduism&quot; which is obviously not true. You might want to look into the different schools of Hindu Philosophy and see what appeals to you and model your life after it. Note that the Hindu philosophies span the entire spectrum from Vedas&#x2F;Mimamsa Rituals&#x2F;Sannyasa Upanishadic Renunciation to totally materialistic Charvaka&#x2F;Lokayata belief systems. Whatever you choose should be in accordance (to a certain extent) with &quot;Modern Science&quot; to avoid&#x2F;control cognitive dissonance.<p>PS: You might want to look into the set of volumes by S.N.Dasgupta named <i>A History of Indian Philosophy</i>. Vol-I gives an overview of all systems.')
