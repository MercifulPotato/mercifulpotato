I am assuming the plan actually makes sense, and that when you compare the three-headed tunnel, the two tunnels, and the tunnel &amp; bridge solutions, and all of the maintenance and externalities of roads connecting them, the three-headed tunnel is no more expensive, and trying to think of reasons this may be.  If the plan is actually more expensive, or if no counter-proposals were considered, this is all somewhat moot.]')
