It is of purely theoretical interest to complexity theorists.<p>In our universe it remains unknown if there are problems that can be solved efficiently by a quantum computer but not by any classical algorithm.  It is known that BQP is contained in P^#P, so proving such a result would require separating P from P^#P, which is probably nearly as difficult as separating P from NP.')
