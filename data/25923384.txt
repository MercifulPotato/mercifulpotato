I hope that their business model succeeds, and am happy to be supporting them.<p>The Bronze --&gt; Premium transition seems to me to be a valid price restructuring, and this will prompt us to upgrade to Premium rather than downgrade to Free.<p>However,<p>- Ultimate seems like minimal value for substantial extra cost. There&#x27;s no way we could ever justify it.<p>- The collaboration model is terrible. We would love to introduce lots of our clients to gitlab as part of a collaboration - thereby increasing gitlab&#x27;s mindshare, install base, and potential customer base - but the price tag attached to inviting a previously-free-tier collaborator doesn&#x27;t make sense for us.<p>- Premium needs to include Jira-killing features. Do that and we&#x27;re yours probably for life.')
