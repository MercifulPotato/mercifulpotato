It is about screenwriting, but I transposed so much to programming and writing it&#x27;s ridiculous.<p>The way to create characters, plot, or get ideas. The plot is one problem and characters solve it. One thing and one thing only. The job to be done [of a movie] is to entertain an audience, don&#x27;t get gradiose or too tied to it.<p>As a programmer, I watched the videos and with every video, there was a clear application to programming and design.<p>Advice on writing, in general, and observing good products evolutions lead me to increase my effectiveness: not building the wrong thing, better scoping, solving the right problem. This leads to a lot of code not written, and reduces unnecessary complexity.<p>I have of course read some of the books you mention, but I find that simplifying things delays the need to resort to some patterns. You often find code that does practically nothing but filled with observers and borgs and factories and whatnot. It&#x27;s useless and doesn&#x27;t solve a problem. If it were a display of patterns skills, maybe, but that&#x27;s why I did Judo and not Aikido. I like things that work in real life against actual problems, not imaginary or compliant adversaries.')
