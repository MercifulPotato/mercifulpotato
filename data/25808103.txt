Item(by='not_knuth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610857472, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25804014, text='A bunch of quotes can be found on the Wikiquote page on Feynman [0] together with the proper references, but these two stand out:<p><i>“What I cannot create, I do not understand.”</i><p><i>“Once I asked him to explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin-1&#x2F;2 particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. Gauging his audience perfectly, he said, ‘I&#x27;ll prepare a freshman lecture on it.’ But a few days later he came to me and said: ‘You know, I couldn&#x27;t do it. I couldn&#x27;t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don&#x27;t understand it.’“</i><p>His book <i>Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!</i> also has a couple of anecdotes where he solves people&#x27;s problems by asking them questions and trying to understand them. Unfortunately I read this some time back and the exact page numbers escape me.<p>Generally, if you search for <i>Feynman Technique</i> you&#x27;ll find anything in the direction of &quot;explain it to someone to understand&quot;, but I think there is a lot of misattribution going on here. Like Einstein, people love to stick his name on things.<p>And finally, an indirect, but in my opinion well-summarized reference to the way Feynman learned, was in the <i>Richard Feynman</i> section of Lex Friedman&#x27;s 118th podcast [1].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikiquote.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Richard_Feynman#Quotes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikiquote.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Richard_Feynman#Quotes</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;U_6AYX42gkU?t=452" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;U_6AYX42gkU?t=452</a> (with exact starting time)')
