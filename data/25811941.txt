Most tasks take less than or much more time than around 30 seconds. This is the division I roughly take for running locally or in cloud. At least that&#x27;s the workflow for me and most developers I know of. Having a desktop forces you to work in just one position and this could could cause a lot of obvious inconveniences like not being able to work in cafe or in both home and office.')
