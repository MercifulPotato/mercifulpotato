That or its a bit like atlas, holding up the burden of capitalism.<p>Either way the internet is still just a big ip network. You can still setup a vps and run your own email, website, rss, blog, etc. And I know some people (masochists, psychos?;-) who do but they do that admin work for a living. Yeah, you gotta roll up your sleeves but that&#x27;s just life: you have to work for it. These companies prey on human laziness and &quot;free&quot; stuff.<p>Just stop using garbage services and take back control. I&#x27;m one of those technological troglodytes who refuses to participate in most modern web nonsense. I have a smart phone with only a few utilitarian programs. I don&#x27;t use any social media. I use bandcamp to stream&#x2F;download my music collection which I paid outright for. I don&#x27;t have any smart appliances, TV&#x27;s or IoT trash. My life is fine and I have plenty of friends and a social life. Don&#x27;t let anyone fool you into thinking you need to drink the dumpster juice internet koolaid.')
