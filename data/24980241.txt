Item(by='technotarek', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1604415915, title='Tell HN: Is T-Mobile Leaking Private Account Info?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='We have a friends and family type account with T-Mobile, where I&#x27;m the primary account holder. Some of the account holders, which don&#x27;t even share the same mailing address as us, are receiving text messages (specifically political ones) with my name in it. This suggests that somehow the sender knows that I&#x27;m affiliated with another phone number, even though I&#x27;m not the  phone number&#x27;s actual assignee. Is T-Mobile leaking data, where leak could either mean willing selling the data or might it have a vulnerability where the data is being extracted somehow?<p>The only other explanation I can think of is that T-Mobile is allowing a mail-merge of sorts that allows advertisers to blast to phone numbers on T-Mobile&#x27;s system and that T-Mobile is injecting my name (incorrectly) after the fact.')
