It seems like over the years the focus has shifted to privacy being the ultimate goal, and every other aspect of the mission happens in the name of privacy.  And there&#x27;s no acceptance of the idea that some well-informed people are willing to make a decision to sacrifice some privacy in exchange for convenience or cost, anybody who considers sacrificing some of their own privacy is treated as a moron who needs to be protected from themselves.')
