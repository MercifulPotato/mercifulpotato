Here&#x27;s why that&#x27;s dangerous for struggling drivers like me&quot; and the submission was eliding portions of that.<p>Your link and criticism are entirely inapt. The title was not using the dash for emphasis, and even if it were, it would have been inappropriate. The examples in the article you link are of a dash making a <i>break in the chain of thought</i> more emphatic. Dashes are not used to emphasize enclosed text itself.')
