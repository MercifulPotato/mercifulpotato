After seeming like they were really on the brink for a few years there, not really knowing how to do digital, they turned it around - apparently by doubling down on this approach. High-minded clickbait for right-thinking elites, in other words. Have a look at their &quot;most popular articles&quot; box and you&#x27;ll frequently see some breathless, hysterical stuff.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, too, because a majority of their content is probably still pretty good! Their pandemic coverage is a good example. But their editorial staff need engagement and they&#x27;re gonna drive it by pushing the same &quot;dark&quot; buttons (fear, anger) that everyone else pushes these days. Ironic they&#x27;re doing it in a critical article about Facebook.')
