I am making a distinction between OLTP workloads for the online applications that need a feature vector (i.e., a row of data) to make an individual prediction, and a client that is creating train&#x2F;test data from millions of rows of data (features) - that is the OLAP workload.<p>To be more concrete, Feast is an open-source Feature Store built on BigQuery and originally BigTable. But the latency of BigTable for the OLTP workload was too high for GoJEK (feature lookup is just one part of making a prediction), so they switched to Redis. Redis PK lookups are a couple of ms, on average, compared with 10+ ms for BigTable. What is the latency of a PK lookup on snowflake? It ain&#x27;t a millisecond or two. On MySQL Cluster (NDB), our online feature store, PK lookups return in sub-ms latency on dedicated hardware.')
