But the average person probably couldn&#x27;t gain access to a significant multicast group without first gaining the &quot;backing&quot; of their group. And they could then attempt to grow from there. Clearly that&#x27;s far from perfect as echo chambers are an issue today as well! But it does feel to me like the lack of friction, coupled with nearly instant access to a global, un-namespaced platform, and the ability to broadcast, has just removed a little too much friction. I guess the big challenge is working out how to add enough appropriate friction to improve the situation. Or do we need to revert to a more namespaced internet again?')
