Again, something that could be false.<p>The idea that literally dozens of times he directly and clearly denounced white white supremacy, that he practically couldn&#x27;t shut up for four years about all the great things he was doing for black people, that he passed the criminal justice reform bill, that he funded historically black colleges more than any administration in history, that he created opportunity zones to bring investment into black communities... He&#x27;s going around the country bragging about these things constantly, but his off the cuff response in a press conference where he reaffirms his belief that there were some non-racist statue supporters... That&#x27;s when the real truth came out, that was his big signal to the white supremacists that he was on their side in spite of significant policies and repeatedly proclaiming the opposite.  That&#x27;s a wild belief.')
