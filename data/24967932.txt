We have no car (neither myself not my wife even have a driver&#x27;s license) but we have a cargo-bike for taking the kids places &amp; regular bicycles when we go alone (or when one person is riding the cargo bike and the other isn&#x27;t).<p>They are not even electric (although sometimes I wish they were) and this is very common for urban German families. If it is impractical in US cities it is only because they were built that way.<p>When we have to go long distance we take trains (that often have an extra car for taking bikes with you).')
