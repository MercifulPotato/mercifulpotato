Taxes are a rounding error (or literally zero) when you&#x27;re small and not making any money, which will be the first several years of a startup&#x27;s life.  When you get big you can hire an army of lawyers and accountants to keep all your money in Ireland and avoid them.  Regulations just get ignored.   When you&#x27;re small, you&#x27;re too little a fish to go after; the regulators are busy suing Uber and Lyft and Facebook and Google.  When you get big, you can hire an army of lobbyists and PR people to change the regulation, just like Uber and Lyft did.')
