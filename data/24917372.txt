Do you want to be the ebb of that great tide, and revert back to the beast rather than overcome mankind? What is the ape to a man? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. And just so shall a man be to the Overman: a laughing-stock, a thing of shame. You have evolved from worm to man, but much within you is still worm. Once you were apes, yet even now man is more of an ape than any of the apes.</i><p>- Nietzche<p>The issue with this &quot;only the present matters&quot; shallow take is that the imagined future <i>does</i> matter in terms of the present. In other words, your imagined future influences your actions in the present, often to such a degree that it actually forms the future. If you discard these imagined futures, you end up with a &quot;Eh, I have no agency anyway, why bother with difficult things?&quot; and slide into an apathetic, presentist hedonism.<p>The game is about constructing imagined futures which are productive and optimistic, not simply checking out entirely.')
