It&#x27;s an alternative HN web-client that I built and use as my default HN version nowadays. It features some layout improvements over the original and has a dark theme.<p>It is not yet feature complete (missing login, routing is broken in some rare cases) but I plan on improving it on my next &quot;lazy&quot; weekend and get a nice domain for it. I&#x27;m also going to publish the source code on GitHub.')
