States are self funding entities. The fed does give grants for some projects (bridges, rails, etc). Some states do receive more tax&#x2F;grant benefits than they give, but those funds are earmarked - states can&#x27;t use that money for any old reason.<p>&gt; Moreover, the federal government can use its resources to physically drive the vaccines around...<p>Correct, the Fed can help make resources available to the states but the states have to request and allow the resource. The fed for instance can have the military perform interstate logistics, or rent out all the frozen delivery trucks and lend them to states.<p>The fed can not force states to take the grants, or perform operations in the state without approval.<p>&gt; In your worldview, what is the purpose of the USA as opposed to 50 separate countries?<p>Alaska isn&#x27;t overly qualified to run a military, form treaties with foreign powers, regulate interstate commerce or run the FDA. The fed does have a place, but the fed doesn&#x27;t have the power to control states or boss them around (in theory - in practice federal grants do give a fair amount of power over many states). The fed is limited to interstate (that is, things involving multiple states) actions, and can&#x27;t dictate the internals of a state.')
