But these interactions don&#x27;t need to be defined by work. I work in caffe 10 meters from my apartment. Sit with laptop in the park. Meet with friends. I don&#x27;t drive, don&#x27;t use public transport, but walk an awful lot.<p>And thanks with great, mostly asynchronous communication at my workplace, I sleep as much as I want to, and work exactly when I feel like it, and never ever hear or see my colleagues — only text, mostly comments as opposed to instance messaging. Sometimes I just slack off for three days straight. Sometimes I go into work binge for a non-interrupted 20 hour refactoring session. Not even because there&#x27;s some deadline, feeling of responsibility or any other kind of negative motivation like that — just because I enjoy it and don&#x27;t want to stop!<p>I feel like I&#x27;ve been on vacation for the last three months, and yet repository stats show me that I&#x27;m more productive as I&#x27;ve ever been.<p>Oh, and the best thing about all of that? I live in a country with much lower cost of living than US, but thanks to headlines like this, I feel that I&#x27;ll soon be competing for exactly the same jobs and salaries that SF engineers.')
