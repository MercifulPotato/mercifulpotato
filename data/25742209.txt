And indeed, you seem to be describing a sounder response taken in AU, overall.<p>However, somewhat in defense of the OP, now that we have a good idea of who is vulnerable, as well as the enormous relative health, social, economic, and personal costs that the lockdown has caused to many who don&#x27;t have the luxury of a desk job, the claim that the lockdown is no longer justified (and hasn&#x27;t been for some time) is very justifiable.
