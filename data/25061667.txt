If you have hella money laying around, you could blitz out on some dehydrated meals, I think those are delicious. But they can come out to like, 9$ a serving or more. Packaged ramen is great for carbs and stores relatively compactly. Protein powder keeps well, but is only a supplement, not a meal.<p>On a budget, or if you just don&#x27;t want to splurge thousands on your food prep that should be recycled usually yearly, I&#x27;d say stash dried rice, dried beans, maybe some bagged tuna (I like it more than canned for storage reasons), and some dried fruit so ya don&#x27;t get scurvy.')
