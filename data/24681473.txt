Item(by='rbecker', descendants=None, kids=[24681644], score=None, time=1601838417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24681331, text='&gt; Isn&#x27;t it possible that actively recycling those devices is far better for the environment than allowing them to be resold to China and&#x2F;or end up in landfill?<p>In one scenario, a device keeps being used, it just changes hands. In another, it is recycled, using up energy and materials into making new products out of it, and throwing away what can&#x27;t be salvaged. And you think it&#x27;s <i>wild speculation</i> to claim the first scenario is less taxing on the environment than the second?<p>Oh but it&#x27;s explained by the completely sensible deduction that, if you sell someone a working device, they might throw it in a landfill. Why is the 2nd owner more likely to landfill it than the 1st? Does Apple vet buyers for environmentalism before it&#x27;ll sell phones to them?')
