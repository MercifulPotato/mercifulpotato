All I want to know is what platforms does it support, suprised they dont list that anywhere easy to find.<p>This blog based project home page obscures the relevant in favor of the recent.<p>Found the relevance on the About page.<p>&quot;Pygame is highly portable and runs on nearly every platform and operating system.&quot;<p>Would appreciate a list but Ok.<p>Oh snap here we go:<p>&quot;Truly portable. Supports Linux (pygame comes with most main stream linux distributions), Windows (95, 98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista, 64-bit Windows, etc), Windows CE, BeOS, MacOS, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, BSD&#x2F;OS, Solaris, IRIX, and QNX. The code contains support for AmigaOS, Dreamcast, Atari, AIX, OSF&#x2F;Tru64, RISC OS, SymbianOS and OS&#x2F;2, but these are not officially supported. You can use it on hand held devices, game consoles and the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) computer.&quot;<p>Wonder if it supports an HTML player?')
