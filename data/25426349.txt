He give me the land as his son. I split it in half and give half to a friend of mine. The investigation occurs and determine this land was stolen and should be returned. I don&#x27;t think the argument of, &quot;sorry won&#x27;t return it because I didn&#x27;t steal it, my dad did&quot; holds much water. Nor the argument of, &quot;nope I won&#x27;t return it because a friend of mine that has nothing to do with the theft is benefiting from it&quot; holds much water either as reasons for your family to not get their land returned.<p>And related, possession of stolen goods is a fairly common legal concept. Regardless of penalty, at minimum once discovered the goods are returned, even if they&#x27;d previously be sold or given to someone else.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Possession_of_stolen_goods#United_States" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Possession_of_stolen_goods#Uni...</a>')
