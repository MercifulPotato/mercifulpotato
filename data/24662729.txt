The problem is that &#x27;value creation&#x27; is not valued (particularly in the tech sector). There are plenty of highly paid bullshit jobs.<p>Tech corporations are essentially empty shells; their market caps are not based on the value that they create for society but on the rate of money printing by the reserve banks of the world.<p>Because tech corporations are not subjected to free market forces like everybody else, they eventually lose their ability to create new value (and the kinds of people who join these companies and stay there do not have a value creator mindset). Indeed, if you compare the price of S&amp;P500 companies relative to most stable-value commodities such as gold, it would seem that the S&amp;P500 hasn&#x27;t grown at all in the last 5 years. However, S&amp;P500 correlates strongly with the growth in M1 and M2 money supply. This indicates that the growth in nominal price of stocks in the past 5 years is entirely artificial.<p>Young tech workers cannot compete with corporations because the playing field is not even. If your competitor is getting free money from someone, how can you possibly compete with them in any market?<p>This is why all young people in tech these days are eventually absorbed into corporations. Whether through employment or phony acqui-hire. It&#x27;s also why big corporations like Google used to buy up startups and then kill the project immediately afterwards. It&#x27;s mostly phony money transfer with hidden motives and it&#x27;s not related to value creation.')
