It even has a loading screen because it&#x27;s much slower, and somehow also manages to show <i>less</i> content than the previous design.<p>If I remember correctly there was a brief period a while ago when they did use a JS-only &quot;web app&quot;, but then switched back to simple HTML with JS enhancements (and I seem to remember they announced that change with much pride).<p>Of course, there is always mobile.twitter.com that is still static-only and quite usable without JS, but IMHO Twitter is the perfect example of how the &quot;modern web&quot; is doing less with more.')
