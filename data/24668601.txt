(Yes, I know there are some limited options to do this on an iPhone that don&#x27;t involve jail breaking.  They all involve emulation and have limits to their usefulness.)  I like running an FTP server on my phone.  When combined with wireless tethering, it&#x27;s the only way to get data directly from a phone onto a government laptop.  There are plenty of hackerish&#x2F;security apps I use that are simply unavailable on the iPhone.  Sharing data between apps is now at least possible on an iPhone, but it&#x27;s still very cumbersome.  I understand the need for security, but it comes at a cost to performance or usability.<p>This is not an ideological issue.  Everyone else in my family has iPhones, and I use my iPad all the time.  It&#x27;s just a personal choice that is driven by my use cases for a phone.')
