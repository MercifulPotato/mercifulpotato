I&#x27;m also seeing &quot;20G&quot; cables that claim to only do 5G USB3, which is concerning &amp; confusing me quite a bit...<p>FWIW my confidence level on &quot;would an active TB3 cable work for USB3 if it had the proper bits set&quot; is somewhere along 66% to 75%; this is based on the SERDES in some (most?) TB3 host silicon being able to switch to USB3 to &quot;downgrade&quot; a port... meaning the electrical level can&#x27;t be all that different... but I haven&#x27;t dug into this.')
