This puts bounds on creatures. Unless there&#x27;s some crazy different way to compute I wouldn&#x27;t expect a being to be able to have strong cognitive functions and be the size of a fly. They would also have a difficult time building advanced machinery to get to galactic travel scales. Similarly I wouldn&#x27;t expect a creature the size of a Brontosaurus to become space faring. Because of their sizes they would have to consume significantly more resources to build simple things. A two story house probably couldn&#x27;t be created out of wood or other basic biological materials making it difficult to transition into even the stone age. They also require higher food because energy requirements aren&#x27;t linear. But think how much it costs to send a pound to space. Their first to space would be significantly more expensive.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean these things are impossible because maybe there are ways around them, but it certainty shifts the probabilities by quite a bit. Given our current understanding of biology <i>and</i> mechanics it makes it much more probable for creatures to be within the ballpark of our size (let&#x27;s say crow to elephant?).')
