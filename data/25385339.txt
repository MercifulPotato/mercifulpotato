Item(by='jsinai', descendants=None, kids=[25386029], score=None, time=1607692480, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25384183, text='&gt; I never really understood the combination of noise cancellation and home use only. I think noise cancellation really shines when out and about in public, like the subway. But I can&#x27;t imagine anyone using those things on the go, at least not where I live.<p>FYI here are some examples of why I swear by my noise cancellation headphones while working from home during a pandemic in a densely populated city:<p>- Washing machine and dishwasher running cycles during the day\n- The fridge vibrating at higher frequencies (don&#x27;t know much about fridge mechanics but this soemthing fridges to do maintain a certain temperature)\n- Other people in the household talking, cooking, making coffee, fetching cutlery and plates etc.\n- The high decible hum of delivery scooters&#x2F;mopeds usually accelerating much faster than they should in what is supposed to be a quiet road\n- Road noise from delivery vehicles which are heavier than your typical car<p>(ps admittedly the last two points are only a problem when I have the windows open but occassionaly someone revs an engine which can be heard through the windows)<p>- During summer months with the windows open, passers&#x27; by can be heard from my desk. I live on just off a &quot;quiet road&quot; in my city, my desk is on the first floor and is on the other side of the room from the road. Yet people&#x27;s conversations are loud enough to make a noise.<p>Individually there is little wrong with these sounds (except maybe mopeds which I wish were quieter) but collectively they cause noises during working hours for which I am grateful to have noise cancelling headphones at home.<p>PS I guess Apple are also targeting people who will take these to the office eventually.')
