Good fiducials make for distinct features that can easily be matched across different images.<p>It works best if you play into the algorithm used to find the point correspondences. One commonly used one is SIFT [1]. It&#x27;s a multi-step process where each step introduces some invariances, like scale invariance through convolution with gaussian kernels at different standard deviations to create a &#x27;scale space&#x27;, then doing blob detection in that space by looking at second derivative maxima and minima.<p>The matching process does of a lot of convolution, which is linear (so you can combine a gaussian and laplacian kernel and do both in one shot) and it can be nicely parallelized. The 8 hours of processing of ~80GB of 24MP images was on a GTX 1080.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s particularly slow considering the amount of data and complexity of the operations, but surely a speedup would be very welcome and useful. It would become much more accessible to game companies, movie studios and even industries that (afaik) don&#x27;t make much use of 3D models yet -- perhaps archaeology or anthropology would jump at the opportunity of scanning and sharing super high res models.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scale-invariant_feature_transform" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scale-invariant_feature_transf...</a>')
