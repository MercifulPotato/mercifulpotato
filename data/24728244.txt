This means that many important control decisions are made using approximate heuristics. And this leads to huge inefficiencies.<p>For example, a typical steel plant spends many $10s million&#x2F;year on energy, but the theoretical minimum needed is far less. We are working on solving this problem by achieving totally optimal control. We create data-driven predictive process models that can simulate the physics and chemistry of the very quickly. This allows us to simulate different control tactics in real time - continuously evaluating different options in response to live observations.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foresightdatamachines.com&#x2F;jobs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foresightdatamachines.com&#x2F;jobs</a>\nor email me: info [at] foresightdatamachines [dot] com')
