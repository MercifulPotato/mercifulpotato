Earlier it used to happen over a zoom call, now i use mac’s screen recorder or loom, but then i end up in meetings&#x2F; sending countless slack msgs&#x2F;email. These tools (loom) are marketed in a way that makes me believe an utopia of less context switch&#x2F; no meeting&#x2F; showing &gt; telling. Although theoretically i might buy these ideas but practically I didn’t find much benefits out of these tools working in a team set up in an org. Has anyone objectively feels that these tools improve their productivity? If yes how do you do it?')
