Item(by='mgkimsal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608204014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25453248, text='&gt; When I see something I don&#x27;t understand I like to look for the reasoning behind it.<p>Similar view here, to an extent.  But... with many topics, a majority of what I find is fanboy posts that strawman &quot;problems&quot; with earlier tech&#x2F;tools, gloss over problems with the new way, and fawn over &quot;hello world&quot; examples.  It can take a lot of time to get <i>deep</i> reasons, that may have some impactful value on your own problem spaces, and... at some point, I have to draw the line on &quot;investigating all the bandwagons&quot;.<p>But also, at some point, one of the reasons to adopt something is &quot;everyone else is&quot;, and there&#x27;s some value in using &quot;the latest trend&quot; (hiring, bug solving, new tools, etc).  And that may be enough value, but rarely does anyone justify their decision with &quot;everyone else is doing it&quot; - they try to give deeper &#x27;technical&#x27; reasons, when (whether there are good&#x2F;strong reasons) sometimes they just aren&#x27;t able to do a good job.')
