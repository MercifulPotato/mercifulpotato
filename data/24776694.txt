By cancelling series as soon as they plateau (not even _decline_, given reporting (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;why-netflix-keeps-canceling-shows-after-just-2-seasons&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;why-netflix-keeps-canceling-show...</a>) of its production cost escalator), they do not generate a large library of &quot;complete series&quot; for later viewing.<p>This also puzzles me, since it contradicts Netflix&#x27;s willingness to pay a pretty penny for established series like Friends.  Its current show-commissioning practices seem to be incapable of generating a new generational hit like that.')
