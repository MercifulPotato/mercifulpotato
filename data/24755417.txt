At least with `git clone` you can verify that the code you&#x27;re building matches something you trust. You have to trust the code and your make tool. You can inspect the code if you&#x27;re concerned and validate that it&#x27;s going to do what it says.<p>It&#x27;s true that the vast majority of the time a &quot;curl | sh&quot; works fine and does just what you expect it to do, but that&#x27;s not really the point. The point is that you have no idea what that script your piping will do. You also have no idea whether in this case the binary it fetches is actually built from the code the service says it is; downloading the script first and inspecting it is a good idea, but still not as good as building directly from the code.<p>This is why we see people do things like publish a hash sum alongside binaries they offer, or use a digital signature. Then we can at least verify that a binary matches what the author says they released, or better yet ensure that the binary was produced by a trusted source.')
