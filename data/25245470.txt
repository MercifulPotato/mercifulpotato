Great comment, thanks.<p>One group was trying to monetize services which were already free. Like make a list of data provided by stock mobile runtimes (Android, iOS), such as location data, and then create a developer portal for accessing that same data thru web services.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble remembering the details because I didn&#x27;t even understand it at the time. My buddies were contractors, loved this kind of work, the money was good, and you could never fail. They thought there were helping me, get me some cheddar too.<p>I was briefly on the &quot;mobile app services&quot; team, it took me about 3 months to figure out what we were even doing. But there were lots and lots of meetings. Convened by empire builders and corporate climbers. Expensive suits. And lots of agile, kanban, scrum masters, velocity. To build something biggly impressive for which there would never be customers or revenue.<p>I assume there was at least one other group trying to &quot;accomplish&quot; the same thing.<p>The carriers would print money forever if they simply fired everyone unrelated to the actual network (cables and towers) and charged everyone a flat rate. And some overhead of the basic infrastructure services like provisioning numbers and 911.<p>No metering, no discounts, no custom phones, no carrier add-ons. The actual effort to create additional income streams was ridiculously wasteful.<p>It was crazy making. The actual features that would be awesome were never part of the conversation. For instance, I&#x27;d love to hear my voice mails on my laptop. I&#x27;m sure enterprise customers would love some tools for managing fleets of phones. Etc.<p>Maybe the carriers got high from the SMS profiteering, didn&#x27;t realize that was a one-off bonanza, and have never recovered.')
