As a English-as-a-second-language speaker, there are times when I wish I could speak up and express my thoughts&#x2F;emotions in a way that is palatable to the audience (native English speakers), but decided to stay quiet because I am not sure if it&#x27;ll come out right or because my brain cannot process fast enough to speak fluently&#x2F;eloquently. I consider myself fairly decent in English vocabulary and reading (not bragging but scored 720 out of 800 in both SAT and GRE verbal), but I still cannot do as well as native speakers in expressing my concerns&#x2F;opinions during business meetings. Sometimes, I wish the tables are turned so that I can speak my native language and am able to make persuasive arguments in discussions.<p>Language barrier is real and I am guessing some English speakers may never understand&#x2F;empathize with the non-native speakers.')
