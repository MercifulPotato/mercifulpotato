To better explain it I will return to Abbott’s flatland. Consider a flat universe. Consider an imaginary grid on it that represents the ‘curvature of space’. Planets in this flat-verse look like solid circles. They bend space so the grid lines are more closely bunched together near them. Now consider another universe next door. Nobody in one universe can know anything about the other universe because their senses are 2d. Even light in their universe vibrates the gridlines of space in the plane of their universe. Now the flatlanders have figured out that gravity operates in 3dimensions. Now consider another universe(B) nearby with a black hole in it(a black circle to us). In space A the flatlanders are struggling to understand a phenomenon they have called dark matter. We on the other hand see the black hole in universe B and it’s effect on universe A. Meanwhile, we are struggling to understand our own version of dark matter. In ‘reality’ there is a black hole in a universe a little bit ‘kata’ from us, bending our space.')
