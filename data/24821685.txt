Which experimentally was shown to not properly predict the effect of gravity, where as seeing gravity as a distortion of spacetime instead of as a acceleration force applied to the objects, did predict accurately the trajectory in experiments.<p>You can call both a force in the generic dictionary definition of force. Because obviously it&#x27;s crazy that something can be so powerful as to distort spacetime itself. But gravity wouldn&#x27;t be a force in the Newton sense of being something that affects the acceleration of an object.')
