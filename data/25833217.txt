The data you train on is much more important than model architecture in terms of validation and compliance, and yet it’s a closely held secret. Producing or obtaining good data is a pain in the ass.<p>For this reason, EAI has made the data we are training on public. I can’t link to it because of anon policies at conferences, but if you look at our website I’m sure you can find a paper detailing it and a link to download it.')
