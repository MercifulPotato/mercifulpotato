Item(by='turminal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609639428, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25618182, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t think you (or anyone else on this website) understand the scale at which twitter operates. Including all replies to a thread by default on a site with that amount of traffic will increase the load of ... everything. Dramatically.<p>I understand fetching all the replies all the time is next to impossible, that&#x27;s not what I was criticizing, I get the impression that Twitter is doing a good job performance wise anyway.<p>&gt; And, honestly I would not be surprised if it were incompetence, either. The skill of the silicon valley developer (as demonstrated by the commenters here) does not impress me even a little.<p>I think incompetence is part of it, but not the only reason. Twitter probably wants its mobile users to interact through the native iOS&#x2F;Android apps. It&#x27;s not as obvious as with what Reddit is doing but making the website act flaky and a bit unpleasant to use is certainly a way to get more people to use the app.<p>I imagine the app looks and feels better. I never used it and I don&#x27;t intend to, for unrelated reasons. But then I guess I don&#x27;t really have a right to complain.')
