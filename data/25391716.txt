Just like first generation Apple hardware, even if looks as good as the M1, I&#x27;d rather have other people take the plunge before I do.<p>In about a year, I may. By then, we&#x27;ll have 2 years worth of data from the test group - good enough!<p>If I perceive any serious risk, I won&#x27;t. Being young and with no risk factors, I have little to gain - so the rational move for me is to leech off the group herd immunity effect.<p>So people, please, do the right thing and get vaccinated!! Protect your parents and your neighbors!!!')
