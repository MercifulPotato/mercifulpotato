Belonging to UPS it&#x27;s a dedicated server - when UPS doesn&#x27;t need it, it&#x27;s idling for the most part. When it belongs to TFI it&#x27;s offered as a VPS.  If it&#x27;s sitting in a parking lot because UPS doesn&#x27;t have a need for it and can&#x27;t rent it to someone else, it&#x27;s a quarter million dollar lawn ornament.<p>If TFI can instead, through increased client demand and smarter routing&#x2F;logistics management ensure that the fleet is moving and making money 85% of the time vs UPSs 60%, that 40% improvement is mostly margin. Throw in economy of scale for things like fleet maintenance, financing, fuel and workforce&#x2F;driver management and you drive operating costs down on the same fleet doing the same work.<p>Add that up and of TFI can service UPSs demand for less + add their own on top as extra margin, they just created value.')
