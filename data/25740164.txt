The tweet that prompted the initial ban literally said &quot;go home and be peaceful&quot;. That is supposed to be an incitement to violence?<p>Lots of violence happened during the protests this summer too. Should we assume that everyone tweeting about being peaceful then was also sending coded messages supporting the violence?<p>Are we really going to go with the logic that violence occurred, therefore anything tweeted prior to the violence was an incitement to the violence?  And if it appeared to say the opposite of that, then it was actually a coded message that means whatever is politically convenient for us to have it mean?')
