How something will be assembled is a constant consideration while designing. The product being run on these lines never really changes and human are only used when the the operations are so complex that the equipment doesn&#x27;t pay for itself in (typically) 2 years. This is very rare, mostly people are only there to keep the machines filled with parts.<p>In the sequence of<p><pre><code>  design -&gt; automate -&gt; manufacture \n</code></pre>\nmanufacture needs to be much larger than the others have good margins. You can&#x27;t iterate on design without iterating on automate, so if you change the design a lot it&#x27;s probably best to avoid trying to automate.')
