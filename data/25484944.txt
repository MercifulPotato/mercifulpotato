RISC-V was specifically designed for this use case to have a very light weight core ISA, with an extensions mechanism that make it easily customisable for specific accelerator design. Even the lightest weight ARM cores are monsters in comparison.<p>Thus we are likely to see a lot of new ARM chips containing a few RISC-V cores tucked away inside the design. In fact NVIDIA already does this on some graphics cards and itâ€™s not impossible M1 does as well.')
