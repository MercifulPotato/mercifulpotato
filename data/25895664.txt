Read for a while.  1-2 hours more.<p>Just this morning, I think I finally diagnosed my central sleep apnea.  I was laying there and just as I fell asleep I started awake because I wasn&#x27;t breathing.  My diary has notes about this happening all the way back to last March.  This happened to me after my first sleep.<p>To add to that, I&#x27;ve become hyper-sensitive to caffeine.  It causes palpitations (started in late 2019).<p>I don&#x27;t snore, but I have been using Breathe Right strips to make sure I have adequate air flow, and so I&#x27;m really sure I don&#x27;t snore.  Curiously, I haven&#x27;t used them for a couple of weeks (long story).<p>EDIT: if you want to contact me, my info is in my profile')
