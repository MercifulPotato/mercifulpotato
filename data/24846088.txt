You need an invoice with serial number. It&#x27;s a lot of hassle but it works. The reason for that box is that we didn&#x27;t get serial numbers on the invoices for a long time :(<p>It&#x27;s another one of those things that are supposedly for the benefit of the consumer but also really supports the company&#x27;s bottom line by having to buy a new product. I&#x27;m always a bit dubious of their motives. I do see the benefit of such features. But they should have some kind of workaround for unlocking it. Such as a card with a QR code that you get with the phone and keep on file or something. Because theft isn&#x27;t the only way you can get locked out. And since the fappening Apple is really difficult with resetting passwords, in some cases people just can&#x27;t make it happen.<p>Android is even tougher but our local carrier can send them for repair to unblock them. Also, Samsung KME overrides the lock, which makes sense because it proves the device is company owned. I wish Apple DEP could do this too.')
