People make websites to be viewed by people. Doing the semantic stuff is work that can be difficult to get right. If it doesn&#x27;t bring you visitors, why would (most) people bother.<p>Sure you can get fancy tools that use the data (lets ignore the scaling issues that many of them have), but fancy tools separates the data from the context, further reducing incentives (for many content creators). If they ever did take off, we would have massive spam&#x2F;quality problems, because we have now separated the data from the website, with all the visual indicators of how spammy it is, which is perfect for dark SEO and other spammers&#x2F;phisers.<p>For that matter, just look at metadata on the web in general and what a mess that is. &lt;meta name=description (or keywords) - spammers took over and nobody use them. &lt;link rel=&quot;next&quot; i think old opera is the only thing to ever do anything with that metadata.<p>The only metadata systems that have ever worked is when the site author gets something out of it: e.g. technocrati tags, &lt;link&gt; to rss feeds, facebook opengraph, various google things, etc. Or on the other side, when that is their whole reason for being, like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikidata.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikidata.org</a> and maybe some glam stuff. Everyone making arbitrary metadata out of the goodness of their heart, and having it be of consistent quality and meaning is a pipe dream.<p>Not to mention the negative incentive of obliterating the walled garden which as much as it sucks is something the corporate overlords like a lot.')
