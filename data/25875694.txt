I use to drive from Atlanta to Jelico and back a couple times a year and in my Model 3 it added probably 20-30 minutes to the trip time compared to an ICE vehicle.<p>The rate at which an EV charges slows down as the battery gets closer to 100%.  The time to charge an EV from 5-55% is faster than the time to charge from 55-100%.  If you only charge up to 80% or 90% you will cut a significant amount of time off your charge times.  The Tesla trip planner will plan routes with this in mind automatically.<p>We moved cross country last year (~2200 miles) from GA to CA and it took us 4 days.  I drove a diesel box truck and my partner drove the Model 3, we took the same route but didn&#x27;t stick together.  We stopped at the same overnight stops and our arrival departure times were with in 30 minutes of one another.<p>What you don&#x27;t realize on long road trips is that stops for fuel rarely consist of just filling up.  You use the restroom, stretch, buy a snack, etc.  That all adds up to 15-25 minute stops, where as the Model 3 would stop to charge for 20-30 minutes.')
