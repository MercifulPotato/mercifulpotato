Pre-school isn&#x27;t 8 hours a day though, so you need to pay around 100€ to supplement it with childcare.<p>After that it&#x27;s school, high-school and university, all free again. \nHigh-school &amp; university require you to buy the books though, which do have a cost, but nothing like the US schoolbook prices from what I&#x27;ve gathered. It&#x27;s hundreds of euros per term if you buy new.')
