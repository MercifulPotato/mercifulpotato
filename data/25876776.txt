Way back in history 2x4 were cut to 2&quot; x 4&quot;.  In a modern sawmill 2x4s are never cut to 2&quot; x 4&quot;.  They are cut to a thickness and width such that given saw deviation, and variable drying shrinkage nearly all boards will cleanly plane down to 1.5&quot; x 3.5&quot;. The exact target dimensions will depend on how well the mill can control their saw deviations and the statistical range of shrinkage they expect for the wood they are cutting. Reducing dimension targets by controlling saw deviation and understanding drying shrinkage is a big part of sawmill efficiency and profitability.')
