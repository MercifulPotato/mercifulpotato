Two weeks before the end of CS for me they initiated a pass&#x2F;fail for a test that we were never taught anything about and then mandated that you repeat the entire CS curriculum if you weren’t able to pass it. They said that it didn’t matter that I passed all of my sprints and scored 100% on the unit assessment, that I needed to repeat a class (along with 3&#x2F;4 of my cohort) just to pass this test. They never owned up to the fact that they didn’t teach the material on the test, as was evident by the fact that they removed ALL GitHub projects in CS and replaced them with Codesignal challenges. I messaged “Student Success” for weeks and was ignored and when they did deign to respond to me it was a generic canned response that addressed none of my issues save “Deal with it”. I took to speaking about the problems in the open channels and I was removed from Slack and forcefully “withdrawn” from Lambda. It is utter chaos there.')
