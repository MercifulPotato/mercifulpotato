My employer did a project for a big mobile operator to build a white-labellable web platform for selling phone service. The idea was that they could launch a fully operational new phone brand with the click of a button. They could use this to target different market segments (eg a low cost no frills service, without dropping the prices for their main brand), or to form branding partnerships (eg with luxury brands, football clubs, etc).<p>At least one of the brands is still running, but I&#x27;m not sure the co-branding thing ever went anywhere.')
