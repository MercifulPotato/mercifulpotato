Oddly there’s no external metric on this, it’s just some internal driver.<p>It would result in closing old or low priority items rather than leaving them. It would also result in things not fixed being closed.<p>It was a surreal conversation where I asked how they knew my issue was resolved without asking me, the person who submitted it. The PM said “what do you mean, we closed it. It’s closed.” And it took time to explain the difference between thinking it’s done and properly confirming it’s done.<p>I find the most frustrating as a user is “closed, won’t fix” as for OSS projects someone could eventually submit a fix.<p>Closing “stale” issues is vanity tidying that’s not necessary in a digital, “free” world.<p>I think the fix for this is to look at the “unaddressed” metric to include any closed issues that weren’t resolved. A high number of stale issues closed is a negative metric for a project. But a high number of lingering issues isn’t so bad.')
