Item(by='yellowapple', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611772847, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25924750, text='I feel like the author started with a good analogy, but then missed an important angle that more readily explains the &quot;crazy&quot; part of crazy beliefs:<p>In a sufficiently-large workplace, you&#x27;ll start to encounter office politics and the office &quot;culture&quot;, both of which end up influencing the makeup of the employees in that workplace - be it through hiring decisions, promotion&#x2F;demotion decisions, and even terminations (voluntary or otherwise).  Before you know it, the overall culture and political environment of that workplace becomes entrenched.  It&#x27;s a sort of <i>internal</i> cronyism - one which maintains consistency within the organization, rather than a pursuit of meritocracy or an attempt to appease an external force.<p>Taking this metaphor to the brain, once a belief is &quot;hired&quot;, there&#x27;s a certain barrier to &quot;firing&quot; it; even assuming there are no labor laws in the State of Brainia, there&#x27;s a bit of a sunk cost in each belief that makes it undesirable to &quot;fire&quot; that belief, and therefore each belief has some impact on the &quot;workplace culture&quot; and &quot;office politics&quot; of the mind: each belief will impart its pressure on other beliefs, forming cliques and pushing out beliefs that don&#x27;t conform.<p>Thus lies the path from reasonable things like &quot;I believe pharmaceutical companies will do whatever they believe will maximize profit&quot; to... <i>less</i> reasonable things like &quot;I believe Bill Gates is using COVID vaccines to inject 5G tracking chips in the global population&quot;.  And worse, that&#x27;s what makes it so difficult to actually convince someone about the craziness of such beliefs: those beliefs are already entrenched.  Instead of trying to un-entrench such beliefs, it&#x27;s better to address the proliferation of misinformation at the source: by propagating &quot;inoculation&quot; beliefs that entrench themselves before the &quot;crazier&quot; beliefs can take hold.')
