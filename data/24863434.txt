They&#x27;re not necessarily sourced from petroleum, nor necessarily toxic. It&#x27;s a ridiculously huge category of material, and plastics really were and probably always will figure prominently in our future. And I would assume that some traditional, even edible materials have been subsumed into the plastics category given the general scope of the term and the industry itself.')
