And it&#x27;s probably fair to say that state &#x2F; the public have a right to that information for some purposes.<p>In the interest of sanity, I think we can suspend recording for personal moments:\n   - Bathroom\n   - Medical\n   - Break time (e.g. eating)<p>We can potentially switch to a lower-resolution &#x2F; audio-only take for the vast majority of a shift. E.g. idling in a cruiser.<p>As someone else highlighted, what we <i>absolutely</i> want to record is:\n   - Use of weapon (holster switch)\n   - Conflict (volume trigger?)\n   - Immediately preceding interval before camera turned off (presumably, will contain a request &#x2F; rationale to disable)<p>Effectively, what we want to do is switch from a trigger-on to a trigger-off. Cops shouldn&#x27;t have to even think about cameras. They should just work.')
