Meanwhile, Russia has failed on all counts.<p>The West has the laws on the books, and the legal precedent necessary to enforce them, when it comes to epidemics. What it lacks is the political will.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how effective these measures are, or how bad an idea it is to let the virus run unchecked - under it&#x27;s current leadership, states like Kentucky will never do what is necessary to get the virus under control, because these measures are anathema to it&#x27;s current regime. And states like Washington won&#x27;t either, because while those measures are not anathema to them, their governments are afraid of a backlash that will replace them.<p>This wasn&#x27;t an inevitable outcome - nothing <i>fundamentally</i> stopped bipartisan cooperation on this point. Political expedience and the desire to own the libs did. Had the right not used the pandemic as an opportunity to grab power, and start a culture war, we wouldn&#x27;t be where we are today.')
