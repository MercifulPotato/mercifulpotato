It&#x27;s very easy to cherry pick salacious details and run with them, knowing that people will take it at face value.<p>I&#x27;m absolutely not accusing anyone here of doing that, and in part I&#x27;m not responding to the parent in as much as I&#x27;m also venting my exasperation about how we talk about people on the internet these days.<p>Even if Connery did publicly retract or apologise, for example, how many people would try to seek that out if all they saw was the original video in isolation? Once a criminal, always a criminal? Or can we imagine that people may change even without making a public song and dance about it?<p>These are the questions I ask myself.')
