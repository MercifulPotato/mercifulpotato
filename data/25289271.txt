There&#x27;s a few things that (accidentally or on purpose) make it work:<p><i>Threads&#x2F;Conversations are the only way to talk in normal team channels</i>. This means that messages are automatically grouped on topic and you can ignore the ones you don&#x27;t care about. I have never worked with a Slack team that used threads effectively and so you regularly end up reading a load of stuff you don&#x27;t care about to find the stuff you do care about.<p><i>Separation between a Team channel and a chat channel</i>. Chat channels are more like normal Slack conversations - they end up being fairly synchronous. The Team channel is where the more asynchronous stuff goes. We have a strong project convention (almost a rule) to use use a Team channel if more than 2 people are involved. It helps visibility and means that conversations default to async. But if I write a direct message to someone then it&#x27;s because I want to interrupt and get an answer and so they get pinged.<p>This means I get pinged a few times a day about things I need (as SW Lead) to deal with, and the rest of the time I can just catch up on threads when I&#x27;m waiting for a compilation.')
