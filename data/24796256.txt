Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=[24796407], score=None, time=1602809970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24795448, text='&gt; &gt; A certain group of highly educated urban liberals is shocked by Trump.<p>&gt; 3 million more people voted for Hillary than Trump.<p>As I said, I’m not using this as a pejorative. I’m not just talking about folks who voted for Hillary, but ones who were despondent when Trump won. I worked late on election night and got home to an election watching party with DC yuppies and when I walked in the door I thought someone had died. These are the folks who were so stunned the started looking around for an explanation. And social media just happened to be rising at the same time.<p>Not all Hillary voters reacted that way. My mom and dad voted for Hillary. But they weren’t shocked by the existence of Trump. They didn’t see it as an indictment of the system. They didn’t go on the whole Russia collusion ride like all of my friends. (Not coincidentally, they supported Biden from the start. Meanwhile, I  was shocked when Warren and Harris did so poorly, when it came to voting, because that’s who all my grad-school educated urban friends supported.)')
