Atmos is really just a metadata stream for multidimensional audio panning so a single set of audio streams can be interpreted across many different surround setups.<p>Hypothetically you&#x27;ll get a more accurate spatial response, but again as you noted, they tend to just do a surround background bed with a few Atmos objects for voices and explicit sources.')
