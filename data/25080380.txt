I deploy statistical models with Python, and these always have C dependencies.<p>Additionally, they are part of a larger application, which is mostly managed by pip, which means that I need both pip and conda which is where things get really, really hairy.<p>I actually blame Google and FB here, as neither of them use standard python dependency management tools, and many of their frameworks bring in the world, thus increasing the risk of breakage.')
