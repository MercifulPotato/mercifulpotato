But the NYT has in the past overplayed the race card with no evidence.<p>Now I&#x27;m happy to agree that the retention rate of black people at Coinbase raises some questions. But the NYT, having asked those questions, came up with no particular evidence of racism.<p>The major piece of evidence that these issues are substantially due to race is that the NYT felt it warranted a hit piece. That is weak evidence. Being passed over for promotion and feeling unappreciated - which they lead with - isn&#x27;t evidence. Most of us have been passed over for promotion plenty of times. Most people are unappreciated too.')
