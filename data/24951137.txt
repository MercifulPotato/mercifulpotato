Until recently, there were two competing music bands: the &quot;mice&quot; and the &quot;rats&quot;. One group was socialists, the others catholics. By 2010, both were largely composed of octogenarians and dying. But don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d ever play one note together!<p>- After WWII, my grandfather, being very poor and having been in the resistance, had a right to financial assistance. He never claimed it because his wife was catholic and the resistance group he participated in was socialist. Claiming his benefits would have been social suicide.<p>- My mother&#x27;s aunt was a catholic nun, and one of the nicest and most welcoming people, widely respectd by all in the village were she lived. Once, she went to the funeral of a local farmer, a socialist. Her going to that funeral was quite out of the ordinary already, to put it mildly. On her return, she said: &quot;He was a socialist, but a very good and decent man.&quot;')
