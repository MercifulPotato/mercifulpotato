Item(by='NationalPark', descendants=None, kids=[25569563, 25566293, 25566012], score=None, time=1609203693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25565244, text='Of the 5 XPS line laptops I&#x27;ve had, 2 had component failures that required replacement under warranty (drives and ports) and one had a hinge that failed just after the warranty ended.<p>As if that weren&#x27;t frustrating enough, redeeming the warranty required about five hours total of phone conversation per incident. At every step of the way, they would demand I repeat dozens of irrelevant troubleshooting steps, or they would tell me the problem isn&#x27;t covered (contradicting the last person I&#x27;d been handed off to), or they&#x27;d tell me it isn&#x27;t covered but if I agree to pay to extend the warranty by another year then many he can ask his manager to backdate it and squeeze this in, etc. etc. As you might be able to guess, it&#x27;s all sales&#x2F;lies&#x2F;incompetence and eventually I got through to someone high enough up to initiate the replacements under warranty.<p>Of the many Macbooks I&#x27;ve had, only one ever had a failure that required service. I just scheduled a time to drop the computer off, then picked it up a week later and it was fixed, didn&#x27;t have to argue with anyone about my warranty.<p>Also - in my opinion - the XPS may be the best build quality of non-Apple laptops, but it&#x27;s not even in the same league as a similarly priced macbook.')
