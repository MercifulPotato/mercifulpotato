It&#x27;s about the implication of this fact which is that you might be a bad person. Are you a bad person? Or are you a good person which happened to have a behavior which turned others against you?<p>Second, is good to meditate on this idea of the image you are trying to keep consistent with everyone. It&#x27;s almost like slaving away to make all people like you. But that&#x27;s impossible because whatever you do someone might think you&#x27;re an asshole anyway.<p>So just focus on being a good person in your eyes and the rest will follow. And be kind to yourself, we all make mistakes.')
