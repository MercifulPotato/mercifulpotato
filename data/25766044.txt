This meant creating a straightforward UX that would let you read recipes in a consistent simple format.<p>When I started on this journey, I learned many things from friends and family who like to cook, but approach cooking in slightly different ways. For example, I was surprised by the number of people who requested a print icon to print and were unfamiliar with CMD+P or print in the browser menu. Another surprise was a lot of people still wanted to read the main recipe article or comments, so creating a straightforward way to minimize the recipe card modal was essential.<p>Current features include:<p><pre><code>   • Pretty formatting of ingredients and instructions\n   • Easy access to serving size and time estimates\n   • Print and copy functions\n   • Share to your device via QR code\n</code></pre>\nRepibox Home Page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repibox.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repibox.com</a><p>Direct link to the Chrome Store is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;repibox&#x2F;nbgpmjdmplldckdiolbacdflmebgnoij" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;repibox&#x2F;nbgpmjdmpl...</a>')
