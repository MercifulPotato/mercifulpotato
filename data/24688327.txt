I like the Nano, but I use it mostly as a development machine and for that I would rank the 8GB Raspberry Pi at about $89 US the best deal. Substantially below that is the Nano, and almost tied is 4GB Pi. There may be cases where you absolutely need an Nvidia machine in which case I would argue for the 4GB version, but otherwise the 8GB Pi appears to be the winner by a long shot.')
