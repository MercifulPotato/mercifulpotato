There&#x27;s little immunity to COVID-19 and it&#x27;s highly contagious.<p>This is like saying &quot;COVID isn&#x27;t worse than the flu&quot; - even if it was true, having another flu-sized disease burden would already be bad, so it&#x27;s a bit of a weird goalpost.<p>That being said, there&#x27;s a lot of literature describing post-covid symptomes and hypothesized mechanisms of action, like [1]. The virus has been around for less than a year, so a quantitative comparison with something we have studied for decades makes no sense.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7320866&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7320866&#x2F;</a>')
