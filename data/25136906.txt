Sure, if we lived in a perfect world where your woodworking moderators knew for a fact when libel was taking place or Nazis were posting - then we could all rest easily because they would de facto be preventing harm, not causing it.<p>But that&#x27;s not the way it works.  In reality, moderators don&#x27;t know legal libel when they see it to the point that they should be automatically indemnified.  We see in day-to-day life that not everyone who is accused of being a Nazi or a racist is one in fact.  Sometime the accusation of being a Nazi is itself the libel, and if your woodworking moderators are participating in the perpetuation of that libel; then they should be held to account.<p>If your woodworking community, through moderation, decides to weigh in on user comments through moderation, badging, or editing; then it should be liable for any libel that it amplifies through its policies.  If a person can show actual damage from those policies in court, then why should your woodworking community get a pass?')
