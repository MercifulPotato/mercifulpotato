I pondered for a time if I should buy the content on abusive platforms and then download it illegally without DRMs, but I decided that respect must go both way. Just to be clear, I pay for a lot of music every week and I even give a lot every months to charities, this is not about money and my difficulty to part with it. Ultimately, I very rarely use piracy anyway because when I have to, I lose respect for artists and don&#x27;t want to listen to them anymore (it&#x27;s not me making it political, it&#x27;s just a feeling that happens when I realize the artist will force spyware on me). The only content I download through piracy is from long dead artists, mostly (they didn&#x27;t chose to only be available with DRM).<p>That being said, I&#x27;ve been surprised how common it is to find albums on Bandcamp or bands&#x27; own sites. It may be the music I listen to (I try to never limit me to a few &quot;genres&quot;, but I very commonly listen to music with small audience). I guess fees asked by platforms have something to do with it too.')
