Gosh no.<p>Does criminalization and stigmization of drug use make the problem 10,000x worse? Very.<p>Imagine if the US followed Oregon&#x27;s lead and decriminalized all personal use. Drug users can seek out help and get harm reduction (eg: needle exchanges, advice, etc) and get them participating in the medical system where we can help them out of addiction, no families will be destroyed because of a little weed (or heck, meth), we save a bunch of money on drug enforcement, we could close private prisons, etc.<p>I am not saying utopia, but maybe we should look at drug use as something besides a personal moral failing. No one wakes up and decides to be a drug addict... no one _wants_ to be an addict.<p>This idea that drug users are burn-outs who chose that life is absurd.')
