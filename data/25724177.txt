At its worst you certainly had the stereotypical &quot;pig&quot; cops that everyone likes to ACAB at. The kind that intentionally incite an otherwise peaceful crowd; the kind that may shoot at erstwhile peaceful bystanders (including people standing on their own porch) with rubber bullets; the kind that aim their gas canister launchers directly at people standing nearby, against all common decency, and often department policy&#x2F;law.<p>But you also had police departments that merely monitored a situation without forcefully intruding unless necessary. Some even that put away their weapons and peacefully marched with protestors.')
