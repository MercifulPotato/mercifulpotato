It&#x27;s cheap here, is what I&#x27;m saying.<p>And many, many young people are moving back and have &#x27;discovered&#x27; farming, forestry, and gardening. They treat it like they&#x27;ve discovered some long forgotten relic of an ancient past.<p>We do those things already. The difference is, nobody in their 80&#x27;s, and nobody struggling with a family farm is making an instagram about it.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m getting old, and maybe I&#x27;m getting crotchety. But, if one more 20-30 year old tells me how I should be growing crops and how crop rotation works, without letting me interject that I&#x27;ve been doing this for longer than they&#x27;ve been alive, and have a current, operating partnership with the local University co-op for soil&#x2F;water&#x2F;native wildlife conservation projects, I&#x27;ll scream.')
