I&#x27;ll quote from my post from April (1) which was already in the context of Covid-19, where I quote the start of the presentation by Al Bartlett:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.albartlett.org&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;arithmetic_population_energy_transcript_english.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.albartlett.org&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;arithmetic_populati...</a><p>&quot;It&#x27;s a great pleasure to be here, and to have a chance just to share with you some very simple ideas about the problems we&#x27;re facing. Some of these problems are local, some are national, some are global.<p>They&#x27;re all tied together. They&#x27;re tied together by arithmetic, and the arithmetic isn&#x27;t very difficult. What I hope to do is, I hope to be able to convince you that <i>the greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function</i>.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s why when some hear that R=1.2 can be catastrophic and R=1 can be fine they just switch off. And there is exactly that &quot;only 20% percent&quot; difference.<p>But many developments in nature that work against humans have exponential behavior, including the stuff that humans do.<p>Somebody once named the video of that Bartlett&#x27;s presentation &quot;The Most Important Video You&#x27;ll Ever See&quot; and in this case it&#x27;s not a clickbait.<p>Edit: What&#x27;s the name of the book you mention?<p>1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22655785" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22655785</a>')
