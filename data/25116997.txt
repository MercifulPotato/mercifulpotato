I&#x27;ll probably get downvoted for saying it, but I want to get out in the open that the situation reeks of a PR&#x2F;astroturfing campaign. There are a small number of ardent nuclear energy supporters acting in good faith, but a much larger army of paid trolls that have been active for the last few years. I mod on Reddit and have seen this happen daily.  They post a pro-nuclear&#x2F;anti-renewables talking point and then when you look at the account history, the account will be days old or have a clearly artificial history generated by karma farming (reposting old comment or short junk comments generated by computer).<p>It follows much the same patterns we saw with accounts pushing climate change denial on social media. Research later showed this was driven by bots and paid trolls.<p>&gt; Is there any reason to believe that this isnâ€™t just an industry group with a friendly, activist face<p>I can almost guarantee this is the case.  So-called environmentalist Micheal Shellenberger is another example (made more clear when he came out as a climate change minimizer recently). It uses the same playbook that fossil fuel companies used to create artificial climate change skepticism.<p>At least one group of reporters is doing investigative research into this issue.<p>One litmus test to use: most nuclear energy advocates that are acting in good faith see it as part of an all-of-the-above energy solution that includes nuclear, renewables, and storage.  The shill accounts break from this by trying to trash renewables while pushing nuclear energy.')
