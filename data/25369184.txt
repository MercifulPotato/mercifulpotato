The suppliers they work with are in turn focused on supplying high-quality meat and produce that isn&#x27;t really interchangeable enough for a futures market.<p>Farmers who grow commodity crops (corn, soybeans, etc.) or commodity livestock often do use futures markets in the way you describe, or work with financiers who essentially do it on their behalf.')
