Melvyn is very careful to keep a coherent progression in each episode, and he invites experts in fields relevant to the topic at hand. Among the ~1,000 episodes I&#x27;m sure there are some weak ones, but the way you frame it is as if British academics are not capable of discussing topics outside of their own culture or Melvyn is some amateur host who just wants to hear some pop history fun facts.')
