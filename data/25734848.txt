There&#x27;s been extensive fact-checking on this, and Trump obstructed the investigation.<p>I have, of course. My claim is just that Russia &quot;stealing&quot; the election might be non-&quot;contextual&quot; if what&#x27;s been shown is that Russia ran extensive misinformation campaigns, since the election was still ultimately decided by people voting, no evidence of extensive fraud, etc. , etc.<p>Of course, perhaps it is still a &quot;steal&quot; simply because of the effect of that interference&#x2F;influence campaign. And similarly, perhaps the 1994 crime bill had an influence on future downstream state actions around incarceration. There&#x27;s a discussion to be had about the topic. <i>Neither</i> &quot;fact-check&quot;-ing seems non-ideological to me.')
