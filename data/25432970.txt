Item(by='filoleg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608055483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25431453, text='&gt; Involving aircraft hangar gravel or something, I never googled it, I never have even thought about such a product in my entire life. Yet there was the ad from a completely once in a lifetime conversation I had with someone. It&#x27;s too damn niche to be coincidence.<p>You might have not googled it yourself, but I bet the person you had that conversation with did. If the conversation took place in real life, then that person&#x27;s device was in physical proximity to yours (i.e., location data tracking; for example, if you enter a room full of people who googled tons of stuff about a certain subject, expect to see ads around that subject popping up on your device in the near future, even if you didn&#x27;t google anything about that subject before and aren&#x27;t planning to do so in the future). You also probably exchanged contacts and called (or texted) each other about other stuff in general (probable, but not necessary for the scenario I am describing). And if the conversation took place online, then it is even easier. Here you go, you just created a social link between yourself and the person who googled stuff about aircraft hangar gravel. In which case, it isn&#x27;t surprising at all that you got that ad.<p>So in a sense, you are correct, it wasn&#x27;t a coincidence. But I heavily doubt it has anything to do with smart devices listening and analyzing to what you said at all. It is much more trivial and less creepy to simply utilize your social links to figure out what kind of ads to display to you than listen in and try to analyze your conversations. More reliable too.')
