A ZFS pool is created from block devices, and ZFS doesn&#x27;t care if those are whole discs or partitions.<p>Every ZFS pool I have is composed of GPT partitions, and this is also recommended in ZFS books as good practice to make it easier to identify a failed drive.  Since you see the GPT partition name in the &quot;zpool status&quot; and other tools&#x27; output, it&#x27;s handy.')
