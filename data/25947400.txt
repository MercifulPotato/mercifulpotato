What&#x27;s the &quot;call to action&quot;?<p>&gt; It would represent a radical change, but one that should be looked at seriously.<p>Okay.  Looked at by whom?<p>I would say we already have the protocols (Napster was founded in 1999, P2P protocols are old enough to drink.)  <i>Then what?</i><p>(My own cynical reaction is that people like what they have and deserve what they get.  But I recognize and admit that that is not a productive area of discussion.)<p>Given that pirating movies is unfashionable now, what could some P2P protocol offer that would entice people away from FAANG?  (Assuming that that would be a net benefit to humanity and the world is itself more of a hope than something you could prove one way or another.
