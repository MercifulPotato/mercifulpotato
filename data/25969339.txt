Forced updates killed it for me. Don’t get me wrong, I actually prefer Windows as an OS over macOS in some ways, but the update policies do not leave you in control of your own system. The nail in the coffin was around 3 years ago when right in the middle of a recording session, Windows forced an update despite my best attempts at delaying and stopping it. The next day I backed up all my data and installed Mint and never looked back. Perhaps this was an overreaction, but I don’t regret it. I am glad I did this because I bought a macbook and discovered the word of mac-based DAWs and I am extremely thrilled, though I am fearful that one day macOS will become Windows-like in its system policies. And then life will suck.')
