We have a mentality in the US that government cannot do anything right, but it seems of late (last 40 years or so) that we are kneecapping government&#x27;s ability to execute and then complaining about it when it can&#x27;t and making pronouncements about how only the private sector can understand tech.<p>Government technology workforces are thus composed largely of either people who are below average in competence or above average and willing to take a pay cut because they care about the cause, but we shouldn&#x27;t expect people to do that, and there aren&#x27;t very many of them. We should give government a fighting chance.')
