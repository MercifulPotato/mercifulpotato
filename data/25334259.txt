The result is that most of the heat gets transferred.<p>At the end of the exchanger, the warmed incoming air is in contact with 70° outgoing air, so it will be at almost 70°. Similarly, the outgoing air will be at almost -10° as it exits.<p>It will probably make more sense if you look at the diagram: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Countercurrent_exchange" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Countercurrent_exchange</a>')
