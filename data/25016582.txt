Once the models project that it&#x27;s basically impossible (...)<p>It&#x27;s only &quot;basically impossible&quot; if the amount of votes to be counted are still enough to sway an election.<p>You should think things through and pay attention to the unwanted consequences of these sort of claims.  We&#x27;re living a development where half the US population is complaining about voter fraud and conspiracies to withheld their candidate from their rightful place in the US&#x27;s regime.  It makes no sense to argue in favor of taking shortcuts in the election process citing arcane arguments and models, each of which unverifiable and impenetrable to the common man, and expect it to simply accept an outcome that is dictated by you and not verifiable by them.<p>If you want a country to accept election results, the results need to be obvious and above any scrutiny.  In the case of elections, you only get there if all votes are counted and any shred of doubt is rendered an impossibility.  Otherwise all you get is conspiracy theories, dissent and erosion of any faith on the democratic nature of a system.')
