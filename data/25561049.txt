We do inbound phone support and had 24 lines on a T1, because I wanted to make sure I had SLA&#x27;ed last-mile connectivity.  Previous iteration of this was a 24 line PRI directly into a Sangoma T1&#x2F;SIP Gateway. After a move + installation, I had an Adtran device that was IP based. It is my understanding that that it was more or less VOIP over a data T1, and the on-premise Adtran device turned it back into a voice T1 for the benefit of our T1 Gateway.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve switched it to a metro fiber ring + SIP trunking.<p>It&#x27;s surprisingly difficult to get SLA&#x27;ed SIP trunking in the SMB market.')
