I wonder whether the  sonic boom public scare is just based on the fact that the majority of the public has never experienced it. I grew up on a Navy base in USSR, and we regularly had fighters booming at the altitudes much lower than the altitude normal for the commercial supersonic travel. It was just fun for us children. May be you&#x27;d not want the boom echoing&#x2F;bouncing through the Manhattan concrete mazes, yet at 20km altitude over rural areas there should be no issues.<p>Also there are large swaths of less populated lands in other countries who may be open to having such corridors over these areas. And back in Concorde times, there weren&#x27;t such a big rich markets like China who has different approach to clearing of permitting&#x2F;regulation issues for example when it comes to public transportation infrastructure.')
