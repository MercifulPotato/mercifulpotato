There are so many interesting YouTube channels today, it&#x27;s &quot;quality documentaries&quot; that were unthinkable in my childhood in the 90s.<p>Technology Connections, Numberphile, 3blue1brown, NativLang, Ben Eater, VSauce, Tom Scott etc.<p>As a teenager I could watch NatGeo and perhaps another similar channel with 2 hour dragged out documentaries with talking heads edited and narrated by people who don&#x27;t love the topic the way these YouTubers do.<p>I think the Internet is still great if you curate what you watch and read, it&#x27;s better than ever. But perhaps it&#x27;s worse on the average. The junk is more potent and the intellectual poison is dosed higher than even the worst reality shows used to be on TV.<p>Both of these can be true at the same time.<p>Also, you&#x27;re watching this 1937 docu on <i>YouTube</i>, not on Discovery Channel on TV.')
