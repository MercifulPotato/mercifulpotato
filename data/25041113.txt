I agree, if I&#x27;m shopping for something like a USB cable most of the brands are companies I absolutely don&#x27;t give a damn about. However, if I&#x27;m shopping for a cable I don&#x27;t want to have to figure out which one actually has enough copper to support the amperage demands, so I&#x27;m likely to just get one from a trusted brand like Anker or Monoprice and be done with it.')
