Amazon aren&#x27;t keeping that a secret.<p>At most, they are singling out their Fulfillment Center to be the first trials but the automation is coming regardless of the strikes.<p>Imagine being able to run a warehouse in total darkness, with no heating or ventilation. The cost savings from things like having toilets and a canteen could be worth a bit too. You could also expand into the car park and use up most of that since you already own the land.<p>It&#x27;s too good an opportunity to pass up I reckon (from an Amazon perspective anyway!)')
