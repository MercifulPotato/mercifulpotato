It felt like Intel was stepping back.<p>the microcode bugs cut performance by 20-30% varrying in your workloads.  and it comes with a 4k display? That would also contribute to a performance loss, depending on what you&#x27;re doing.<p>That 2.8-3.9 cpu would be equal to a 2.3-3.3 before the bug, afaik.  Thats <i>hardly</i> faster than 10 year old duals, wow!<p>&gt;&gt;they just need to crumble.<p>&gt;Less competition will only make things worse for us consumers. ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
