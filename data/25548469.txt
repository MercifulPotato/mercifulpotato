With a miracle I was given a second shot of life. What that meant however is that I lost a good part of my 30s. I sat there, 37, divorced and recovered from a major illness with nothing to show. My friends had kids etc and were getting in to the next chapter of life while I was left feeling what if I had done things differently, tried different things.<p>BUT its not productive to do so. Every one does it and its ok, but it should not be an obsession. I realized that everything doesnt go according to plan and I need to chart my path, not compare to others. Whats good for others, might not be yours. You have to decided what you want to do in the future.')
