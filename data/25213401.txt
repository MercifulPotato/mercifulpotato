Recently (last year or so), Google has started to explicitly refuse service to me when I use Tor (only after forcing me to solve a CAPTCHA for 3 minutes).<p>Question for dang -- why does HN continue to use recaptcha? It&#x27;s impossible to signup via Tor, and Google is a user hostile company.<p>One thing I will note, is that hcaptcha seems to be more loose in what answers it accepts. Sometimes I click random images and it still lets me pass.')
