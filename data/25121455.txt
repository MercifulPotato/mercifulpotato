I wouldn’t be surprised if this would be seen as bad advertising and would lead to potential compensation for customers and competitors, if they stop providing the service.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.admin.ch&#x2F;opc&#x2F;en&#x2F;classified-compilation&#x2F;19110009&#x2F;index.html#a20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.admin.ch&#x2F;opc&#x2F;en&#x2F;classified-compilation&#x2F;19110009&#x2F;...</a><p>Edit: added the English translation of the link.')
