Some terminals from that time used very long persistence phosphor to allow more lines to be drawn. Even then, sometimes, the amount of information shown forced them to flicker in seizure-inducing ways. The CDC 6x00 consoles packed so much information the fonts themselves ended up deformed by the inability of the deflection coils to keep up with the data.')
