As far as I can tell, few to none of those things can actually make things happen. Actual exercisable power tends to come only with office, or something equivalently public.<p>On top of that, and more to the point, most of those things come with the same basic cost- you won&#x27;t make it past the front door anywhere without answering nosy questions that end up on record somewhere. Even donations aren&#x27;t private; consider e.g. campaign finance law. I think the only thing on your list you can just show up to is protests, and those can come with severe costs in the end, too.<p>The general rule of thumb I&#x27;ve come to is that most people who do not want to end up documented on some unexpected corner of the internet would be well advised to stay as far away from government or politics as they possibly can. Hence the irony: anyone who wants to work on fixing society&#x27;s privacy problem- or anything else for that matter- at essentially any level will first have to throw away their own. This is a great reason to stay home, instead.<p>(As a side note under &quot;volunteering your expertise&quot;, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen any organization I cared about express need for e.g. volunteer developers. It seems to be an all but useless skill for fixing these sorts of problems.)')
