Most statically-typed languages are fairly awful at this point and you could get big wins by switching to something else. A language I consider fatally flawed in 2020 could be a huge differential advantage in 2002, because the competition is that much worse.<p>In 2020, I think we have many more viable languages that have squeezed out the sort of general crappiness we had in 2002 in programming languages, and the ability of a startup to choose $LANGUAGE and attain a systematic multiplicative advantage over incumbents is small. You have a modest opportunity to win over incumbents by choosing better operational mechanisms (I call it &quot;marginal&quot; because the incumbents are switching to k8s or whatever at a decent speed too), but mostly your big technical advantage is the ability to greenfield something, even as it is also a nearly-crippling disadvantage in some ways too.')
