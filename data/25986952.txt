I maintain an app personally to do similar things - I also generate .m3u8 playlists.<p>Unfortunately it uses ffmpeg&#x27;s AAC encoder, which isn&#x27;t the best. I went for using XLD&#x27;s command line tools on mac to encode to AAC using Apple&#x27;s codec, and that does produce better results - I tried afconvert to start with and had a lot of issues.')
