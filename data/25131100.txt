This is most visible in recipe blogs, where for example the site will look independent, the blog owner’s &quot;About Me&quot; page will say that she is a young woman born and raised in Louisiana and passionate about her home region’s cooking, but the English is replete with the sort of mistakes that non-native speakers make. You can tell that the content writing was farmed out to someone from Eastern Europe or Southeast Asia, and basically the whole blog and its owner are fake. (Even all the recipes were drawn from other blogs, but someone was paid to rewrite them slightly.)')
