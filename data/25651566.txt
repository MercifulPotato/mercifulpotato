The fact that blocks of matter need to be physically moved by a crane severely limits the total  capacity of the system.  The most dense metals are only about 20x as dense as water, so we are not talking about a huge volume of water.  The equivalent mass of water can be stored in a tank - no dam required and moved through a pipe - no river required.')
