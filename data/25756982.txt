I was in Peru last year and one of the most memorable thing that happened was eating a Changalikodan banana that is only found in India (Asia?)&#x2F;Latin America. I missed it so much (hard to get it in the US) that I ate like 3-4 right there in the market. We now find them at our local Mexican store but it&#x27;s a hit or miss.')
