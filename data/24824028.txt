Water consumption isn&#x27;t the concern. They certainly wouldn&#x27;t be doing drip irrigation with wastewater because wastewater would clog the equipment. Evaporation is expected and desired. Treated human waste is full of pharmaceuticals and phosphates from detergents. It should not be used to grow food unless it is feed for animals. Drainage is a concern on sandy soil. You wouldn&#x27;t want these sites anywhere near your groundwater supply. You can&#x27;t dump phosphates and nitrogen in your rivers because the result is algal blooms -&gt; depleted oxygen -&gt; fish kills and really toxic shit like Pfiesteria, which can give you headaches, cognitive problems, and nerve damage just from standing knee deep in the water.<p>Really, how well the forest grows is beside the point. They&#x27;re doing this to dispose waste water. If they can make a tree crop to offset costs a bit, then great. The &quot;climate change&quot; angle is lipstick on the pig.')
