Study after study shows that Black boys have much worse outcomes than white boys even when comparing families that have similar incomes: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;19&#x2F;upshot&#x2F;race-class-white-and-black-men.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;19&#x2F;upshot&#x2F;race-c...</a>. White boys whose parents have an income at the 90th percentile (compared to all households) will statistically end up around the 70th percentile (regression to the mean). A black boy raised to parents who have a 90th percentile income will end up at the 55th percentile.<p>There is something unique about the economic status of Black Americans, especially Black boys. The income gap between Black and whites hasn&#x27;t narrowed <i>at all</i> since the end of Jim Crow in the 1960s. Gaps for other groups have disappeared or are in the process of disappearing-even groups, such as Hispanics, that typically come into the country near the bottom of the economic ladder.<p>&gt; The research makes clear that there is something unique about the obstacles black males face. The gap between Hispanics and whites is narrower, and their incomes will converge within a couple of generations if mobility stays the same. Asian-Americans earn more than whites raised at the same income level, or about the same when first-generation immigrants are excluded. Only Native Americans have an income gap comparable to African-Americans. But the disparities are widest for black boys.')
