I think I practice it almost daily for the past years now and I helped me to express a whole set of \nemotions from anger to doubt to fear and helped me with connecting with others, enabling a better understanding.

Highly recommend it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nonviolent_Communication" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nonviolent_Communication</a>')
