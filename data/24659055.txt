I don&#x27;t even think most have my SSN, just the info for my bank account. And I have a pretty common name. There&#x27;s convicts even in my state with the same name I can find on search. Often there&#x27;s not even a formal contract, just a handshake.<p>Also you can make money this way all over the world.')
