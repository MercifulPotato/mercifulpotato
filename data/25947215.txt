(Melvin having 11 bilion in total assets and Citadel giving them 3 billion).<p>That&#x27;s what I was pointing out!  \nMelvin did not close their shorts(as they said they did), they just got more rope from Citadel, and Citadel was willing to do just that knowing they can manipulate the market.<p>The narative of Melvin was &quot;Citadel gave us 3 billion dollars, we closed our shorts at a loss, you won wsb, aren&#x27;t you happy, you won, now leave us alone and stop buying&quot;.')
