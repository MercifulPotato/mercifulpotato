Do I know for certain I&#x27;m the last human?<p>If I didn&#x27;t know for sure I would probably spend most of my time looking for other humans. Drive around the continent, set up some radios and send some signals around the world and stuff.<p>Otherwise, if I knew for a fact that I was the last human? I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t think anyone could really predict how they would handle that. It&#x27;s kind of a horrifying reality to contemplate even for the most introverted among us.<p>The way I see it is that there is no real meaning to life unless we put it there. Each of us gets to decide what is meaningful and how to pursue that.<p>In my opinion the only way to live a superficial life is to live it to someone else&#x27;s standards instead of your own.')
