It&#x27;s a great tool for many jobs, the community is super helpful and very capable, and the ecosystem is tremendous.  Tech decisions are hard to make and managers try to choose carefully.  It sounds like your team already bought into some of the costly hype by adopting Kubernetes (and probably microservices).  It takes restraint not to go further and rewrite everything in Rust.\nIt&#x27;s been a while since microservices became a big deal, so the tech industry may be due for a cost-cutting correction  where projects consolidate a constellation of microservices to efficient monolithic systems written in systems languages such as Rust or Go and use leaner hosting solutions.  You can adopt Rust then, maybe.')
