Cars and trains didn&#x27;t kill track-and-field competitions!&quot;.<p>But now that I think about it, I really do feel a slight aversion towards getting back into chess.<p>Although practiced concentration is a side-benefit of playing chess regularly, the fact of the matter is that nowadays, it is impossible to play in a manner that hasn&#x27;t already been thoroughly examined by some AI.<p>There&#x27;s no new ground to discover; no interesting techniques or thought-processes that an amateur or a world champion can invent; there is no more sense of human innovation in the game.<p>If I picked up a chessboard for the first time in a decade, there would always be a chance that I can come to defeat Gary Kasparov someday; that is not the case with AlphaZero or DeepBlue.<p>Say what you want about the benefits of forced concentration or the social benefits, but that desire to play chess has been extinguished for me, and I&#x27;m sure for many others, once AlphaZero and DeepBlue hit the scene.')
