I dropped out of college (thankfully fully paid for by scholarships for music) after a few weeks. I was pretty useless in my late teens and early 20s and &quot;earned&quot; the low paying jobs I had. I finally got my act together, started working help desk &#x2F; IT support jobs. Then I learned enough to get a job doing web development for low pay. I continued to show my value to employers and my salary reflected it after time. No one deserves more money because they don&#x27;t like their job.')
