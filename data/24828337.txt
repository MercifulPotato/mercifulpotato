Item(by='selectodude', descendants=None, kids=[24829214], score=None, time=1603126990, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24827153, text='&gt;I&#x27;ve never seen a corded drill that was meant for driving screws as opposed to drilling only.<p>That&#x27;s more a function of battery-powered drills being good enough and the stuff that requires a plug is designed to drill through concrete. My cordless Milwaukee has pressure-sensitive speed and a very granular torque setting, along with hammer drill and screw settings. My Ikea furniture is basically bulletproof.')
