Item(by='mumblemumble', descendants=None, kids=[25304419], score=None, time=1607099699, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303485, text='&gt; Programmers who donâ€™t code in their spare time for fun will never become as good as those that do.<p>I would guess that the reality is more nuanced. Programmers who don&#x27;t code in their spare time will probably find their knowledge becoming out of date. But that&#x27;s because our profession doesn&#x27;t really have a concept equivalent to continuing (Medical | Legal | etc) requirements, so we aren&#x27;t really given an opportunity to sharpen our saw outside of our free time.<p>But that&#x27;s only if you&#x27;re consciously doing it to learn new things. My guess is that spare time programming for the sake of spare time programming actually has a deleterious effect. Though I admit I base this on conjecture and over-inference into scanty evidence. There are some anecdotal observations that colleagues who spend their evenings and weekends grinding away on code have a tendency to also be the ones who have trouble concentrating or make burnt out fuzzy brain mistakes at work. And there&#x27;s some empirical evidence from other domains such as language learners and musicians that, past a certain point, additional time spent practicing actually does more harm than good. Brains develop fatigue, too.')
