I PURPOSELY avoid unicorn&#x2F;&quot;big corp&quot; case studies&#x2F;interviews (like the ones mentioned in the article) because of 2 main reasons:<p>1) They are almost useless to new founders. These companies were in their &quot;early days&quot; 6-10 years ago, back when MySpace was still a thing. Although you may learn some &quot;timeless lessons&quot; from them, you&#x27;ll learn WAY MORE by reading from someone who&#x27;s currently 2 steps ahead of you vs 100.<p>2) The curse of knowledge. In general, a photographer who spent 1 year learning how to take good pictures will prob. teach you in a more understandable&#x2F;actionable way than someone who spent 10 years doing that. The reason is simple: They still remember how it was like to be in your position (beginning) vs. someone who&#x27;s now focused on TOTALLY different things and forgot the beginner&#x27;s mentality.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com</a>')
