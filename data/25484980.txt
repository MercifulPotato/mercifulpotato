I think RISC-V is doing fine and will grow regardless.<p>Where more Arm mainstream success will have a slipstream effect on RISC-V is in app porting.  There are significant differences between x86 and Arm, notably memory model (AS does support TSO with a flag, but native apps use the weak mode).  Porting from x86 to Arm can be non-trivial, whereas porting from Arm to RISC-V is far easier.')
