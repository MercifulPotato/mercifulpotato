Then you can set the DNS for that network right there.<p>You run the risk where your phone is set to always use 192.168.1.147 but another device @ .147 is already connected via DHCP, but it&#x27;s not really a thing that will happen because the chances are so low. And it&#x27;s a bit hard on public WiFi where finding the gateway, subnet mask, etc. could be hard, or there might be some access control mechanism on the network side.<p>But for a large amount of people, setting the DNS on their home WiFi with this method would cover 50-90%+ of network usage. No root required.<p>&gt; cue in google apologists telling me how to root or install hacks to do that and that it is totally possible<p>I&#x27;m not a google apologist btw. Running lineageos with no gapps. With a root-based workaround to get around Google&#x27;s stupid&#x2F;illogical&#x2F;incorrect geography-based call recording restrictions.')
