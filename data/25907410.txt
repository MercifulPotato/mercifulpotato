The DARE program and driver safety courses were two examples. I just sort of filter it out now because it doesn&#x27;t seem REAL.<p>The stuff that really gets to me isn&#x27;t the shocking images, but the stories from people. From the guy that got COVID and blogged about his 2 weeks of suffering to my friend who lost his partner in what seemed like an instant. If you want to get to people, share real, unembellished stories. Don&#x27;t try to persuade either, just give people real stories.')
