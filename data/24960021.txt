At least, unconstrained fusion is hard. If you have a couple instructions pairs to fuse together, that&#x27;s fine, but fusing any possible compiler output together is going to make decode even more complicated in practice.<p>This is why Intel publishes software optimization guides that go over what their fusions are, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like the RISV-C spec is going to do that yet for many cases. And compiler authors need to know which instruction stream to generate to ensure fused execution.')
