I know professors at large state universities making $100,000+ in medium to low cost of living locations. Some make even more. They aren’t 1% but they might be top 10%.<p>I guess what’s piqued my interest here is, at what point do we consider labor to be labor?<p>If you get a nice UAW job for 30 years and plow money into the market, are you not a capitalist?<p>Is a surgeon not labor since he or she may not own the hospital? Sure they may make $700,000&#x2F;year, but... aren’t they working for a living?<p>The Meritocracy Trap is a great book I’d recommend that’s related to this question&#x2F;issue. Wealth and the bourgeoisie used to just hang out all day and go for walks in the park. Now they  work 120 hours&#x2F;week.')
