Type <i>:set cm?</i> while in vim to verify that it reports the algorithm as blowfish or blowfish2.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried vim on Android and iOS, so I don&#x27;t know how convenient this would be on smartphones, but for Linux, I can&#x27;t think of any simpler way for keeping an encrypted file of freely formatted text.')
