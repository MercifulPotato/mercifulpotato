I can write code inside my spreadsheet but not inside my browser? WTF.<p>&gt; Here’s my pitch: build a browser that comes pre-installed with node.js, an IDE and a simple runtime environment.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the problem. Ignoring the node.js requirement, just open the developer console in Chrome or Firefox. There you have a powerful JavaScript REPL. There is also a ton of online REPLs, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repl.it&#x2F;languages&#x2F;nodejs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repl.it&#x2F;languages&#x2F;nodejs</a>.<p>&gt; Increasingly there’s a disconnect between the kinds of activities code enables and the “expected” workflow for “being a coder”.<p>What does that even mean? There is also a huge disconnect between the kinds of activities buildings enable and the expected workflow for &quot;being an architect&quot;. Yet I don&#x27;t hear an architect complaining that he cannot design a building simply by wandering through the Taj Mahal and thinking &quot;wow, this really looks beautiful, I enjoy this!&quot;.')
