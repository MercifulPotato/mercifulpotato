The last time I needed it was because the skin on my hands was fucked (cold + dry air and a newfound habit of actually washing my hands; vaseline cream helped) and chronic neck pain (treatment didn&#x27;t help, but changing my backpack apparently did?).<p>Anyway I bought a house a few years ago and I&#x27;m a bit more settled so I&#x27;ve moved to a local GP, and I hope to never need it.')
