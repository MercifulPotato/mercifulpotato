The interleaving of computers and engineering entailed here makes a hard case that there is not an absolute &quot;no&quot; available.  But computational software is a corner case, I know.  (sigh)<p>We certainly view our pure CS people as experts in what they do -- and the things I see them do are, e.g., build out cloud based versions of our product, add new GUI features, automate build and test systems (until management tries to replace them with us... a dubious proposition at best).  That&#x27;s just the stuff I see day to day, since it&#x27;s most closely tied with us on the numerical side.  Why wouldn&#x27;t that be engineering?  I could speculate but I don&#x27;t care to.  We are all working to make the product the customers want.')
