In the real world you can&#x27;t fully test your product hypothesis before building anything, but you also can&#x27;t build a complete product before testing the market.<p>Instead, it needs to be an iterative process. Build a little bit of product, tease it to the market, gauge interest, engage with customers, adjust trajectory as necessary, and continue to iterate.<p>Testing your business hypthesis before building anything is prone to generating false signal. Some times your customers don&#x27;t realize they need what you&#x27;re building until they see it and use it. Many times your customers will praise an idea, right up until you ask them to use it or pay for it.<p>A good example might be the recruiting company started by a famous HN commenter around 2015 that tried to use programming games as a recruiting filter. The idea received huge amounts of praise on HN and large numbers of waiting list signups before they released anything. The demand and hypothesis appeared to be validated. Then they switched to the other extreme, building enormously complex systems for years without actually selling anything to their customers. Eventually they shut down because they realized the market didn&#x27;t actually want what they were building. The initial signal was misleading, but going heads-down to build a product according to the initial signal was also misleading. A better approach would have been to start recruiting up front and slowly iterate on improving it with programming games, rather than going off in the weeds to build a product that no one actually wanted.')
