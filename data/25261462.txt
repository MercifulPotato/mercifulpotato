In disbelief people have started asking how on earth this is possible?<p>I&#x27;m getting sick of this.  The M1 is an impressive chip for sure, but it&#x27;s ridiculous to compare them to the Intel chips in last year&#x27;s MacBooks.  Those chips were old, the cooling solution was <i>terrible</i>, and Intel had already fallen way behind AMD for the kinds of tasks you might actually use a MacBook for.  The cynic in me thinks Apple intentionally handicapped the 2019 models to make the M1 look as good as possible... and it clearly worked.<p>Can we please stop comparing apples to oranges (pun intended)?<p>Like I said, the M1 <i>is</i> impressive - especially in terms of power efficiency - but we should be comparing it to the likes of an Intel Core i7-1185G7 or the imminent AMD Ryzen 7 5800U.')
