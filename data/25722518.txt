It&#x27;s for the large part responsible for Linux desktops having negligible adoption. I wish there would be a open-source, but not free desktop environment built with Qt. Not free because you can&#x27;t have just about everyone pushing their opinion on it. There has to be a team with strong design and QA skills behind it.')
