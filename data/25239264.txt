I moved recently, so we&#x27;ve been ordering 2-4x &#x2F;week while getting the new place in order.<p>I buy locally what I can, but retail offerings are so anemic (even for, say, granola bars) that online options massively eclipse what stores carry.<p>I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to order from Amazon, but I don&#x27;t want to get by with the meager brick-and-mortar offerings.<p>Another example: Recently I went to Best Buy to grab an HDMI-DisplayPort cable. They had it priced at $38. Amazon had it for $12. I&#x27;d have paid up to $20 for the retail stock surcharge, but that overage was obscene.')
