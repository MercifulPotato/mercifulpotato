At sundown, they head back to their roosting grounds in Victoria Park. The sky is filled with hundreds of crows for approximately 10 to 15 minutes during this rush hour. It’s absolutely fascinating to watch.<p>Every so often, you get to be “lucky” winner of them roosting in a tree in your back yard overnight. They cackle throughout the night.
