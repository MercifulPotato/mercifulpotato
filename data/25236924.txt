One would think after the first death, he would have formed a company that ran around hiring them all (even sending some that were too far gone upstairs back to their parents) to provide some sort of a safety net for his real estate activities, but that was never the priority. The old guard in Vegas that (once upon a time) gave Howard Hughes “the business” too was so thrilled to meet Tony Hsieh —-and his endless new supply of self-destructing laptop tourists. Just like Hughes, Hsieh started the ball rolling and I think last month Downtown Las Vegas opened the first of what will be many all-new resorts in that hell hole of lost souls in many decades.')
