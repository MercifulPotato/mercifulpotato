Many of these deaths were people outside of the primary workforce, unlike say WW2 which killed off many of the young able-bodied men the mid 1900s economies primarily relied on.<p>I guess all I&#x27;m really trying to say is that when the story of Covid is written in 100 years time, &quot;mass death&quot; probably won&#x27;t get much of a look-in vs economical and mental-health costs of lockdown, disruption to business, and so on.')
