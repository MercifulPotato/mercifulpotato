Large-scale geoengineering will be necessary sooner or later on Earth.  However, it almost certainly has failure modes that we don&#x27;t know about, and won&#x27;t know about until we can experiment with it.

Testing the effects on Mars or Venus, though costlier to implement, has the advantage of not risking those 8 billion lives.')
