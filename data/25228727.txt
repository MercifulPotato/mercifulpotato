Item(by='Garlef', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606485469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227651, text='&gt; An essay that told people things they already knew would be boring. You have to tell them something new.<p>I think there&#x27;s something off about this statement: A lot of people enjoy watching a new marvel movie once or twice a year while the movies themselves are more or less reiterations of the previous ones. People seem to enjoy the repetition.<p>The same seems to be true for essays: People enjoy finding their own thoughts repeated by anothers voice.<p>For example, there are a lot of essays analyzing&#x2F;explaining&#x2F;stating&#x2F;claiming the importance of book X, videogame Y or composer Z; Art movement A, theory B or profession C. But do they provide anything new besides the comfort of nostalgia for shared experiences? However stale the enjoyment of these essays seems when viewed through the lens of the cited statement, the enjoyment itself can not be denied.')
