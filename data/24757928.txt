Here&#x27;s my MonteCarlo solution if you can&#x27;t be bothered with this garbage. Sorry that repo is 7 years old. Never got a chance to use it again.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;krishnanraman&#x2F;TicTacToe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;krishnanraman&#x2F;TicTacToe</a><p>Makes me so glad I quit the field &amp; went into stats. My classmate just graduated with his stats phd &amp; I asked him how the job interview went. Apparently they asked him if he was a frequentist or a Bayesian. So he said he was a Fisherian, and they had a good laugh. After a few preliminaries on p-values, credible intervals vs confidence intervals, 2 way anova, standard proofs on Cochran&#x27;s theorem, Cramer-Rao &amp; how to simulate multi-variate gaussian, everybody went for lunch. He was out the door under an hour with a job offer.')
