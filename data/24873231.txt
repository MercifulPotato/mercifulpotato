Item(by='chance_state', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603482717, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24871982, text='&gt; Do you also only think that crimes happen only if it gets reported? Meaning if 50 burglaries happen to 100 people but only 2 people reported it, does that mean the burglary rate is 2% or 50%? This is why I don&#x27;t bother with these worthless metrics as I&#x27;ll explain in the next paragraph regarding trump.<p>Based on this middle school level of understanding of polling and crime statistics, I&#x27;ll skip the rest of the comment, but thanks.')
