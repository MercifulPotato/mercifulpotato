Item(by='adventured', descendants=None, kids=[24864458], score=None, time=1603409099, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24864385, text='It&#x27;s the first line of the article:<p>&quot;The infamous megarich Sackler family will pay $235 million in civil penalties as part of a controversial $8.3 billion settlement with the US Department of Justice.&quot;<p>Further, the family owned all of Purdue Pharma. The company settlement is also a direct cost to the Sackler family. If the company has an $8.3 billion settlement with the DOJ, that is the family paying $8.3 billion from their asset as it was 100% owned by them.<p>The headline is slightly misleading, even if the Sacklers are scumbags. The headline is blatantly attempting to pretend the only cost to the Sackler family is $235m. You can tell by the article&#x27;s opening, aggressive tilt; very colorful phrasing like &quot;infamous megarich&quot; - which is ars firing up the outrage machine in the first line to prep a reaction for the rest of the article.')
