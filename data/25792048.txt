This prompted me to give access to the sdcard, however, I had the option to select a single folder (or actually directly creating it within the prompt) that the app will have access to. I.e. Signal now has access to sdcard&#x2F;signalbackups&#x2F; but not to the whole sdcard. (unless this whole new permission process wasn&#x27;t Android but the Signal app. I rarely download apps and have to give storage permissions).<p>This used to be different, but times of giving access to full internal or external sdcards are over. Unfortunately though, the UX isn&#x27;t perfect. I felt like I needed to know that I only want to give it access to a part of the sdcard and actively look that this is indeed possible. But that might be my bias from previous usage talking.')
