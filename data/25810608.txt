Total charge and discharge current cause wear, especially in extreme states of charge. The number of cycles only matters when you assume a given amount of charge in each cycle.<p>The batteries of my 7 years old previous laptop, which was used mostly stationarily and mostly kept at 75-80% state of charge, are still at above 90% capacity. I don&#x27;t fully trust the &gt;90% reported, but the batteries are quite obviously still good.')
