People like you exploiting a silly pathetic protest to justify censorship is the threat to the republic. I&#x27;d rather have the protests than censorship by tech companies.<p>It is not for a bunch of unelected tech elites to decide whether our elected leaders speak. That&#x27;s not their job. Once we hand over that power to a bunch of tech elites, then we have the end of the republic.<p>Nobody voted for Amazon, Apple, Google to be our hall monitors.<p>If there is a &quot;threat to the republic&quot;, then it&#x27;s the job of the political leaders and law enforcement to deal with it. Not Tim Cook, not Zuckerburg and certainly not the idiots at CNN, foxnews or other media companies.<p>The collusion between tech and news industry is the greatest threat to the republic. Not some pathetic protest that amounted to nothing.<p>Have you ever bothered to ask who elected the tech industry to be our masters? Do you really want a bunch of unelected tech elite controlling our lives? Do you want these people to be lords over our elected leaders?')
