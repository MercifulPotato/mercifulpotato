It really weighs down on you. I&#x27;m confident making the claim that anyone in the thread screaming for blood has never dealt with this kind of thing before. It&#x27;s not like you pay $500 and a week later your settlement is ready. No, it&#x27;s in the tens of thousands, and it drags on. And on. And on. And on.<p>So, yes, please hire a lawyer and make sure they are well-versed in SV-type investment&#x2F;startup bullshit. Have them review your contract and tell you where you stand. This will likely cost under $1000 and you won&#x27;t spend two years fighting for a slice of a pie that has a 98% chance of being worthless.<p>This kind of stuff is horrible and can make you feel powerless, but it&#x27;s important to know when to walk away. Not every hill is worth dying on.')
