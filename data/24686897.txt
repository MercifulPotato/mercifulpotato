I&#x27;ve seen developers commit tiny changes all the time, which do not make sense - I wouldn&#x27;t want to trace a small logic change over 10 commits. Also, sometimes you commit, then realise that there&#x27;s a stupid mistake you&#x27;ve made and then you fix it with another commit. In those cases it does make sense to squash the commits so that you get a normal, logical, commit in the history. On the other hand, squashing perfectly legit commits together into a horrendous single commit is a pretty bad practise for obvious reasons.')
