Item(by='trzy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608355050, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25475215, text='If I understand correctly, you are saying that with the reversed bit numbering, bit 31 (in a 32-bit address bus) changes most frequently with sequential accesses because it is the LSB but when wired to the MSB of SRAM, it causes switching in the column decoder for every single access.<p>That makes sense but I didn’t realize that it was difficult to simple swap the wiring. Are the physical pins ordered backwards as well (that is, do PowerPC’s A31 and A30 appear where A0 and A1, respectively, would be on a “normal” system)?')
