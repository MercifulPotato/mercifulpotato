I can&#x27;t help but bring up the countless studies that violent video games do not make kids more violent. Can the same be said for content consumed on social media? At what point is content &quot;extreme&quot; and at what point is it just content? Whose to draw that distinction? There are very obvious examples of extreme content but there are, I&#x27;m assuming, many more subtle ones that are possibly impossible to police.')
