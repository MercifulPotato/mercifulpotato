Of course it&#x27;s quite easy to start creating cpp files. Also C++&#x27;s benefits were quickly realizable while for Rust&#x27;s safety benefits to play out, you need to have replaced significant portions of highly risky components (e.g. those that parse user data, have a history of bugs, etc). Adding Rust to an existing C++ codebase is much harder than adding C++ to an existing C codebase.<p>Also do you have a link for your claim? I&#x27;m interested in reading on the early rise of C++.')
