From the paper:<p>&gt; Across all sports, scoring tempo - when scoring events occur - is remarkably well-described by a Poisson process, in which scoring events occur independently with a sport-specific rate at each second on the game clock.<p>So, yes, basically that was my concept. Estimate its parameters and then you&#x27;ll have the &quot;real&quot; odds. Any difference with the market ones is a potential of profit (considering the house fees).<p>I couldn&#x27;t backtest it since I couldn&#x27;t find free historical data for all types of markets (then again, maybe I didn&#x27;t look hard enough). I forward tested it, though, and it seemed to work.<p>My code is here [1], which also links to a blog post describing the method. Feel free to take a look and contact me to discuss these ideas.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re interested in mathematically modelling probabilities, we are looking for team members to develop a product to estimate the risk of default in loans. After all, a loan is another kind of bet, that takes place in a slightly harder to model environment.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ghgr&#x2F;BetFair_Arbitrer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ghgr&#x2F;BetFair_Arbitrer</a>')
