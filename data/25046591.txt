But you can just see in this comment section (where most of the people are educated) that most of the replies hints that they do not understand the election process hence backing my statement.<p>The movies are obviously PC-Washing all history just like you removed your statues you are removing from your intellect everything that is not consensually approved and history has a lot that this new horde of censors of the good will not like. and the proof is that most the people reading this will downvote me using those censoring tools to destroy an opinion that they do not approve.<p>What is breathtaking is to read comments like &quot;wasnt the election done?&quot; purely because you want to win and hate the system when it doesn&#x27;t play in your favor.')
