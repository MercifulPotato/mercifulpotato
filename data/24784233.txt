I could&#x27;ve just read the titlebait. I think the title misrepresents what the article is about.<p>Commenting on the title -- how many extremely poor visa applications are rejected correctly though? Is the process expected to be absolutely perfect? Are 100 valid rejections and 1 invalid rejection worth not being able to reject any applicants at all?<p>FWIW, I&#x27;m not saying the process isn&#x27;t broken. We shouldn&#x27;t be consistently rejecting a brilliant application -- it hints that the process has some severe flaws. Perhaps it should be easier for the process to &quot;forget&quot; someone.')
