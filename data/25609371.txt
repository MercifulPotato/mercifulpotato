The culture extends from the government to investors and even employees.<p>Government has no appetite for creative destruction and pushes policy favoring large incumbents over upstarts.  Investors have no appetite for risk and only seek conservative investments.  The best minds (that don&#x27;t leave the EU) would rather work for large companies, schools, government, etc. than at smaller, riskier organizations that may not be around in a few years.<p>My family in Europe thought I was a loser and&#x2F;or crazy for leaving a job as an adjunct professor to work at a 100-person startup.  It makes no sense to us but it&#x27;s understandable to someone who views landing a lifetime cushy bureaucratic job as the gold standard.')
