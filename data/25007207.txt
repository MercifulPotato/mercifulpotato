Item(by='plq', descendants=None, kids=[25007398], score=None, time=1604666630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25006498, text='Turkish and Finnish do have the same word structure and very similar sentence characteristics. Both are agglutinative languages with vowel harmony and &quot;floating&quot; word order. Japanese is also agglutinative but lacks vowel harmony. I&#x27;d consider scholars who believe these languages are not similar to be quite wrong.<p>It&#x27;s true that there is practically no common vocabulary between the tree though. (Hungarian and Turkish share some small amount of words due to relatively recent Ottoman rule, but that&#x27;s about it)<p>An Italian friend learning Turkish complained mainly about having to wait until the end of sentence (The Turkish (and Japanese) sentences are canonically Subject-Object-Verb) to understand what&#x27;s going on. And imagine a native English speaker&#x27;s frustration when they realize groups of words can come in any order in Latin (and Turkish, and Finnish) and it&#x27;s the suffixes that make up a word&#x27;s function in the sentence!<p>So, my point was that being exposed to a language with a different grammar is simply good mental exercise and <i>will</i> come in handy when learning other, seemingly separate foreign languages, regardless of the amount of people who speak it.')
