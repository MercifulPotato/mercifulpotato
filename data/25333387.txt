It&#x27;s the same frequencies as digital tv, and if they have a composite video input, it&#x27;s the same process, so not very much extra to support it.<p>There may only be a few OTA broadcasters left on analog in the US, but I don&#x27;t know how far the digital transition went in developing markets. I&#x27;d bet there&#x27;s some rural cable systems still running analog as well.')
