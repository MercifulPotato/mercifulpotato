I&#x27;ve been bitten by that a few times. You&#x27;re at the mercy of the 3rd party to continue updating and supporting the modules. On top of that, it may not support a particular user case you want to implement. And it&#x27;s almost worse if it does, because that likely means that it&#x27;s no longer a simple wrapper around raw terraform resources, but a huge complex beast.<p>In this case, I don&#x27;t think the author necessarily expects the user to directly user his code. It is a set of examples. The modules themselves are very simple (really just one or two raw resources with vars and outputs)')
