Since you can&#x27;t send significant amounts of text to the server, you can&#x27;t really make a message board kind of thing in pure Gemini. The content submission has to be done via HTTP or a terminal interface to the server.<p>But then, if HTTP is the simplest and most secure way to allow posters to make submissions, then is there really a point to allowing the messages to be read over Gemini? Might as well make a simple HTTP layout and have the whole thing run over HTTP.')
