The minimum is 10-12 engineers to have a sane on-call schedule and they have to be distributed across the world (timezone).<p>With 6 people you&#x27;re going to be oncall almost every week. That&#x27;s practically only 4 people on rota because 1-2 people are not participating in rota (last joiners are not yet trained and other reasons). Then when there are issues actually happening, they are getting escalated to the person on rota and then escalated to you&#x2F;team (it&#x27;s rare than one man can fix&#x2F;debug much alone), so you&#x27;re forced to work even when off rota.')
