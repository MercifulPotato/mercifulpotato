Item(by='ksec', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602740283, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24782784, text='&gt;70% more devices per pallet (if I remember the figures correctly) is no joke!<p>I think that was the figure they used and it was more of a spin. ( Unless Flight has changed in recent years ) They were already flying at <i>max</i> load before the packaging got smaller. I did a calculation on HN some months ago and expect may be 30% increase in shipment unit due to weight saving from box, charger and earpiece.<p>Pretty Decent, but not 70% as they did like you to think.')
