Next gen file systems are supposed to be resilient even if hardware fails. That&#x27;s the whole point of raiding and checksumming. ZFS was very much intended to be resilient when faced with bad hardware. Heck, even in the 90s this was a known problem hence chkdsk on DOS marking bad sectors to somewhat mitigate data corruption on FAT file systems. If Btrfs only works when hardware is behaving then that is absolutely a problem with Btrfs.<p>As for my experience with ZFS, it&#x27;s kept consistency when disks have died. It&#x27;s worked flawlessly when SATA controllers have died (one motherboard would randomly drop HDDs when the controllers experienced high IOPS -- which would be enough to trash any normal file system but ZFS survived it with literally no data loss). Not to mention frequent unscheduled power cuts, kernel panics (unrelated to ZFS), and so on and so forth. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible to trash a ZFS volume but it&#x27;s stood strong on some pretty dubious hardware configurations for me and where most other file systems would have failed.')
