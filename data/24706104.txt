The PSU can accept DC because the rectifier is on the high voltage side and there is no 50 or 60 Hz transformer.  This eliminates the inverter and removes the need for any bypass or synchronization circuitry.<p>Of course you need to check carefully that your particular PSU can operate like this before trying it.<p>Alternatively surely there should be a market for PSUs that accept 12 V or 24 V input so that they could be driven directly from single car or truck batteries.  Or the equivalent lithium ion or whatever else is the best available technology of the moment of course.')
