The company is employing (and paying) the employee, not the other way around.  This is not a symmetric relationship.  This is the thing you seem to have a hard time with.<p>And no, the company can&#x27;t do whatever the hell they want either, they are bound by the contract and the appropriate laws.  Which at least one of my employers found out to their detriment (they tried to do something illegal and unethical to me and I didn&#x27;t let them.  Lawyers got involved, it ended very nicely for me)<p>However, had I done what these Googlers have done, I wouldn&#x27;t have stood a chance, and my lawyer would have just thrown up his hands and exclaimed &quot;you did <i>WHAT</i>??!?&quot;<p>&gt; any action you please, including one that risks termination.<p>Absolutely.  But if you risk termination, don&#x27;t be surprised (and cry foul) if you are terminated.<p>This really isn&#x27;t that hard.')
