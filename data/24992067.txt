In the case of Covid-19 we know that humans can be contagious without experiencing negative symptoms. The potentially fatal symptoms appear later on.<p>The danger with that is that there is no reason for evolutionary processes to favor a less deadly strain as the disease has a window to spread before it starts damaging you. The evolutionary pressure towards being less deadly only happens because a disease that kills people too fast doesn&#x27;t have time to spread as far as a less lethal strain.<p>In the case of Covid the disease could easily evolve the opposite direction: to be 100% fatal after two weeks of non-symptomatic contagion. It would still be able to spread just fine using its initial two week period, so there would be little to no evolutionary pressure toward lower fatality rates.')
