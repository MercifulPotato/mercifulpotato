Item(by='keiferski', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606631653, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25243037, text='$1 million is more than enough if you are willing to live in a rural area or small town, or can move to somewhere like Greece, Croatia, Portugal, Sicily, etc.<p>But, I would only suggest this if you have a clear plan for <i>what you’re going to do</i> when you retire. Write novels? Work on open source? Become a world-famous painter? The world is at your fingertips, but if you don’t have a plan, you’ll be bored of retirement within 2 years. If you don’t have that yet, I suggest keeping your job for another year while you plan you escape.')
