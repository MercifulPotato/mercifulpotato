I randomly send one of the balls to Australia, one of the balls to the USA. The moment you look at your ball in Australia, you also know the color of the ball in the USA. How would you use that fact to send information?<p>The crux with quantum mechanics is that you can show (very easily, understandable by the layman, look up the Bell inequality) that in the quantum case the ball only takes on a color the moment you look at it, and so instantaneously is setting the color in the USA as well.<p>However, the basic setup still applies. You cannot send information by merely observing something.')
