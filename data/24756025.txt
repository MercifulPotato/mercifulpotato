While the military may purchase more equipment then it actually needs to lower per unit price, the acquisitions as a whole are not made any cheaper and the weapons developers make no more profit. In fact, given that this material is specifically diverted from what would be sold as surplus, the military would have more money to purchase weapons with if it didn&#x27;t give these supplies to police forces. It&#x27;s also worth noting that, while military vehicles like MRAPs are very visible, most of the requested property is more mundane: bulk ammunition is the most requested category, followed by office supplies.<p>It&#x27;s pretty obviously just a way for the federal government to subsidize domestic police forces with money nominally intended for the defense budget.')
