Leap seconds are added to keep time synchronized to the rotation of the earth (i.e. so noon is when the sun is at its apex).<p>You&#x27;re better with something like epoch time because the duration between two times is always the absolute value of their subtraction. You don&#x27;t have to store a chart to figure out whether the difference in wall time between 3:03:03 and 03:03:05 is 2 seconds or if there was a leap second and it should be 3 seconds.<p>You can do it, but you have to check the behavior of all your libraries. Which isn&#x27;t fun. And make sure that somebody doesn&#x27;t do an optimization that switches the behavior at some point.')
