So the idea that performance is irrelevant for those domains in cases where Java is a reasonable choice is completely wrong.<p>Having the programmer be personally responsible for memory safety doesn&#x27;t work, we know that now. What spacecraft control software is written in isn&#x27;t really C any more than typescript is javascript: yes, the final runtime artifact is in C, but the &quot;source code&quot; includes a lot of additional verification material without which it wouldn&#x27;t be valid. As for operating system kernels, even Linux isn&#x27;t written in C any more because C is too unsafe; rather it&#x27;s written in an ad-hoc language that provides stronger safety guarantees (which it compiles by passing special parameters like -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks to GCC).')
