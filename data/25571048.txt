It&#x27;s about China.<p>The fact is you can&#x27;t buy a single thing made in China and be sure it isn&#x27;t implicated in this in some way. Think of the last few things you bought that were manufactured or sourced some parts in China. Can you honestly say the manufacturer audits their supply chain with the same rigour? At least Apple is trying to keep their supply chain clean, but ultimately that may prove to be impossible.<p>If that&#x27;s the case vilifying Apple for it won&#x27;t fix it, the only way to fix it will be to shun Chinese products completely, but that&#x27;s going to be a very painful and difficult process for more people than just Apple. Take Fairphone for example, those guys work really hard to do the right thing as much as possible, but they have dozens and dozens of suppliers in China some of them indirect. In their own literature they point out they can&#x27;t answer for every single supplier. This is a really tough problem.')
