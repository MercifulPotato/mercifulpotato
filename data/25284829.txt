It was literally destroying the world with violence.<p>The Roman identity was literally built on conquering. It took a long time until we were able to say ‘yeah, why can’t this small little land mass be it’s own country?’. Why would a country have to fight for independence? Can you imagine that in today’s society? It’s absurd. Yet, many of our countries had to ... fight for independence. What kind of world was that? A world where dominance wasn’t an undercurrent?<p>Intellectual dominance hasn’t found socially acceptable gutters, it literally <i>pays</i> in society. Esports and video games is a band aid. The underlying trait is dominance. I can’t prove my thesis in two paragraphs I suppose, but you’ll have to forgive me for that.<p>Dominant behavior is dysfunctional, and since it is an underlying human trait, it reincarnates itself constantly. Racism and classism are all forms of it, under the umbrella of elitism.<p>Why can’t my unfit brother go to the same gym I worked hard to get into? Sounds crazy right? Well he’s fat, he didn’t earn it, etc. We don’t even contemplate this anymore physically. Yet, why can’t someone also work at Google because they aren’t the best? Intellectualism at the moment rejects ‘it takes a village’, and it rejects ‘the hand cannot say I am not of the body’.<p>So be it, it’s just the dark ages. One day we’ll figure it out, as we did with the other manifestation of dominance.<p>My most serious point is this - the nonsense cannot and should not affect people’s livelihoods. Find the abstract gutter for the nonsense already, and do not fuck with people with your meta game.')
