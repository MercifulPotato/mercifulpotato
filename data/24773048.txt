VS is very nearly a dead research agenda. If you look through citations from recent years, virtually all of them are just referencing it as a landmark in the prior art alongside Paxos et all. There&#x27;s not much in the way of new work that&#x27;s wholly within the VS paradigm. The main reason for this IMO is that the original paradigm predated people&#x27;s full understanding of some important details of consensus in asynchronous networks, so some of the concepts are cross grain so to speak. People doing novel work today would rather just start on the firmer ground of everything derived from Paxos, etc.')
