Rubin sees his punishment as unjust but he believes this kind of judicial error is a small bump in the road to a communist utopia.<p>Towards the end of the article, the author accuses &quot;the NumFOCUS policy&quot; of failing to &quot;consider the mental health of people that are accused&quot;.  But if someone has a mental breakdown after being criticized that does not mean the critic did anything wrong.  Legal and moral norms exist to allow us to answer questions like &quot;did this person do anything wrong?&quot; or &quot;did this person cause this other person&#x27;s mental breakdown?&quot;  I think it&#x27;s naive to expect codes of conduct to improve on what we already have.<p>I suppose I think codes of conduct are as good as the people you get to enforce them.  But that&#x27;s the thing: the people willing to volunteer their time to be cops tend to be the last people you&#x27;d want in those roles.  If codes of conduct are not a replacement for fair-minded people maybe they&#x27;re more trouble than they&#x27;re worth.<p>Also, while I did not find his presentation insulting, I do think he made a mistake by spending so much of it directly critiquing someone else&#x27;s presentation.  It was in bad taste though not -- of course -- the kind of thing that needs to be punished.')
