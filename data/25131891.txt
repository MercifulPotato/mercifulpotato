Additionally, consistent winners may face other fees (e.g. Betfair&#x27;s &quot;premium charge&quot;, which will hit long-term consistent winners with a 20% fee on overall profits)<p>Combine those fees with the need to tie up the money until a decision is made, and it makes it hard to make profit from high probability bets.  (or from any bet where the line is reasonably near the true odds).')
