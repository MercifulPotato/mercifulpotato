Item(by='codys', descendants=None, kids=[25368484], score=None, time=1607563683, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25363862, text='As others have noted, the statistics you listed are recklessly inaccurate.<p>That said: even if they were accurate, we&#x27;d still need to examine how may signature match failures result in detecting actual fraudulent voting, and how many signature match failures don&#x27;t (ie they are false positives that serve  to disenfranchise voters).<p>It turns out that the vast majority (97%) of ballots rejected due to signature match issues are likely valid. IOW: we&#x27;d disenfranchise 32 people for every case of fraud occurring. I have personal doubts that the rate for fraud was even that high (3% of the % of ballots rejected for sig mismatch), as you&#x27;d expect some type of criminal charges resulting from it.<p>Even assuming the 3% of sig rejects number, because that&#x27;s already a % of sig rejects, it comes out to 3% of 0.2% (the actual number of sig mismatch rejections). This is 0.6% of the total vote.<p>Additionally, signature match checking disproportionately rejects votes from specific groups, while accepting votes from other groups. In other words, having a signature check (or making it &quot;stricter&quot;) allows tuning which demographics you accept votes from. Allowing this type of targeted disenfranchisement is not good')
