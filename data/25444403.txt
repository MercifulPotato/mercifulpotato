Perhaps in terms of energy-intensity, paper is higher than plastic. But energy use of store bags is relatively negligible anyway, not to be ignored but also not a grave threat. But in terms of the spread of plastics and biodegradability, a one-time paper bag is certainly better than a one-time plastic back, and not quite as negligible in its impact.<p>The problem here is that increased energy use applies to every bag used, whereas the concern about biodegradability only applies for bags that are mismanaged. A plastic bag that&#x27;s buried in a landfill or burned in an incinerator is a non-issue, and most (almost all?) bags end up properly disposed.<p>&gt;Besides, if plastic is being replaced by paper, it simply shows incentives work<p>Is it? The parent commenter said that plastic bags were banned, not that they were taxed.')
