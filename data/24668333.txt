The language the twitter client is set to is also not english (maybe French? the original discovery was made by someone who lives in France. I don&#x27;t know), which introduces the possibility that it wasn&#x27;t even daytime in the US when those were sent.<p>I&#x27;m all for publicly announcing these things (in a responsible way) and forcing a quicker response from the company, and its also likely that Troy tried to reach out on his own, but I just think that screenshot is a bad example of a company not responding to DMs. If it had been 48 hours to a week, then I&#x27;d be in the concerned camp.')
