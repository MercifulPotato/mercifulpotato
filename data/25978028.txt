Item(by='joppy', descendants=None, kids=[25978064], score=None, time=1612092537, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25977673, text='I apologise for not having read the book, but that wasn’t the gist of my comment: my point was that wealth or income levels tend to run in families anyway just because of socioeconomic class and similar environmental factors. The book you mention would not help many people in the lower-class neighbourhoods around mine because people there don’t tend to read books on personal finance (perhaps because that is not valued in their social circles, which in turn are products of their environment).<p>The distinction between wealth and income in the book is not so helpful for comparing inequality I think. You can be well-off by having access to enough money: whether this is by having a lot in the bank and a small income, or a little in the bank and a large income, you are still far better of than having neither.<p>I contest the term “self-made” since in particular, socioeconomic status is transmitted from parents to children (there are many studies of this). Sure, there are exceptional self-made individuals. But in a world where the income bracket of a child can be fairly reliably predicted from their parents, is calling a large group of people “self-made” meaningful?')
