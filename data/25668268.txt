Item(by='AceJohnny2', descendants=None, kids=[25668498, 25668286], score=None, time=1610004758, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25666929, text='FWIW, I am currently using a CalDigit TS3+ with a (Intel) MBP, with dual displays (one over DP, one over USB-C (DP)). They work as separate displays, not mirrored.<p>I also tested an HP G2 Dock [1], because its dual-DP ports gave me more options, only to find that macOS can only use those two ports as Mirrored to each other.<p>Apparently [2], this is because the HP G2 implements its two DP ports as DP1.4 MST (Multi-Stream) on a single link, and in that mode macOS will only support a Mirrored configuration. It cannot (as of Big Sur 11.1) use them as separate displays.<p>I&#x27;m told you can also use the HP G2 with separate displays by plugging one monitor into one of its USB-C outputs, kind of like how I&#x27;m using the CalDigit TS3. I tried the one labeled USB-C (DP), and that stayed mirrored, but apparently I should&#x27;ve tried the Thunderbolt downstream port instead. I returned the dock before I knew or could try this.<p>All this to say, I&#x27;m disappointed by the mess of an ecosystem that Apple has built around Thunderbolt 3. But I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m surprised.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.hp.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;pdp&#x2F;hp-thunderbolt-dock-120w-g2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.hp.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;pdp&#x2F;hp-thunderbolt-dock-120w-g2</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@sebvance&#x2F;everything-you-need-to-know-about-macbook-pros-and-their-lack-of-displayport-mst-multi-stream-98ce33d64af4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@sebvance&#x2F;everything-you-need-to-know-abo...</a>')
