Indeed&#x2F;Monster do it by default.<p>The way I see it, recruiters want to string you along just in case their first picks don’t work out and to prevent you from realizing that you probably need to be looking for gainful employment elsewhere.<p>This is on the more benign side of what recruiters get away with. You can sue Oracle for ageism, sexism, etc. You can’t reasonably sue JobsToday! because you wouldn’t get anything out of them and another recruiting firm would just pop up in its place. It boggles the mind that we allow companies to offshore their discriminatory hiring practices to recruiters.<p>That’s fine. Once the broader public becomes aware of recruiter abuse, I imagine they’ll get legislated or regulated out of existence.')
