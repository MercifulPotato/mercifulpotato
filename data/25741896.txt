Trademarks aren&#x27;t universal, they&#x27;re for a specific domain.<p>So who can bid on the keyword &quot;Apple&quot;? Does Apple Computer get exclusivity? What about Apple Cosmetics? Apple Travel Agency? Apple Corps? Imagine telling Greg Apple of Apple Plumbing that he can&#x27;t advertise using his own last name!<p>Even if you let <i>everyone</i> with a relevant trademark bid on keywords, you&#x27;re still gonna have problems because so many trademarks are normal words. Should a random orchard that hasn&#x27;t obtained a trademark containing the word &quot;Apple&quot; be able to place apple ads?')
