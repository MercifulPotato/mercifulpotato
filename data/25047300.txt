I really and truly understand where Josh is coming from. I have fully sympathy for him and whatever actions he took for his best interest after a gruelling 7 years. I am really grateful that he has shared the numbers so openly. Josh, you don&#x27;t know me but please go and do whatever the F you want to do and don&#x27;t listen to what others say. You deserve it!! It is disappointing to see comments like &quot;what did employees get&quot; ? Employees get salary and as long as they are happy working for the company and company takes care of their well being, they are not entitled to any additional founder benefits. Not all companies are unicorn where &quot;early&quot; employees get a big piece of the pie.')
