They might have connections to other people that are still in the business and they&#x27;d harm them indirectly by leaking after getting paid. Why make more enemies? Also, why put more attention onto themselves after they already succeeded? Some people have very strange reasons they do things, but I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s likely. I think these things are organized with the top priority of minimizing the risk of getting caught.')
