All the wireless protocol that we use are actually &quot;raw&quot; radio whatever that means.&quot;<p>Sometimes the most profound of truths, the most elegant of truths, are so simple, so as to be overlooked and&#x2F;or written off by people.<p>In this case, you see, if &quot;everything is turtles&quot; all the way up, then at the base layer, the turtle all the way at the bottom, the turtle who rests on no other turtle, well that turtle is &quot;radio&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s change the topic and talk about cars for a second.<p>You have drivers, people who can drive a car, that is, people like you and me.<p>But then you have a subsection of these people, who are mechanics, who can fix most typical problems that a car might have, but there are limits to their capabilities; they couldn&#x27;t make a car more aerodynamic, or reengineer a gas car to be an electric one, etc.<p>Then you have, as a subsection of Mechanics, Car Design Engineers (all Car Designers are in effect Mechanics also, because their knowledge is a superset of the mechanic&#x27;s knowledge).<p>The Car Design Engineer can do &quot;miraculous&quot; things that an ordinary Mechanic cannot -- he or she could make a gas car electric, an electric one gas, could design for higher MPG, could swap out systems, etc., etc.<p>The Mechanic works at a lower level of abstraction than the car driver does, and so, can do many things that an ordinary car driver cannot, but the Car Design Engineer works at a still lower level of abstraction than the Mechanic -- and thus he or she can do &quot;miraculous&quot; things that the Mechanic cannot...<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all raw radio&quot; -- is the simple, elegant, most profound truth at the bottom of the stack of turtles (compare to the concept of common denominators in Mathematics), it&#x27;s the lowest-level abstraction, it&#x27;s the abstraction level that, should we work from it upwards (rather than pre-built protocols, drivers and stacks) downwards, we&#x27;d find that we can do things that we otherwise couldn&#x27;t, if we were forced to work within the constraints of all of those pre-determined systems.<p>Finally, the Internet itself -- <i>the Internet itself</i> -- <i>IS A SERIES OF ABSTRACTIONS</i> -- a series of &quot;Turtles on top of other turtles&quot;.<p>The Internet itself...<p>Meditate on that one for a second... I did, and the implications of that meditation were profound!<p>Why shouldn&#x27;t someone commit to learning about all of those levels of abstraction, and gaining the corresponding power of amazing engineering (aka, &quot;abstraction working&quot;) abilities -- should that knowledge be gained?')
