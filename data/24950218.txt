He&#x27;s had a managerial role but the career path and salary has never been great and he&#x27;s often worked graveyard shifts. He understandably has felt very unfulfilled and depressed with his life.<p>He has always been really into computers and I&#x27;ve begged him for years to try and angle his way into tech. I&#x27;m a UI&#x2F;UX designer and PM myself, so I know it&#x27;s possible but I&#x27;m also aware that I could be seeing through rose-colored glasses here.<p>I&#x27;ve offered to start training him in UI&#x2F;UX design weekly but I&#x27;m not sure what the best long-term path would be for him&#x2F;me to focus on. Do you have any recommendations for him?')
