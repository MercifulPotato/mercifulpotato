But the problem with this legislation (as introduced in France and Germany where a hard shutdown is imposed after hours with actual comms features disabled) is that it makes my way of working impossible (although usually us tech workers find a way to get an exception one way or another :) ).<p>Thus obviously I&#x27;m against legislation that restricts my desired way of life.
