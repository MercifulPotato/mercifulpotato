When a notification pops up on my phone, my headphones get &quot;taken over&quot; by the sound from my phone. I basically just turn off Bluetooth on my phone at that point (easier than disconnecting a device).<p>Minor annoyance for sure (especially because I have notifications turned on for like 3 apps on my phone), but I&#x27;m so used to elementary OS (using it since 0.2) that there&#x27;s no way I can switch to anything else — Windows or another Linux distro — at this point.')
