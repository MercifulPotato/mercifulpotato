Both are equally valuable.<p>There has been an ongoing issue in mathematics between documentation and communications.<p>Documentation is rampant.  It is a necessary part of the process of determining whether something is correct, rather than almost correct.  It’s a <i>technical</i> requirement of the process, much like desks and chairs.<p>Communications is almost an afterthought to the community, but is math’s basic value to society.  Here I define “communications” as imparting the basic insights to anyone who isn’t either developing the proof or reviewing the proof for correctness, I.e. the entire planet minus 10 or 20 people.<p>Communications has relatively little to do with documentation, although documentation can and has masqueraded as communications.  The current mathematical enterprise has put 95% (99%?) of the effort on proofs to expand the mathematical universe, and precious little on communications.<p>I’d argue that should be reversed at this stage in the development of mathematics.  But, as a nod to the established order, I’d propose that 50% of the effort of <i>professional mathematicians</i> be spent in the development and improvement of the communications side of mathematics.  No better time, given the maturity of media technologies.<p>My two cents...')
