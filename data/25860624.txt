In the meanwhile I&#x27;ve stumbled upon CascadeStudio.<p>Cascade Studio is fast, looks good, available everywhere via browser. I was able to do a non-trivial model, add bom generation via console.log. It would be great if there was a standalone version as well, so larger projects can be built directly from the filesystem.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s good stuff, whishing the project all the best.')
