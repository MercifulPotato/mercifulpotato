The differences with other libraries are:\n- Ogham has only a single and simple API for sending any kind of messages. With the same code, you can send an Email through SMTP in development and tests but send the same Email through SendGrid (HTTP API) in production. Only the externalized configuration is changed.\n- Ogham supports template engines for writing message content so developer doesn&#x27;t have to handle template engine integration. It adapts itself to the presence or not of template engine(s). It also handles technical concerns that are specific to the sent message such as inlining CSS styles and images in the email. The developer doesn&#x27;t have to know the RFC and the technical concerns anymore. He just writes his HTML email like he does in a browser and everything is magically handled by Ogham.\n- Ogham provides testing utilities that the developer can use to test his code (for example, check the presence of an account creation confirmation code in the sent email).\n- Ogham integrates with existing frameworks (like Spring Boot, more are coming).<p>I share this project here to get your feedback. I am also looking for contributors because I have many ideas for the future of this project like supporting RCS messages and make Ogham available on several platforms (JVM, NodeJS, Android, iOS, ...). Any contribution is welcome !<p>The full release notes: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groupe-sii.github.io&#x2F;ogham&#x2F;v3.0.0&#x2F;release-notes.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groupe-sii.github.io&#x2F;ogham&#x2F;v3.0.0&#x2F;release-notes.html</a><p>Thank you in advance for your feedback.<p>NOTE: I am also looking for a job')
