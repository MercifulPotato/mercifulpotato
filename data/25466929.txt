There was no second party. It&#x27;s just a `svn mv` of a directory.<p>I agree that is anecdata, yet I&#x27;ve had 10y of extensive experience with subversion and 10y of extensive experience with git (plus a sprinkle of cvs and rcs to boot), both used on FOSS and company contexts. I&#x27;ve regularly teached both to beginners ans seasoned developers alike over the years. I&#x27;ve had the occasion to do things with both that would make many blemish and faint. Dismissing the counterexample with &quot;everyone&#x27;s different&quot; is a bit hard of a handwave. I stand by my assessment: subversion looks easy on the surface but is fatally flawed down to the most simple actions, to the point of being able to cause data loss.')
