They just exists to get money, but it is something everyone could live without. Lots of things could get easily automated. I do not know, but people fear automation. Is it not the goal that people could work less? But if you work less, then you get paid less, so we need a way to give people money gained from automation, so everyone can enjoy their life without doing bullshit jobs.<p>It is never going to stop if people not doing bullshit jobs means they do not get money. We need a system for this. People should chill, lay back, let the automation tool do its job. People should not worry about not being able to do bullshit jobs for money. :&#x2F;')
