Item(by='rosseloh', descendants=None, kids=[24975814], score=None, time=1604346708, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24971132, text='&gt; If someone goes faster but never tells anyone, they still went faster.<p>That&#x27;s true, and I certainly am not the authority here nor am I knowledgeable enough to pretend to be one....But this reminds me of an argument I had once with someone about Short Takeoff &amp; Landing airplane competitions.<p>They were bringing up how a group in Alaska was totally incorrect in claiming the competitors at their event were setting world records because (paraphrased) &quot;well I know a guy whose uncle in Idaho took off in a foot less than that on his mountain airstrip, so that video isn&#x27;t of the world record.&quot;.<p>Did he? Maybe. I can&#x27;t prove either way. But the difference is, these guys are <i>the</i>, or at least <i>an</i>, authority on STOL world records. If you are serious about setting a record like that, you&#x27;re going to participate in one of these events. Uncle Jimmy might be a pretty dang good pilot but it really doesn&#x27;t matter if nobody was there to see it. And the pilots in these all agree that this group is the authority, so why would they recognize a &quot;record&quot; from someone outside it?')
