Not because it&#x27;s a particularly good language but because there is a simple binary interface: symbols and calling conventions. Libraries built from this code can be used from virtually every other language. People actually rewrite stuff in C just to obtain this property.<p>Complex binary interfaces restrict software reusability. If it&#x27;s too complex, it will be extremely difficult to build and maintain the links between programs.<p>Modern languages approach this problem by getting rid of the links. All code and interfaces are visible to the compiler, the resulting binary image is a perfectly optimized version of the whole program and nobody cares about the machinery the compiler outputs. Nothing else can interface with these programs though... I don&#x27;t see people calling Rust functions from Python without using the C ABI.')
