Item(by='efreak', descendants=None, kids=[24978724], score=None, time=1604398724, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24968257, text='&gt; I&#x27;m now trying to properly tag and curate these media files and host it in some way that I can use it remotely. It&#x27;s not a trivial job.<p>Foobar2000 with discogs addon will help you with organization; musicbrainz picard will hello you with actually identifying your files if necessary. Airsonic is quite nice for actual hosting, and allows you to create multiple accounts with limited access and time-limited shares for playlists&#x2F;albums&#x2F;etc. I personally use fb2k with a dozen or so addons to organize my media library and playlists (the auto-playlists feature is nice). I use airsonic for hosting; on computers I use the web interface (or fb2k) for playback; on mobile I use dsub for playback. Bubbleupnp server is also installed locally so I can share&#x2F;cast to receivers that don&#x27;t support subsonic protocol, though I have yet to use this since I started using airsonic.<p>Airsonic is a fork(?) of subsonic, and has several forks available with different feature-sets and focuses (one for japanese media, one for audiobooks, etc). The one I use is airsonic-advanced, linked below. It integrates with last.fm and listenbrainz for scrobbling, and (I think) with last.fm for artist info and similar artists (I&#x27;d like to see similar artists replaced by gnod, personally).<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foobar2000.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foobar2000.org&#x2F;</a><p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;picard.musicbrainz.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;picard.musicbrainz.org&#x2F;</a><p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;airsonic-advanced&#x2F;airsonic-advanced" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;airsonic-advanced&#x2F;airsonic-advanced</a><p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;daneren2005&#x2F;Subsonic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;daneren2005&#x2F;Subsonic</a>')
