Much the same can be said for camera ISPs or neural accelerators. GPUs only started tackling more general workloads long after they were a standard, and even today GPGPU is a bit of a mess.<p>If GPUs didn&#x27;t come around when they did, and games were all CPU-based today, you wouldn&#x27;t have an easy time inventing and selling a GPU.<p>&gt; Intel itself tried to move beyond OoO and utterly failed.<p>One attempt in 2001 (and a few before then when the market was more competitive but before people had the context we have today) by the company with market power doesn&#x27;t invalidate my point as much as reinforce it. People have tried approximately nothing in the last 20 years, all pointing back to this one bad design Intel did 20 years ago as if that proves the taken path is the only valid path.')
