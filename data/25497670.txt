It is also known that the dark matter consensus has problems despite billions spent on research over decades. When there is an experimental result that contradicts the leading theory, that is interesting and worthy of media attention. If this experimental result was only published in popular media, then I too would likely ignore it. However it was also published in a major journal. Like you said elsewhere, that doesn&#x27;t mean it is right. But I think it is worthy of attention and discussion and should not be dismissed out of hand because it doesn&#x27;t agree with consensus.')
