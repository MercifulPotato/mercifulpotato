Literally paid to try and place you into the company.<p>Back to topic - HR is a tool.<p>Their job is to keep the company from getting sued by employees, the government and sometimes unions over bad practices. If the company is large enough they also report to the board.<p>Maybe HR&#x27;s better analogy for the employee is a double edge sword. If you choose to use it, you&#x27;d better be prepared. Know the your rights, local laws&#x2F;governance about your employment.<p>If your complaint aligns with laws then you&#x27;re better setup for success, but again, it can always come back to bite you.')
