Arguing that the other side does not have a legitimate concern regarding some political conflict is generally not going to be very persuasive, and it isn&#x27;t going to make those people go away.<p>That being said, I think it is possible to care very deeply about certain issues, and act on those concerns, in a way that largely avoids the political sphere.  Trying to fix the problems we are concerned about by means of influencing the power games of elected officials is often very crude and ineffective.  Sometimes influencing politics is necessary, but if we let ourselves believe that the only way to effect change is &quot;shake the vending machine&quot; of governmental power we will generally end up frustrated.')
