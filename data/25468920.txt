I expect a class system to affect game mechanics in a deeper way (eg, in KOTOR you get different allowances for attributes, feats, and skills depending on your class).<p>FWIW, I actually prefer the progression system in cyberpunk. rigid class systems make more sense in party-based rpgs. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s accurate to say the game has a class system; it&#x27;s more like it intentionally has the <i>absence</i> of classes.')
