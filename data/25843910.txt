There have been externalities affecting game design since the NES.<p>Early NES games were modeled (or ported) after arcades, which incentivized you to put in a quarter, play a handful of minutes, then put in a quarter to continue. This didn&#x27;t translated well at home. So game designs moved away from that format.<p>When movie rental places started offering games (late NES early SNES days) they started making games take longer than a rental period to beat (2-3 days). One well known example is the monkey puzzle in the Lion King game [1]. I distinctly remember renting NES games and beating them in a few days before returning them. Specifically, one of the later Mega Man games. Granted, I owned other Mega Man games so I was familiar with the format. I still would have loved to play that game over and over, but I only rarely was able to buy games.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thegamer.com&#x2F;lion-king-remaster-monkey-level-controversy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thegamer.com&#x2F;lion-king-remaster-monkey-level-con...</a>')
