So no magic computational-memory performance panacea yet unfortunately ;)<p>I wonder if graph processing might be more broadly applicable than matrix processing as done on GPU&#x27;s. Atleast &#x27;sprinkeling&#x27; computation between memory seems like a good idea for HPC. Moving data is expensive and slow.')
