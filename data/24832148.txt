What&#x27;s the use of literacy without engagement?<p>There are lots of ways to learn things without reading. While I personally taught my kids reading at an earlier age than 10 (they are also not home-schooled), I&#x27;ve also seen kids learn &quot;late&quot; but still learn as needed. I also see a ton of kids who can&#x27;t read even though they were &quot;taught it&quot; early.<p>On a side note, Montessori methods for teaching are quite interesting in how they use materials to teach concepts most traditional schools rely on abstract ideas and worksheets. They don&#x27;t need to read to do the Montessori materials, but worksheets certainly require some level of reading to understand what&#x27;s to be done.')
