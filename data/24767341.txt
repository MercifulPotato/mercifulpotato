It can mean Artificial General Intelligence - AGI or Artificial Narrow Intelligence - ANI. In my experience and opinion, as soon as something is well defined it becomes ANI - Vision systems, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Neural Networks - it loses the name &quot;AI&quot; and gets its own specific name.<p>How AI is talked about depends on the audience. Nowadays, no one really thinks of rule based engines or scripts as AI, neither as ANI or AGI, but back in the day people thought maybe you could just have enough rules to replicate intelligence. So old ANI is just &quot;an algorithm&quot;<p>To researchers, as soon as an approach is well defined it becomes ANI; at least so far. In future there may be an approach to AI that becomes AGI, but ANI is not considered AI to most researchers.<p>For industry, AI generally denotes a handful of ANI approaches - Machine Learning and Neural Nets. If you say &quot;AI&quot; in a corporate environment, this is what people will think of.')
