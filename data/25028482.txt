Like think how to someone living in the US(usually) it&#x27;s inconceivable to live in one place with 3 generations of people, grandparents, parents and kids, friends nearby. But to these cultures that&#x27;s where the strength lies, you help them they help you.<p>But in these cultures it&#x27;s also incredibly important to be seen as &quot;doing well for yourself&quot;. You will see people from these cultures will frequently(for instance) drive a Mercedes, just because that means you&#x27;ve achieved something in life. Doesn&#x27;t matter the Mercedes in question is 20 years old and on bald tires, it&#x27;s a Mercedes, parents and grandparents can now say they are proud of you. It increases your social standing. Likewise, if you manage to buy an iPhone, that can be seen a an achievement(even if the iPhone is fake, what matters is people think you can afford an iPhone). Then in turn, if you are seen as successful(by the virtue of having those expensive things) you get better social opportunities, for employment, education, housing....it&#x27;s almost cliche, but in some places having an iPhone, a good car and a gold chain(all fake of course) can really and measurably improve your standard of life.<p>Like, have you never seen a movie where a person emigrates to a wealthy country, and writes&#x2F;calls the family back home saying &quot;oh yeah I have my own bed, a car, a TV and a mobile phone! We eat meat every night&quot; and like at home , that&#x27;s incredibly impressive, even though to me or you that&#x27;s just normal stuff.')
