Police has been of great help in my community. They are kind. They take crimes seriously. They are friendly to kids in school. I shouldn&#x27;t need to mention this as it goes without saying, but whatever: they are kind and friendly to kids of all colors in my community.<p>And dictatorship in what way? You mean that the president repeatedly asked mayors and governors to ask for national guard, as required by law, but couldn&#x27;t do anything because they said no? You mean the president has no power over state or city jurisdiction so he could only yell on Twitter for opening the cities -- pathetic in a way. You mean the president has no authority to ban critical race theory so all he could do is to ban them in federal agencies, again under his full authority? You mean the president has no power over media so all he could do is to call them fake news? Or you mean that the first thing that Hitler did to gain power is to disband the police, just like many of our justice fighters have been demanding?')
