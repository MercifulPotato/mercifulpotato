The most elegant easy to use interface to a game is a &#x27;push this button to win&#x27; button. This might be one of the reasons why you still have the physical interfaces design surviving in video games, while we don&#x27;t see that in desktop UIs anymore (outside some niche software).<p>That being said, SC2 goes out of its way to make it frustrating. They intentionally design such frustrating UI elements into the game to act as skill differentiators. For instance, a Zerg player needs to click every N-seconds on each of his queens to spawn eggs or risk getting behind. That makes SC2 overall one of the most &#x2F;execution-&#x2F;oriented esports, where the perfect execution of a good strategy is the largest differentiator in skill. In contrast, dota2 is a very strategy&#x2F;game-sense oriented game, where the top players are not necessarily mechanically the best.')
