There is little correlation between phone calls and actual progress, if not the usual « giving an impression of progress, while the problem entrenches itself. » Those may be two groups with surprisingly little overlap. I’ve called 6 numbers when I thought about it, none of them answered (turns out in France they’re all closed after 9pm, badly staffed, or reserved for teens or women), yet I didn’t commit suicide (I did commit criminal activity though, as a revenge for society not returning my call to this day, and generally society being vengeful towards men because supposed ancestors were supposedly mean to women).<p>People who commit have real problems that a phone call generally doesn’t solve, unless your problem is just about feelings, which is... let’s say it helps those who call for attention a lot, and who would end up with a failed attempt to call for attention, which will attract attention, but it will hide the real x5 numbers behind the scenes of the other gender who actually commits suicide when they try.<p>It’s time to stop with the « let’s speak about it » attitude, and start with the « let’s give you funds&#x2F;education&#x2F;solve your parental problems&#x2F;throw the book at your boss&#x2F;mandate your wife to let you see your kids&#x2F;stop sidestepping you at work&#x2F;fix the VA together » attitude.<p>Men are not an option.')
