I donâ€™t think even The Rolling Stones would want to see their songs reused by, say, neonazis.  \n</code></pre>\nHard disagree from me. I mean it might hurt to see your work misused but that already happens all the time across different disciplines. The artist behind pepe the frog is not a fan of his work being adopted by white nationalists and that&#x27;s terrible, but intellectual property law is not gonna stop anonymous people with photoshop on 4chan.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m in favor of neonazis trying to turn music I like into their propaganda, but I can&#x27;t see any reasonable way to fix this via IP law. Fundamentally the problem is not with reprehensible  people remixing&#x2F;reusing&#x2F;appropriating culture, it&#x27;s people holding reprehensible beliefs. The solution is to try and change their beliefs.')
