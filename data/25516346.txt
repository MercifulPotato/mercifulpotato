CSS has a pretty simple and elegant core. You just have to understand the problems it was designed to solve.<p>- Readable documents at any screen dimensions or resolution (i.e. you should not need to scroll horizontally back and forth to read each line just because you have a smaller screen.)<p>- Incremental rendering - the document could be rendered as the data arrives over the network.<p>- The user should be able to increase the text size.<p>The &quot;normal flow&quot; layout model is designed in such a way that these constraints are fulfilled by default. You <i>can</i> make a layout which only works on a screen of a particular size, or where the user have to scroll horizontally for every line, but you have to do it deliberately.<p>I&#x27;d say the fundamentals of CSS is to understand the &quot;normal flow&quot; and the box model.')
