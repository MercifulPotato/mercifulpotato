That&#x27;s often a benefit, but it&#x27;s not large and is easily dwarfed by the cost of bad abstractions.<p>On the other hand, DRY as a principle shines when it allows logical changes to a program to only require physical changes to the code in one place. E.g., in &lt;horrible but self-contained algorithm&gt; it&#x27;s plausible that bugs might exist, and you&#x27;d really like bug fixes to apply to all implementations. The easiest way to manage that is to only have a single implementation. Likewise, to the extent that they&#x27;re sometimes necessary your magic strings should be given a name so that your compiler can catch minor typos (supposing the edit distance between various names in your program is largeish).')
