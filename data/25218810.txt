What used to be simple is now no longer simple. Why is it like this? To accommodate the x% of people who seem to get confused in some manner when presented with &quot;too many choices&quot;. I forget the reasoning now, and disagree 1000% but don&#x27;t want to sidetrack my argument any further.<p>Anyhow... compare the original form to an imagined GUI since we&#x27;re not presented with the software to make a proper comparison. If you needed to fill out the paper form quickly you can tick..tick...tick..tick..write a bit.tick...tick..read..write.etc.<p>Now with the software, does it use a mouse? Probably not. It&#x27;s most likely a touch screen. Possibly a tablet. So now every choice required more interaction. More choices. Opening a dropdown? So you mean to say the developers have decided to hide important information until you request it? The paper version has everything you ever need to know at a glance. One side of a sheet, no need to even flip it over.<p>This is all conjecture, but I experience this type of thing all the time when a software &quot;solution&quot; comes to fix a real-world &quot;problem&quot;.
