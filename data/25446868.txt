And that&#x27;s absolutely correct.<p>I have no functional use for Turkish Lira.  The only reason I would possess any is because I&#x27;m speculating that the value of Lira will increase relative to the currency I use to pay for my needs.<p>Using that definition, one could create a Proper Currency Score by taking the number of people or businesses that use each currency and multiply it by the gross value of transactions performed in the currency (excluding currency exchange).  This definition is at least reasonable on the surface, as the top currencies would be USD, EUR, and RMB.')
