Whether something&#x27;s actually organic is highly dependent on whether the farmers and grocers actually adhere to the guidelines.<p>You could theoretically be audited, but I never saw or heard of a single audit in the 4-5 years I worked in produce at a national grocery chain. Granted, this was over 10 years ago. But given the regulatory climate in over those years, I would be shocked if enforcement was made stricter.<p>That&#x27;s also ignoring the fact that non-organic farming began in part as a way to more cheaply and efficiently grow food, thereby supporting a larger population. It might be hard to unwind that clock simply because of the food demands of the current human population.')
