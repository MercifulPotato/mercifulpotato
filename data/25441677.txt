They could just as well deploy their own custom name resolvers and talk to them via IP from applications like YouTube for Android.<p>The scenario you&#x27;re describing (DNS-level blocks) could always be circumvented.<p>On the other hand, if you live in the US and don&#x27;t override the ISP&#x27;s name servers, most probably they will spy on you and sometimes even do things like injecting ads into third party websites.
