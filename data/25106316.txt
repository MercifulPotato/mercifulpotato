Our company is writing a portable replacement to our Electron client right now. The electron option was absolute garbage, very limited, and caused us untold pain. We got tired of telling customers &quot;we can&#x27;t really do that&quot;. The Qt version is already working on Linux and Windows, and on whatever CPUs we compile it for. There&#x27;s no excuse for Electron, because there are good, portable GUI frameworks and libraries to use instead. Hell, don&#x27;t like Qt? Use GTK+! I use GTK+ for my own portable personal projects, I like the API better and it integrates better with XFCE.')
