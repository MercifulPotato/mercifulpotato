Because most farming stopped making sense, once you could ship food from the midwest cheaply.<p>But how much water is consumed by the farming that remains in NY? I never had the impression any of it was irrigated, but haven&#x27;t tried to look up numbers. Farming in CA is of course a wildly different story. Left without water it&#x27;s a desert, not a forest.')
