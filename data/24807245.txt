I don&#x27;t think the situation is as you describe it though. Basically everyone with strong political convictions is furious at HN for being outrageously (as they feel) slanted toward the opposing side. But it simply is not so. I suppose this is a consequence of the &quot;if you&#x27;re not for us you&#x27;re against us&quot; mentality, which is the essential political stance, though growing in intensity lately.<p>The reason we do these sorts of edits is not driven by politics but by the attempt to optimize HN for curiosity (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20optimiz%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20optimiz%20by:dang&amp;...</a>). The principles of how we do that have been worked out over the years, and they&#x27;re not derived from political positions. Curiosity likes to cut across such boundaries—being limited by boundaries is not in its nature.<p>I get that above a certain threshold of political passion, the feeling becomes that the site ought <i>not</i> to be optimized for curiosity, but rather for political justice or some value like that. That&#x27;s understandable—those are also good values. HN would just be a totally different kind of site if we did that. The question then is whether a site dedicated to curiosity has the right to exist on the web or not—including under current political conditions. I think it does. Why shouldn&#x27;t it?')
