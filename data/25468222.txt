Surprising because she works for a place that is routinely featured on the frontpage of HN, where very nearly every single person on HN has used their software sometime in the last ~30 years. It was my view, originally, that these people ought to already have the answers to the questions they&#x27;re asking. I was wrong.<p>Her and one of her colleagues are the de facto git gurus in her entire department of over 100 people. She&#x27;s ended up owning tooling in their build pipelines that is quite complex, using libgit, etc... That tooling was eventually exported around to the rest of the engineering teams (~1,000 total engineers). Now she gets random, challenging git (and perforce, to a lesser degree, and she stepped in to help with some SVN issues at one point in time, though those projects have moved over to perforce, I believe) questions from the entire engineering organization.<p>I do agree with you, though, that git is probably the wrong thing to focus on and that she and her colleague are outliers. But, it&#x27;s interesting to see nonetheless.')
