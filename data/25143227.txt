Anti-vaxx garbage is a prime example of something that should be censored into oblivion.  It is actively harmful to the public.<p>But, on the other hand, who pulls the levers of censorship is equally terrifying.  I don&#x27;t want a world where a dissenting opinion is censored because it doesn&#x27;t fall in line with whoevers ideology.  For example, Chinese censorship of the Tiananmen square incident.<p>How on earth can we fix this?  Social media has created a world of bubbles.  Some of which are FILLED TO THE BRIM with misinformation.  Penetrating those bubbles is nearly impossible.  They&#x27;ve always sort of existed, yet somehow it feels like they are more extreme now-a-days.<p>Just musing.  I really don&#x27;t have a solution to this but am certainly interest to hear any proposals.<p>Perhaps the solution is really as simple as better public education?')
