I&#x27;ve tried it a few times in the past and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time coming back to it when something else intervenes. Usually self-inflicted because of some complex and unecessary environment setup involved.<p>I&#x27;ve lately had some success using vanilla emacs, Geiser and Guile (or MIT) Scheme. If you want to work through sicp, the little schemer [1], or my current favorite &quot;Essentials of Programming Languages&quot;[2], then that&#x27;s the perfect setup. Racket will work too, but if you&#x27;re using emacs anyway then it&#x27;s just as easy to get going with Guile or MIT.<p>I&#x27;d recommend getting familiar with largely vanilla emacs[0] rather than a curated kit, but it will require a little bit of additional investment. Additionally, you&#x27;ll be getting acquainted with emacs-lisp (elisp), so you&#x27;ll be swimming in lisp languages.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of VS Code and only use it for work when I have to (and then only when I can&#x27;t use vim). I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d work, vim too, but there are an awful lot of emacs&#x2F;lisp resources out there and it&#x27;s helpful to take advantage of what&#x27;s available.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sanemacs.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sanemacs.com</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0262560992" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Essentials-Programming-Languages-Daniel-Friedman&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0262061457" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Essentials-Programming-Languages-Dani...</a>')
