One of the groups (Amish I believe) has something called Rumspringa, a time when teens leave the strict confines of the community to experience modernity. The vast, vast majority return to their communities.<p>A husband and wife team trying out the 1800s lack community and the other things I mention above. Also, using a husband and wife team of sociologists (meaning, educated, employed and highly employable with job security, salaried, with health care coverage, etc etc) as the quintessential example of a human under modernity seems fishy to me.<p>My point is not that modernity has no benefit whatsoever. My point is that it is ridiculous to called it an “absolute” joy, indicating no downside. Sure, for the privileged that may be true, but for many it is not the case.')
