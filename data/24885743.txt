It&#x27;s been really good so. It&#x27;s a smaller niche than X.org&#x27;s, but I get to do everything I need. HiDPI support is just right, just throw output eDP1-1 scale 2 in the config and you&#x27;re set.<p>Clipboard works perfectly splendid, screen-sharing works (not as perfectly splendid as clipboard does), input works, chromium&#x2F;electron is getting support for native wayland. Qt and GTK Wayland support&#x27;s quite good.<p>I have had no problems whatsoever and I invite you to try it. I have no hard-proof evidence or numbers to support my opinion, just try it.')
