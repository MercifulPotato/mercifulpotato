The GUI is incredibly ugly. MIDI workflow is terrible. The developers seem slow, old, and very opposed to new ideas. You can&#x27;t run Windows plugins in it, so goodbye productive work. No professional anywhere uses it. You have to use C++ (!!) to write support for control surfaces instead of scripting in a real language. Setting up your audio&#x2F;MIDI hardware settings has its own window instead of being part of Preferences like any real DAW. And of course, no proper DAW workflow like Live or FL Studio. You can&#x27;t make beats with Ardour, you need actual musicians which is just stupid.<p>I would definitely stick to Audacity.')
