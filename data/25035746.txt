It maintains compatibility with the existing C API and seems to perform well.<p>You can find more information on both the concurrent minor collector and the parallel minor collector in the recent ICFP paper: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3408995" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3408995</a><p>You can also see KC&#x27;s talk on the paper here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ASX79I0jm6M&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6195" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ASX79I0jm6M&amp;feature=youtu.be...</a><p>--<p>The TL;DR on Domains is that they&#x27;re heavyweight threads. You essentially want as many as you have cores.<p>Our talk (separate to the one above) at the OCaml Workshop also covers a lot of the terminology and how to get started with Multicore today: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Z7YZR1q8wzI&amp;list=PLKO_ZowsIOu5fHjRj0ua7_QWE_L789K_f&amp;index=6&amp;t=0s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Z7YZR1q8wzI&amp;list=PLKO_ZowsIO...</a>')
