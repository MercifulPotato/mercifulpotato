Viruses and pandemics aren&#x27;t a matter of opinion. Facts don&#x27;t care about your feelings.<p>I&#x27;m a coward. Got no problems admitting that. I also have elderly relatives who I don&#x27;t want getting sick and potentially dying. The sooner this pandemic is gone, the better I&#x27;ll feel.<p>I actually want everyone to get their freedom of movement, freedom of religion (are churches open yet?), freedom to earn a living and pursue happiness back. I&#x27;m not just thinking of myself. Sorry if that calculus (freedom of movement + religion + others &gt; freedom from masking) seems wrong to you - maybe we value different things.')
