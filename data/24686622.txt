If you can&#x27;t know if someone means it to be positive or negative in the end (and there are good instances where you need a double negative to mean a positive and can&#x27;t just restructure easily) then you can&#x27;t actually know what the person is saying.  And I&#x27;ve had plenty of people come back and say they meant the opposite of what I&#x27;d assumed from their statement, too.<p>Contrived example:  You&#x27;re explaining a process and say, &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t get &#x27;no results&#x27; here.&quot;  Since it&#x27;s spoken, there&#x27;s no punctuation to help you understand that &quot;no results&quot; is a phrase and is a result in and of itself.  You&#x27;d just hear &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t get no results.&quot; and may think that an empty result is desired.<p>For the others, if people who <i>know</i> good grammar are reading your work, they&#x27;re going to be distracted by your bad grammar and have less focus for the actual point of your work.  If you&#x27;re serious about getting something done, that should matter to you.<p>Notice that I keep saying &quot;work&quot;, though.  In casual conversation, these things <i>don&#x27;t matter</i>, except to attempt to train people for when they <i>do</i> matter.  So mostly they don&#x27;t matter.')
