If you looked at the top hundred streams there the artists are all probably studio grade, but maybe a tenth of them actually make a living off their art.<p>A lot of people are making a <i>lot</i> of good stuff for free online and making pennies on it because in practice its not talent that is scarce, its eyeball access and virality. Your average webcomic artist today does not have the resources to exploit the psychology of target demographics the way Disney will for their next streaming show or the war chest to shove ads for it down throats until it reaches a critical self perpetuating mass of popularity.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make the stuff they make less worthy of being enjoyed, though. They just can&#x27;t spread the message by themselves.')
