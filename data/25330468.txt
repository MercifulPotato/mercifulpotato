Much of what makes music theory difficult is that the terms and notation systems have built up over centuries, and they come from musicians who were concerned with what&#x27;s useful, not from programmers who understood the math. So pretty much everything has nine different names, and pretty much every term gets used to mean nine different things.<p>That said, for modes, AFAIK the names are all 100% arbitrary and used for historic reasons. For scales with varying numbers of modes, the first thing that jumps to mind is that some scales have modes that are identical to the scale, or to other modes, so references probably leave them out (e.g. consider the modes of the whole tone scale!). But there&#x27;s probably also cases where this or that mode might get omitted because it whoever wrote the authoritative textbook about that scale thought it sounded awful, or felt it shouldn&#x27;t be considered a mode for whatever reason.<p>There could be other stuff going on I don&#x27;t know about - when I was learning this stuff I ignored big swaths of material that didn&#x27;t seem useful for programmatic music.')
