Together, weâ€™ve created a music experience that we really enjoy - MusFuse.<p>MusFuse is a centralized platform that unlocks music listening, sharing, and discovery across all major music providers such as Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, and SoundCloud.<p>Users can create circles with friends where music sharing comes to life through posted songs, which other circle members can listen to using their favorite streaming service without leaving MusFuse. They can also react to the post, start a conversation in the comments, add the posted song to their favorites, and so much more.<p>We would love to hear your thoughts and feedback!
