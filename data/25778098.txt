So was Stalin. If you’re really in favor of free speech, then you’re in favor of freedom of speech for precisely the views you despise. Otherwise, you’re not in favor of free speech.”<p>Right now, there&#x27;s an enormous liberal bias in Silicon Valley. The founders of these companies are more libertarian - some are even conservative, but their employees by-and-large are anywhere from left-leaning to far-left. That&#x27;s fine. I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with that. The resultant problem is with the helicopter parenting generation that produced these people, and their inability to accept things that make them uncomfortable.<p>But... its okay, because like all complex systems, it trends toward equilibrium, and now you&#x27;re starting to see the system self-correct.')
