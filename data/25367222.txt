All you&#x27;re doing is trying to redirect and distract from them. Reciting a Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap label at me doesn&#x27;t prove your point, it just shows you&#x27;re irrational. And now you&#x27;re making straw man arguments falsely accusing me of having the idea that I&#x27;m somehow above God. That&#x27;s a non-sequitur. Where did you get that from??! Why do you have to just make shit up, instead of arguing the facts? Tell me what Hitchens said that isn&#x27;t true, and prove it.<p>This is a discussion about psychopathic people being able to conceal it, and fool gullible people into literally believing they&#x27;re saints. Of course she relentlessly self promoted and grandstanded -- that&#x27;s what she was doing when she attended a nun consecration ceremony (which she didn&#x27;t need to do, and didn&#x27;t help the poor) and decapitated innocent people with the propellers of her private charter airplane, killing two children, and a man who ran a home for lepers, then she arrogantly claimed it was a Miracle from God that SHE survived. How narcissistic can you possibly get?<p>Do you or don&#x27;t you agree that Mother Teresa is a psychopath, and if you disagree, how do you square it with the facts that Hitchens and others raise? (Without attacking the messenger, address the FACTS.)<p>The spectacle of you trying to defend her with mumbo-jumbo, without contesting any of the widely know and documented facts about her, simply proves my point that she fooled a lot of gullible people who refuse to be swayed by the facts, including you.')
