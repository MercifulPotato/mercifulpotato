But the comment I replied to made a strong claim: that (technologically?) BTC offers this ability. This is not just some nice property that it currently has, it&#x27;s part of the &quot;intrinsic value&quot; of BTC. This to me sounded like a claim of &quot;guarantee&quot;, not just a claim that &quot;nobody banned it yet, and maybe they won&#x27;t ban it in the future, either&quot;.')
