It’s a good indicator.<p>I am, however, puzzled by the refusal of testing facilities to actually disclose what cycle count they are using. It could be too high, it could be too low, it’s likely “just right”. But “trust me I am doing it right” is the wrong answer to someone who hasn’t yet made up their mind.')
