Especially the first point.<p>I&#x27;d also add that there is still a Heroin problem, albeit diminished. It is not unusual to see someone walking though the local village, out-of-their head drunk at 9am on a Wednesday. It isn&#x27;t alcohol though, it&#x27;s Heroin. But it is also an economically poor area. The weather is amazing and the place is gorgeous, but for someone raised here who doesn&#x27;t manage to escape it can also be a trap. Many of the older people work in the fields in the morning, the in the late afternoon they meet in the cafes and chat about village life. Coffee is $0.15, a beer is $0.7. There a very few younger people. Those that can leave have left for a city. The ones who remain are that ones who were not able to leave. I spoke with the local President last week and he himself said that the area has become a skills desert.<p>So yes, I think the route to Heroin addition looks something like this. Get financially stuck in the local area. Get a bad reputation for being lazy. Try to become YouTube&#x2F;Insta famous. Give up. Turn on those that tried to help. Drink &amp; smoke weed as an escape. When those stop working try Heroin. I know a couple of people in my village that are on this path right now.<p>There is some crime here. It seems to fall into two categories. First is petty crime where something goes missing that&#x27;s worth about $100. That&#x27;s enough to quickly sell for immediate cash (likely for some form of drug). This has happened to me twice, and I don&#x27;t really mind.<p>There is more &#x27;organised&#x27; crime where a place gets methodically burgled when someone is away. I know people this has happened to.<p>There is a rapidly growing contingent of foreigners here now, and we&#x27;re mostly accepted. Economically, I get the impression that most businesses prefer to deal with the foreigners. Even the guy that sells firewood says that 95% of his customers are now foreigners, and that he prefers it that way. There are <i>lots</i> more foreigners arriving too (leaving cities due to covid, basically), very few Portuguese people being added. Most people in my village are over 60. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how the demographics play out over the coming years.<p>Anyway, maybe that is of some interest. The region of Portugal I am in is Castelo Branco. I&#x27;m starting an ISP here too: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gardunha.net" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gardunha.net</a>')
