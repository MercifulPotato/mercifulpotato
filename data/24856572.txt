That fast CANNOT be sustained for long, and becomes dangerous after just a couple of days regardless of your fat&#x2F;energy reserves.<p>Jews do it for 25 hours once a year, and traditionally eat an extra lunch upfront (&quot;Mafseket&quot; - &quot;The pause meal&quot;) and a regular-to-larger dinner afterwards. Muslims do it for a month, but only during daytime - and feast all night (some who can afford to, just sleep all day and stay up all night and don&#x27;t actually fast). Neither of these traditions are healthy in any way.<p>I&#x27;m not as familiar with the Hindus and Jain fasting traditions - but I know some of them last months and all of them involve water drinking, so those are likely indeed healthy.')
