It doesn&#x27;t mention that funds can distribute interest and non-qualified dividends, which are taxed at the regular federal rates. It doesn&#x27;t mention the 20% qualified-dividends-capital-gains rates or the Net Investment Income Tax, which further impact high earners.<p>In short, most people should do their own analysis because this analysis is not going to be accurate for them.')
