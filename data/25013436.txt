How about the rest of unicode? My guess is you have a static or fixed size texture atlas. To put all 140k glyphs of unicode in a single texture atlas would require a 12k by 12k texture assuming 32x32 pixel glyphs. Plenty of devices don&#x27;t support textures of that size and you&#x27;d be limited to just that size of font. Handling this in an actually &quot;all of unicode&quot; way so a user can read documents and type names in all the languages etc (&quot;use facing apps&quot;) is not something Dear ImGUI as currently designed can handle AFAIK. It&#x27;s not just a PR waiting to be written, it would be a large change.<p>There are other issues with ImGUI paradigm as well. How does it handle accessibility for example. With OS level widgets the OS itself can read the content and deal with accessibility. Same with HTML. But with entirely internal data and just a list of GPU commands that&#x27;s a huge open issue.<p>I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of Dear ImGUI and have donated $$$$ to it. I think it&#x27;s awesome. I think there is lots of room and inspiration to be had from Dear ImGUI for making it easier to make UIs. I&#x27;ve written articles on it (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;games.greggman.com&#x2F;game&#x2F;imgui-future&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;games.greggman.com&#x2F;game&#x2F;imgui-future&#x2F;</a>) But I&#x27;m not blind to its current limits')
