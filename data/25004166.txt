Item(by='krapp', descendants=None, kids=[25004198], score=None, time=1604628221, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25003977, text='&gt;You seem to be implying that the divide is not rural or urban, but whites vs blacks, or rural whites vs everyone else.<p>I&#x27;m implying that race and class divisions are more relevant in American culture and politics than rural vs. urban, yes. As is right vs left. The narrative that the primary motive for Trump&#x27;s support is a deep cultural anger by rural Americans against city-dwellers is entirely populist fiction.<p>&gt;There is half the country supporting a candidate like trump because they are disgruntled of the other candidates.<p>Only about half of eligible voters even voted in 2016, and only half of <i>them</i> voted for Trump, a slight majority voted for Clinton. And eligible voters comprise about a third of the total population. Even if you took for granted that all rural voters support Trump, and all urban voters don&#x27;t, Trump supporters would still be in the minority.<p>&gt;and you don&#x27;t get to wash your hands off the fact that the country is divided<p>Are you trying to imply there&#x27;s <i>blood on my hands</i>? What precisely are you implying that I should be ashamed of?<p>Your increasingly accusatory tone makes me not want to continue this conversation further.')
