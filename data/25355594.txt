And yet, here were the anti-maskers, who apparently just won’t be happy unless we have absolutely no regulations at all.<p>Perhaps they were not enthused about the prospect of the board enacting restrictions that were considered (by many reasonable people, no less) not to have the desired effect. There might be an argument for effective restrictions but these guys are arguing for restrictions that they admit may not have done anything. Seems like both sides have lost their minds actually.')
