Grustaf is the type of person who would not refer to anyone as &quot;trailer trash&quot; even in jest or to quote someone, because Grustaf is of of the opinion that they act and are colorblind, and has behaved in such a way even in the thread by using colorblind language not to sanitize their speech, but because their use of language attempts to practice what it preaches. Grustaf would argue something like that if we seek an equitable and just society in America, [Grustaf self identified as European, giving no indication of race] then America should emulate Europe where such equity, equality, and social programs should be administered on the basis of economic need and the laws and orgs should not resort to racial language and framing altogether, because it should be based on economic or human needs that should be readily apparent with no need to poll or take into account skin color.<p>To steelman Grustaf further, I suppose Grustaf doesn&#x27;t see an irony that dark skinned grapes aren&#x27;t even allowed to be called Champagne, because Grustaf would say that grapes are not people, and that sparkling red wine made in Champagne tastes entirely different, but were it to taste the same, then the red Champagne and the white Champagne would almost certainly be given equal shelfspace and cost roughly the same if made by the same winery. Grustaf would on the other hand say that human beings transcend such issues, and certainly any person of any color can be and achieve and have the same intelligence and thoughts as any other so long as they are given equal opportunity. Grustaf believes that what Apple has done here is erode the principle of equal opportunity in attempt to try to provide equal opportunity.<p>I tend to think Grustaf might still think that if they were an American living in the country, but based on what Grustaf has said, they would be equally shocked at how not universal our basic social services are, even to elites. Grustaf would say &quot;All men are created equal&quot; should be made true in America so much so that racial language need no longer apply.<p>I just happen to find that either naive, or not pragmatic enough given the state of America in 2020. I can give Grustaf the benefit of the doubt, to a degree, because they admit to not being an American and seem to imply they don&#x27;t live in America. It is easy to see how they do not have a full picture, and they admitted to as such.<p>I happen to feel that Apple&#x27;s move is their best intentioned pragmatism to take a stand for something.<p>Zacmcloud on the other hand seems to have no such positions as above, and calls people &quot;trailer trash&quot; in jest. If zacmcloud is referring to me as the type of person who thinks any Whites are &quot;trailer trash&quot; let me correct the record. If working class Whites in Appalachia or Detroit were given access to an elite education through social programs, I&#x27;d be all for it, and presumably so would Grustaf. We just disagree that racial language in such initiatives kills the intiatives altogether. One reason being is American descendants of slaves aren&#x27;t given popularized names for their heritage like Appalachia, and such terms typically exclude such people implicitly or explicitly in their definition, and often not by the people who coin the terms, but by the people who apply them. In my view, Grustaf&#x27;s position is untenable in America at this time in the same way that if MLK&#x27;s I have a dream speach would have been unintelligible had he not kept the words Black and White in.<p>&quot;I have a dream that one day little black boys and girls will be holding hands with little white boys and girls.&quot; MLK<p>Someone maybe believe MLK could have said &quot;of all races&quot; and accomplished the same thing. To that position I say, then why wasn&#x27;t &quot;All men are created equal&quot; sufficient to address slavery, much less racial inequality in America.<p>Addressing such issues will take time and ideas, and even when race has been transcended, I think it is a fair bet that class will not have been. And by the way, MLK spoke about that increasingly towards his later years, and soon after he was assassinated.')
