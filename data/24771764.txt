They&#x27;re still doing transcription in the cloud which requires sending your voice for Apple to process and store.<p>I have no issues personally with using cloud services like this but they very much used weasley language in the presentation and website to obscure the fact that Apple&#x27;s cloud absolutely will get access to your unencrypted raw utterances following their wakeword detection, and cause people to conclude that that wasn&#x27;t happening.<p>As a side-note I find it a bit surprising that with all the history Apple has with Siri and the meaningfully powerful on-device ML acceleration that they still can&#x27;t download and run a recognition model on-device that wouldn&#x27;t require streaming your speech to Apple&#x27;s servers...')
