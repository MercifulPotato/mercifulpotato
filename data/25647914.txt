It&#x27;s also easy to see that, by far, artists don&#x27;t create things to actually make a living from copyright-based forced royalties.\nPatron and Kickstarter have shown that we are very much capable of funding artists remotely, either in an ongoing, post-payed basis for the former, or a pre-payed, project-specific funding way for the latter.<p>As for patents, it should be easy to demonstrate concrete societal harm through monopolization and inhibition of progress (by blocking multiple recent inventions from being combined); as example for the former I give Sawstop (there are many reasons to not want to buy a whole machine from one specific vendor), examples for the latter are small firearms (handgun&#x2F;rifle) design and the core technologies the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mpegla.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mpegla.com&#x2F;</a> practices rent-seeking on, which are embedded into hardware, but e.g. foregone in favor of software decoding (or appropriate alternatives for the other things they administer).<p>I expect it&#x27;s relatively easy to figure out a lower bound for the environmental harm from not using hardware decoding or choosing H.264 over H.265 purely for licensing reasons (and tanking the higher bandwidth costs).<p>Trademarks, however, seem to serve a purpose.<p>As an example for the drug R&amp;D world, handling at least human trials by having a shared pot that everyone who wants to can invest in, and which is payed back e.g. double or whatever a suitable scheme for determining the overall payback sum, financed through a fixed VAT levied on the drug in question if it ever happens to get sold.<p>It might potentially work better as a sort of bond auction, where the study administrators calculate the required budget, and public founders offer to pay X$ now in exchange for getting Y$ back via that tax system, while the auctioneer(system) takes from the offers that want the least return (in %), until the budget is reached. If the sum of all funding offers is insufficient, no money changes hands and the study doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>I&#x27;d suggest a tax rate between 5 and 40% for such a system.<p>In the movie industry, people would put their money where their mouth is, and (likely through some intermediary agencies) pay to &quot;make the sequel happen&quot;, or to choose which TV pilot shall get a first season.<p>There might be need for some sort of anti-tivoization regulation to replace what the GPL3 accomplished there, but overall, software seems to be hurt by copyright preventing a &quot;on the shoulders of giants&quot; process to soak deep into less and less theoretical cases. See ZFS vs. Linux, if you need an example.')
