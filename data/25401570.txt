I don&#x27;t understand how this responds to the commenter&#x27;s critique. Under the hypothesis, almost all stars in the universe would be so far from Earth that we would see at most one photon from their light by the time it reached us, for whatever the applicable time interval is. Would that single photon be sufficient to register the star&#x27;s existence?<p>I&#x27;m not a physicist so presumably I&#x27;m wrong. But why is this wrong? As far as I understand it, this paradox is the reason we have the theory that space is expanding at a rate which makes objects in effect move away from each other faster than the light they emit.')
