I actually kind of like it.<p>I&#x27;ve come to associate the borderline absurdity of logos for open source projects with projects I like at this point, and I do think these kinds of logos are almost a shibboleth for certain kinds of software. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s less about not knowing how to do &quot;better&quot; or driving away designers and more about signaling &quot;hey, this is NOT corporate software.&quot; I&#x27;ve always considered it as a community thing and a cultural quirk more than anything else. To come in and say &quot;this unicorn is <i>ugly</i>, let me fix that for you&quot; would be to misunderstand a lot of things about the context that the software exists in IMO.')
