Item(by='csnover', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611812735, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25920145, text='&gt; rest assured that we do read what you&#x27;re writing on these posts and they&#x27;ve spurred some internal process discussions.<p>OK, that’s good to hear. Nobody from the company has reached out to me so this is the first time I’ve been made aware. The only public replies I’ve seen up until now seemed to focus exclusively on just the public bug bounty part, which is really the least important part of this whole thing.<p>&gt; I believe the bugs you mentioned were cleared&#x2F;fixed with version 7.0.0.439 which was released in Q1 of 2020.<p>It’s really critical to be transparent about this stuff and tell your users. You published release announcements for subsequent versions and there were no mentions of security issues being fixed. When you don’t do this, it looks like you’re intentionally trying to hide vulnerabilities from the public. This is not how any company should act, especially not one that promotes how radically transparent it is[0].<p>&gt; I just noticed the Daniel Stenberg libcurl citation. Oof, yea that certainly a whiff on our end. Luckily though we were able to make up for it […]<p>I reported license violations in a ticket and nobody replied.<p>You did fix the libcurl violation, which is great, but it took a letter from the author, which is less great.<p>You are still violating the OpenSSL license.<p>It honestly baffles me that nobody at Backblaze thought to check the licenses of the other OSS libraries that you’re distributing after receiving a notice that one of them was being violated. It’s not like there’s a huge compliance burden or complicated dependency tree to evaluate—as far as I can tell, it’s zlib (which requires no acknowledgement), libcurl (which does), and OpenSSL (which also does, for the version you are using[1]). This would’ve taken like 30 seconds.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;transparency-in-business&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;transparency-in-business&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openssl.org&#x2F;source&#x2F;license-openssl-ssleay.txt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openssl.org&#x2F;source&#x2F;license-openssl-ssleay.txt</a>')
