I have no idea why Spotify feels the need to clutter my recommendations with radio stations like &quot;Rap Caviar&quot; and &quot;Music for when you know you&#x27;re the bad bitch&quot;, meanwhile it doesn&#x27;t show me new releases for music I actually listen to because of all the irrelevant suggestions taking up space. I ended up creating a new account because apparently listening to a couple of podcast episodes means you want half your page filled with recommendations for shows on the same topic.')
