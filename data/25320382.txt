If they had done so, then there wouldn&#x27;t have been a time when everyone had to buy Sun hardware to run Unix. There would instead have been a choice, and many DEC shops would never have converted to Sun. Commentators saying, as the article does, that it was all about the rise of the PC are wrong. PCs were useless toys at that time. Of course DEC may have done down later just as Sun did, in the X86-64 take over.<p>+I know: Ultrix, blah blah...but seriously no Ultrix wasn&#x27;t embracing.')
