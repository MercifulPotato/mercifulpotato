Whatsapp uses the Signal Protocol. Their claims of end-to-end encryption are true (and easily verifiable! just pull out the debugger of your choice)</i><p>I don&#x27;t dispute this but apparently there&#x27;s still a way for Facebook to give FBI et. al. un-encrypted chats, no? So is that truly encrypted?<p>&gt; <i>I think your (perfectly understandable) misinterpretation was corrected in a rather polite manner, but you still wanted to argue after being corrected by multiple native english speakers.</i><p>Yes and no. Being a native speaker doesn&#x27;t excuse ambiguity and idiomatic expressions. I believe people who write in English on the internet have a duty to avoid idioms as much as possible. I am not a native speaker and easily misrepresented the meaning.<p>But, even the author corrected me so, okay.<p>As for polite... let&#x27;s agree to disagree there. You are questioning my opinion that I get snarky replies but IMO it&#x27;s clearly visible that no small amount of replies weren&#x27;t made in good faith and were only aimed to express hurtful sarcasm.')
