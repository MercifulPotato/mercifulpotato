I live in North East Scotland, but have spent a lot of time in Norway with work over the past 20 years (I&#x27;m actually closer to Norway than to London!). If there&#x27;s so much as a sprinkling of snow over here, airports shut down and there are car crashes everywhere - meanwhile in Norway, it&#x27;s business as usual. Also in Norway, if you have a car you must by law fit winter tyres during snow season.')
