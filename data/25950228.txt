At best a tiny settlement after years of litigation. Congress will have a few hearings for show, so reps can get face time and claim to be &quot;for the people&quot;. SEC will wag their finger, might even levy a few hundred thousand in fines.<p>This will be the end of wall street. Or at least, the end of companies like Robinhood. Faith in American systems were already at all time low after last four years and now with this kind of market manipulation at the expense of retail investors, American stock market will be bust. There is zero reason to play in this casino.')
