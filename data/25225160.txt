I was simply complaining about the lack of HLA correlations in the paper, which is suspicious. Probably they didn&#x27;t type or impute HLA haplotypes.<p>My HLA-B27 example was actually a positive one. It gives you higher chances of a good outcome if infected by HIV.<p>Another paper, with a small sample size, claims HLA-B44 and C01 are susceptible [1].<p>I work with the Oxford vaccine group, and I am quite interested in this effect, including in vaccinated patients. It&#x27;s pretty well known bad vaccine efficiency and side effects will correlate very strongly with HLA, and with thymic involution.<p>Sadly everything is quite chaotic at the minute and it&#x27;s difficult to get samples and funding for these ideas. If we were more advanced, we would get be classifying vulnerable patients and asking them to shield according to HLA and immunoageing&#x2F;dysfunction markers.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;1422-0067&#x2F;21&#x2F;15&#x2F;5205" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;1422-0067&#x2F;21&#x2F;15&#x2F;5205</a>')
