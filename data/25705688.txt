Do you know what changed my mind? I was swimming in the Lac Leman in Geneva. I decided to go underwater and hold my breath for a while, I noticed that I couldn&#x27;t stay that long while my brother who had his gear could look underwater for a long time and enjoy it way more. That&#x27;s when it hit me. Constrains don&#x27;t make you more creative per se. They only force you to create workarounds, but in the end that&#x27;s all it is, workarounds not really a good breath of fresh air. Hopefully the analogy makes sense to you too.')
