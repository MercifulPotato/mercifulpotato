Terrorists continue to post on Twitter <i>right now</i>.  Totalitarian regimes carrying out genocide continue to tweet happily away on Twitter.<p>This is about going after anyone they think they should ban in order to keep the Democrats happy.<p>This is not about Trump for the technology companies.  It&#x27;s about bending the knee enough towards the Democrats to ensure that they retain as much of <i>their</i> freedom as possible.  They are sacrificing others&#x27; freedoms in order to hopefully secure they own - although I think this is a Faustian bargain.')
