But IceWM is unbeatable, it does everything and is extremely lightweight. I wanted my own skin and drawn it. I wanted compositing (transparency) I just run compton on top of IceWM. I needed better tray icon for free memory and coded an applet in C in a hour or so. Other WMs even those that claim being fast and lightweight feel sluggish and bloated to me. With IceWM you never wait for anything to load or start it&#x27;s just instantaneous everywhere.<p>IceWM has five config files for: startup, menu, keyboard, preferences, taskbar they are very straight forward, only the preferences one needs learning because it has hundreds of options of which I only use a dozen or so tbf. One thing I would like it to have is grouping of multiple firefox windows under one tabbar entry, hope they will add it.')
