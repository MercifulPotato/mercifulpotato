When you buy something to rent out, there&#x27;s no profit unless the rent is higher than the time value of the money.<p>There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with renting rather than owning. Fiscally it doesn&#x27;t make sense to buy a home unless you plan on living in that location at least 3 years, and probably more. Heck, just selling the house will cost you 6%. Having the house sit empty between renters costs a fortune.')
