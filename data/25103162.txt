But that doesn&#x27;t mean if I buy a more expensive SD card it will be better. I&#x27;ve already been using name brand consumer ones like Samsung EVO+. And I don&#x27;t have the patience to dig through spec sheets on Digikey to see which ones purport to handle power loss gracefully and then do web research to find out if they actually live up to that claim.<p>My next use of RPis (security cameras) will just use SD to load the kernel&#x2F;initrd, and then run from nfsroot.<p>BTW this hasn&#x27;t been a once a month problem, maybe once a year. But once a year is still too often for me, as I would assume it would be for anyone who relied on one to control their lights.')
