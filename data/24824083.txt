Item(by='watwut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603093234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24820511, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s fairly common for people to resent the Socratic approach being used on them. Probably they think that you&#x27;re assuming a teacher&#x2F;mentor role (and this may not be your intention), and they want to keep it as a &quot;colleague&quot; role.<p>It is not just that. It is fundamentally asymmetric style of communication. One person is forced to defend every tiny point, the other person does not have to defend anything. It is much easier to ask questions then to answer them. No matter how much you know, I will be able to reach borders of your knowledge.<p>In negotiation or causual debate situation, people quickly realize that your communication style is putting them at disadvantage and act to prevent that. Imagine we are discussing whether to go with my idea A or your idea B. You ask all questions, I am expected to answer them, and there is no place for your idea to be questioned too. The typical end result is that faults of my idea are presented, faults of yours are not, so you win.<p>Of course there are ways to counteract that, but people will still perceive you as hostile&#x2F;unfair rather then cooperative. Because they had to use verbal wrestling.')
