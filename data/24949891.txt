I actually ran into a bug in oracle db and they did not listen to us because we where a small company. We where working for a very large customer and asked that company to complain on our behalf at oracle. They they finally fixed it. Project was a large GIS project. I never had a say in the choice of database otherwise I would have chosen postgres. Oracle regularly crashed on complex spacial queries. At some point I left te company just to stop trying to fix that product. I think the only way of fixing the problem was a rewrite of the product that would use postgres. I hope I never work with oracle products in my life again.')
