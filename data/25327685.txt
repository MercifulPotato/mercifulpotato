How does anyone on here present proof of credibility about knowledge of a particular event or issue? The comment in question was from someone who created a throwaway “exzappos” username and claimed to have worked closely with Hsieh and understood the problems that have now come to light.<p>It’s impossible for anyone on here to prove their identity or that they aren’t lying about knowledge about something. In that situation anyone can say an anonymous person on the internet is not credible.<p>Seems like the more appropriate response is to take a comment like that with a grain of salt, but downvoting it to the point of being flagged and deleted made no sense to me either.')
