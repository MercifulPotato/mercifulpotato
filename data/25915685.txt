Supports kernel level wireguard and easy adblock through plugins. Easy upgrades. Not that great web UI but does its job. Shady OSS practices.<p>opnSense: no kernel level wireguard yet, but might be coming soon. No good adblocker plugin available. Easy upgrades. Great UI. Better OSS practices at least for now.<p>OpenWRT: supports kernel level wireguard. Supports LXD so you can install pihole. Good UI.
