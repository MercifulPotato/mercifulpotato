I feel like shouting into the wind in these threads.<p><i>The bits don&#x27;t matter</i>. How you got them does. If you&#x27;d pull the exact same sequence of bits from &#x2F;dev&#x2F;urandom on your first try, you&#x27;d be fine. But you didn&#x27;t, you used a program to download the video from YouTube. You didn&#x27;t download it through publisher-blessed means. In fact, the publisher and their proxies expended effort in shutting down the expected, &quot;normie&quot; ways of downloading it. In this way, you circumvented the technical copy protection mechanism (no matter how ridiculously trivial it was).<p>If you write an extension that automatically saves the streams your browser renders for you, that&#x27;d be &quot;circumventing technical means&quot; too, at least in case of YouTube.<p>That&#x27;s the thing with intellectual property: it tags bits with colour, out of band, and you can&#x27;t get rid of it without engaging with IP laws.<p>(Note that I do use your argumentation to defend <i>ad blocking</i>. But that&#x27;s a different situation. IP laws don&#x27;t recognize &quot;free to view if and only if you view attached ads&quot; as a colour, but it does recognize the &quot;copyright&quot; colour.)')
