Your fitness is literally measured by your ability to reproduce, and here are people locking their penis inside a device that a) it intended for somebody else to control (weird) b) is actually defective and they ended up being stuck inside it, and worst case could&#x27;ve set their member on fire. Somebody give them a Darwin award.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t think such an expression is better saved for other things, though of course I agree it could be applied to those things too.')
