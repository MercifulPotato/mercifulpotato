(And I&#x27;m really worried about when we do hit 0 ICU beds -- as we probably will -- that people will be confused and&#x2F;or lose trust.)<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;file.lacounty.gov&#x2F;SDSInter&#x2F;dhs&#x2F;1070348_DHSCOVID-19Dashboard.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;file.lacounty.gov&#x2F;SDSInter&#x2F;dhs&#x2F;1070348_DHSCOVID-19Das...</a>')
