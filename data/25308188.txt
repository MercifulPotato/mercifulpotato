[...] It does not matter if a person has a note from a doctor that states that the person has a disability and needs to have the animal for emotional support. A doctorâ€™s letter does not turn an animal into a service animal.&quot;<p>This post is about <i>emotional support animals</i>, not <i>service animals</i>.  Your animal, who&#x27;s helping you feel better despite your phobia, is <i>not</i> a service animal.  This is exactly because people keep blurring the line between these 2 different situations that airlines, restaurants and other businesses have to implement &quot;a-hole policies&quot;.')
