But playing music is always a great source of peace! Reading even, as long as it&#x27;s fiction. Asimov seems to redirect my attention to a single target, and that helps!<p>&gt; Work is also a good distraction for me sometimes because I enjoy what I do<p>This also is the same for me, but there&#x27;s a minor part (let&#x27;s say 20% or 30%) of my job that I don&#x27;t really enjoy, and that really sets me back, every single time...<p>I will try following your suggestions, and I will focus more on different activities that can distract me in a positive way!<p>I wish you all the best, and I hope with all my heart that 2021 will bring resolution to your issues!<p>From you username I would guess that you like Haskell, I also love it! :)')
