Item(by='scotty79', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603290291, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24846779, text='&gt; Rust is not a good example of a language which doesn&#x27;t require discipline: on the contrary, it requires very much discipline and thinking deeply about lifetimes and resources.<p>My experience is completely different. I programmed a bit in rust recently. Nothing system level. Quite opposite.<p>I had multiple occasions when after succeeding to implement some part in Rust I thought to myself &quot;wow, if I tried to do that in C++ I would have fallen in so many pit traps by now, that rust helped me avoid by restricting me in some ways&quot;.<p>And I&#x27;m very new to rust and I was just coding blindly just by powering through different approaches till one of those compiled.<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t use borrow to keep that? What&#x27;s a borrow anyways? Let&#x27;s just cram it in Rc whatever it is. I can&#x27;t return this? Fiiine! I&#x27;ll create it outside and pass it in.&quot;<p>And in the end it worked perfectly. No weird bugs to find. I felt like a caveman trying to bang rock into shape. And at no point rock cracked, split and or buried me under the rubble.')
