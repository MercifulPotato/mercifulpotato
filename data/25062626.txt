If it&#x27;s in a recent nightly or a stable release, you can rightfully file a bug. It will be either fixed on master or a point release will be made. If your nightly is weeks old, you don&#x27;t really know whether master has fixed it weeks ago or a bug report would be welcome. So you lose this advantage.<p>Anyways, that&#x27;s not an exhaustive list. Not wanting to deal with rustup might be another reason so you use your distro rustc packages instead.')
