We have over six million registered users from around the world. Our primary product is an online, real-time collaborative editor for papers, theses, technical reports and other documents written in the LaTeX markup language.<p>We acquired ShareLaTeX in 2017 and have since merged the two platforms.<p>We plan to add two developers to our team, both with a back end focus. Ideally, we&#x27;d like to find one developer with web analytics and data pipeline experience and one who would be interested in a team lead role in the future.<p>Our stack currently includes Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, Angular.js (going away), React and a some Ruby on Rails.<p>Some reasons you&#x27;d enjoy working with us:<p>- Most of our code is open-source and we&#x27;re big fans of Free Software.<p>- Working hours can be flexible to your needs. Our core hours are 2pm--5pm UK time. Applicants in the US, Canada and UK&#x2F;EU are preferred.<p>- We&#x27;re agile (with a lowercase a). We test thoroughly (unit and acceptance), we have a CI build process, a full staging environment to play with, and we automate as much as possible.<p>- Remote is a first class citizen; even before the pandemic, all founders and employees worked remotely. When we can do so again, we&#x27;ll get everyone together in London a few times a year for valuable face to face time.<p>Please see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;77FA8361E4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.workable.com&#x2F;j&#x2F;77FA8361E4</a> for more information and how to apply.')
