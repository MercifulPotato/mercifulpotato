Cities like Palo Alto and Mountain View had severe restrictions on building housing. So SF, Oakland and San Jose took the burden of housing the techies. Naturally people here got angry. But instead of focusing the anger in solving problems it was extremely common for people I meet to loudly complain about tech workers - bars, parties, nextdoor and side walks were full of hate messages. I left the city 3 years ago and I completely understand how frustrating it is.')
