Not really for videoconferencing, but I use it for that as well.<p>It&#x27;s true that the bandwidth isn&#x27;t there to push 4k. But being decently lit, with a real depth of field, large sensor and aperture, and the flattering effect of a good focal length, all adds up. I look a lot better than the other people on the call, and people notice and comment on that.<p>This isn&#x27;t worth a few grand on its own. But if you have other uses for decent video and photography equipment, or just find yourself needing an expensive hobby, you&#x27;ll get a substantially better effect with it.')
