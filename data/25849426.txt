Congratulations on the launch. I&#x27;ll share this (Algiers, Algeria).<p>One of the problems people here have is getting paid from companies abroad. I think it would be good to conduct interviews with people who may be having the same problem, and either offer a solution or explain it on the website. Many people work as freelancers, and the way they get their money is Herculean.<p>Also, many, especially here, neither are Arab nor identify as such [native population and ethnicity before 7th century invasions]. Many also do not share the language or other common attributes. Therefore, if you&#x27;re not ethnicity based, but based on the &quot;region&quot;, I guess North Africa, and Middle East are the terms that would work better.<p>Again, congratulations. There a <i>lot</i> of very talented people in these countries who will not work abroad for different reasons. Staying not to leave family behind is a very, very, common reason. Making remote work easier for them, whether positions or ease of payment, is huge.<p>This is encouraging even for those who are willing to move but aren&#x27;t invited to because they haven&#x27;t reached the skill level required for an employer to incur that cost, and they haven&#x27;t reached the financial level to incur that cost themselves. I guess your product hits that niche as well.')
