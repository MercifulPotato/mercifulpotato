It&#x27;s lucky that they happened to have an offline PC to copy the flash plugin from.<p>This just goes to show that platforms can&#x27;t be trusted. Flash had been &quot;EOL&quot; for forever now, but of course someone who doesn&#x27;t speak English and doesn&#x27;t read Adobe&#x27;s blog won&#x27;t know about it. What&#x27;s next? Will Chrome disable some key HTML5 API and break your app? Will old versions of Electron stop working on Windows 11? The closer to the metal you get, the less chance that someone will pull the platform out from under you.')
