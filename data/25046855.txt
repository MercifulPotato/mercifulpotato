Just like the investors could have demanded their money back if they wanted too.<p>They chose not to, which would seem to indicate they weren&#x27;t miffed. Nobody forced them to do anything. It&#x27;s not immoral to ask someone for an accommodation and accept it.<p>The investors didn&#x27;t give him the money as a friendly favor to help him it out. It was an investment. Presumably they make a lot of them and understand the risks involved in doing so. If you&#x27;re going to get hurt feelings whenever one of your investments doesn&#x27;t pay off, you&#x27;re not cut out to be an investor.')
