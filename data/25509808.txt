Try everything, write it down, make ansible playbooks. Even used some of their interactive training modules, but I quickly had my own cluster up in vagrant so didn&#x27;t really need the online shell.<p>Now we have two clusters at work, I have ansible playbooks I&#x27;m really happy with that help me manage both our on-prem clusters and my managed LKE with the same playbooks.<p>I&#x27;m completely sold on this container thing. :)')
