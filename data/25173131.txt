Item(by='xoa', descendants=None, kids=[25173227], score=None, time=1605996762, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25173002, text='&gt;<i>Next step: The browser must not be anything but Chrome.</i><p>It seems like that&#x27;d be difficult without somehow dealing with Apple first, maybe by getting the government to force them to allow Chrome. Which could happen. Some of the &quot;antitrust&quot; stuff getting tossed around is already starting to get exploited by entities like advertisers, and not just big ones like Facebook, there were those EU ones recently. Like all power, Apple&#x27;s focusing of its user&#x27;s collective power can be used not just for bad stuff but for very good stuff as well. But that nuance doesn&#x27;t seem to be present in a lot of the last year&#x27;s discussions, and of course lobbyists will use the opportunity if they can.<p>Without that though or another big disruptive shift Apple misses, can even Google afford to give up on the entire iOS market? Even the Mac market perhaps, if Apple really wanted to push back against Google there they&#x27;ve certainly got the potential capability.<p>Restricting to just Chrome&#x2F;Safari(Apple webkit) would still be really bad though. Even if they still allow Firefox, that would further formalize just 3 browsers with minimal further experimentation still possible. That&#x27;d be a real shame.')
