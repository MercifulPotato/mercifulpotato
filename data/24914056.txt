There are stories of people who didn’t leave their homes except on walks but caught COVID-19. There was a NYT columnist who got it and hadn’t done anything except go on walks in NYC. That seems statistically odd to me, because there can’t be that many NYT columnists.<p>Consider that to go outside, many in a large city must leave their flat, walk down a shared hallway, walk past other people’s front doors, use an elevator, etc.<p>There’s also a lot of people on the sidewalk, many without masks, who will walk right past you, often talking loudly on a cell phone. It’s often not possible to avoid walking close to these people due to small sidewalks and busy city streets.<p>Obviously the risk is lower than other activities but it’s not the same as going outside in the suburbs or driving somewhere. In my city, on a 40 minute walk I pass several hundred people. In my building here, none of the other residents wear masks and to enter and exit I must walk past their front doors.<p>So I would say it’s quite safe. But it’s not quite as safe in big, dense American city as in the suburbs.')
