When I want an extra feature, I can add it. I did this so many times already, it&#x27;s ridiculous. From adding support for new HW to the kernel, to patching my postgresql to support my language better, to adding zstd support to qemu qcow2, and hundreds of other small things over the last 15 years or so.<p>This is what&#x27;s great on GNU&#x2F;Linux.')
