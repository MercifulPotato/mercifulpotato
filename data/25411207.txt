To me the best bike &quot;lanes&quot; are not lanes at all, they are bike paths through the Forrest, no cars allowed or even in sight. Paths like this [0]. The air is clean, it&#x27;s safe and relaxing. When taking my kids to school I go over such bike paths, it&#x27;s nice, I don&#x27;t have to worry so much about the kids. Then we hit the road again, I&#x27;m breathing fumes, I keep telling my kids to stay at the side, tell them exactly where to brake and cross the road... We should separate cars from bikes as much as possible.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cobblescycling.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;4-gave-fietspaden-rondom-eindhoven-routes-beginner-fietspaden-rondom-eindhoven-liggende-foto1.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cobblescycling.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;4-gave...</a>')
