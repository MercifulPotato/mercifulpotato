If YouTube keeps adding new features that match and are better than Twitch I could see switches starting to happen. Currently YouTube already offers a better streaming experience in some aspects it&#x27;s just missing a bit.<p>Twitch&#x27;s whole gaming department leadership when it comes to streaming games or making games seems to have no idea what they are doing. They also seem to have no idea what their target demographic wants and likes. They end up listening to angry Twitter users over their actual users.')
