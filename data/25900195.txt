I would assume that as long as a large part of the global tech industry relies on TSMC, countries such as the USA would have a strong incentive to potentially protect Taiwan against threats. Does anyone have insight into the geopolitical impacts of Taiwan - USA relations in regards to TSMC fabs on US soil? Would Taiwan view this a strengthening of relations between the two, as I would assume this provides the USA with some &quot;domestic&quot; 5nm fab capacity, or is there some risk in that once this fab comes online the USA may see Taiwan as less critical?\n Anyone know some good sources discussing the above?')
