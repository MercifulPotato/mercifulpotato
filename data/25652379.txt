There are several other options are you not looking at. One is changing the systems to the on-call becomes way less burdensome and much more automated. Not sure if this is an option or not. This isn&#x27;t easy to implement (eg I&#x27;ve seen many engineers misunderstand the problem and focus on cool tech often, this isn&#x27;t a blank check) but it&#x27;s a great option and one I&#x27;ve seen get people promoted in the long term.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen teams where this festered and no one fixed it. I usually got called in in the end to fix it. Often the engineers weren&#x27;t even talking to the managers about the issue and that&#x27;s all a fix took, a solution that wasn&#x27;t just more money or more people. It also helps if you can come up with a basic cost benefit analysis in terms of wasted dev time that could be used for something else. This is a language managers speak.<p>You should really consider and discuss with your manager several of the options in the comments: pay, sleep replacement time, more people on the loop, better automation, tech debt work that is focused on burning down the most common pages, etc. It&#x27;s never a great idea to show up with only one possible fix, especially when that&#x27;s &quot;pay me more&quot;. They may not be able to, or not thin you are worth, and then your option is leave or deal. If you have quite a few more options maybe a compromise can be reached.<p>Engineers just suffering in silence and then quitting in anger is really the worst option tho. So open a dialog if you have not about other options.<p>As some others said, if you&#x27;re not getting traction, also talk with your skip... you are meeting with your skip right? But don&#x27;t come to them with problems and gripes. Come to them with possible solutions and get their advice on those solutions, and be open to their suggestions as well.')
