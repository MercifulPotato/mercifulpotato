I mean, I struggle with it - Trump, CV, Brexit, etc - it&#x27;s all pretty clickbaity stuff, built for hours of mindless browsing - but ultimately, what does an endless newscycle actually do to an individual?<p>I live in Cornwall in the UK: much of this stuff is - anger and distaste and &quot;long distance fear&quot; aside - completely irrelevant. I think Trump is appalling, but really, what difference does it make to me? None whatsoever. What difference can I make to whether he&#x27;s in power or not? None whatsoever. What is net result of me seeing yet more news about how redundant a human being he is? I get cross, depressed, and - as per OP&#x27;s article - man, I waste a bunch of time I&#x27;ll never get back.<p>The problem I&#x27;ve struggled with is that there is presumably a continuum at the end of this &quot;caring less&quot; approach which is the &quot;why bother voting&quot; lassitude, and I certainly don&#x27;t want to go that way. I&#x27;m still passionately left wing, passionate about helping fix inequality and the environment and so on - so news at a higher level is important. But I&#x27;m not sure the sort of rapid, breathless, clickbaity HORROR cycle does anything for anyone.')
