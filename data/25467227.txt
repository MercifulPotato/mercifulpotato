RFC just says it&#x27;s not defining <i>the</i> Internet standard. The reason being, and as I&#x27;d already pointed out, CSV predates RFC 4180 by 3 decades so what the RFC is really setting out is to describe what those established conventions are and what the MIME type should be. That doesn&#x27;t mean that what the RFC describes isn&#x27;t already a convention (it&#x27;s the same specifications as published by IBM, W3C and many other big hitters).<p>&gt; <i>it would still be a poor choice for archival purposes.</i><p>I hadn&#x27;t suggested it was a good choice for archival purposes. You&#x27;re building a straw man argument there.<p>My point was that there is a conventional standard to CSV and that is very well documented. The issue with CSV is that it&#x27;s so easy to write a parser that some developers do so without bothering to read any documentation on how CSV <i>should</i> be parsed. That&#x27;s not the fault of CSV, that&#x27;s the fault of lazy developers. But I do completely agree that CSV has <i>other</i> faults (which I had also discussed too).')
