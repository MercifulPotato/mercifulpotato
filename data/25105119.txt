Neo Dogs are a novelty in society, a sideshow to the general public, but they have the Intelligence similar to a human moron, but is a Mozart for their species. And they use them in war, which is their main use. The recruiter that works with the protagonist, was a bonded partner. They bond deeply to their Neo Dog and if the Neo Dog dies, it is more humane to kill the handler immediately, or put them in a drug induced coma for a couple months and then rehabbing them. The recruiter was put into a coma, but is still dealing with the loss of his Neo Dog, and agrees that killing the handler asap is kinder than having to go through the rehab.')
