Maybe it was a user error, but at the end of the day, I was constantly tightening it and adjusting it.<p>The baby bjorn I adjusted once and it was good for months.  It had clips to make it easy to take the baby in and out and for quick release when going through things like airport security.<p>My only complaint was that it was hard to do the clip in the back because I think it is designed for women who have a lot of experience clipping things behind their backs.')
