If you feel like you&#x27;re not moving, it&#x27;s because all your speed is being put towards travelling faster through time. Conversely, if you manage to move very fast through space, the world around you will appear to speed up, because you&#x27;ve had to trade off some of your forward travel through time so as to travel in space; the rest of the world is moving forward in time faster than you are.<p>So you can change your acceleration through the time dimension of spacetime, by dint of changing your acceleration in the spatial ones.')
