They are also micromanagement and I don&#x27;t plan to use those new features<p>I agree with the general argument, except this - keep in mind that typing in Ruby is optional (and will always be).<p>So devs who choose not to use it, they won&#x27;t suffer any downside. There are also middle grounds - typing can be added gradually or locally.<p>Keep in mind though, that as projects grow large, handling dynamic languages becomes more and more challenging, and adding types is a good strategy to handle that.')
