It would take some forward planning, but it&#x27;s doable.<p>In general, it&#x27;s common for kids to have no money. (I had no money when I was a kid.) If you are doing electronics on an extreme budget then naturally you&#x27;ll just have to use whatever equipment you can get hold of. But PCBs are <i>really really really</i> cheap. If you cannot afford PCBs you probably can&#x27;t afford lots of other things that you need.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that you should be using PCBs. I have no experience teaching kids electronics.')
