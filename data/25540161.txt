She had a few questions at the end and I remembered there being some great infographics that would help explain. So I reached for Google Image Search and the results were dominated by Pinterest. It wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad if I could&#x27;ve viewed the original full-size image - but for that I would&#x27;ve needed to create a Pinterest account which I absolutely didn&#x27;t want to do.
