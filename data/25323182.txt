It would get stuck frequently in GC cycles due to huge number of objects processed in memory and developers unconstrained resource usage.<p>We switched it to ZGC, only by changing startup options, and the application was like a brand new thing. Very responsive and zero GC issues.<p>Rewriting it in C++&#x2F;Rust would take many months and even more $$$, and no one could guarantee it would work better.')
