Same goes for neglecting our souls, I believe.<p>We should recalibrate at some point in order to, in earnest, make nourishing our souls a priority. And also my take is that through our years God not only matures our brains but also teaches us quite a bit, to the point that when we hit 40 we are properly equipped to make this important recalibration.\nI want to also add that I&#x27;m not saying the path is hermitism, in fact I really dont think that.<p>For example, charity to the family, the relatives, the orphans, the needy, the migrant, I believe nourishes our souls.<p>Happy to keep this conversation going anytime btw. Hope you have a Blessed evening.')
