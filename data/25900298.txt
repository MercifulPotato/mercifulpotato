You can argue an &quot;eye-for-an-eye&quot; approach to disputes amongst humans - logic says, let go. It&#x27;s past us. Emotions and life long suffering of a lost child says I want revenge. Justice system also prevents escalations from other avenues - like societal violence since &quot;Justice was not served&quot;. You really don&#x27;t want to live in a society where people take up arms for retribution.<p>It&#x27;s arguable whether it prevents others from committing similar crimes - I don&#x27;t think it makes much difference if its 15 years or 30 years to make a drunk person avoid driving.<p>Also keep in mind, the cost-benefit of the Justice system is <i>highly</i> dependent on the socio-economic conditions of the city or neighborhood.
