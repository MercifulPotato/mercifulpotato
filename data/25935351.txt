They&#x27;re not even close to dying.<p>&gt; <i>and they need to come up with a car that is competitive to the Tesla electric offerings to compete</i><p>And they are doing exactly that. VW alone already has $86bn spending committed to its EV lineup.<p>You associate the existing manufacturers with a  Blackberry&#x2F;RIM situation, but that is simply not the case.<p>This is more of an Apple&#x2F;Android type of situation. Apple triggered this paradigm shift, and dozens of others (Samsung, Motorola, etc.) followed suit almost immediately.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s going to take existing car manufacturers a few years to catch up. Just as it will take Tesla a few years to ramp up production to competitive numbers.')
