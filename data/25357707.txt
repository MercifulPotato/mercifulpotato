There&#x27;s just nothing close to the reliability and comfort that iOS gives you (Used Nexus&#x2F;Pixel for 5+ years and finally had enough and switched this year back to iPhone. God was my life so much easier).<p>On earphones I&#x27;m not so sure. My Sony 1000XM2 works really well and I don&#x27;t have advanced needs like switching devices constantly or sharing the audio with another person. Then again, maybe we just didn&#x27;t know something is possible before somebody actually delivers it out there.<p>The &quot;spatial audio&quot; thing I don&#x27;t think would be a very good argument though. The promotion materials are extremely vague and I don&#x27;t have much confidence that the noise cancelling&#x2F;sound quality of this will be night and day compared to other established earphones. So I&#x27;m not caring too much about that aspect. As long as the sound quality is not worse than Sony&#x2F;Bose&#x2F;Sennheiser I&#x27;ll be fine with it.')
