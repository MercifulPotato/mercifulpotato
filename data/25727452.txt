You have to repeat the type information, a lot. And also you have to declare lot of intermediate data structures.<p>In Python, this became easier and one could focus on the data transformations, thinking about the code a level higher.<p>But then I learned a bit of Haskell 5 years ago, and with type inference, this problem goes away. So it convinced me back to benefits of static typing. (Although I still feel the most productive in Python, their library APIs are IMHO unmatched in any language. But Haskell is catching up.)')
