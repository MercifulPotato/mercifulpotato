I think a metaphor that has nothing to do with reality causes people to think too much about it. You end up replacing one abstract thing with another abstract thing (and the reason to go metaphoric in the first place is to make the concept less abstract). The metaphor makes more sense you because you’re already deeply familiar with the concept of technical debt so you’re able to easily evaluate (2) — you’re not actually using it for understanding. If I told this metaphor to my spouse (for whom I’m often using metaphors to explain things), the reaction would be: “What are you talking about? Library with 25 books? Huh?”')
