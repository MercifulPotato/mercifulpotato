Why do we need a law to enforce this?<p>I meant they are enforced to open their content for licensing.<p>The market we have today is for services that are actually a <i>bundle</i> of things; youtube is both a video infrastructure <i>and</i> a recommendation engine. Twitter is both an infrastructure for textual content, for a <i>network</i> of people and a recommendation engine based on both.<p>It is hard to say if they are chosen for their recommendation engines or their <i>content&#x2F;network</i>. The latter is very prone for monopolistic dynamics, the former is being victims of that power law distribution in my opinion.<p>I don&#x27;t want to be as engaged as possible with twitter, but twitter does. If the new &quot;virtuous-recommendation-engine&quot; promised they are not there for maximum money but maximum wellbeing and sensemaking of their users, I might switch to that, ask my relatives to switch to that, force my kids to switch to that.')
