Do I <i>really</i> need to do anything ppv or movies on demand? It&#x27;s fleeting enjoyment much like those are.<p>And in the case of Fortnite and Roblox, the games are free so it does make sense to pay at least some into it (there&#x27;s no such thing as a free lunch) and thankfully none of the things you pay for give the player an advantage so it is mostly what elicits an &quot;I want my avatar to look like this&quot; reaction. Plus, it teaches limits and in the case of my daughter, she weighs what she really wants in the game vs just seeing something shiny. In Adopt Me, that is mostly ride&#x2F;fly potions for pets she has raised and turned to neon via raising 4 and merging.<p>I do, however, think there should be limits on it. But I think lessons can be learned from the experience all the same.')
