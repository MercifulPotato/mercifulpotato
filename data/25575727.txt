I can usually maintain average velocity around 2-5 mph so I don&#x27;t have to stop and go, but auto-driving cars will accelerate and brake hard, which makes it hard for me to judge whether we&#x27;re out of the present traffic and I&#x27;m holding up people behind by not accelerating, or whether I should continue the crawl.<p>Correct following distance in that traffic is ~3-4 metres (~10-12 feet) which is easy to maintain against a human or against an auto-car you know is auto-driving, but that takes a few seconds to calibrate that it&#x27;s auto-driving.<p>I&#x27;ve made many rush hour commutes from my home in Glen Park to SOMA with very few brake-use events¹ and travel team equivalent to original Google Maps prediction.<p>¹ One of the many metrics I attempt to min-max during all of my drives')
