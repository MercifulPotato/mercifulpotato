I think the US lives in a bubble but other parts of the world are feeling that shift already.<p>I wonder how many Americans know that Europe trades more with China than the US. Or that Japan also trades more with China than the US. Same with Africa.<p>The US is retreating into protectionism, internal struggle, and the opiate of social media.<p>It’s not that China didn’t play dirty. It’s just that the US is losing.<p>Having the most expensive military force isn’t nearly as useful if other sides possess nuclear weapons like you. Then it becomes a struggle along other dimensions.<p>The US seems full of entrenched institutions there just to increase their own power. Yet it is these institutions that  are causing the greatest issues.<p>You have medical costs spiraling out of control. You have educational costs spiraling out of control. You have infrastructure costs spiraling out of control.<p>Changes in the political order have changed none of this. I don’t see the latest change addressing these either.<p>You can see this in the actions of the current alpha and the previous alpha. Neither addressed or is addressing how the above consume the largest and ever increasing percentages of GDP without producing corresponding gains.<p>Are Americans living longer and healthier lives? No, they are living shorter and less healthy lives.<p>Can a high percentage of the population make good incomes with their expensive educations? No, many are relegated to low wage, dead end service and gig jobs.<p>Why do we have to deal with inadequate and overpriced transportation, water, and energy infrastructure? How many consecutive years of forest fires does California have to live with?<p>The new administration just patches things without taking on the institutions themselves.<p>$15 minimum wage and making college free doesn’t make college more useful. It just provides an endless trough for bad education to feed.<p>More medicine for all doesn’t address the problem that it is way too expensive. It just feeds more money into a money eating pit.<p>More purchasing of clean energy infrastructure but enforcing domestic production  doesn’t address the problem that your companies produce uncompetitive products. Will buying Ford electric trucks at higher prices than you could get elsewhere help anyone but Ford?')
