Qt takes a lot of effort to produce apps that look like garbage on every OS while Electron takes no effort to produce apps that look great everywhere. VLC Media Player - arguably the most popular Qt app - looks like dog shit.<p>Qt will have you coding in an old shitty programming language or using duct-tape and glue to bind it to a more popular language while Electron will have you coding in the most popular programming language and getting things done in a fraction of the time.<p>Qt is register-ware that is moving closer to being closed-source while Electron is 100% open source.')
