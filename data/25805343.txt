Item(by='kayodelycaon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610829902, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25804892, text='&gt; only because I have to say something in reply despite not having any answers<p>I completely understand and my reply comes out of very hard experiences from decades of helping people.<p>Humans are emotional beings. We want to help. We hurt when we can’t. We feel guilty. The natural response is to say or do anything to make that guilt go away. This is a deep, hardwired response. It is a natural response and a good one. I consider this to be one of humanity’s best traits.<p>But it is not a good response in this situation. My goal is to help people. If I am to do that, nothing I say should said out of my own feelings of guilt or helplessness.<p>I’ve learned to embrace guilt and acknowledge it’s there but also tell it it is not helpful in that moment. I need to do what I know is right, not what I <i>feel</i> is right.<p>Hand and hand with this is letting go of the belief we have control. We can not save people who don’t want to be saved. There is only so much we can do. And we will fail. I’ve lost friends I’ve wished I could have saved but I know there were no words. Therefore, I have no responsibility for their actions.<p>As a very wise person once said,<p><i>It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is life.</i>')
