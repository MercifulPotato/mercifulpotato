Then you can write `note something` to create or open $NOTES_DIR&#x2F;something.md with your $EDITOR.<p>If you type &quot;note&quot; without parameter you&#x27;ll start a search on all the note names, ordered by last use. If you type &quot;note -f&quot; it starts a full text search.<p>For best results you should have the fzf.vim&#x27;s preview.sh somewhere in your fs, otherwise it&#x27;ll use &quot;cat&quot; but it won&#x27;t be as good looking (see FZF_PREVIEW in the script).<p>Hopefully despite being shell it should be readable enough to tweak to your liking.<p>Note that it was written and used exclusively on Linux, but I did try to avoid GNU-isms so hopefully it should work on BSDs and maybe even on MacOS with a bit of luck.')
