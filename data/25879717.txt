You could build it without having to minimise the number of launches. You could have much bigger and heavier sections sent up in pieces and built &quot;on-site&quot; so to speak.<p>Much easier to consider when the price to move those heavy components up to space orders of magnitude cheaper and launches take place daily &#x2F; weekly.<p>(Yes I know I am glossing over a lot of things here).')
