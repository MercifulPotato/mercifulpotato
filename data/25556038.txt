I ran into the same issue when I wrote Actually Portable Executable. Most operating systems and libc implementation have been &quot;ported to death&quot; in the sense that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to determine the actual typing of interface structs and typedefs, due to a labyrinthine web of #ifdefs and macros. So most of the time, rather than reading the C source code, I&#x27;d just read the object disassembly and STABS listings. It&#x27;s very disheartening that open source can suffer such tragedy of the commons that the source code is less useful than the binaries. Tyranny of the minority.')
