Obfuscation of complexity is not.<p>The post pushes these words around without giving any indication as to how to actually do anything. Seems like an example of moving definitions around.<p>The important thing when dealing with complexity is to decompose it into simpler parts that combine neatly. This is one meaning of &#x27;good abstraction&#x27;. I don&#x27;t like the word abstraction, as I also don&#x27;t like the word refactor--they almost explicitly sound like arbitrary collecting&#x2F;moving things about.<p>The word I use is &#x27;factor&#x27;. I say I&#x27;m factoring the code. Then you have to be able to name which factor a particular piece of code has dealt with. If you can&#x27;t answer that, you&#x27;re just moving stuff. And once that&#x27;s done, it shouldn&#x27;t immediately need to be redone&#x2F;refactored.<p>If something is complex because it has N dimensions, then try to create N components to deal with each factor as is possible rather than create refactorings that deal with some combinations of dimensions that follow chronological developments rather than structural ones with empty seams.')
