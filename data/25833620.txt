I feel like sticking through the latter is psychologically more difficult.<p>* I&#x27;ve only had to set a broken limb (arm) once in the backcountry.  In that case we distributed that person&#x27;s gear and spent three days getting out.  On a different trip: very painful&#x2F;bloody feet; luckily we were only about five miles from our destination so we took turns helping the victim walk out under his own power.')
