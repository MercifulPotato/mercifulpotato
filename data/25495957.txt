Not only is the cap table invisible, but the fully-diluted cap table and terms of dilution and many other terms and conditions are also hidden from non-founders&#x2F;investors at most startups I&#x27;ve read about. I&#x27;ve heard so many stories of shares getting diluted right out from under employees immediately before a liquidity event that it has become a trope. IMHO that&#x27;s not investing into a startup; that&#x27;s buying a lottery ticket.<p>What am I missing here about typical startup stock options where the same terms and conditions founders and investors see are not accessible to employees?')
