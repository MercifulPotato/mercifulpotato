And I appreciate that it can keep things cooler than the required -80c.  (Nevermind that keeping it inside of a temperature range might be important as well).<p>But I think you&#x27;re overlooking something rather important:  Storing liquid nitrogen in a vacuum flask only keeps the liquid nitrogen cold for hours or days.  It doesn&#x27;t keep the thing cold that you&#x27;re cooling with liquid nitrogen.<p>The week you get to use it is after the dose has been created.  If it&#x27;s brought below temperature for any length of time, it can presumably DESTROY the dosages affected by temperature.<p>See the current flu vaccine storage protocols, for example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;pinkbook&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;vac-storage.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;pinkbook&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;vac-sto...</a><p>&quot;Regular temperature monitoring is key to proper cold chain management. Store frozen vaccines (Varicella, MMRV, and Zoster) in a freezer between -58°F and +5°F (-50°C and -15°C). Store all other routinely recommended vaccines in a refrigerator between 35°F and 46°F (2°C and 8°C). The desired average refrigerator vaccine storage temperature is 40°F (5°C). Exposure to temperatures outside these ranges may result in reduced vaccine potency and increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases.&quot;')
