Until it dies? That would put the car&#x27;s life span on the order of 1000 km. Or did the author mean Megawatt?<p>It&#x27;s also quite interesting that that rather small looking car has a significantly worse projected range than the american-level obese Audi e-Tron (best case they&#x27;re not fudging the numbers as much).<p>Their other vehicles look cool, though. Maybe they could also become drive train suppliers for small manufacturers.<p>The most scarce good, batteries, they also don&#x27;t seem to be providing though.')
