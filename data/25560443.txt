Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=[25566109, 25563697], score=None, time=1609172720, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25559123, text='&gt; Enthusiastic agreement.<p>I&#x27;m glad you do, given your background, because while I&#x27;m a massive proponent of UBI it still doesn&#x27;t solve a critical issue in the Human Condition: Purpose and the lack thereof.<p>I learned so much during my apprenticeship and I was honored to be taken in by some the most renown artisans in their fields that spanned: pecorino cheese makers, aceto and lambrusco brewers in Italy to a multi-genrational legacy Emnentaler cheese maker that allowed me apprentice for a day and even let me use the stick his great grandfather used in the Bernese Alps 100s of years ago to make a very rural and basic cheese.<p>This helped me not only further appreciate their artisan craftmanship, but it also gave greater insight that I would use in my career(s) later on in 3 separate Industries and allowed me to get opportunities to work under Michelin star chefs and get offers to work in Jame Beard award restaurants as a cook that simply cannot be gained in culinary school, which I completely bypassed to my complete benefit.<p>I think having community based works program alongside UBI would help solve local food insecurity and could be a critical part in solving so many more ecological issues, especially for disenfranchised and disillusioned younger millennials and Gen Z kids who we have to admit have really limited options in the traditional labour market with ever diminishing returns to be had rom their mandated &#x27;formal education.&#x27; At least a program like that could pay for itself in the long with the work experience they gain as it could give them insight to prepare them to take on massive issues like carbon sequestration, soil erroison and water reclamation and basic survival skills for Mars colonization that will be CRITICAL in their lifetime and those to come and may be give them motivation to take their UBI with their neighbors&#x2F;family and create a seed-round for a startup like Boyan Slat did to pull the plastic out of the Pacific Ocean.<p>I know that would help a lot of the kids who follow and are motivated by Greta Thunberg&#x27;s activism and help give the younger crowds from Extinction Rebellion (all amazing movements) a productive outlet to let them utilize their anxiety to desirable ends. Because I know I felt that anxiety about our Environment since the 2008 financial crisis but didn&#x27;t have any options due to student debt until I could afford to quit my Industry altogether and undertook a series of massive risks to pay it back that propelled me to flee to the other side of the World and put all of my skill-set to the test.<p>I now know in hindsight that I couldn&#x27;t have done even a fraction of the amazing things I&#x27;ve done in Life if it weren&#x27;t for those years of apprenticeship and how lucky I was that it even worked at all. My only wish is that the youth have a more structured path to that end as they will need it.<p>And to be honest after accumulating these skills I&#x27;d really like to be able pass this knowledge on to help instruct these kids to help them solve these very dire Environmental situations and if I can give them a craft in the process as I can no longer do it myself anymore I&#x27;d be glad to do so at no cost--but I wouldn&#x27;t say no to reducing my tax liability.<p>One of the most rewarding things about going from an ignorant apprentice making a ton of mistakes along the way and learning a skill or craft well enough to then have apprentices of your own is this sort of legacy transfer of knowledge that I think is what parenthood must feel like when you see your child be able to undertake a project or task by themselves for the first time.<p>I&#x27;ve only had 3 but it was pretty cool experience that I think could scale with limited resources if the right incentives allowed to tap into the collective will and desire of the youth as I think it&#x27;s Human Capital issue more than it is a lack of resources.<p>That was long, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re one of the few that would probably fully appreciate that sentiment and need given what you&#x27;ve written about your past.')
