I assume it would have to be objects that move very fast, i.e. nothing ordinary that I can think of.<p>[edit] actually stupid question. I assume it&#x27;s more about throughput than fps, i.e. be able to process lots of streams on the same machine, for instance for doing mass analysis of CCTV streams.')
