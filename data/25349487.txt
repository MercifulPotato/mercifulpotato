For anyone interested in participating and collaborating in the RHEL ecosystem, CentOS Stream is your reliable platform for innovation.</i><p>That doesn&#x27;t seem to be what you think it is, at least in my eyes.  I&#x27;m definitely not looking to run something positioned between Fedora and RHEL.  There&#x27;s already enough updates every month (including multiple kernel updates a month sometimes) that it&#x27;s hard to keep the fleet updated.  I definitely don&#x27;t need stuff ahead of RHEL where I can assume I&#x27;m a bit of a guinea pig to test out the coming RHEL update.')
