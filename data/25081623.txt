Why would I even &quot;install&quot; something, instead of dragging&#x2F;dropping a single &quot;file&quot; (yes I know it&#x27;s a directory) like I usually do. Do Linux applications all self-update using Sparkle like Mac-applications do?<p>I also love Apple-music where I can listen to everything on all my devices, can I have that in Linux?<p>Does linux have the same beautiful font-rendering that I get in OSX, or do I have ugly non-antialiased bitmap-fonts now and there?<p>I also haven&#x27;t used installation-media for operating-system installation in many many years, everything just works via the internet. I input my apple-id on a new mac and everything sync perfectly without any issue. Do I get that in linux? One login and my mail, notes, calendar, photos, music, files, backups, keychain sync across all devices?<p>And also simpler UI-questions: Can I rightclick on a file&#x2F;folder and it says &quot;Compress to zip?&quot;. I can have that in windows, can I have it in Linux? Can I easily create a encrypted bundle and mount it in the UI? Can I drag the little icon on top of any open window into any filedialog to rapidly access that file?<p>Can I easily configure keyboard shortcuts system-wide?<p>Can I have a photos-app that is as good as Apple Photos?<p>I think OSX is great. It feels more and more locked down, that is true, but I haven&#x27;t had any real issue with this yet. I still can develop whatever I want and run it if I feel like it.')
