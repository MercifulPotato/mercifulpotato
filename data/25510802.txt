I think there are plenty more professions that go thankless and that are actually making the world a better place.<p>I hope this doesn&#x27;t offend you but the thankless garbage men or street cleaners on my neighborhood have a bigger impact on my life than the people who do QA on the apps I use on a daily basis.<p>If github, slack and outlook stop working I basically have that time off and go outside for a coffee. If my garbagemen stop picking up my smelly garbage, then I&#x27;m gonna have a pretty bad day.<p>Again, no offense, just stating the facts.')
