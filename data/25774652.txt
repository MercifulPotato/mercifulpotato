I don&#x27;t like politics being banned in a professional context, but I slowly see no other solution.<p>The political alignment of many Parler users isn&#x27;t a secret and if they decide to measure skulls again, I might be in trouble. Still, I don&#x27;t see them as a relevant threat at all. It is even more ridiculous as the terrorism scare.<p>However, the actions of SV social media sites and hosts like Amazon censoring unpopular opinions and content outweigh that danger from neo-nazis by magnitudes. These groups have absolutely no political power in the 21st century.\nThey have more influence than a decade ago, but that is mainly due to their ability to reinforce their prosecution narrative and martyrdom.<p>On the internet there are calls to violence in any political group, even vegans and cat lovers. We ignore that because they aren&#x27;t relevant. But if you seriously crack down on cat lovers, you might need to expect real violence.<p>Either there are rules and principles that are valid for everyone or there are none.<p>Some say people get influenced by far-right propaganda. Far-right groups think in the same way in that they believe everyone not on their side is an &quot;NPC&quot;.<p>I think Dorsey and Zuckerberg handled it relatively well in the grand scheme of things. Their latest ban attempts were over the top though. I know that some people might need help instead of a Twitter account, but that is beside the point. They set the precedent for countries to suppress their opposition and for state propaganda. I think Uganda is one of the latest examples.')
