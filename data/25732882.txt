Item(by='whimsicalism', descendants=None, kids=[25741696], score=None, time=1610387889, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25732764, text='&gt; designed specifically to enforce a certain political viewpoint<p>I&#x27;ll try to break down my claim more simply. Saying something like &quot;I don&#x27;t really care about any political issues, but abortion is fundamentally wrong&quot; <i>is</i> a political viewpoint. If IG took moderation action against people who were saying pro-abortion things, we would call that enforcing a certain political viewpoint.<p>Similarly, a statement like &quot;all claims are fine except for those that tie Biden&#x27;s crime bill to mass incarceration&quot; is, again, a <i>political viewpoint</i>. It perhaps doesn&#x27;t map cleanly onto left or right or pro-Trump vs. anti-Trump, but the set of claims that IG picks to dispute is <i>political</i> because the issues around Biden&#x27;s crime bill (for instance) were political.<p>I&#x27;m neutral on whether Parler should be &quot;singled out&quot;, my point was merely that the two conditions set up by OP are not sufficient to single out Parler, compared to the actions taken by other social media networks.<p>Likewise, thanks for engaging.')
