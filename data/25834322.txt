Here&#x27;s the text of the LICENCE.TXT file.<p><pre><code>  Source code in this repository is covered by one of three licenses: (i) the\n  Apache License 2.0 (ii) an Apache License 2.0 compatible license (iii) the\n  Elastic License. The default license throughout the repository is Apache License\n  2.0 unless the header specifies another license. Elastic Licensed code is found\n  only in the x-pack directory.\n\n  The build produces two sets of binaries - one set that falls under the Elastic\n  License and another set that falls under Apache License 2.0. The binaries that\n  contain `-oss` in the artifact name are licensed under Apache License 2.0 and\n  these binaries do not package any code from the x-pack directory.\n</code></pre>\nAside from not showing copies of the applicable licenses, it seems you have to read the code headers to determine which source file has which license. There are a lot of ways to respond to competitive threats from Amazon, but this approach is increasingly chaotic the closer you look.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;elastic&#x2F;elasticsearch&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;LICENSE.txt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;elastic&#x2F;elasticsearch&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;LICENSE...</a>')
