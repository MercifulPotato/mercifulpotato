You can&#x27;t &quot;fix&quot; this problem by offering remediation measures that would be immediately coopted by exactly the same actors to exactly the same goal.  All the continuing education would be is a waste of time and money for the targeted people going through it, as some excuse would still be found to deny their voting rights at the end of it.  Do not underestimate the lengths that people will go to for voter suppression.  You can&#x27;t design a program that won&#x27;t be intentionally warped and abused to serve this ulterior motive, especially considering that you won&#x27;t be running it; they will be.<p>We have hundreds of historic examples here of how allowing the denial of voting rights for any reason is an incredibly slippery slope, and it is rightfully banned except in a tiny number of instances (felons) that still need to be rectified.  And yes, the war on drugs is itself a successful voter suppression effort -- make enough things illegal, and convict enough people of felonies, and you can meaningfully alter the make-up of the electorate.  This has actually happened.')
