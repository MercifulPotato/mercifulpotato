That doesn&#x27;t mean that they think that it wasn&#x27;t <i>just</i> about slavery - because it wasn&#x27;t just about slavery, and even less just about the moral issues of slavery.<p>When people say that the US hasn&#x27;t confronted its legacy of slavery and genocide, they mean things like personality cults of people that owned slaves, institutional racism - that persisted a hundred years after the civil war, not recognizing that there was a genocide of natives, and so on.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly consistent to say that the Civil War was mainly about slavery (and, of course, also for economic reasons as an extension of that) and to say that the US still hasn&#x27;t  fully confronted its origins of slavery.<p>Also, there is still a lot of people in the US that are sympathetic to the Confederacy, even amongst the government - the Civil War didn&#x27;t even go all the way.')
