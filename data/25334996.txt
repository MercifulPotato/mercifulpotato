There are a million reasons why a solution isn&#x27;t perfect and we need to put as much thought into it as possible. At the same time we have to keep in mind that everything we do is a tradeoff. If you think your solution is perfect you probably lack knowledge.<p>I prefer to ship 90% and then see how we can improve on that with data I can&#x27;t produce if I don&#x27;t ship anything. Talk about hypothetical future problems going in circles doesn&#x27;t solve problems we have right now.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m one of those 10x thought times guy myself. But I know how to keep the ball rolling in a team and take the responsibility for these types of decisions which look like educated corner cutting.')
