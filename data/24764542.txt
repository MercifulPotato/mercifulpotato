He can set a high price and people who want to read the works will still pay.<p>Whereas ride sharing companies interchangeable and are in full competition with each other, which, in a healthy market, should bring the price down to the point where they&#x27;re all only making a marginal profit. The cost of alternative mode of transportation does not come into equation (well unless it&#x27;s overall cheaper and better -  then it will kill the entire market segment).')
