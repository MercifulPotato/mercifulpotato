For instance, &quot;As paredes tÃªm ouvidos.&quot; literal translation is &quot;The walls have ears&quot;. It&#x27;s fascinating that they translated to &quot;The walls have hearsay.&quot; I think that&#x27;s an artefact from the initial Portuguese -&gt; French translation.<p>That book is more like getting a phrase translate into a chain of languages and see what it comes out in the other side.')
