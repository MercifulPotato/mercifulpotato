AFAIK leading analyses in leading economic scientific journals have discussed the excessive spending of inflationary countries as the and only root cause for the inflation.<p>But, these leading papers often don’t even mention that the worlds biggest economies at these times (e.g. US) have cut ties and imposed economic sanctions on these countries just before the excessive spending and hyperinflation started.<p>How are these countries then able to buy goods on the international market denominated in USD, if they are basically cut off from the US Dollar monetary system?  It’s almost as if an excessive shock of raised import prices propagates to a general increase in prices. This would mean economic sanctions imposed by the US on to Chile put them into a crisis, not their socialist government from back then with its spending programs.<p>But wait, that would not fit into the narrative so let’s just claim that these countries short term reaction to these shocks (print enough money in hopes to stabilize the economy) is the cause of the shock and hide it behind a wall of math that nobody wants to look at anyways.<p>Excuse me, I don’t have the classics at hand now so I can’t point sources.')
