Certainly, vaccines are extremely safe by the time they get approved - because the approval process is careful, methodical and takes years.<p>However, in this case, if a COVID vaccine is approved by the end of this year or in the near-term, we won&#x27;t have any long-term data, and so I do worry about those aspects, about the compounds used in the final formulation as well as the untested nature of RNA&#x2F;DNA based vaccines.<p>A few places to do research for those interested:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vaers.hhs.gov&#x2F;data&#x2F;datasets.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vaers.hhs.gov&#x2F;data&#x2F;datasets.html</a>?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;vaccines-blood-biologics&#x2F;safety-availability-biologics&#x2F;recalls-biologics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;vaccines-blood-biologics&#x2F;safety-availabi...</a>')
