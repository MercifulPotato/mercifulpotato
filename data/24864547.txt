Item(by='Arnavion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603410088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24863856, text='For the curious, searching for `&quot;whewell&quot; &quot;coleridge&quot; &quot;scientist&quot;` does give a few results about the 1833 Coleridge exchange that user disown is referring to. (Though many of them source it to Snyder&#x27;s 2011 book so they&#x27;re not independent.)<p>Even the 1834 article we&#x27;re all talking about says:<p>&gt;Philosophers was felt to be too wide and too lofty a term, and was very properly forbidden them by Mr. Coleridge [..]<p>... which he presumably wrote specifically as a reference to that 1833 exchange. This article is anonymous, but see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24864582" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24864582</a> for why it&#x27;s attributed to Whewell.<p>So it&#x27;s quite possible that he first spoke the word in the 1833 exchange with Coleridge, and first put it to paper in the 1834 review of Somerville&#x27;s book.<p>Edit: See also <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24864563" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24864563</a> which has a link to the 1833 meeting&#x27;s report, which does not appear to mention Coleridge or this exchange.')
