Many F500 type companies pretty much MUST have O365.<p>Then, if you have O365, you have OneDrive.  And the question then isn&#x27;t whether Dropbox is better.  It&#x27;s whether OneDrive is &quot;good enough&quot; to suffice, despite it being not as good as Dropbox.  And the decision maker doesn&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s not good enough for some smallish subset of employees that need a Linux client, etc.  They care whether it&#x27;s good enough for most.')
