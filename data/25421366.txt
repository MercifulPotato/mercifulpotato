Yes, five. As in 5. And I don&#x27;t mean &quot;Black-N-Milds&quot;, I mean five robustos.<p>Hilariously enough, this research was conducted by the American Lung Association. I became aware of it when a data scientist friend of mine who smokes cigars quite often was telling me about it. He tore the study apart, up and down, back and forth. It was solid science, or at least, solid data science. And I trust his opinion implicitly.<p>Now for me, that&#x27;ll never be a concern... I probably smoke 50-100 cigars a year, so I fall so far below the statistically significant risk of cancer that I don&#x27;t even concern myself with it now.')
