And that is usually bad news.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s right. Any time an organization goes with &quot;let&#x27;s bring back the band,&quot; I become a little more skeptical than before. Not just because of what it implies on the quality of the bench, but I&#x27;m also wary of this halo effect of the good old days masking what&#x27;s really needed today instead of living in yesteryear.<p>Gelsinger seems like a pretty good pick for Intel given how disastrous their last CEO search went, but in the earnings call today, there was a lot of invoking the Old Gods and Intel history. I get why they&#x27;re doing it, but it&#x27;s a different competitive landscape and Intel today.')
