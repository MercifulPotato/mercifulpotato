Superficial comparisons will be misleading.  Implement auth, CSRF, a &quot;real ip&quot; Middleware, request logging, graceful restarts, yes CORS, and then do a few REST endpoints with it to see how much boilerplate VS useful code you have to write.<p>Maybe this is just my opinion as I started a significant golang app with just vanilla stdlib and then added each of these complexities in turn, before switching to libraries to solve most of the boilerplate better than my hand-crafted patterns')
