In most countries you can&#x27;t just decide to climb in your private car and provide commercial transportation service. You have to spend a lot of time and money to get there, authorizations, commercial insurance, driver certifications, etc. Uber bypassed it by saying &quot;we&#x27;re a tech company&quot; and left it to the drivers, making the enforcement of the law a lot harder.<p>Let&#x27;s be real, most of it is getting a taxi medallion (sure you need a different driving license but any 18 years old can get it).<p>Posted it in an other thread [0] but do we really want to go back to the medallion system? Pre-Uber, either the driver rented the car to a middleman who rented the medallion from a rich owner, or said owner was selling and financing (most banks won&#x27;t touch these medallions!) a medallion at a ridiculous interest rate to a driver that planned to use it as his retirement savings (an extremely volatile asset and not very liquid).\nThe more I spoke to cab drivers the more it seemed their industry was a pyramid scheme aimed at helping established rent-seeker take advantage of often poor new immigrants. Uber brought a breeze of fresh air: Someone could simply buy a car, calculate the depreciation and it&#x27;s value on the market (since unlike medallions cars are relatively liquid assets!) do rideshare and calculate their profits or loss. They can get out of the game at anytime, and they know exactly how much they are going to get for the car they have should they sell it.<p>Also, the argument on Uber&#x2F;Lyft drivers not being contractors since they can&#x27;t set their own rates and decide which ride they take strikes me as weird since medallion drivers were contractors, had to charge the price set by the city and could only pick-up customers in the (arbitrary) zones covered by their medallions.<p>And I&#x27;m not even touching the usual pain points and often discriminatory practices of medallion drivers (refusing card payments, refusing rides to non-white passengers and to non-white neighborhoods...).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24225648" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24225648</a>')
