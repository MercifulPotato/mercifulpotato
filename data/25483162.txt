I did not mean to detract from your point, and awareness of bus architecture is so limited that vendors usually get away with cheaping out on memory channels so we often have even fewer than our CPU module could exercise.<p>In practice if you have more memory buses they are more likely to be useful to help more processes or threads make simultaneous progress than to speed up one process. For a single thread to make good use of more memory buses usually requires using memory pre-fetch intrinsics and memory sequestration, and even then it is hard to keep more than two or three usefully engaged for that thread.<p>So, your point stands.')
