Item(by='young_unixer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606506319, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227585, text='&gt; that they don&#x27;t capture linguistic ability which is a part of intelligence<p>Speaking from my deep ignorance:<p>It can be argued that linguistic ability and geometrical intuition are both manifestations of general intelligence. But yeah, that&#x27;s a controversial topic, as far as I know.<p>And even assuming that G factor is the best way to define intelligence, for 2 people with the same G, there can still be specific abilites more developed in a certain individual because of pure practice, does that learned intelligence count as intelligence? I think that contradicts the &quot;g factor&quot; hypothesis that these tests assume in the first place.<p>Studying intelligence is already hard enough and then there are people trying to push some incorrect ideas for political reasons, like that tabula rasa theory that somehow survived all the way to the 21st century.<p>But as I said, this is my impression from my ignorant point of view. Maybe I&#x27;m completely wrong.')
