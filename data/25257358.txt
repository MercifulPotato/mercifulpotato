I don&#x27;t know the right answer, I&#x27;m certainly no lawyer ;)<p>I just know that, to me, &quot;dynamic linking&quot; seems like an arbitrary and imprecise way to define &quot;derivative work&quot;.  And, I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s really something that _can_ be defined and possible to determine without consider it on a case by case basis.  It&#x27;s a good &quot;right hand rule&quot;, perhaps, but doesn&#x27;t strike me as either necessary or sufficient to really define it.  We&#x27;ll never really know, I guess, until someone makes that actual argument in court.')
