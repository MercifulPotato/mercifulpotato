I want to mock the visualization in the service then get the raw, static JS offline to be used as a template.  I&#x27;ll write a Ruby wrapper around the data I&#x27;m exploring and gradually parameterize the template as I better understand it, and what my data looks like in it. I don&#x27;t want to dance with details of the JS, I want to dance with details of the data and parameters, so get me out of requiring online hooks ASAP.  I <i>know</i> this is possible because prior versions of Observable let you do exactly what I want, but now I get some super friendly&#x2F;not friendly interfaces that obfuscates what I&#x27;m familiar with.<p>As a separate issue not fully related- Ultimately my goal is a static visualization for scientific publications or presentations (I can export SVG from Observable, so my prior arguments doesn&#x27;t hold here). Science has a very long shelf-life, in my field we routinely reference papers and their figures 200+ years old.  While I absolutely love the idea of &quot;living publications&quot; I also fear life that depends on other&#x27;s services. If the big people can&#x27;t play nice (coughing in your direction Google services gone dark, I can think of various examples that have screwed over scientists), then you can see my caution in adopting Observable&#x27;s all-in-dynamic approach.')
