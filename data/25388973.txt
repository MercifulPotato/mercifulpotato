Item(by='542354234235', descendants=None, kids=[25389324], score=None, time=1607711583, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25387912, text='&gt; so it&#x27;s unfair to assume without evidence that they incinerate them or bury them in a landfill.<p>It isn&#x27;t an assumption without evidence. It is an assessment based on a detailed breakdown of the product, a knowledge of the generally understood state of the technologies involved in reclamation. This isn&#x27;t the random opinion of a shop owner. iFixit has a detailed breakdown and assessment, and they are generally considered experts in the field. What is unfair to assume without evidence is that Apple has some sort of super secret tech no one else knows about to repair them. That is simply a claim without evidence.<p>&gt;Considering that Apple&#x27;s battery service fee is $49 per AirPod, that tells me that the residual value of a failed AirPod (a single one, not both) is $99.50 - (depreciation) - $49, so $50.50 in the best case, and almost certainly nonzero in the worst case.<p>Airpods with Wireless charging case: $159 Retail. Wireless Charging case: $79 Retail. Assessed retail value of Airpods: $80 ($40 each).<p>Apple replacement of damaged Wireless charging case: $69 ($10 discount off retail). Airpods: $69 each ($30 <i>more than they cost new retail</i>).<p>Apple “battery repair” of Wireless charging case: $49 ($40 less than retail). Airpods: $49 each (again, $10 more than new retail value).<p>Given this, there is absolutely no evidence that the Airpods have any reclamation value to Apple and they are just selling you a new ear pod for more than you paid as part of the original product. Apple makes more money per unit on “battery repair” and damage replacement than off the original purchase.')
