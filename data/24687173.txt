Sure, they can restrict them all they want, as long as a fair stance prevails und people are not ripped of their goods.<p>This strong difference in powers between companies and customers in the digital realm becomes more and more a serious problem. When people are stop buying digital goods or anything of certain types, just because they have no legal security, then it harms also companies themself. so it should be in their own interesst to support such things.<p>There was a time in Europe when a strong movement for digital rights existed, but to bad it somehow died down.')
