Q-tards and Antifa stormed the capital. The people you so righteously call racist and seditious are not and did nothing of the sort. What Antifa and a few Q-tards did on Jan. 6 doesn&#x27;t discredit the fact the establishment politicians and our corporate overlords have sold out to China and don&#x27;t want to be held accountable and would prefer to follow their script to divert attention to the bad orange man&#x27;s behavior. When Antifa burns multiple cities to the ground they&#x27;re the good guys but Schumer supposedly &quot;survived pearl harbor&quot; because patriots had their own movement and are trying to remind the actual corrupt politicians they work for us and not the globalists and China trying to keep us all locked down forever, fighting one another.')
