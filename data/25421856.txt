Addiction is thus very specific to individuals, not to substances.<p>If it&#x27;s a behavior that one can control (as in stop doing it) then it&#x27;s a legitimate choice and not addiction.  If someone walking by a plate of cookies can&#x27;t avoid eating too many then it is clearly addiction for that person.<p>Refined sugars are highly addictive for a lot of people, even to the point of feeling withdrawals.<p>It&#x27;s also possible to consume refined sugars in moderation for other people.')
