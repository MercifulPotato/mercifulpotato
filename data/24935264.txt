Changing &quot;rioters&quot; to &quot;protesters&quot; completely changes the meaning of what Cotton said.<p>This was a calculated move to paint all the protesters as rioters and drum up support for treating them as such.<p>Even without reading into it, Cotton was advocating for bringing US military troops into US cities to put down the protests because some of them turned violent.  That is NOT normal, and NOT something we should see in a healthy democracy.<p>I might add that once the police stopped attacking protesters violently, the protests calmed down pretty quickly.<p>&gt; Spreading misinformation purposefully to trick people into agreeing with you is what is destroying this country right now and you are doing this.<p>Projection is such an ugly thing to see.')
