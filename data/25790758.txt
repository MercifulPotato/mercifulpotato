Before even beginning to write any code, you have to think about these things:<p><pre><code>  - What environment do I expect the end user uses? Are there already some libraries I can use as well installed?\n  - Do I need a GUI, or should it also run on headless devices? TUI or just CLI?\n  - Does it make sense to use a big comprehensive framework or rather a bundle of minimal components?\n  - Does a specific feature really need an additional dependency or can I rather implement something on top of the already existing dependencies?\n  - How good is the maintenance of a library, code quality and is the license compatible?\n  - and many more...\n</code></pre>\nAll of those are very difficult questions and require often some crystal balls to get right.<p>Lazy people might just add any dependency some stackoverflow or other random search result says, without thinking about these. While good developers think about each one and try to find a minimal set of them.')
