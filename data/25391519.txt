Item(by='enraged_camel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607723104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25391340, text='This is a popular joke among conservatives, of course, but the reality is the opposite.<p>There are two types of people moving from Cali to Austin: people who can&#x27;t afford living there anymore, and people who can easily afford it but are tired of paying high taxes. The latter group tends to be on the more conservative side (essentially the FYGM section of the political spectrum) and their wealth does give them the ability to influence local politics.<p>So, if anything, Austin, one of the most liberal cities in America, is more likely to shift to the right as a result of these migrations from California and other blue states.<p>edit: downvotes by conservatives are laughable lol, keep them coming guys!')
