When 30% of people don&#x27;t know whether they will be able to find&#x2F;keep a job to pay the expensive rent, they simply refused to pay the current rent or found themselves unable to. Rent went down.<p>For me and most people I know when the landlord came asking about renewal (London is all about yearly contracts) for a similar price or more, he was told to f<i></i>* off. When everybody is doing that, rent is going down.<p>In a sense the perception of the market is driving the market. The virus is affecting 90% of the population, it&#x27;s not just hitting the margin.<p>I say landlord but it&#x27;s very often a letting agency (taking commission for finding tenants), the landlord is someone abroad or an investment company that&#x27;s nowhere to be seen. They don&#x27;t have each other interest at heart.')
