I&#x27;ve been spending an hour or so a day coming up to speed for the past few weeks, and every yarn&#x2F;npm package I installed had some kind of error&#x2F;warning that required a hack, or version contortion. I naively thought I could webpack with electron+vue+pug+ts and was soundly smacked down repeatedly, even after trying the boilerplate from each components&#x27; docs.<p>I appreciate what the developers are trying to do, I really do. Only, it is too many cooks + death by a thousand cuts. As I read through pages of closed-but-not-really GitHub issues for each package, sometimes going back years and years, it feels like a constant stream of hacking that erodes the well-intentioned first versions.<p>&gt; but a bozo like me does not. This is actually causing me stress irl.<p>Me too! I dread package upgrades because it can instantly turn into an all-hands-on-deck emergency, and these are just the stand-alone packages, not all the ones I mentioned above.')
