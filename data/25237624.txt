But I find it important to understand that the politicians in the interior and justice branches are not pushing mass surveillance because they&#x27;re evil. It&#x27;s because of perverse incentives: They know full well that, when the next terrorist attack happens, everyone who didn&#x27;t push hard enough for law and order will be portrayed as an enabler. Or at least they think that this will happen. It can be argued if it really would, but them thinking that this is how the world is is my best explanation for their behavior. I don&#x27;t think they <i>want</i> to build the next Stasi or Gestapo.')
