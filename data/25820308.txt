Item(by='nix23', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610965878, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25816594, text='&gt;I don&#x27;t get it.<p>-I just said that she is probably perfectly capable of interpreting simple data.<p>-That you don&#x27;t have to be a &quot;data scientist&quot; to understand simple data.<p>-Data Scientist is not a real Job but a base training (learn tooling and a bit statistic)<p>-A Mathematician&#x2F;statistician&#x2F;scientific-programmer has probably more of a clue what data&#x27;s and statistics are and how to interpret them then any &quot;based trained data-scientist&quot;.<p>-If it&#x27;s so complicated you would need a specialized covid-data-scientist&#x2F;mathematician, but it&#x27;s NOT....compared to let&#x27;s say, what Surgeons do...hence the degree in Medicine, with specialization on surgery.<p>I did not say she&#x27;s wrong or right, but to say that someone has no clue because he&#x2F;she is not even specialized in &quot;fill in occupation&quot; or employed as &quot;fill in occupation&quot; is just plain wrong, and shuts down every other opinion.<p>Just look for a example at Apollo 1, a fireman or chemist would have probably said: WHAT! filling the Cabin with pure oxygen is a terrible idea!!<p>But he&#x27;s&#x2F;she is not a Astronaut, Doctor or Rocket Scientist. With the logic here, he&#x27;s maybe capable of understanding rocket-fuel or how to put out fires, but has no clue of humans and what they need in space...and he&#x27;s not even employed as Human-equipment-specialist.')
