If you give away the source for free that doesn&#x27;t produce any cash-flow. If you sell services you sell services.<p>The value-add proposition of &quot;open source companies&quot; I think is they know the software so you can hire them to do things with it, and they can adapt their open source software if needed as they go along. So that is a service-model. Open Source licenses can help companies that do this.<p>Open Source is its own worst enemy. At some point an OS project becomes so GOOD that you don&#x27;t need to be its developer to use it and adapt it or build Cloud-services around it. Further if they need the expertise of the original developers they can simply hire them. The ethos of open source doesn&#x27;t forbid you from having an employer. An ethical OS-hacker should be happy getting a salary from whichever company lets him or her write Open Source software. That includes companies like Amazon and Microsoft and IBM who then sell the right to use that software on their Cloud.<p>If this is the correct ethical model then we should not blame Amazon or Google, they do contribute to copyleft Open Source projects. We should blame smaller companies like MongoDB etc. who do not offer &quot;pure&quot; Open Source licenses.<p>So I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s not so much the Open Source Business Model that is in crisis. It is the Open Source Ethical Model, which needs to reflect upon itself in the time of Cloud.<p>Is it really more ethical to work for Amazon writing Open Source, than writing Non-Open-Source for a small company which wants to make sure it is not crushed by Amazon?')
