I don&#x27;t mind constant refreshes or redesigns.  I don&#x27;t care that I&#x27;m slightly less efficient in the modern settings pages than in the old control panel. I&#x27;m happy to lose a bit of efficiency to have a nice design. Just like I want web pages to have a nice design even at a (reasonable) cost of readability or usability.<p>But what does bug me is when the refreshes are half baked. Either refresh everything visible and hide the old one entirely behind some obscure command if it must remain, or don&#x27;t  refresh at all.')
