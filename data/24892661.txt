Item(by='oska', descendants=None, kids=[24892800], score=None, time=1603683976, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24892096, text='I&#x27;m increasingly of the view that any comments complaining about &#x27;clickbait&#x27; titles are worse than the actual practice (such as it is).<p>There is no mention of a reactor in the original title. So probably you are referring to &#x27;Mexican Chernobyl&#x27;. Yes, Chernobyl was a nuclear accident involving a reactor but not all nuclear accidents involve a reactor and Chernobyl is being used in this context as a well-known disastrous nuclear accident (not <i>necessarily</i> involving  a reactor). And the original title clarifies that they are talking about this greater set.<p>Furthermore, HN, as is its admirable practice, has rewritten the title anyway. If you have an issue with the title you can easily get the mods attention by mentioning &#x27;title&#x27; in your comment and making some <i>constructive</i> criticism (which yours wasn&#x27;t).<p>(I wouldn&#x27;t usually spend so much time responding to a bad comment but taking this one as just an example of this particular genre of bad comments.)')
