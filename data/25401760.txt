If RHEL was too bleeding edge for you, then CentOS Stream will be too, but otherwise it will be approximately the same as RHEL used to be.  I consider RHEL and CentOS to be pretty equal, with CentOS lagging a bit behind.  Now they will be pretty equal, with RHEL lagging a bit behind.  Packages going to CentOS are packages that would have gone directly to RHEL previously.')
