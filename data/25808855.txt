It improved steadily over about a year, but didn&#x27;t change too much after that. The best analogy is that I would previously think in long paragraphs, and after I would think in sentences. I had to write notes as I was thinking otherwise I would lose my train of thought pretty easily.<p>But, I had pretty great success with hyperbaric oxygen therapy [1] in combination with oxiracetam [2][3]. I would <i>highly</i> recommend looking into it, and it might be covered by your insurance. I was really struggling with work, and it definitely helped that, my lack of motivation, my muted personality, and some anger issues. My wife says she noticed a big difference and claims I&#x27;m now back to normal. I would say that I now can think in short paragraphs, which is sure a lot better than before! My brain is my job, so the cost was easily justified. It really was a big change in a short amount of time.<p>The weirdest and shittiest lingering problem is that I have apparently mostly lost the sensation of needing to breathe. Before the oxygen therapy I could just hold my breath and literally not notice. It took me passing out a few times to realize that I was forgetting to breath during conversation. This made exercise difficult. After the oxygen therapy, a slight urge to breathe has come back. I can exercise, and I&#x27;m not afraid to swim now, but if I&#x27;m deep in thought, I&#x27;ll forget to breathe and end up feeling pretty terrible. I plan on buying a continuous, wearable, oxygen monitor...<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2013&#x2F;01&#x2F;130123144218.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2013&#x2F;01&#x2F;130123144218.h...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;31057392&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;31057392&#x2F;</a>\nNote that the oxiracetam was my thing, not prescribed by the doctor (he did approve of it though, as long as I was taking some choline supplement). I now take ~1g&#x2F;day with 200mg centrophenoxine (choline), and fish oil on weekdays. This seems to really help.<p>[3] Can&#x27;t find the exact NIH reference for this one that I really liked, but I&#x27;ll reply when I find it. But, the concept is (my understanding) that capillaries grow where oxygen is needed. A TIA will tremendously clog capillaries. The neurons that were deprived from the clogged capillaries don&#x27;t receive enough oxygen to metabolism enough to promote new capillary growth. So they stay &quot;dormant&quot;. Promoting capillary growth and waking up these dormant ones is how someone with a stroke really benefits. This was all echoed by the doctor that reviewed my situation before the therapy could start.')
