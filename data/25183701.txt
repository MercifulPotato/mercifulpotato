I’ve read a bit about it, but didn’t work there at the time so can’t confirm. From what I’ve read, it essentially had no PMs. They drilled the culture into every aspect of the business and then demanded excellence.

They understand the deep technical and business requirements of a product.<p>I think this might be the only setup in which you can achieve real innovation.<p>A business only needs a modern PM once they’ve crested the hill.
