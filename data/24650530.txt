Want a toolchain?  You have to create an account.  Of course, it&#x27;s freeloading off of the Free software gcc toolchain.  Even worse, when it comes to their microcontrollers that use the START or ASF4 system, you get headers that are incompatible with Free software (I haven&#x27;t checked how they license the headers of the new tinyAVR series MCUs).  At least when it was Atmel it was just a few pieces of IP that were guarded with stupidity like this (their touch interface is the only one I recall)')
