One that might very well deserve to have serious legal ramifications for Apple.</i><p>Apple gave a detailed explanation. It was a server misconfiguration combined with a CDN issue which caused the OCSP certificate check to stop working, which caused Apple&#x27;s system for ensuring certificates haven&#x27;t been revoked to stop working:<p><pre><code>    “We have never combined data from these checks\n    with information about Apple users or their\n    devices. We do not use data from these checks\n    to learn what individual users are launching\n    or running on their devices,” clarified the\n    company.\n\n    “Notarization checks if the app contains known\n    malware using an encrypted connection that is\n    resilient to server failures,” says Apple,\n    further emphasizing, “These security checks\n    have never included the user’s Apple ID or the\n    identity of their device. To further protect\n    privacy, we have stopped logging IP addresses\n    associated with Developer ID certificate checks,\n    and we will ensure that any collected IP addresses\n    are removed from logs,” details Apple.\n\n</code></pre>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25108108" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25108108</a>')
