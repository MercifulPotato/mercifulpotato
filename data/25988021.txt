It&#x27;s like you borrowed a car from a rental company and then you sold it to someone. Pretty sure that&#x27;s a crime. If this is allowed on the stock market, then I think this is laziness of law enforcement that they don&#x27;t know what to do with it. What if the owner wants the item back and the person you sold it to won&#x27;t sell it? It seems like this may be the problem with Gamestop. If people hold on to their shares, whoever &quot;shorted&quot; them is in a big trouble and rightfully so.')
