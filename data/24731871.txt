Raphael and I recreated this unpublished part in a new DSL.<p>DGFIP equally didnt want to publish their internal test games (cases). We had proceeded therefore with the creation of a suite of random test cases, separate from the non published ones, to finally be able to reproduce the validation of Mlang outside of DGFIP.&quot;')
