A broker-dealer should be required to either give advanced notice of a suspension like this, or have a <i>clearly</i> upfront volatility metric that triggers it. (No, a TOS statement like, &quot;We reserve the right to suspend trading <i>at our discretion</i>&quot; is not a clear rule. It&#x27;s a weasel clause)<p>Users would then know, in advance, if a particular ticker will be restricted. Either through specific advanced notice, or because they were told that all securities that exceed a volatility of X over Y time period will be restricted.<p>Whatever the rule, it can&#x27;t be a snap decision that leaves users with no recourse.<p>If you&#x27;re not an appropriate day-trading app, then don&#x27;t act like one until you suddenly don&#x27;t want to be one anymore. Make the rules in advance, communicate them, and let the market decide if you&#x27;re appropriate for their needs.')
