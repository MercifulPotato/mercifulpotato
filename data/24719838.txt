Item(by='candiodari', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602170014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24719744, text='Mostly there are zero suspects. These subpoenas are, as you point out, ways to find more suspects. There&#x27;s just one issue: they also often only turn up ONE suspect. And here&#x27;s the thing with people and police: everybody lies. The victim of the crime lies. Suspects lie (but the thing is: suspects lie <i>whether or not they&#x27;ve committed a crime</i>, this is <i>not</i> a difference between innocent and guilty). Witnesses lie (don&#x27;t want to get caught, and yes the police <i>encourages this</i>, at wrong parking. Police will encourage them to lie, because they can&#x27;t ignore a confession of wrongful parking and they understand they&#x27;ll lose cooperation if they write them a ticket for their trouble). And of course the police officers themselves lie.<p>Whatever hope you have of finding the underlying truth in such a haystack less than a few years of work ... forget it. And then comes Google with &quot;concrete evidence&quot;. Something that is actually true. Very likely not related to the crime, but true.<p>So you can probably understand that this would introduce quite a big bias against a &quot;suspect&quot;, when their real connection to the crime is &quot;someone was shot, and this guy googled &#x27;gun&#x27; 2 days before&quot;. Furthermore, this gives them something to put to a judge or a jury, when before they had nothing, or nothing coherent.<p>Do you really think at this point a police officer, judged by the number of cases solved, bad guys put away, just walks away without at least applying <i>very</i> strong pressure on whoever was fingered ?')
