Without using the tools of government.</i><p>I don&#x27;t know how to solve the problem for everybody. I know how I solve it for myself: by using common sense and critical thinking, combined with a lot of background knowledge from a lot of different sources. But I don&#x27;t know how to magically make everyone do that. And even people who do that won&#x27;t always agree; many of the questions we would all like answers to do not have simple answers that everyone can agree on. People have different goals and values and they aren&#x27;t always fully compatible, and we don&#x27;t have a good understanding of many important problem domains.<p>What I do know is that the problem is unfixable <i>with</i> the tools of government. So we have no choice but to look for other, non-government ways of fixing it.')
