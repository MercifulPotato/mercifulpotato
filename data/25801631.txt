I.e. learning a large number of facts in a manner that you can barf them up exactly once (in the exam) and forget them immediately after.<p>Naturally, this only works on knowledge-base exams, not skill-based exams (e.g. math). This also shows up in the results: math exams generally seem to have worse grades than other exams, and math exams seem to have lower thresholds to pass (e.g. 25 % vs. 60 %).')
