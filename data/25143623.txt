Item(by='pedalpete', descendants=None, kids=[25152255], score=None, time=1605739700, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25142159, text='The reasons you give around &quot;keeping up with new developments, new technologies, ...lack of creativity&quot;, lead me to believe it isn&#x27;t the job that you dislike, it&#x27;s the environment you&#x27;re in.<p>I have a friend who was in a very similar situation to you and he just kept sticking with it year after year. He talked about going back to school and finding a new career, but it was always just easier to keep doing dev work, and it was well paid. He hated the tech stack he was working on (particularly everything javascript&#x2F;typescript), didn&#x27;t see how his contribution was meaningful, etc etc.<p>He was ready to cash it all in again when he found a start-up that he really loved the product. He had a big say in the initial tech stack, and had wanted to dive into Rust. He was enjoying learning about hardware, etc etc. After a few months, he realized that Rust was a great language, but he was getting into more of the &quot;new technologies&quot; and it was a bit of a shiny thing, so he went back to C++. He doesn&#x27;t care about the &quot;technologies&quot; so much as he cares about the problem he&#x27;s solving for customers, and how that is implemented.<p>You mention you &quot;don&#x27;t see the value...beyond the paycheck.&quot;, well, that&#x27;s the value. Can you find something where you love the problem that you&#x27;re solving for the customer, and hopefully love the product as well. Something where you can see the impact your having on the customers (and maybe even the world).<p>I know it may seem all &quot;we&#x27;re changing the world&quot; start-upy, but some people really are, and it isn&#x27;t only about the money. From my experience, SF is full of the &quot;we&#x27;re changing the world&quot; people with no real reason behind it. The less startup focused hubs I think have more to offer because they&#x27;re not so caught up in the bubble.<p>Just my two cents, hope it helps.')
