The mid-late 2000&#x27;s one after all this history? Or the 1991 one that was about intel seeking ways to squeeze out AMD from it&#x27;s license? The first one isn&#x27;t really relevant to this and the second one could have been more direct but AMD having a license and then getting another later as part of the deal on x86-64 does allude to behind the scenes shenanigans.')
