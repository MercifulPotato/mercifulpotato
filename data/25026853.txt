Huge media brands like TechCrunch talking about the &quot;winner takes all&quot; companies (Google, Netflix, etc.) Everyone loves to talk about the big winners and associate with them. I guess it&#x27;s human nature.<p>I&#x27;m really glad there are sites like Failory [2] that talk about founder failures (I&#x27;ve seen them on HN front page several times). I&#x27;m also trying to do the same with my research project on acquisition channels [3]. I often found I can learn WAY more from people who failed at something and their advice on &quot;things to be aware of&quot; vs. people who succeeded. Many people who failed usually tried 10 different things and know the aspects of what worked&#x2F;didn&#x27;t vs. people who succeeded and tried 2-3 things and got lucky in 1.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Survivorship_bias" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Survivorship_bias</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;failory.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;failory.com</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com</a>')
