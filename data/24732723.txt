However, combined with some of the other clojure niceties (namely cider and structural editing) it does make it a better experience for me.<p>It allows me to maintain a better flow as I can maintain REPL state if needed(especially if it&#x27;s a quick hack where dependency injection like component isn&#x27;t worth the overhead). When I&#x27;m done exercising the code I can just make minimal changes to make the comment a test, leave it in place, or move it over to a bag-of-tricks user.clj.')
