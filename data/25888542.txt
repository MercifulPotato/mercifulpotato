They create definitions based on examples of the word&#x27;s use, and Oxford English defines it as: &quot;Denoting software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.&quot;<p>We can agree to disagree about the details; no use arguing on the internet, and I respect your view. But please keep in mind the OSI&#x27;s mission is fitting open source into a legal framework. It&#x27;s not the ASF, FSF, Mozilla Foundation or other organizations who actually support and organize open source projects. <i>Full disclosure; I also worked on Apache Drill, thanks to the ASF.</i><p>My primary point is that Amazon is not part of the open source community (AFAIK, they&#x27;ve never claimed to be). So it&#x27;s hard for me to trust a company overtly focused on monetizing OSS <i>without</i> contributing. IMHO, all of the engineers at Elastic who gave so much time and effort for this project are still part of the open source community. I hate to see Amazon effectively judging which projects&#x2F;people are &quot;truly&quot; part of the community when their motivation is so clearly corrupt.<p>I hope this comes across with respect, and please know that I&#x27;d much rather not see licenses like the SSPL. But after seeing Amazon&#x27;s monopolistic and anticompetitive behavior play out repeatedly with various companies, I can&#x27;t just watch them do this without saying <i>something</i>. Even on a stale HN thread. :)<p>One last thing to note -- Bruce Perens left the OSI in January of 2020 (shortly after the SSPL stuff went down), and said: &quot;We created a tower of babel of licenses. We did not design-in license compliance and we have a tremendous noncompliance problem that isn&#x27;t getting better. We did not design a good framework for where proprietary software can go, and where it never should. Our license loopholes are exploited.&quot; ESR (who I detest as a human being), was banned from the OSI two months later. I don&#x27;t mean to suggest this was a direct reaction the SSPL though -- please see the OSI&#x27;s wikipedia page and cited sources.')
