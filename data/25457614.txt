If you look at something like the contract for your credit card, I guarantee you&#x27;ll find a clause entitled &quot;Arbitration&quot;, &quot;Mediation&quot;, or something akin to that where it basically says &quot;If something bad happens, you give up your right to sue us and instead agree to binding arbitration by a mediator of our choice.&quot; As for what would happen if one party tried to sue the other anyway, I think it would depend on the nature of the grievance. Again, IAN[even_close_to_being]AL.')
