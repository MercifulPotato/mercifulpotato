Item(by='kansai-ben', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610955089, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25818407, text='&gt; A large number of Japanese recipe are highly homecook-able especially for Japanese people living in Japan, who probably already have the right tools&#x2F;ingredients. It all depends on what you usually shelf at home.<p>Agreed. I&#x27;m not making kaiseki every night, nor any night for that matter here in Tokyo.<p>Typically I&#x27;ll have the rice cooker set to have rice ready at 17:00 when I finish work for the day. I&#x27;ll usually have some dashi on hand that I made over the weekend, but otherwise it&#x27;s a 5-minute job with instant stuff that&#x27;s not powdered, or 20 or so if I feel like making it from scratch. Mix in white&#x2F;red miso and any other extras, and soup&#x27;s done. A quick stir-fry with some meat, bean sprouts, and a packet of seasoning takes me all of another 5 minutes, and that&#x27;s dinner.<p>If it&#x27;s noodles, I&#x27;ll usually have some fried vegetables from the supermarket in the fridge, and that takes 5 minutes to heat up in the toaster oven. Udon can be boiled and done in that time. Slice up a green onion, mix in a raw egg, add soy sauce and some roe, and that&#x27;s another quick dinner.<p>When I feel like doing something more major, making nabe on the weekends really isn&#x27;t that much harder. Prepping ingredients takes maybe half an hour, and then it&#x27;s just letting it simmer for another hour. Plus, leftovers from the last a long time.<p>Curry&#x27;s also something else that takes an hour tops from start to finish.')
