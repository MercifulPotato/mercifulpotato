Item(by='apendleton', descendants=None, kids=[25275092], score=None, time=1606898451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25274311, text='Vaccines that prevent disease symptoms but don&#x27;t completely prevent infection are definitely a thing (they&#x27;re said to confer &quot;non-sterilizing immunity,&quot; vs. &quot;sterilizing immunity&quot; which prevents both infection and disease). The inactivated polio vaccine (the injectable one that&#x27;s used in the US) is an example of such a vaccine. The oral polio vaccine, which is the main one used in the developing world, interestingly <i>does</i> confer sterilizing immunity, but with the tradeoff that sometimes it also causes polio.<p>At least in the US, the explicit target endpoint for FDA approval was just prevention of disease, not prevention of infection, and the phase III trials for both the Moderna and Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech trials were only designed to assess this criterion: they only tested symptomatic people, so it&#x27;s entirely possible (though not <i>that</i> likely given animal model observations, etc.), that infections were just as common in the treatment groups as control groups, but they just never developed symptoms and so were never tested. More research will be needed to ascertain which kind of immunity is being conferred.')
