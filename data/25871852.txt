Falcon 9 weighs like half a million tons. Falcon Heavy is about three times that. Starship will weigh like 5 million tons. I hope you&#x27;re not under the impression that all rockets uniformly produce the same emissions. It depends on a few different factors.<p>Falcon 9 burns RP-1 kerosene, and uses twice as much of that fuel as Soyuz.<p>Falcon Heavy burns 440 tons of RP-1 kerosene. A 747-8i can carry 60,755 gallons of jet fuel (a similar distillate), which weighs 407 thousand lbs, or 203 tons. Its range at maximum take-off weight is 9,210mi. A flight from Boston to Glasgow is about 3k miles, so that&#x27;s three transatlantic flights per tank, or 6.5 transatlantic flights per Falcon Heavy flight.<p>Reusing rockets also has a greenhouse gas cost because you have to fire engines to steer and land them after reentry.<p>I wonder if Mr. Musk would support forcing spaceflight companies to offset their carbon emissions by paying for reforestation. Somehow, I doubt it.<p>Furthermore, rocket emissions deliver gases directly to the middle and upper atmosphere, so their pollution is thus more impactful pound-for-pound than aircraft emissions.<p>And in fact, Mr. Musk wants to replace air travel with rocket travel. Check out this SpaceX video from 2017. It&#x27;s not just one or two flights we&#x27;re talking about. He wants to fly thousands. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zqE-ultsWt0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zqE-ultsWt0</a>')
