The production database was ssh-tunneled to the default port of the guys computer and he ran tests that cleaned the database first.<p>Now... our scenario was such that we could NOT lose those 7 hours because each customer record lost meant $5000 usd penalty.<p>What saved us is that I knew about the oplog (binlog in mysql) so after restoring the backup i isolated the last N hours lost from the log and replayed it on the database.<p>Lesson learned and a lucky save.')
