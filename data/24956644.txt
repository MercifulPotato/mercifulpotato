A business might want some simple web functionality. In a non-software business (a dentist, an after school program, a home builder, etc.), they usually do not have any developers at all. Neither good, nor bad, neither web nor any other kind. None.<p>So the business employees (a dental hygienist, an office manager, a teacher) or owners cobble something up. And it often works, up to a point. But since (1) most rules of good software engineering were likely broken in this setup and (2) it incorporates enough business logic and users learned to live with it, once this breaks it is very hard to fix or replace. This is not an idle speculation: I personally know three such examples (friends). All were done by non-software folks. All used PHP.<p>This ability is not always a bad thing -- PHP allowed small orgs with zero software skills to solve their business problem. And keep it running for a while, in one case for almost 4 years before it got into this &quot;too broken to run, too familiar to toss&quot; state.')
