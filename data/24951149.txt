So here I am looking at <i>Outland</i> (which isn&#x27;t as terrible as Harlan Ellison said but goodness it isn&#x27;t great), <i>Zardoz</i>, <i>In the Name of the Rose</i>, <i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i> (it&#x27;s fun, I will grant it that), <i>Time Bandits</i> and was left wondering: what films had his iconic performances?  What&#x27;s a good sample to understand the range he had?<p>I grew up with the Bond films so they&#x27;re very much background to me, almost hard to notice in a way.  Any recommendations?')
