But such a small infection that is effectively managed by a vaccine-primed immune system is meaningless. That&#x27;s like saying that a clean living-room floor isn&#x27;t really clean because you can spot a speck of dust with your magnifying glass.<p>For all intents and purposes, vaccines prevent people from contracting an infection that is clinically meaningful, and that can be spread to others in a way that leads to infection. That&#x27;s herd immunity.<p>&quot;Herd immunity is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through vaccination or previous infections, thereby reducing the likelihood of infection for individuals who lack immunity.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Herd_immunity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Herd_immunity</a><p>You&#x27;re making it sound like vaccinated people are walking around shedding virus all over the place, but simply showing no outward signs.')
