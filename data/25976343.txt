If you add the option for them to receive 1&#x2F;2 or even 1&#x2F;3 of income but have to do nothing - now doing the job they would do previously to avoid poverty would probably take more money to do. And the people who get screwed are the ones who were barely able to afford their services before.<p>Every job I needed to do in my early life sucked and I would do none of them if someone gave me 1&#x2F;3 of the income and stay at home with my parents and play video games and code for leasure. I would probably never even take that level of job (factory line work, industrial work, farm work, entry level sales shit). Multiply that by a huge fraction of the population and you seriously destabilise the economy.<p>Some jobs can be outsourced (like manufacturing) so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal - but some jobs like for eg. elderly care, etc. are labor intensive and not easily outsourced. And everyone needs them.')
