Gas prices were very high at the time too so that was the main benefit from the company point of view.<p>But we had to take either monday or friday off and we had to work together with our teams to make sure we weren&#x27;t all off on the same day.<p>It was great! 3 day weekend every week, the ability to do chores and errands that are much easier to do on a weekday than a weekend, and cutting out a 1&#x2F;5 of the commute made a big difference in both sanity and money.<p>But the best part about the whole thing was that because there were some people out on mondays and fridays all meetings were scheduled on tuesday, wednesday, thursday - and you knew that if you had fridays off then your monday was free and clear to get actual work done. It made a huge difference to productivity and morale.<p>I have tried to convince every company ive worked for since to do it and none have, but I will keep trying.')
