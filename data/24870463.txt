I think this is a product of the fact that those SF buildings and those SF neighborhoods were always fundamentally undesirable and those people were only kept in place because they needed access to their jobs and our terrible transportation system was failing them. But these anecdotes involve people moving to Berkeley, not Moab.<p>For the Bay Area specifically there are also tens of thousands of apartments being completed right now, including about 10k in SF and several 1000s in downtown Oakland. This will naturally reduce rents.')
