You mention other things being more interesting. You might be telling yourself something.<p>Obviously we do not live in a bubblegum dream world and you may not always be able to follow your interests exactly, but I have to imagine that if you examine those things that &quot;seemed more interesting,&quot; you may find a new career in there. And if you don&#x27;t find a new career because those things don&#x27;t make any money, then maybe don&#x27;t beat yourself up too much for not wanting to become better at a job that only serves to fund your true interests.')
