But that&#x27;s because in C++ the &quot;inline&quot; keyword creates a weak symbol, so you can #include a header in several places and there will only ever be a single implmentation. For function templates this happens automatically, btw.<p>IMO, if you need a #define like this, you&#x27;re are not really writing a header-only library, that&#x27;s basically just a source file in disguise. You could just as well distribute headers + a single source file and just ask the user to add this one source file to their build system (which should really be a trivial task).<p>EDITED for more clarity about C vs C++.')
