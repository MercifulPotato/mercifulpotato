We even entirely broke rules about how package versioning works compared to what Hex expects.<p>However, we didn&#x27;t spit on having a package manager (that wasn&#x27;t a bad lazy index hosted on a github repo), and it became a very interesting bridge across communities that we don&#x27;t regret working with. Our hope now is to try and make it possible to use more Elixir libraries from the Erlang side, but the two languages&#x27; build models make that difficult at times.')
