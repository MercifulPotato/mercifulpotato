I know that when a person gives me a gift, he&#x2F;she shows an interest in my joy and happiness. That&#x27;s just enough. I may use the gift the way it intended to be used to do a gift giver nice in return, even if I really don&#x27;t need it.<p>Like parents like their children&#x27;s birthday cards or seashell figurines not for beauty or worth, but for an effort to make them happy. Being that parent for everybody who gives me gifts making my life better.<p>The same is with my gifts: I am choosing them according to my idea of the person&#x27;s taste and what will make him&#x2F;her happy.<p>There are universal gifts of flowers (not a lot of people hate the idea of having a bouquet in their room), good wine&#x2F;champagne&#x2F;spirit (except for non-drinkers), something tasty (and not very unhealthy). If there is a discrepancy - a reasonable person will always give a hint to avoid the same mistake in the future.')
