Much, perhaps most, of his output is locked away in a vault, perhaps never to be heard. And of the material that was released, he didn&#x27;t allow covers except by artists he handpicked; he was also the only artist to consistently turn Weird Al down when approached for a parody of his music.<p>But Prince was a Da Vinci level genius. Every song he released was a treasure. So anyone who knows anything about music will admit that not only did Prince have the right to be so protective, but he has already gifted us with so much that to be angry at him for not giving us more is to be selfish.<p>Apple is like that. They kickstarted the personal computing revolution, <i>and every single computing revolution to come after</i>. GUIs in 1984, portable digital music players in 2000, smartphones in 2007, tablets in 2010. The Apple M1 Mac is the first personal computer to be developed, hardware and software, soup to nuts by a single company. It is the first machine to uncompromisingly represent a single vision for computing and how humans engage in it. It is not only the best computer on the market by a wide margin, it is the next revolution. The machines they just released are only the beginning: the future portends even higher performance desktops and laptops with lower power draw and heat&#x2F;noise output than anyone else on the market. They absolutely deserve the very strict control they exercise over their platforms because that control has let them shape an impeccable vision of how computing should work. (Which becomes even more appealing when you consider the messes the Windows and Android ecosystems have become.) To demand that they turn loose of that control, for the sake of the few users still running legacy apps, is to compromise what makes Apple, Apple. Macs run macOS, and macOS runs on Macs. Demanding open source emulation of macOS compromises that. It&#x27;s not going to happen.')
