And I&#x27;m happy to discuss it with them. But their &quot;big picture&quot; experience is limited, and this can matter.<p>I do not mean to patronise you at all when I say that the ideals of school sometimes have to bend when faced with limited resources. I know, I sound like every condescending oldster ever, but experience adds nuance that may be hard to see.<p>Obviously I can&#x27;t speak to your situation, and I know nothing about medicine or medical teams [1] but there is one technique that may help you better understand the choices being made;<p>When advocating a specific approach pay lots of attention to the possible downsides of your recommendation. I&#x27;ve seen a significant maturation in my engineers when they can honestly articulate the down-sides of their point of view. If their answer is &quot;there are no downsides&quot; then it&#x27;s easy to dismiss them as not fully understanding the problem. Every decision has a downside. But those who can see, and balance both the upsides and the downsides, who understand the negative impact of their choices, are starting to show their maturation.<p>In most cases there is no perfect approach, and ultimately someone has to make as decision, which may turn out to be right or wrong. And I get that in the medical field the impact of being right or wrong is significant. I don&#x27;t envy you that.<p>[1] anecdotally I try not to work with doctors. The nature of your job requires that you project high levels of confidence with minimal data. Given the placebo effect I understand this - no-one wants an indecisive doctor. Alas this character trait works less well when interacting with other professions about _their_ area of competence. I&#x27;ve found doctors difficult to program for because (with respect) their ego gets in the way. When everyone treats your word as gospel, and you must &quot;never be wrong&quot;, it&#x27;s easy to become self-important. I don&#x27;t tell a plumber what kind of pipes to use, but doctors all try and design UI with unfortunate workability issues.<p>In any team there are going be different opinions, and in the heat of battle there isn&#x27;t time to pass on all the data that matters. But in the aftermath I encourage you to speak to your team leader about the decisions he took and try and learn from the experience. Sometimes she will be right, sometimes your approach may have been better. No-one is right all the time.<p>And in 10 years remember this process when you are team leader and some fresh-of-school youngster tells you the &quot;obvious best thing&quot;. Be open to learn from them, but also forgive them their absolutism.<p>Above all, thank you for your service in this most trying of times. You have entered a meaningful profession at a opportune time.')
