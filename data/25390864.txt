I prefer to cut out as many middlemen as possible nowadays, in order to ensure the highest probability of getting the highest quality product.<p>I know Walmart gets lower quality products than other places and whatnot, and manufacturers make subtle adjustments to products to meet resellers&#x27; desired price points.<p>So now, I just buy directly from the brands whenever possible (and definitely not from Amazon for anything high value).
