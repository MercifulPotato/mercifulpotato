Once it loads the initrd, the early kernel environment validates the the root volume passphrase in about 2 seconds, presumably because it&#x27;s using an optimized implementation that&#x27;s available in the kernel but not in GRUB...<p>Right now I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing this unless you have a really good reason for encrypting the boot partition. Most people will be better off having an unencrypted boot and enabling secure boot with your own platform key instead.')
