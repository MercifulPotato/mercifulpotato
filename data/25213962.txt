Your phone does not need to be unlocked for the app to work.”<p>“It then securely makes a ‘digital handshake’, which notes the date and time, distance and duration of the contact. All information collected by the app is securely encrypted and stored in the app on the user’s phone. No one, not even the user, can access it.”<p>“Unless and until a person is diagnosed with COVID-19, no contact information collected in the app is disclosed or able to be accessed. Then, once the person agrees and uploads the data, only the relevant state or territory public health officials will have access to information. The only information they are allowed to access is that of close contacts – when a person has come within approximately 1.5 metres of another app user for 15 minutes or more – in their jurisdiction,” Minister Robert said.<p>Ref: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pm.gov.au&#x2F;media&#x2F;covidsafe-new-app-slow-spread-coronavirus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pm.gov.au&#x2F;media&#x2F;covidsafe-new-app-slow-spread-co...</a>')
