The &quot;spaces&quot; version of windows is better IMO which is a huge plus.  It was very easy for me to go from my mac workflow to windows which I found surprising.  Docker, Windows Terminal, VSCode, WSL2 all seem to work well for me.  Windows 10 even has a spectacle equivalent-ish where you can drag and snap windows to create grids for your apps.<p>This allows me to go from development on personal projects to gaming and vice-versa which is very satisfying.')
