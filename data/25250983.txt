Regarding the scope of audience and participation, I see remarks from six participants.  I&#x27;m aware of adjacent threads addressing related topics and angles.  We have undisclosed N participants that&#x27;ve been variously upvoting, downvoting, flagging, and vouching comments, leaving many flagged or dead (i.e. collapsed to casual visitors).<p>It seems to me there is no common ground on the matter between you and I, not even agreement of the parameters of discussion.  A collapsed subthread whose index topic has naturally decayed from the front page lacks any prospect of additional voices, and with no opportunity I can perceive for the Hegelian dialectic to resolve otherwise, I shall break off here, and wish you (and any unseen readers that have stoically endured thus far) a good day.')
