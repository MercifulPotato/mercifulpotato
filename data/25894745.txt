It is a contributor to my ability to spend money to eat better and the resulting health improvements that further feedback into a better life.<p>Furthermore, my attitude has shifted from &quot;get wealthy&quot; (20s) to &quot;optimize for time.&quot; (30s) and that too has impacted my perception on what career and lifestyle I want.<p>All this is to say: I do believe there is a soft cap on what money does for your wellbeing.
