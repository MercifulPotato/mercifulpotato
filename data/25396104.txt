The most common comments they make are: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be guinea pig&quot;, &quot;How do I know the government won&#x27;t control me&quot;, and more conspiracy theories. All of these fears seem to come from misinformation on the internet, friends and family get a ton of memes&#x2F;fake news through WhatsApp highlighting the unproven negative effects of the vaccine. Is there any effective way to control the propagation of misinformation on these platforms? How would one even get started to tackle that problem?<p>Whether or not you agree with their opinions or the sources they derived them from, what you&#x27;re advocating is dangerous. Who should have that authority to determine what is and is not misinformation?')
