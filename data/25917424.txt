Firefox has to run everything interpreted, which is actually fine for most sites, but bogs down on JS heavy web app type things.<p>On a much less niche side of things, a lot of web apps like Teams, Zoom, and probably many others are only fully functional on Chromium, thanks to WebRTC specifics and some video encoding stuff that&#x27;s only on Chromium. Don&#x27;t know the details, but things like video and desktop streaming are limited to Chromium.<p>That could very well be an artificially enforced restriction, but I don&#x27;t think it is. I <i>think</i> firefox is moving towards feature parity with Chrome on this one, I hope so anyway.')
