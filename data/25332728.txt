The M1 browser is remarkably fast and it unlocks new territory in what you can do without bringing the browser to its knees. The new 11th gen Intel laptop part has also opened a big gap between itself and its predecessors and competitors, but it’s not as fast as the M1 and it draws way more power when it’s running. So I think this is an area they still have room to improve and consumers will really notice the benefit of it.')
