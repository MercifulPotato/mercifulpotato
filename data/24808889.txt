The gayness of the nazis was a source of jokes and criticisms from the beginning. The pro-homosexual bias of fascists are so obvious, there are even books, generally by religious people, which assert, with considerable evidence, that fascism was entirely a homosexual phenomenon. This sort of thing doesn&#x27;t fit the preposterous bias of the book you quote, which <i>again</i> is simply a list of the prejudices of the authors; more or less, the prejudices of late 20th century shitlibbery, against traditional christian people.<p>As for nazi nudity: go watch the movie &quot;Olympiad.&quot; Or ... hell, just look at photos of the era[1]. A good fraction of them were neopagans as well; they probably invented the phrase &quot;sky-clad.&quot;<p>&gt;Given that I believe private nudity is legal in the US, why should anyone respond otherwise, unless unaccepting of divergence from their beliefs?<p>Are you joking? There are lots of things which are legal but which people might not be all together comfortable with. For example: gambling, smoking, eating live shellfish, having unprotected sex with 100s of people, going to Church on Sundays (I guarantee you there are people who see something wrong with this), remaining a virgin until you&#x27;re married (ditto), getting falling down drunk, eating only vegetables: the list is endless. Nudism certainly falls into the category of something all kinds of people might not be all together comfortable with; both authoritarian and non-authoritarian; and in this case both American right wing and left wing people. Do you think Susan Fowler would have been happy if Uber had done its corporate retreats and a nudist camp? Don&#x27;t tell me it&#x27;s &quot;inappropriate&quot; -because if &quot;there is absolutely nothing wrong with nudist camps&quot; -how can it possibly be inappropriate to hang out with your colleagues with your junk hanging out?<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haaretz.com&#x2F;jewish&#x2F;holocaust-remembrance-day&#x2F;.premium.MAGAZINE-the-nazis-tolerated-gays-then-everything-changed-1.6869815" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haaretz.com&#x2F;jewish&#x2F;holocaust-remembrance-day&#x2F;.pr...</a><p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Naturism_in_Germany" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Naturism_in_Germany</a>')
