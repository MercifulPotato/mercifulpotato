Player B sells game back to GameStop for $20. Who sells it to player C for $55. Repeat a few more times if you like.<p>You are probably happy with the story. I am not. I want content creators to be rewarded. You want middle men to extract value.<p>I know what first sale doctrine is and how it works. Thanks for the claps.<p>&gt; That has nothing to do with the Gamestop&#x27;s business decisions after they sold the new copy. The studio is trying to milk it for more money post sale.<p>If you would like to argue that game developers do not alter their business model in the face of used sales go ahead. Anyone who sat in meeting centered on “how can we prevent gamers from selling the disc back to GameStop in the first six months” will laugh at how wrong you are.<p>The good news for you is that the rise of digital distribution made the debate around used sales moot. Used sales don’t matter and GameStop’s old business model is dead. I hope they fail to pivot and their whole business goes with it.')
