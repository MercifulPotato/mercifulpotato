The arming code number isn&#x27;t like a traditional code lock where there&#x27;s a chip that&#x27;s doing &quot;strcmp(entered_code, CORRECT_CODE)&quot;, but instead the arming code number is a fundamental piece of how the bomb works.  Without that you need the kind of state nuclear apparatus you&#x27;d need to build a bomb in the first place to reverse engineer (think a state run nuclear research lab), or at best you can remanufacture it into a much crappier bomb that probably duds to just being a dirty bomb.')
