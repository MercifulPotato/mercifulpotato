Either some facet of the topic, or maybe a side conversation (like the one we having now about HackerDaily). I want to &quot;jump out&quot; of this conversation and back to the &quot;main topic&quot;, but I have to scroll up until I get to root of this topic and click the collapse sign (-) next to the parent to easily get to the next conversation tree. However, I may be pages and pages down from where this conversation started and have to page up and up and up. Alternatively, I can page down and down and down to try to find where this topic ends. Neither works very well.<p>But what you do is provide a line of minus signs (-) at the top left that grows and shrinks with the tree and at any time I can click one of these to collapse a parent post! This is great! Being a UX aficionado I am tickled that you have not only seen the same pain, but found an elegant solution for it. Well done!')
