If things occur in sequence, for instance, we can infer causality from what we know about the things conjoined apart from the conjunction.<p>Crucially, there is more here than just &quot;joining multiple clauses together&quot; (and many of the things conjoined aren&#x27;t clauses), because &quot;or&quot; can be described this way too, but &quot;and&quot; does not mean the same thing as &quot;or&quot;. With &quot;or&quot; you are only asserting that some of the propositions are true.')
