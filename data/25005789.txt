I said they don&#x27;t contribute to the public purse. Your taxes are not a contribution to the public purse because your entire wage <i>comes from</i> the public purse. A public sector worker is not adding to the national gain. Their work <i>may</i> provide value to the nation, in that it can be considered an investment - in the case of teaching, the students who graduate and go into the private sector may create wealth that goes into the national gain.<p>The fact that public sector workers even pay taxes on their income from the State is a bizarre process which merely ties up financial resources into a system where they&#x27;re taken from a pot, only to be put back into the same pot later on, in a repeated cycle.')
