I said they don&#x27;t contribute to the public purse. Your taxes are not a contribution to the public purse because your entire wage <i>comes from</i> the public purse. A public sector worker is not adding to the national gain. Their work <i>may</i> provide value to the nation, in that it can be considered an investment - in the case of teaching, the students who graduate and go into the private sector may create wealth that goes into the national gain.<p>The fact that public sector workers even pay taxes on their income from the State is a bizarre process which merely ties up financial resources into a system where they&#x27;re taken from a pot, only to be put back into the same pot later on, in a repeated cycle.<p>It has become apparent that many of the students who graduate from publicly subsidized academies go back into the academies themselves. They are not necessarily providing value to a nation, but its impossible to really measure whether or not that could be the case. The expansion of the public sector has obvious consequences though: less income into the public purse whilst public expenditure grows. There&#x27;s only one conclusion to this trend if it were to continue: the salaries of all public sector workers will eventually exceed the income tax from private sector workers. Insane.<p>If more workers were placed into the private sector, then not only does national expenditure decrease, the total income tax increases - those same jobs could add to the national gain rather than take from the pot, freeing up resources for other purposes. There must necessarily be a cap on the size of the public sector, and it is my opinion that the smaller the better.')
