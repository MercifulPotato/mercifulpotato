They hate them since forever.<p>Germany and France were eternal enemies too. Now we cannot imagine Europe without both countries. If we kick Poland out of EU, the anti-EU sentiment will grow and Russia will be the only available partner in the region. At the same time Poland will have a strategic card in their hand. So they will do what they have to do.<p>Look the numbers look like:<p>&quot;Intra-EU trade accounts for 80% of Polandâ€™s exports (Germany 28%, Czechia and France both 6%), while outside the EU 3% go to both Russia and the United States.<p>In terms of imports, 69% come from EU Member States (Germany 27%, the Netherlands 6% and Italy 5%), while outside the EU 8% come from China and 7% from Russia.&quot;<p>So if EU kicks Poland out, who are going to be the next partners?<p>&gt; Who &quot;needs&quot; what? Exploiting cheap labor from Poland only works for Germany, because legal working standards and payment is allowing for this. German people would benefit too, if general exploitation was fought against.<p>That&#x27;s just populism.<p>&gt; The industry needs cheap workforce. Capitalism needs a cheap workforce. Economic growth and exploitation of natural ressources needs a cheap workforce.\n&gt; If we want to survive the shitshow ahead, a lot of things need to change. Compromising with populism and cultural degeneration is contra-productive.<p>That&#x27;s just populism too.<p>So IMO, you want to fight populism with populism and fight for diversity, killing the cultural diversity in Europe.')
