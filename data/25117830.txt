Item(by='paganel', descendants=None, kids=[25118035, 25118924], score=None, time=1605565343, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25109098, text='Italians have indeed the best espressos&#x2F;ristrettos that I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of drinking, but other than that the origin coffee culture is pretty much non-existing in Northern Italy (I&#x27;ve never been to the South). Comparatively speaking Milano is a desert when it comes to origin coffee shops, and the same goes for their hip neighbours across the Alps, i.e. Paris.<p>From my direct experience European cities further East and North fare much better, I can say that with first-hand experience about the city I live in (Bucharest) and about Bratislava, too (which I&#x27;ve found to be better compared to Vienna). I&#x27;ve also heard&#x2F;read very good things about Budapest and Berlin, and (as an exception to my first part of the post) I&#x27;ve found coffee shops in the Chamber√≠ district of Madrid to be serving quite good coffee.<p>All this to say that the Italians do not have the monopoly on saying how one should drink his&#x2F;her coffee or not, for the simple fact that the Italians mostly only care about a small sub-set of coffee culture (i.e. espressos&#x2F;ristrettos)')
