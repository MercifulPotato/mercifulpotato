Item(by='names_are_hard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602158706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24698927, text='I&#x27;ve said this elsewhere in this thread, but there&#x27;s a difference between predictable pricing and controlling runaway costs.<p>Predictable pricing means that each month my bill is the same: I&#x27;m on a $15 plan, I pay $15 a month. No nickel-and-diming, no hidden fees, life is simple. This is a good thing.<p>Controlling costs means that no matter what happens, my costs will not exceed $x&#x2F;month. Service might degrade if necessary, but I will not pay for anything above some upper limit.<p>Seems that DO has the former but not the latter, because if things get out of hand (caused by an attack, a bug in my code, going viral) the customer can be stuck with a bill. Alerts do not alleviate this risk. Pricing that is <i>generally</i> predictable does not alleviate this risk. Only a hard cap does. I want a plan that says &quot;you have 250 GB of traffic, after which requests will fail and you&#x27;ll get an email&quot;. You can make it nicer by sending me a warning email at 200GB so that I have time to upgrade my plan if I want.')
