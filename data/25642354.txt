I figured If I&#x27;m going to feel crap I might as well commit to it.<p>after that I only drink Tea (black no sugar) and only about 3-4 a day.\nI can go a full day without any tea much easier than i could with no coffee... but I might just quit all caffeine completely anyway. we&#x27;ll see, I need to find decent &quot;hot drinks&quot; that are low acidity and no milk. Mint Tea (no black tea in it) will only go so far.')
