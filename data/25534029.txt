It wasn&#x27;t really talking about applications for us, necessarily -- people touted the summer camps they&#x27;d present at or the undergrads they&#x27;d sponsor for research or the way they would give grant money to help undergrads attend conferences (always tied to the pure math in the grant).<p>These NeurIPS Broader Impact statements seem a bit different, in that they more explicitly call out ethical considerations.<p>It&#x27;s funny though that you ask about hammers &amp; nails. Pure math had a strong tradition of people ending up there because they did not want to do applied math, physics, or engineering that could be weaponized and used to kill people&#x2F;support oppressive governments&#x2F;infringe upon basic freedoms. Pure math is not particularly thoughtful about ethics, but many folks ended up there because of their ethical views. The Cold War, World War 2, Vietnam, and French occupation of Algeria had particular ripple effects in pure math because of that.<p>It would be a shame if ML also became a field people avoided because they didn&#x27;t want to contribute to evil, in their own view.<p>Take the longer view: it&#x27;s easy to think we&#x27;re the first people ever to think about ethics and science&#x2F;tech&#x2F;math, but far from it. How are today&#x27;s struggles the same or different than Grothendieck&#x27;s, or Laurent Schwartz&#x27;s, or Emmy Noether&#x27;s, or Lagrange&#x27;s or Kovalevskaya&#x27;s or...? They all had significant reckonings to contend with.')
