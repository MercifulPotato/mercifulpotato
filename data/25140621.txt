It&#x27;s always work-in-progress.<p>Small incremental improvements are not glamorous, typically not newsworthy to share to the public.<p>Some examples of small incremental improvements:<p>1. Improve API docs. I heard that many API-focused startups have a dedicated team to maintain their API doc page.<p>2. Dealing with edge cases. As more apps&#x2F;websites use our API, we&#x27;ll see some edge cases that we would never know, which could be as simple as adding a data field in the response with 2 lines code change, or changing search index that requires to re-index the whole thing for a few days. There could also be some strange edge cases with billing, e.g. what if a user subscribe to the paid plan, then unsubscribe, then subscribe again, then do something strange, then unsubscribe...<p>3. Customer support. This involves adding FAQ (tweaking the texts) and preparing email templates to answer frequently asked questions from users.<p>4. Doing things to keep the service robust &amp; performant, e.g., adding new alerts via Datadog&#x2F;Pagerduty so we can know what go wrong in time. We also need to have mechanism to be able to know if a particular app sends tons of requests (e.g., send request in an infinite loop) in a short amount of time and we should be able to do something about it (e.g., suspend the account).')
