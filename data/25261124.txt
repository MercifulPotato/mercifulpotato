Bipedal robots are a joke. They also dent and rust. It&#x27;ll be that way for a while. They don&#x27;t reproduce.<p>But virtual world, say they&#x27;re better at math. Say they prove all the Clay Millennium Problems. Say they go <i>way</i> beyond those problems and produce some math far beyond human&#x27;s ability to understand it.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about that for a while and have decided it&#x27;s fine. Math as a profession will still exist. Fact is, there&#x27;s already a proof for everything mathematicians are investigating (or a proof that there&#x27;s no proof, recursively), out there somewhere. Mathematicians are just searching for it, so that it can be understood and translated to human language. The fact that AI already knows the answers doesn&#x27;t mean that human mathematicians are useless: they are still required to uncover the meaning of these results and translate them into human language. AI then is still just a tool that mathematicians use to help them in their search. Similar to how biologists will use AlphaFold. I guess.<p>Or... <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;9KWrH#sv05qpF" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;9KWrH#sv05qpF</a>')
