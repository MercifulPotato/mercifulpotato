I used Georgia Techs Udacity course on operating systems to supplement my learning.<p>Which gives ~75h-100h, way more credible than the 15h the author mentions in the post..<p>My students have 3h&#x2F;week of Lecture, 2h&#x2F;week of labs which is about 75h of classes (15 weeks). If we add ~60h estimated time for two projects, it&#x27;s 135h. It means to me that you had enough time to learn the concepts and may have internalized some&#x2F;most of them..')
