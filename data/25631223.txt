We contrast this to the single domain focus of an actual conspiracy. While Pizzagate relies on the alignment of multiple domains, Bridgegate remains firmly rooted in the single domain of New Jersey politics<p>This study is interesting work to be sure, but the cause behind their hypothesis might be rooted in how journalism works, rather than whether it&#x27;s truthful&#x2F;factual or not.<p>Papers have a NJ politics &quot;beat&quot;, with an editor and reporters who are experts in that single domain and are expected to produce work rooted in that specific domain.<p>Or worse, the &quot;single domain&quot; in some instances might be appearing because it was a story fed to the paper by a three-letter agency.<p>Citizen journalists (or whatever less charitable term you want to use) don&#x27;t really have that. They can focus on whatever they want, and it&#x27;s much easier to build a narrative that spans multiple domains.')
