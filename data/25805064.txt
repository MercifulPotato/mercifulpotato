Item(by='kurko', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610827883, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25804507, text='&gt; To-do lists are for things that aren&#x27;t a real priority, otherwise you would be giving them your full attention and the tracking would be unnecessary.<p>I disagree with this bit, but perhaps it’s because “real priority” is vague. To-do lists offload tasks from memory to ensure we don’t forget them. It’s totally possible for something to be a “real priority” (whatever definition) and someone forgetting about it.<p>Don’t confuse priorities with memorization.')
