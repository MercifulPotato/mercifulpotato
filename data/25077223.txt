What about censorship in its op-ed section (if the Times decides to not, letâ€™s say, publish your article in the Op-Ed). Facebook is not a public utility, so restricting how Facebook can moderate is, in fact, censorship (and potentially a violation of the prior restraint doctrine). Safe harbor is an odd work-around to this fundamental concern, in my opinion (that is, forcing a company to censor or not and otherwise holding it criminally liable for the <i>all</i> content, which could technically be posted maliciously by an aggrieved anonymous user).')
