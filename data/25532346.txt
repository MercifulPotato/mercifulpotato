Item(by='bitL', descendants=None, kids=[25533201], score=None, time=1608850936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25531459, text='&gt; it&#x27;s very common for ethicists to have advanced degrees in the scientific&#x2F;technical area.<p>Maybe, I can&#x27;t tell, I am missing hard data on the distribution of degrees among ethicists. The one from Facebook whose lectures I attended had no technical degree but multiple degrees related to philosophy and sociology. One of the first lecture statements was that &quot;technology is inherently about power&quot;, which is obviously how people outside tech perceive us and what many SWEngs are naively missing as we tend to think it&#x27;s all about fun and self-realization (well, OK, it&#x27;s dystopian now after profit-sensing individuals invaded our field). So those people outside want to regulate us with &quot;ethics&quot;, i.e. creating power structures they rule and we need to consult for permissions.<p>&gt; sheet paranoia<p>Was this truly a line of thought you wanted me to follow in order to become unreasonable?')
