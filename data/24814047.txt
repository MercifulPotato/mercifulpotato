Item(by='Wowfunhappy', descendants=None, kids=[24814588], score=None, time=1602974742, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24813906, text='Yeah—if there&#x27;s one misgiving I have with the article, it&#x27;s that they never really address the question of &quot;who makes the rules?&quot; It sounds like one reason Germany and France have fewer problems is that everyone there is just... more responsible.<p>&gt; Two days before [France&#x27;s] national election, the Russians posted online thousands of emails from En Marche!, the party of Emmanuel Macron, who was running for president. France, like several other democracies, has a blackout law that bars news coverage of a campaign for the 24 hours before an election and on Election Day. But the emails were available several hours before the blackout began. They were fair game. Yet the French media did not cover them. Le Monde, a major French newspaper, explained that the hack had “the obvious purpose of undermining the integrity of the ballot.”<p>Can you <i>imagine</i> the American media completely ignoring a major leak because it had “the obvious purpose of undermining the integrity of the ballot&quot;? I know I can&#x27;t!<p>But also—that blackout law is an example of a measure that seems like utter common sense! Don&#x27;t allow sudden bombshells to go off right before voting starts, when there isn&#x27;t enough time to calm down and examine them reasonably. America should adopt something similar.<p>My overall takeaway from the article was that free speech can both protect <i>and</i> threaten democracies. Russia is certainly an example of what can go wrong when speech is restricted, but Hitler is an equally salient example of how misinformation can be used seize power. The harsh reality is that Democracy is <i>extremely</i> fragile, and faces threats from both sides!')
