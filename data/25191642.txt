What are we talking about, then? It&#x27;s a baseless claim, as empirical data shows.<p>&gt; the reason we have the state, courts, justice...<p>The reason we have those things is that we have to coexist with other people. There is no necessary relation between state and ethics, nor there should be.\nPolitics on a large scale is the result of interest groups with differing moral codes&#x2F;interests&#x2F;priorities pushing in various directions.<p>&gt; There are very good arguments against morality in general...<p>I&#x27;m not trying to argue morality does or doesn&#x27;t exist, it&#x27;s not a question I find personally interesting, I was just claiming the request for morality to be universally grounded is unreasonable, we seem to agree there. I don&#x27;t really have an objection to what you&#x27;re saying.<p>Mathematics is <i>very</i> different because it&#x27;s a formal language. One could view all mathematics as purely string manipulation.\nThere&#x27;s no requirement to agree on anything, not even the meaning of the symbols, except for a set of primitive concepts and a set of axioms.\nIn a formal language you have proper definitions and checkable (even <i>machine-</i>checkable) proofs, a privilege that natural language doesn&#x27;t enjoy.<p>&gt; but here are PDF links<p>Much appreciated, I&#x27;ll take a look.')
