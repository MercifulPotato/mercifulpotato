For drudge-work, of course that&#x27;s good. For some examples, showing that it can be automated shows that it IS drudge-work. But replacing a creative illustrator? That is not drudge-work, it is a fulfilling and enjoyable profession. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s clear that changing it to become a hobby (because it&#x27;s no longer viable as a profession) is &quot;a good thing fundamentally&quot;. I would need to hear further arguments on this.')
