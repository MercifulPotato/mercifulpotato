You&#x27;re not just sitting looking at a command line. The REPL is a conversation with running state, but the conversation doesn&#x27;t have to take place only through a single blinking terminal window. In proper REPL-driven development, the editor is  fully integrated with the running session, and you can evaluate either in an attached terminal session or through your editor. Or by attaching whatever other tools to the running session.')
