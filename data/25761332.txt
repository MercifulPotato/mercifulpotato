That was my point. We&#x27;ve been doing this for ages and only recently had to worry about actually deleting stuff.<p>This is why I&#x27;ve never advocated &quot;deleting&quot; Facebook accounts etc. If you &quot;delete&quot; it you&#x27;re just giving them another piece of information about you. Namely that you want your account to be deleted.<p>The GDPR has not yet been shown to have any teeth, so I assume nothing has really changed in this respect.<p>And, yes, holding users&#x27; data forever is normal. Storage cost has only decreased relative to the size of these databases. I&#x27;ve worked in places with customer data going back decades.')
