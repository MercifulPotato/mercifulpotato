It’s one of many such sites in the US.<p>The US manufactured triggers for nuclear weapons there, leaving portions contaminated for millennia. They did a major cleanup in the 90’s and built a nice park, but the contaminated core DoE “Legacy Site” has to be maintained and secured in perpetuity. One of the site’s responsibilities is to maintain a very elaborate groundwater contamination remediation system so that runoff doesn’t poison millions. Also, the hazardous waste from the cleanup has to be stored on site as it was legally&#x2F;practically impossible to transport it out of the state or to any other location in the state.<p>All of this works for now, but it requires the United States government and all of its successor states maintain this remediation infrastructure for the next few thousand years.')
