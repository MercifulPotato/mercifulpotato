This will make combustion vehicles more attractive.<p>If gas prices fall any lower due to demand, then production capacity will probably disappear permanently, leading to shortages and a huge, long-term rise in price.  Oil pumps aren&#x27;t like taps that can be shut off and powered back on demand.  They basically need to be operated continuously  because restarting them is pretty expensive.  And storing excess oil is also pretty expensive.<p>We also have to consider that low gas prices are due to volume.  Refinement is still costly, and if the volume of gas falls by a large amount, that refinement costs gets distributed among the remaining volume.  Refinement capacity is even more expensive to bring back online than pumps.<p>I predict gasoline production will death-spiral at some point.  Gas stations will be culled as prices spike and volumes drop.  I would expect this to happen in a relatively short timespan, over maybe 1-2 years for the bulk of it, then a long tail of persistent decline.')
