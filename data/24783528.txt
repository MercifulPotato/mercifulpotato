Item(by='abeppu', descendants=None, kids=[24784317], score=None, time=1602722916, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24782175, text='I&#x27;ve enjoyed all the posts in this series, but this is first time it&#x27;s I&#x27;ve &quot;empathized&quot; with some aspect of the problem solving.<p>I&#x27;ve taken a couple of stabs at writing a mini&#x2F;micro-kanren in a language which _isn&#x27;t_ a lisp, often following along closely with some paper from Hemann, Friedman and&#x2F;or Byrd -- and if the language _doesn&#x27;t_ have macros it really does get awkward. As mentioned at the PS, for a good long stretch, this post is pretty directly transcribing the &#x27;microkanren&#x27; paper, and without macros at some point Vidrun would have had to invent some of her own idioms.<p>The other trick to having the embedded kanren really work with the host language, which is swept a bit under the rug, is that `walk*` &#x2F; `walkr` in this post implicitly assumes that everything in your universe is a variable, an atomic value, or a cons. In that sense, it&#x27;s a little funny that (I think) her kanren can&#x27;t really solve &quot;inside&quot; of the structs that she asked to be provided.')
