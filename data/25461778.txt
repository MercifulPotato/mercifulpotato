If you leave a bad review on a genuinely-bad experience (for example the 3rd-party Apple stylus that I tried) - you&#x27;ll find that after a few days you get a drip-drab of offers of giftcards to take the review down, promising that the item&#x27;s been fixed.<p>The offers escalated each time, and went up to US$50.00. I still occasionally get an email about it. Each time it&#x27;s from a different email address, and each time it&#x27;s a different sad story.<p>I told Amazon, a helpful CSR offered me an email, I fwd&#x27;d it, and they took the item down. Of course it was re-posted a bit later from a &quot;different seller.&quot;')
