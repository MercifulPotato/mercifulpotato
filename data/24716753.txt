Monty opens a door at random, which just happens to be a goat. Calculate probability of winning if staying.&quot;<p>Both are conditional probability P(A|B) (that is, probability of A happening, under the assumption B has happened).<p><pre><code>   - A is probability of picking the correct door at the first try (or switching if you prefer)\n   - B is the probability that Monty picked a door with a goat\n</code></pre>\nP(A|B) is defined as: P(A|B) = P(A and B) &#x2F; P(B)<p>In both problems P(A) is 1&#x2F;3.<p>In Problem-1, P(B) is 1 because Monty <i>knows</i> and it&#x27;s not a random event and P(A and B) = P(A), so P(A|B) = P(A)*P(B)&#x2F;P(B) = P(A) = 1&#x2F;3.<p>In Problem-2, P(A) is 1&#x2F;3, P(B) is 2&#x2F;3, P(A and B) is 1&#x2F;3 (if you pick a car, Monty is guaranteed to pick a goat), so P(A|B) = 1&#x2F;3 &#x2F; 2&#x2F;3 = 1&#x2F;2.')
