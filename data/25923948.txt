Item(by='disabled', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611718728, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25919846, text='There is a substantial percent of the population whose yearly medical care costs exceed their income.<p>For example, about 7% of the world’s population collectively has some sort of a rare disease, which is theoretically treated with orphan drugs. There are also people who chronically live with cancer who end up living quite a long time. Diabetes, (type 1 or type 2) with or without complications, is quite expensive in the US.<p>I personally have 2 rare immune mediated neurological diseases affecting my peripheral nervous system. The only medication that has kept me in pharmaceutical remission is subcutaneous immunoglobulin (intravenous immunoglobulin did not work), and I have tried 10 different treatments plus combinations of them. When I was living in the US, my private commercial insurance paid, under contract (not the amount that was being billed which was much higher!), $100 per gram. In other words, they were paying $23,500&#x2F;month for my blood product or $282,000&#x2F;year.<p>In Europe, where I live now, the price goes for 40 Euro (about $50&#x2F;gram).<p>Anyways, you should watch this, “The World’s Most Expensive Drug” (which it no longer is), which is quite revealing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;0uYCw5EDX8U" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;0uYCw5EDX8U</a><p>Alexion (a pharma company) started the trend and now the have drugs that cost millions per year over, that are required over the course of a lifetime: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;health&#x2F;drug-prices-rare-diseases.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;health&#x2F;drug-prices-rare-d...</a><p>There is a good documentary on it (requires a Hulu subscription): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;23&#x2F;the-weekly&#x2F;rare-diseases-orphan-drugs.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;23&#x2F;the-weekly&#x2F;rare-diseases-...</a><p>Anyways, the prices of these drugs are an insult to the intelligence of a lot of scientists and (formal) engineers.<p>I also have type 1 diabetes, and because of my training in electrical engineering, I could tell by reading patents on analog insulin patents that a 10 mL bottle of insulin cost somewhere between $1-$10 to produce. Turns out that it costs between $3-$6 to produce. At its worse, in the US, it cost $350 per 10 mL vial for analog insulin.<p>Anyways, the best way of dealing with this situation is by having even the most disabled people working to offset these prices, along with having universal healthcare with price controls. Unfortunately worker protection against discrimination in the US is very poor and when your health benefits are tied to work then it just does not work. Patent law also needs to be reformed, and if the prices are obscene and unjustifiable, then they should be seized.')
