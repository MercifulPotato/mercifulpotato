I first noticed this when playing real time strategy games – I would always have a 2D mental model of where all my infrastructure was, my troops, various battles, etc. It was easy to keep track of, despite the complexity.<p>I suspect many (most) programmers also have a rich mental model of their codebase, instantiated by reading and jumping around these mostly linear streams of text (our brains &quot;fold&quot; linear code like amino-acid sequences fold into 3d protein shapes). Mapping between mind-space and editor-space takes a lot of work, and is the source of many many bugs.<p>Being able to map my higher dimensional space to a richer coding space – to group related functions and objects together, and maybe draw some boxes around them, or toggle various layers of meta-information (such as connections, code paths, etc.) would be amazing.<p>Please keep doing this.')
