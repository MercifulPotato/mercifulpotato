I know they currently have the most versatile&#x2F;best value headset in the Quest 2, but needing to have a FB account linked to it should be a deal-breaker for anyone who doesn&#x27;t already have an active FB account (and perhaps even those who do). It isn&#x27;t just an auth system shared by multiple products. It&#x27;s Facebook, and the ban-hammer can come down swiftly, especially if, like the author, you are just creating an account to link to your Quest. I&#x27;m also not confident, as of right now, that FB is gonna fix this in a meaningful way.')
