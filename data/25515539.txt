Clean, safe public areas, people who commit crimes are either rehabilitated or incarcerated, road maintenance, encourage housing policies or rules that are beneficial to lots of people not just people who own land already -- these are things individuals have little power over because its a governmental type job to do these things.<p>If you tax a bunch of people and use the taxes to essentially just pay for things that are not visible to the people that pay the taxes then you will be unhappy. So while you might say, is it important to subsidize poor people&#x27;s rent&#x27;s (which often is totally invisible to most people), or find a place for homeless people to go and keep the streets safe and clean and prosecute people who do smash and grabs on 20 cars in an afternoon, the answer is you have to do both, but you have to keep the people who pay the taxes informed of the benefits you are providing.')
