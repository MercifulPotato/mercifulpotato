The deciding factor for our family when buying a Mac or Windows 10 device for my wife’s small business was actually my need to upload iOS apps for review by apple.<p>I’m an after hours hobby developer, and use a windows desktop. It’s powerful and has all the tooling I require. And it supports all the games I want to play from the steam store.<p>So - I think apple will lose a <i>little</i> bit of business from people like me with this announcement, as I’m sure we would not have purchased a Mac  when we did only a few months ago.')
