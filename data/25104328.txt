The constitution, like all legal texts, contains contradictions between different principles. As logic students know, once you have contradictions in your principles, you can prove anything you want.<p>The role of a judge is to sort through these contradictions to decide which principles are more important than others, even though they are all mentioned in the constitution.<p>So I don&#x27;t see how there is an objective concept of &quot;originalist&quot;: you have to pick some principles over others. Which ones you pick are a lot more guided by your own ideology than by the words on paper.')
