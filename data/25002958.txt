Item(by='dheera', descendants=None, kids=[25003132], score=None, time=1604616632, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25002815, text='&gt; a small city with an incredibly wealthy population can&#x27;t figure out how to keep the tenderloin from being full of tents and open drug use?<p>The wealthy people avoid walking through the Tenderloin. They spend their time in the Battery and the Modernist. They have no incentive to fix the situation there. None. Zero.<p>This isn&#x27;t Europe where wealthy people enjoy a stroll downtown, and have some incentive to want to keep their downtown nice. The wealthy people in SF just go to Napa and take their stroll in a vineyard over there instead.<p>&gt; Or get some form of functioning public transit?<p>The wealthy people don&#x27;t use public transit, they just drive everywhere or Uber everywhere. Again, they have zero incentive.<p>To be clear, I <i>really</i> want these issues to be fixed, just stating the facts of the situation.')
