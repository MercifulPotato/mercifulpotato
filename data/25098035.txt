First computer has MS-DOS 5.  Which boots and gives a blinking cursor to &#x27;do something&#x27; with.  This often entailed editing mem.sys and various .bat files to get a game working.  Or the abstraction that was Word Perfect that was not WYSIWYG that content and layout are separate concepts, and yes, magazines usually had 10-50 pages of BASIC stuff to do &#x27;cool stuff&#x27; with.<p>From my observation, the change happened with Windows.  Not was was a GUI, things apart from batsock mainly &#x27;just worked&#x27; (except when they didn&#x27;t) and it was no longer necessary to be required to peer into the (albeit high level) bones of a computer.<p>And this was true before DOS, C64, Spectrum also offered somewhat hands-on experiences.<p>But... perhaps not so obviously in Windows-land, if I were giving a kid a computer I&#x27;d make sure it was Linux as the command line&#x27;s not far away, and encourage use of it to get an implicit understanding of what&#x27;s happening - again a somewhat higher level understanding than creating a RISC-V chip, but more-so than &#x27;right click on the desktop to change wallpaper&#x27; - use mkdir to create a directory, understand repositories and how everything&#x27;s a human-readable text file.  Basic stuff with GNU tools, then a little scripting, perhaps some Python.')
