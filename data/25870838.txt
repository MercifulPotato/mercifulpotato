It is free and open source, available with loads of supplementary material, here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hefferon.net&#x2F;source.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hefferon.net&#x2F;source.html</a><p>From a computational perspective, I&#x27;ve heard good things about Gilbert Strang&#x27;s book, although I haven&#x27;t read it personally. User superbcarrot linked to his MIT course materials, including video lectures.<p>One word of caution though: as a mathematics educator, I don&#x27;t endorse &quot;efficiency&quot; as a goal. When I have pursued this goal myself, I have generally regretted it, and decided in retrospect that I was largely wasting my time.<p>To really learn math you should: do a ton of exercises, come up with your own questions and try to answer them, be willing to explore blind alleys.<p>Good luck!')
