I never claimed otherwise. But it is a hassle worth fighting for and this is what I try to show when I am helping them getting started with something else.<p>&gt; If some people categorically don&#x27;t value other people who don&#x27;t use their preferred app, that totally weirds me out.<p>Who said anything about judging&#x2F;not valuing other people by their preferred app? I am not claiming exclusivity. I still have WhatsApp on my phone for contacts and groups \nwho are not close enough to me for me to ask them to use a different app.<p>The point I am trying to make is that if everyone (including privacy-sensitive, tech-savvy people) keep this apathy in regards to their digital hygiene, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and there is no way we will ever get out of this mess. I presume anyone on Hacker News can and know how to do better, and we should be the ones in the front lines fighting for more open systems instead of passively waiting for some magical benevolent entity to save us from Big Tech.')
