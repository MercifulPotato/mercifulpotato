Dictators sometimes get democratically chosen. The dictator chosen in Germany between WWI and WWII was also a symptom of a problem. You cannot simply deduce everything towards such one person; however you also cannot simply say he is executing the &quot;Will of the People&quot;. We&#x27;re not in direct democracies; we pick our leader for 4 years, and that leader (plus some others) have a lot of power during those. I used to say we rotate dictators we pick every 4 years, but back then I had a rather dystopian world-view.<p>As for G.W. &quot;you are either for us, or against us&quot; [1] Bush, people forgive and forget quickly. Though I&#x27;d argue he was just a vassal for Rummy, Cheney, et al. For an insight into Bush, watch the movie Vice from 2018. It centers around Dick Cheney, how he became Vice President. Bush successfully managed to get the hardcore Christians behind him, which I suppose was a natural path given the Lewinsky-Clinton scandal. Another good documentary of around that time is Adam Curtis&#x27; The Power Of Nightmares which you can find freely and legally on Archive.org.<p>[1] Bifurcation 101, very polarizing statement.')
