I&#x27;m thankful for the education I got here. No question.<p>On the other hand I already payed a lot of taxes. And my father retired few years ago and is treated really bad after he worked more then 20 years. Actually he is treated like he never worked at all. So that is what I mean regarding tax policy.<p>In my opinion you can&#x27;t say someone isn&#x27;t paying his fair share if he pay lets say 400k on a 10% rate. He is still contributing much more then the average and I think he should not be treated like a &quot;criminal&quot;.')
