It simply won&#x27;t last. Those sections that do (if it never has to be touched, it also didn&#x27;t last) are usually subpar. Especially with accumulating &quot;ship ship ship&quot; modes, costs, and competing via speed, it&#x27;ll only get worse.<p>Most time spent cleaning up code and improving architecture is time wasted. The startup will fail, the startup will get bought and shutdown, the project will get scrapped, the service will no longer be used, etc. What little survives will be in a state of constant turnover, one that leads to the same junk.<p>Any optimizations&#x2F;streamlining&#x2F;elegance would be to address near-term usability issues. That is, the code is unwieldy to adjust each day and so needs to be reworked. Otherwise, it&#x27;s wasted effort. Further, if it will linger, then would be the time to clean and file away. On the other hand, companies may still fear refactoring at that time as it risks introducing bugs.<p>Most code sections that linger are not foreseen as being worthy. By then, it&#x27;s too late. Other sections never matter, as they end up untouched.')
