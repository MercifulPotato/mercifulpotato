Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604086866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24940293, text='&gt; Surely you own money?<p>Money as a physical item is tangible, money as a ledger entry has more complicated rules of “ownership”. For example, you do not actually own the money in tour bank account, you have a claim on the assets of your bank equal to the amount on the ledger. Other forms of ledger money are equally bizarre in the limit. Suppose you use a weak address with bitcoin and someone transfers “your” bitcoin to a different account. Its not clear that they committed a crime and there is no recourse for the former “owner.” Similar cases abound with ETH.')
