There seem to be many different definitions depending on where I google.<p>Reading this article, I find it hard not to focus solely on my own belief that all carbohydrates, and sucrose&#x2F;fructose&#x2F;glucose in particular are extremely addictive. This article even compares, using dopamine, smoking with &quot;temptation for food.&quot; I&#x27;m fairly sure that anytime someone is &quot;tempted for food&quot;, that there are carbohydrates involved, but obviously it&#x27;s hard to know without that original formal definition.')
