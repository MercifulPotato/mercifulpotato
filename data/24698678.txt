UDIMM is still ~$3 &#x2F;GB, which is about the same in 2010 &#x2F; 2011. i.e Despite what you may heard about DRAM price collapse in 2019, the price <i>floor</i> of DRAM has been pretty much the same over the past 10 years.<p>Every other silicon has gotten cheaper, NAND, ICs, just not DRAM. And yet our need for DRAM is forever increasing. From In-Memory Datastore on Servers to Mobile Phones with Camera shooting rapid 4K images.<p>Compared to NAND, or Foundry like TSMC, there are clear roadmaps where cost is heading, and what cost reduction we could expect in the next 5 years, along with other outlook. There is nothing of sort in DRAM. At least I dont see anything to suggest we could see $2&#x2F;GB DRAM, if not even lower. I dont see how EUV is going help either, there won&#x27;t even be enough EUV TwinScan machines going around for Foundries in the next 3 years, let alone NAND and DRAM.<p>The only good news is the low &#x2F; normal capacity ECC DRAM has finally fallen to ~$5&#x2F;GB. ( They used to be $10-20&#x2F; GB ).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;secureservercdn.net&#x2F;166.62.107.55&#x2F;ff6.d53.myftpupload.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;2019-11-20-DRAM-Spot-2012-19.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;secureservercdn.net&#x2F;166.62.107.55&#x2F;ff6.d53.myftpuploa...</a>')
