They pay, you do it, they are happy.<p>And then there are folks who have their own problems - they may be disorganized? Have internal conflicts? Have other financial issues. So they come in saying - hey give us a break on cost. you do. And then you are in for it, because they can&#x27;t agree internally, complain about everything.<p>This EU situation reminds me of that. Instead of saying how can we help increase production its endless blaming etc. Isn&#x27;t the company an EU company? Why wouldn&#x27;t they make wht they can?')
