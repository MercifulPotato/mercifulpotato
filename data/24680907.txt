I would expect a huge mass of simple RNA based life forms simpler than prokaryotes.</i><p>This is an interesting perspective.<p>Following this line of reasoning, prokaryotes must be close to the simplest unit that can self-replicate and grow to fill the planet. The simpler “proto-life” forms before that built up complex molecules by chance but could never quite achieve a replicative cycle.<p>Perhaps the closest to <i>a huge mass of simple RNA based life forms</i> that still exist today are viruses.')
