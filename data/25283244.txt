This flexibility is off putting to some, but it allows the language to be useful no matter what your skill level or preferences are.<p>Another thing that&#x27;s easy with PHP is debugging. You don&#x27;t have to worry about compiling code or accidentally taking down your entire server (most of the time) if you encounter a critical error. If one of your PHP pages runs into an issue you can enable debugging with a line of code, make your fix then hit the refresh to see if it&#x27;s working.<p>I learnt to code writing PHP when I was 16 years old. Me and my friend had an idea for a startup but neither of knew how to program beyond a little bit of ActionScript. We were good with computers, but if we decided to use Java I&#x27;m certain the project would have never have gotten off the ground because of the steep learning curve.<p>PHP allowed us to skill up with the language and enabled us to move fast despite not really knowing what we were doing. Writing PHP in the ICT room at lunch with my friend was some of the best memories I have of school... I doubt I&#x27;d be doing this today if it wasn&#x27;t for how much fun I had learning and building stuff with PHP when I was younger.')
