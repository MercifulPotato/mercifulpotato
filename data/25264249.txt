I also measured a similarly old but low-end Lenovo laptop I had around and and some 2019 HP business laptop and both were close to 7mm.<p>But the OP3 is also not the thinnest device these days. I know both Samsung and Apple have made flagship devices 6.9mm thick and their cameras were excellent. I&#x27;ve read about 5mm phones as well, but I don&#x27;t know a thing about their cameras (I&#x27;d imagine still better than most laptops though).<p>And besides, even if there was no way to fit a decent camera in 6mm,  I&#x27;m certain most business users couldn&#x27;t care less about a an extra mm of thickness or even a small bump on the back of the screen if it meant that they&#x27;d be getting actually usable video out of their absurdly expensive laptops.')
