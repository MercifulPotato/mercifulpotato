A lot of the work being done by the committees is fixing Stroustrup&#x27;s mistakes.<p>Consider horrors such as this. In the following statement what are foo and bar?<p><pre><code>   int x = foo(2) + bar(3);\n</code></pre>\nMost people will say foo and bar are functions and that&#x27;s a reasonable guess. Unless you are talking about C++. In C++ foo and bar could be functions but could also lots of other things. For example it could be the equivalent of the statement below:<p><pre><code>   int x = (foo)2 + (bar)3;\n</code></pre>\nIn other words type casting can be written as (foo)2 or as foo(2). Just to make it harder to understand what is going on. As another example consider implicit type conversions:<p><pre><code>   Foo b = c + 3;\n</code></pre>\nIf 3 is not compatible with whatever type c is then C++ checks if there is a constructor that accepts an int parameter, and it automatically calls the constructor to convert 3 to the appropriate type.<p>Many of these craziness is being addressed by standards committees. C++ as designed by Stroustrup is a horrible language. Just look at his C++ book. It is huge and heavy and in fact Stroustrup takes pride in how big and complex the language is. C is an awesome language. C++ is horrible.')
