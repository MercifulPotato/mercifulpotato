I&#x27;ve been using custom email aliases for the better part of the last decade (I&#x27;m running my own mail server) but it never occurred to me that this could be a profitable business.<p>My main pain point with my current setup is the following: It takes a few minutes to set up a new email alias. I therefore wonder: How long does it take with your service? Would your users maybe appreciate an app (a super simple one) for Android&#x2F;iOS that allows them to create a new alias within seconds?')
