I had a troll account with over 1500 followers that got nuked in I think 2017 after I posted a screenshot of the twitter stock price and tagged Jack Dorsey, I&#x27;d got a couple of suspensions before that for just being a dickhead but I was really surprised that was what got the permanent ban. Honestly, it was good thing in the end, fewer distractions and the super secret cabal chats I was in I&#x27;d added them on other platforms anyway.<p>The thing I saw even then was selective enforcement, I&#x27;d get death threats all the time from various tough guys over posts where I&#x27;d mocked them for being socialists or whatever, which I&#x27;d report, they&#x27;d never get banned. I didn&#x27;t care that much because it&#x27;s the internet and I wasn&#x27;t posting under my real name, what were they going to do. But then I&#x27;d see people getting banned for telling others threatening them that they were strapped and it wasn&#x27;t a good idea to make those threats. There&#x27;s a hierarchy on Twitter when it comes to following the rules, and if you draw the ire of the people in the protected upper echelons you&#x27;ll be threatened and bullied without any recourse.')
