But as a subtler concern, I do wonder if (some) violent games help to cultivate a sense of general nihilism and lack of value. I work with teens and maybe 15% of them have this sense of &quot;blankness&quot; in the spot where a sense of value&#x2F;meaning&#x2F;morality should be. (Not even in the classic 90&#x27;s sense of &quot;teen apathy&quot; -- more like they&#x27;ve never even been notified that anything can mean anything.)<p>I do wonder if spending 40% of your waking hours playing simulators where you dice people up for no good reason, might contribute a little to that attitude. Especially the kids that already aren&#x27;t being socialized particularly well (abusive parents that barely talk to them, etc.)<p>Hell, I&#x27;d even be alright if it were games that have loads of violence but with a sense of purpose (e.g., the Half-Life series, or many Bethesda games). The truly aimless violence is what kinda worries me.')
