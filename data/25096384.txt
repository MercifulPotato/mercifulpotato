Not chemical. Medicinal treatment aids validation of the diagnosis: if stimulants work well and don’t produce the kinds of side effects that people with “normal” brains experience, it can be inferred that the chemical imbalance exists and can be addressed by further treatment.<p>After my initial diagnosis, my first doctor who treated me said that if I’m being treated appropriately I should be able to sleep while the stimulants are active. Not only <i>could</i> I sleep, when I first started meds, I started taking daytime naps for the first time in my adult life. Even “taking” is an understatement. About an hour after the stimulant (at this time it was ritalin) kicked in, I would zonk so hard that I needed to sleep for anything between 15 minutes and an hour.')
