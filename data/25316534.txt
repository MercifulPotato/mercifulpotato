I think that makes sense since the author of the post can be clicked on right below that.<p>2) I agree with this that it&#x27;d be nice to have a way to adjust the screen space and make just the chat focused on desktop, and perhaps a split screen mode on mobile. I think it&#x27;s a good idea and will have to explore building that. One thing I&#x27;m not sure of is where&#x2F;how to display the content of the post in a chat-centric desktop mode? I was thinking either horizontal strip along top of the chat, or maybe a minimized box floating top-right of the chat (like picture-in-picture style)?<p>Thanks again, it&#x27;s very helpful!')
