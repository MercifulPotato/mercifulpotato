I&#x27;ve got a 5s recording some bird feeders in my yard, for example. Decent camera for filming during the day. Unlike my DSLR, it&#x27;s not artificially constrained to only recording 15 minutes at time. It&#x27;s tiny, and if I have it near an outlet I can even power it so I don&#x27;t need to worry about recharging it. It also does slow-mo if you don&#x27;t mind going down to 720p. I think an iPhone 6 can do slow-mo at 1080p.')
