I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions you may have if anything doesn&#x27;t make sense or confuses you. If you felt overwhelmed by everything I said, you could also just read it slower - if you even bothered to read it before responding. It sounds like you don&#x27;t put much effort into honest conversation though. I added some spacing to my previous comment, hope that helps you be less overwhelmed.')
