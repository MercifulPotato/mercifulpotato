How you choose to view and work with YAML is a choice that doesn&#x27;t need to have any impact on what you share with others and how they choose to view and work with it.<p>While I&#x27;m not usually fond of “you&#x27;re holding it wrong” arguments, that&#x27;s pretty much the proper response to complaints about YAML’s indentation sensitivity, since you can work with YAML in a style which isn&#x27;t indentation sensitive without anyone you share data with seeing anything different.')
