There are also dozens of no-name bots (often SEO tools like ahrefs, semrush, etc.) that can sometimes cause troubles.<p>For me it was a problem of having lots of pages, and having a high cost per request (due to the type of website it was).<p>For other websites, it is not necessarily about the volume of traffic from bots, but the risk of web scrapers getting their proprietary data. They&#x27;re fine with Google scraping their info because that&#x27;s where their traffic comes from. They&#x27;re not okay with some random bot scraping them because it could be taking their content and republishing it, or scraping user profile data, or using it for some nefarious&#x2F;competitive purpose.')
