If I go to a widely publicized open forum and say: &quot;Let&#x27;s go and squeeze the shorts so that they go bankrupt, oh and here&#x27;s a picture of me doing just that.&quot; that&#x27;s market manipulation and in many corners of the world, that&#x27;s illegal. As in, you go to jail illegal. If I short a stock because I genuinely believe it&#x27;s overpriced, that&#x27;s perfectly legal.<p>Beyond this, I&#x27;m sure there are many funds who try and successfully manipulate the markets, but they try to do it quietly. To do in blatantly in the open is basically rubbing it in the regulators face and giving them no choice but to crack down.<p>Nobody would notice a bunch of idiots doing this quietly. A 1 million strong mob hivemind will get noticed and will leave no choice for regulators but to come down hard on them.<p>This is not rocket science. It&#x27;s the same sort of crowd who planned to storm the capitol, meticulously documented the evidence, posted it online (including confirmation of identity through driving licenses) and then went ahead and did the deed. They basically handed all the evidence to the feds on a silver platter.')
