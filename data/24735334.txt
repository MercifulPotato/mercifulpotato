If they send me a 2FA error (and I&#x27;ve got a semi-sophisticated phishing operation) fakegoogle will show you a an input field for that 6 digit code (just like real google). Then I&#x27;ve got a few seconds to send that to $site as well. It&#x27;s a tighter timing window, but it&#x27;s likely at this point that I&#x27;m into your account.<p>This sort of attack isn&#x27;t possible with a hardware key, since it only works on the original domain (which presumably I don&#x27;t control).<p>Does that make sense?')
