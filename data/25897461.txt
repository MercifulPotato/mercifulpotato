I have a team of 3 engineers reporting to me. All three of them are very good engineers and enjoy their freedom while working for me.<p>The issue I have is the following: Each of them have their own tech stack when they build services. Python, NodeJS and Java. Now that I am the manager, I want them to move to a unified code base. What is the best way to start this conversation? Ideally, I want all of them to have a python code base so that other teams can easily onboard.')
