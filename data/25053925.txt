But over time corporate offices destroyed me. I sought help for depression, and my ADHD. But no one suggested burnout.<p>I had to have a fully nervous breakdown and six months off work to even work out what was going on.<p>It&#x27;s taken a full two years of recovery, and now I guard my mental health like the crown jewels!<p>But I&#x27;ll never be the same again. I&#x27;ll never fully commit to another company, manager, workplace or team again.<p>I choose to validate myself outside of what makes me money, and choose my friends and acquaintances carefully. I don&#x27;t assume people I work with are my &#x27;friends&#x27;, and I certainly am very careful who I trust! (which is never anyone at work!)')
