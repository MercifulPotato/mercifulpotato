Rackspace fits this bill for me although I haven&#x27;t been their customer for close to 10 years due to how badly they&#x27;ve burnt me.<p>On the contrary, free-tier Linode support has always been incredibly technically competent and has never let me down for the 10+ years I&#x27;ve been with them. If anyone from Linode is reading this - you guys are awesome, and your support staff is amazing. I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about them as they&#x27;ve done so much to support me for a solid decade!<p>All I&#x27;m saying is paying for support vs. not paying doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll have any more technically competent help in my real-world experience. It just means &quot;you&#x27;re paying for support&quot; on paper, and typically is just an up-sell from legacy hosting providers like Rackspace or GoDaddy. Free from Linode is 100X paid from Rackspace - all depends on the company.')
