I&#x27;m old enough to see nuance. I do not assert that these are the only causes. I only assert that they are the primary causes most of the time.<p>As a side note, there&#x27;s something deeply wrong if CI takes 30 minutes. This usually indicates that all tests are re-run every time, which is something you can easily avoid by e.g. using a modern build system such as Bazel, which will only re-run the affected subset of tests when something changes, because it is able to track all changes to the transitive closure, including data.<p>Also 80 people on a team sounds like a nightmare. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a monolithic team this large in my 25 years in the industry, some of which was spent at Microsoft, of all places. The best size is that of a large family - 5-7 engineers. That way communication overhead does not dominate, and you can still do very sophisticated and substantial things. Beyond this magic number the productivity growth is usually negative.')
