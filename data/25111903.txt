The way warp speed works is that the federal government funds the vaccine even if it doesn’t work.  This allows the drug maker to work faster because they don’t have to worry about losing billions of dollars on a vaccine that does nothing.  The federal government eats the risk.<p>It’s was a really good strategy for the vaccine development and I think the federal team deserves a lot of credit for where we are with the vaccines.')
