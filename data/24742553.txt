I spent several hours on the phone with u-haul trying to get them to reverse it. Ultimately they said the agreed I was triple charged but they couldn&#x27;t reverse it and I had to contact my bank<p>It took EIGHT MONTHS and SEVEN phone calls with my bank to get them to charge back. And haul fought me every step of the process when they&#x27;re the ones that told me to go to my bank. U-haul went as far as to straight up lie to my bank. I&#x27;m surprised they didn&#x27;t forge documents with all the shit they were trying')
