From MW:<p><pre><code>    Definition of deter\n\n    transitive verb\n    1 : to turn aside, discourage, or prevent from acting\n      she would not be deterred by threats\n    2 : inhibit\n      painting to deter rust\n</code></pre>\nI have also seen &quot;crime&quot; and &quot;war&quot; given in examples of sense 2.  To &quot;deter the language&quot;, in sense 2, would be to deter speakers from using the language.  You can sort of unify the two senses by treating &quot;rust&quot; or &quot;war&quot; or &quot;crime&quot; as willful entities - but in that case I don&#x27;t see a reason you couldn&#x27;t do the same for a language.<p>Do you actually fail to understand what pvaldes was trying to communicate?')
