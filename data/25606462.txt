Managers have so much control over information, narratives, and access to decision makers they control perception so most organizations are useless at properly evaluating their work.<p>I&#x27;ve seen managers ride out perpetually failing projects that haven&#x27;t made meaningful progress in years, team &#x27;decisions&#x27; that are reliably and demonstrably bad, services that cost a fortune to run and have a slew of problems and unhappy customers, and rock-bottom scores in anonymous surveys.  None of this matters.  Essentially your job as a manager is to take credit, dodge accountability, and expand your empire(headcount) as to maneuver yourself towards the better high-visibility projects.   Just like politicians, unless they&#x27;re overtly bad(and even then) it&#x27;s difficult to separate them from the sprawling cybernetic organism so you just kind of shrug.  Maybe a team&#x27;s success is because of the manager, maybe it is in spite of them or vice versa - no way to know.')
