It deletes selected objects, or without selection letters or objects to the left of the cursor. In Terminal, it sends ASCII-127 (DEL), not ASCII-8 (BS), just like ancient DEC terminals.<p>Most PC vendors labelled the key in that position &quot;backspace&quot;. Without selection it deletes letters or objects to the left of the cursor, and with selected objects it may or may not delete them. In most Windows and Linux terminals, it sends ASCII-127 (DEL), not ASCII-8 (BS).<p>Given all of this, it not at all obvious to me that the key should really be named &quot;backspace&quot; rather than &quot;delete&quot;.')
