But there are essentially no complex physical systems that we can put such computational bounds on. Since &quot;harm&quot; comes in some form of physical actuation, I would argue that we can only ever get to something like the sort of confidence we can have that a particular manufactured part would succeed under load. The map is not the territory, and any computation that does not include computing the whole universe is necessarily but a map.')
