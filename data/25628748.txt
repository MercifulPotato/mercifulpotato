Item(by='tobiaslins', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1609747281, title='Notion as CMS is not always a good choice', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='We at Splitbee created an OSS library called react-notion [1] that helps you rendering Notion content in your React app.<p>This has many benefits such as the simplicity of the Notion Editor, simple layouts and ease of use.<p>While this works out for smaller blogs and content pieces across the website, it also has some drawbacks.<p>* No proper versioning&#x2F;publishing feature. Depending on the implementation, the changes are visible on the website immediately or after the next deployment.\n* No i18n support. You would need to write content on 2 or more pages and link them somehow.\n* Can break at any time because we use Notion&#x27;s Private API. (ing forward for the Public API)<p>We initially built our blog [2] &amp; documentation [3] with react-notion but switched away with the Documentation to Sanity. We simply needed the versioning and publishing features.<p>Nevertheless, react-notion can be a great way for websites to display rich text content. The implementation is easy and it looks sleek out of the box.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;splitbee&#x2F;react-notion\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;splitbee.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;notion-as-cms-using-nextjs\n[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;splitbee.io&#x2F;docs')
