Disadvantage is that the size picked affects not only the coast lengths, but also relative differences and even rankings.<p>It also means scaling an area by a factor of N (typically) won’t scale its boundary length by N. That’s counterintuitive. That brings us to option 2: vary yardstick length with the size of the object being measured. Question then is: how exactly?<p>Alternatively, estimate the fractal dimension (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fractal_dimension" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fractal_dimension</a>) of the area and use that as the measure of coast length&#x2F;area.')
