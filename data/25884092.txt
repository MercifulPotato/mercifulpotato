The very language used in patents is latin-like. Back in the days of Rome, the written language was deliberately built to enable the business of scribes, and was full of tenses, declensions etc. Write a letter = hire a scribe. Read a letter = the same. Unles you were educated. Hard to start a recolution, spread the word etc. This did not fade away until the 19th century in many languages.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Latin_grammar" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Latin_grammar</a>\nAs some old Latin student at Eton wrote:-\nLatin&#x27;s a dead language,\nlying in the dust,\nfirst it killed the Romans,\nnow it&#x27;s killing us.<p>In a similar way patent speak has become a language for an elite. This has made it very hard to hire capable examiners at the wages they offer. An examiner needs to be capable in both patent-speak and whatever technology is in the patent application.\nMost people capable in tech disciplines can get far better work elsewhere.\nSo they need to reform the patent-speak into the common language of whatever country - making sure that correct terms are used. This would expand the examiner pool enormously.')
