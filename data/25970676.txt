I think the best part of FreePascal are the &quot;outputs&quot;. I will always choose native GUI easily multi-platform programs over framework-dependent bytecode Windows-biased programs. It&#x27;s also pleasant that you don&#x27;t have to spend hours figuring out how to compile popular GUI framework X for C&#x2F;C++ while Lazarus&#x2F;Delphi just works out of the box. For the latter, the de facto GUI framework feels more in &quot;harmony&quot; with the language&#x2F;compiler toolchain.<p>However, as a language, Pascal is a bit of a pain. The parts that frustrate me the most, are the necessity of editing code across separate locations when introducing a new variable&#x2F;function and the lack of smaller scopes beyond function scope. Brian W. Kernighan&#x27;s &quot;Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language&quot; (1981) lists some of these frustrating parts, although there are many improvements since then.<p>I think more recent pascal compilers now support declarations elsewhere aside the interface section or beginning of a function. But more recent also means less support for older systems, which is part of what I like about Pascal.<p>And if my program doesn&#x27;t need a GUI, I feel that C&#x2F;C++ is far more productive for multi-platform-compilable native programs.')
