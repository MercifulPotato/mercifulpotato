I&#x27;ve been doing serious, but slow-paced, Japanese studying for the last few years (I&#x27;ve got my N3 certificate; know ~1500 kanji; etc.) but media consumption still feels like a chore.<p>In particular:<p>* Most anime leaves me behind. If English subtitles are on, ~80% of the time I can say &quot;oh yeah, that does match what they said&quot;. If Japanese subtitles are on, I can&#x27;t read fast enough. If no subtitles are on, I get confused when sentences get long, involve lots of proper nouns, or just too much unfamiliar vocabulary.<p>* Reading feels like a chore. I have to look up a word every sentence or three, and longer sentences can get me twisted up on the grammar, wherein I resort to Google-translating the whole sentence or reading the corresponding English translation if available. So it feels like just a very roundabout way of reading the material. I try to mitigate this by adding the words to an SRS deck, but that just increases the feeling of it being a chore.<p>Any tips from your experience would be much appreciated.')
