If all you want is someone to implement a spec, they&#x27;ll do the job just as good or better than any American.  Why would you pay $100K&#x2F;year?<p>Most markets bifurcate into a commoditized low-end that makes all the volume and a differentiated high-end that makes all the profits.  Think Android&#x2F;iPhone, Windows&#x2F;Mac, TSMC&#x2F;Intel, Volkswagon&#x2F;Porsche, etc.  The commodity low-end programmer isn&#x27;t the guy in Missouri, it&#x27;s the guy in Minsk or Bangkok.  You&#x27;re either the one making up the specs (which will probably still be in Silicon Valley, because that requires communication and trust more than coding ability), or the one implementing the specs (which can be anywhere, with commensurate wages).')
