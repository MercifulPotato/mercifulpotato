I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to work somewhere with good storage, power for charging¹, great security for some time and it really changes the dynamic for cycling to work.<p>Re: showers at work.  I&#x27;ve been wondering what is going to happen to cycling to the office once people start going back en masse.<p>For example, the shower unit at our office has only been available to people who work in the clean room environment since March, and I just can&#x27;t see how we go back to common use in the foreseeable future.<p>And frankly, if people start going back to full-time without showers I&#x27;d probably like to see cycling use drop(or at least for people like me who tend to arrive lycra&#x27;d up on a road bike).<p>¹ Ridiculously that seems to include lights, computers, Garmin Varia, gears, etc at this point.')
