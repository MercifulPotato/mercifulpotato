The set of vowels is finished for a given language but its size can change between languages and `char` will always be less than 256 (or some other fixed value).<p>Since isVowel is a closure it&#x27;s not crazy to consider the array as part of the input.<p>You say &quot;the only useful interpretation would be to consider this function O(1)&quot; but it is possible to read this as an example and that n relates to the size of the array and in that case saying it is O(n) makes sense.<p>Since this is not a formal discussion of complexity and n has not been defined, I think it&#x27;s fairer to interpret the post in a way where it makes sense .')
