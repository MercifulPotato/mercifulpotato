I had multiple people get into arguments with me on the MUFON group about it&#x27;s origins. I believe it was random space junk, immediately a man began insisting it was an &quot;ion propulsion&quot; alien ship crashing after it had been shot, kept insisting that only that bluish glow could be create by an ET exotic technology star drive, I quickly pointed out more than a dozen materials that create a blue flame when they burn at which point he kept arguing with me and got quite hostile insisting it&#x27;s a downed alien craft. I think one even claimed they communicated with the &#x27;crew of the ship&#x27;.<p>People... believe what they want to.')
