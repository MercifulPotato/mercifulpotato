In a dose-dependent manner, (external) time ticks slower and slower.<p>The classic joke is &quot;Two friends are tripping together, one puts on music, and they listen. At the end, one says to the other <i>&#x27;Hey that was great, what album was that?&#x27;</i> To which the other replies <i>&#x27;Huh? That was just the first song.&#x27;</i>.<p>It&#x27;s possible to experience time dilation so intense on psychedelics that external progression of time halts completely and you&#x27;re sort of &quot;suspended&quot; in a moment in time. (I know it sounds ridiculous and completely impossible)<p>So I&#x27;d be really interested to see research on how it is that psychedelics impact time perception and what the brain activity looks like.')
