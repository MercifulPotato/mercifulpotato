The fact she wants to live inside seems something more akin to stockholm syndrome or apathy. I think the difference is when it is humans we consider this kind of thing to be more Hukley-esk. My cat doesn&#x27;t really have free will if I make her think she can go outside but I just give her that impression when she doesn&#x27;t want to (good tactic to keep them from running out all the time btw. But why it is a good tactic is kinda the heart of this discussion).')
