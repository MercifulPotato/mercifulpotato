For example right now if you need food support in the US you can apply for food stamps (SNAP) but the problem is that food stamps can only be used for food and so you create a dependency on that particular program with the person needing food support. But if you give them cash you then allow the person to decide for themselves what mix of things they spend that on according to their specific needs and can probably do away with most of the specific programs that only deal with a specific benefit that may not be in the right proportion to other benefits depending on need.')
