Item(by='TheDong', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606156109, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25189745, text='&gt; Well you don&#x27;t have to scrape it<p>Certificate logs from the certificate transparency project [0] are already public knowledge and shared freely.<p>The only thing lets encrypt gets in addition to what&#x27;s in those logs and publicly discoverable is what challenge you chose (dns or tls), and what email you&#x27;re using.<p>&gt; So yes I personally welcome another CA<p>More CAs generally means more chance that one CA loses a private key or has a vulnerability. Tragically, since browsers trust all CAs for all websites, if the new CA has an issue, people can forge TLS certs for my website even though I have no intention of ever using that new CA.<p>In a very real way, having an excess of CAs is bad for the security of the entire internet. Letting anyone become a trusted CA would be an unequivocal disaster, so clearly more CAs isn&#x27;t always good.<p>I do think there&#x27;s a balance, where we should have several viable CAs that we trust to be secure, but not 100s of them, just 10s. We already trust a ton more roots than that, so right now I see a new CA as being detrimental to security overall.<p>That all being said, I&#x27;m pretty sure this CA is using an existing trusted root and processes, so since it doesn&#x27;t require cross-signing in a new root, it&#x27;s less big of a deal.<p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.certificate-transparency.org&#x2F;how-ct-works" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.certificate-transparency.org&#x2F;how-ct-works</a>')
