Apps still use the filesystem=host&#x2F;home instead of intended portals bypassing the sandbox.<p>2. Common runtimes have un patched security issues.<p>Re 1) This is a backwards compatibility option until app developers start explicitly coding for flatpak compatibility. Given the money  involved (~0) I can understand why it&#x27;s taking some time. As a user one can address this with flatseal[1].<p>RE 2) This is more a problem of the ecosystem rather than a problem of the people developing flatpak. And it&#x27;s not like this problem is not often encountered in other ecosystems. This just shows that the ecosystem is still in early stages.
