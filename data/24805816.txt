Item(by='reggieband', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602889163, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24805691, text='&gt; If you dismiss these liability rules you are effectively removing everything from chatrooms to comment sections from the internet, effectively making the internet into a snailmail&#x2F;bulletin board service.<p>Yes, I am pondering exactly this. How much of the Internet do I consider valuable that would be lost? I mean, lost in the sense it would be completely irreplaceable without Section 230 protection. To be fair to my position, the vacuum of unmoderated spaces would be filled one way or another.<p>Maybe people are surprised by such a position, but I don&#x27;t actually see enough inherent value in unmoderated comment sections on private blogs or even all of the 1990&#x27;s era phpbb forums to worry about their loss. In fact, when I consider the negative effects of the massive companies hiding behind Section 230 they really seem to heavily outweigh whatever positive effect comments on my personal blog could ever bring.<p>It seems these things keep coming up: public comments on personal blogs and anonymous forums. I want people to deeply think about whether or not these things are really valuable and even more so whether or not the are irreplaceable without Section 230.')
