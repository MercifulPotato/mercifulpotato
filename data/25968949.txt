The reason we why we&#x27;ve so far opted to not include documentation online (we used to have it online) was because it would drift from different versions people were using. Lots of times people would see a feature or something in the manual, and wonder why it didn&#x27;t work on their own installation!<p>If you have any suggestions as to how to remedy this, or if you think the trade-off is not worth it, we are all ears!')
