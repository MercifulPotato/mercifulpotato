Obviously leaving out the ones that are literally written to the DOM, can you give some more examples of React props (like &#x27;children&#x27;) that are helpful to think about in this way?<p>I wrote vanilla JS for years, then Backbone, then Angular, and now React.  I am the counterexample to your second sentence.  My &quot;intuitive understanding&quot; is that props are actually keys in a plain-ol&#x27; JS function argument, and I&#x27;m sure that you&#x27;re handicapping yourself if you&#x27;re going out of your way to map React concepts to DOM concepts.  This is why people find hooks so confusing and weird, because they&#x27;re trying so hard to map it to some other concept.  See the many comments about JSX in this thread - the more you try force React ideas into your preconceptions about web dev, the worse time you&#x27;ll have.')
