Jails and chroots are a form of containerization and have existed for a long time. Sun debuted containers (with Zones branding) as we think of them today long before Google took interest, and still years before Docker came to the forefront.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve seen Docker be a disaster over and over again. The fact that they have a good sales pitch only makes it worse because more people get stuck with a bad technology.<p>&gt; Eliminating Docker from the equation seems to me to be an unmitigated Good Thing.<p>Now this I agree with, Docker is a wreck. Poor design, bad tooling, and often downright hostile to the needs of their users. Docker is the Myspace of infra tooling and the sooner they croak, the better.')
