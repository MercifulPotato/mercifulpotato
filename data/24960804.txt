The instruction set is so nutty that trying to implement them all directly in hardware is a non-starter.<p>The x86 front end breaks down big instructions into smaller RISC-like micro-ops and then fuses&#x2F;re-orders&#x2F;optimizes&#x2F;etc and runs those instead. There’s pros and cons, the con being sheer complexity and power budget, the pros are that it’s an abstraction so the microarchitecture can change completely without recompiling your code —- and you get CPU specific optimizations too. The CPU is basically emulating x86.<p>You could in theory build an x86 CPU with a RISC-V core behind that decoder.')
