In case your kids miss out and feel jealous? Surely if yours kids have only an average intelligence, you&#x27;ll still be happy for them despite the fact that they probably can&#x27;t achieve as much success as their most successful peers in any intellectual field.<p>Your attitude sounds like my Dad&#x27;s attitude of being sad that my generation doesn&#x27;t believe in God anymore or his own Dad&#x27;s unhappiness at him for not being a proper loyal soldier in the Navy. It&#x27;s tempting to believe that our own generation has the ultimate peak of right behavior and any change is for the worse, but it&#x27;s also arrogant and repeatedly proven to be wrong.')
