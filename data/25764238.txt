And that, in turns, informs a significant number of properties of the tree you&#x27;ll be using as well as the operations to perform. The stdlib providing &quot;a basic tree&quot; and essentially telling users to get bent would be worse than useless, it would be actively insulting.<p>Even for the humble &quot;linked list&quot; there are half a dozen possibilities: singly linked? Immutable? Doubly-linked? Circular? Array-of-nodes?')
