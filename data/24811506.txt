I ended up dual-booting for AutoCAD on my laptop. It&#x27;s apparently at an age where AutoCAD still works well, but trackpad drivers don&#x27;t work correctly in Windows. Because it&#x27;s only used for AutoCAD though, I&#x27;ll only ever be using a mouse, rendering the problem (mostly) moot.<p>This isn&#x27;t an issue with Ubuntu, as everything from the trackpad, to the funky keyboard keys, just works.')
