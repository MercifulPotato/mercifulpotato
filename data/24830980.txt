You&#x27;ll get more reach in the former case, but have much less control. For that matter, it&#x27;s similar to serverless vs code everything and host it in a server on a rack somewhere.<p>Engineering is all about the tradeoffs.<p>So, how would I make that call? I&#x27;d think about how much it mattered to have control of the auth experience vs the easier onboarding of customers. I&#x27;d think about the risks of having the auth yanked out from under me (I&#x27;m not aware of any cases where this happened). I&#x27;d think about the value add of auth to my app; in most cases it&#x27;s slim to none. I&#x27;d also look at what the auth provider allowed me to know about the user when they deliver an authenticated user to my application.<p>I think in general auth isn&#x27;t a huge differentiator for most applications, and offloading it to a social provider, as long as a chunk or most of the target market has an account (github for devs, linkedin for sales folks, google for, well, people with an email address), is a good choice.<p>Don&#x27;t forget, you can provide both; I&#x27;ve worked at companies with only social login, but don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s very common.<p>Disclosure, I now work for a company which provides auth software (link in my bio).')
