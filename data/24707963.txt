It happens to not correspond to the &quot;t&quot; coordinate that a distant observer would call time, but it still exists.<p>The mathematics describes 2 singularities with black holes. 1 singularity occurs when describing the black hole using the coordinate system of an observer at constant distance. This is a coordinate singularity and goes away under an appropriate change of coordinates.<p>Another singularity occurs at what the constant distance observer would describe as the &quot;center&quot; of the black hole. This is not a coordinate singularity. The curvature there goes infinite regardless of your coordinate system.<p>Whether or not you want to call this singularity the &quot;center&quot; is a matter of opinion. An observer within the event horizon would describe the singularity as a time, not a location, so &quot;center&quot; certainly has some connotations that you may want to avoid. On the other hand. In the coordinate system that I normally see used to describe the interior of black holes, the singularity occurs at the surface r=0; which sounds kind of center-ish.')
