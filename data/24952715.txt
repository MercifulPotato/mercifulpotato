Unless you are in a high risk aerosolized environment, an N95 is unlikely to give you much additional benefit.<p>Most medical masks are made of the same material out of China that filters &gt; 95% of infectious particles. If you want extra protection, you can look for masks with an &quot;ASTM Level&quot; that gives additional support that the mask is medical grade.')
