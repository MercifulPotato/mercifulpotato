I suspect I’m not alone in this sentiment.<p>Also, since the parent didn’t mention writing to support, your response comes across as condescending and passive-aggressive. I’m not sure it was intended that way, but it reads as though you fully expected that the parent never wrote to support in the first place. If that tone was intentional, HN really isn’t the place for that sort of attitude. Simply suggest that they write to support—no need to be condescending about it.')
