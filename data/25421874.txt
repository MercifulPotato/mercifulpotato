Generally I spend between 4 and 7 hours in an IDE.<p>My best days, I can hit 9-10 hours IDE time - but generally when I hit that, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve spent the evening working on my own stuff.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly difficult (and undesirable) to hit that number working entirely on my main job. Diminishing returns come in fast. Switching contexts to a project I&#x27;m personally interested in is critical.<p>I think the better approach to being productive is to aim for ~4 hours of IDE time, maximizing deep work as much as possible.<p>I use codestats.net for tracking code volume (measured in &quot;XP&quot;), dividing it by the IDE time in a spreadsheet to get the hourly code volume each day.<p>XP&#x2F;hour a very noisy signal* , but not useless. For me, it usually varies between 400 and 2000 XP&#x2F;hour - a very rough proxy for deep work when averaged out over long periods. I&#x27;m always trying to improve on the mean.<p>*e.g. debugging time yields a far lower XP&#x2F;hour than greenfield development.')
