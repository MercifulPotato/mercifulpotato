Item(by='PeterisP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611928179, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25956332, text='In general, researchers don&#x27;t try to understand second-order effects of their pet theories, because the consequences of the theories are not relevant to the theories being true or false - it&#x27;s an &quot;is-vs-ought&quot; distinction. This is an article that observes and describes \naspects of how X influences Y.<p>The question whether Y and its implications are good or bad is orthogonal to that; any discussion about whether Y should be hastened or slowed down would be simply offtopic. Discussion about which <i>other</i> factors would hasten or slow down this effect would be relevant though.<p>I&#x27;d go even beyond and argue that researchers should explicitly and intentionally <i>avoid</i> considering such &quot;second-order effects&quot;. Let&#x27;s assume your position that &quot;this research says we&#x27;re not going to lose anything on the quality side anyway&quot; will cause some unwelcome consequences. So, what next? Should we avoid saying the truth because we don&#x27;t like it? Should we <i>lie</i> and say &quot;oh, we <i>are</i> going to lose on the quality side&quot; because we don&#x27;t like the second-order social effects of acknowledging the truth? I&#x27;d argue that allowing the social consequences (how things <i>ought</i> to be) to affect your view of reality (how tings <i>are</i>) is anathema to the concept of science, we should instead strive for objectivity even if  (and especially if) we don&#x27;t like what the looking glass is showing us.')
