If you ask &quot;if Y were a Chinese company, would they be banned, too?&quot; the answer is usually yes.<p>Google Search and Facebook aren&#x27;t banned because of where they&#x27;re from, but because of what they do, i.e. offering access to information the Chinese government wants censored. A <i>Chinese</i> company offering access to censored information would be shut down long before they got big enough to make international news.<p>There&#x27;s no need for &quot;reciprocity&quot; by putting more severe restrictions on Chinese companies. Applying the same rules to everyone would be enough. (Requiring all companies listed on US stock exchanges to be audited by the SEC is an example of a step in that direction.)')
