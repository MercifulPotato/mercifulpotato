As I understand it, speciation is a gradual process.  Trying to pin down exactly where the change occurs is like trying to  pin down precisely where a rainbow gradient shifts from green to yellow.  You can pick a point and declare that to be the demarcation line, but discrete categorization in this way seems inherently arbitrary.<p>Even seeming straight forward metrics like <i>&quot;can they produce viable offspring&quot;</i> isn&#x27;t so black and white, since between &#x27;yes&#x27; and &#x27;no&#x27; exists a continuum of &#x27;maybe&#x27;s.  In very rare cases even horses and donkeys can have fertile offspring, e.g. mules that aren&#x27;t <i>mules</i> (the typical infertility of mules has lead to the occasional use of the term to describe any infertile hybrid.)')
