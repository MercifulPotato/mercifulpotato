Parler posts were actively calling for violence and government overthrow. The mob at the capitol set up a gallows and were carrying handcuffs. To the (limited) extent that BLM protests turned violent, it was the result of situations on the ground getting out of hand, not planned in advance or incited by leadership. (Also, much of it was the result of aggression by police). There&#x27;s certainly room for valid criticism of aspects of BLM protests but they are not at all comparable to the insurrection at the capitol this week.')
