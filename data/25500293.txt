A phrase that always echoes in my mind when discussing cosmology is<p>&quot;All models are wrong - some models are useful&quot;<p>The farther you venture from the verified useful section of a model (by which I mean - the farther you are from model predications that have been validated with observational evidence), the less you should trust it - ALL MODELS ARE WRONG!<p>And for most sciences - this isn&#x27;t a huge deal - we can do lots of observational work easily right now.  For cosmology... well - our observational data on the history of the universe it just astoundingly, mind-bogglingly, miniscule in comparison to the events we&#x27;re interested in.')
