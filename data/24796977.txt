First and outside of the scope of this discussion, in search of a base he has aligned with the woke, but the main reason I stopped being a fan is exactly observing money being spent in CA and WA by people that are not quite as bright or honest as Bernie Sanders. I no longer want to pay more taxes, because I am philosophically opposed to giving money to complete morons. Frankly, I&#x27;d sooner pay taxes to Bill Gates or Warren Buffett - they are more likely to do something sensible with the money.')
