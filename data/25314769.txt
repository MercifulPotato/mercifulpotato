But if you&#x27;re running a model in production at google with loads of google searches hitting it every second. At what point does the inference costs start to outweigh the training costs?<p>I simply have no idea where the hinge point is. This could inform other questions like, could it be worth to scale up to get a more accurate model (pay up-front in training) to avoid further searches (inference)?')
