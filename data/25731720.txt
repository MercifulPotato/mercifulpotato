It&#x27;s one thing if one already <i>has</i> a personal BHAG, but going through a process to develop one as a personal goal seems almost... backwards to me. I would find it difficult, if not impossible, to come up with something so specific that &quot;sums up&quot; the way I&#x27;d like my life to turn out, but maybe that&#x27;s just my personality.')
