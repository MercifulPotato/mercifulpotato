The author would start explaining some advice and I didn’t know which advice he was referring to. Like <i>”This is one I struggle with the most”</i>, “this” what? I would go back to the previous paragraph and there was no reference, worst, apparently it was another topic!<p>Then it hit me, the <i>images</i> with words on it every few paragraphs were the pieces of advice! They were not ads or merely unimportant illustrations, they were the titles! I unconsciously ignored them all on first read, banner-blindness or something like that.<p>I actually scanned the post for bullet points the moment I opened the page and couldn’t find them. Because the bullet points were designed as images.<p>Important to notice that now, looking at them as bullet points, I like the design. They useful mini-posters. But they had this side-effect on me of magically becoming invisible.')
