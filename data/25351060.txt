You might be entranced or utterly bored by &quot;Six Marimbas&quot; but be disinterested or engaged by &quot;Music For Ensemble and Orchestra&quot;. etc. etc.<p>Best to plan on diving in about once a decade and see if you like what he was doing then. My suggestions would be:<p><pre><code>  60s: Come out\n  70s: Music for 18 Musicians\n  80s: Tehillim\n  90s: Different Trains\n  00s: Double Sextet\n  10s: Reich&#x2F;Richter\n</code></pre>\nPersonally, I&#x27;m a huge fan of his phase-shifting work, so for me the keys works would be:<p><pre><code>  Six Pianos &#x2F; Six Marimbas\n  Clapping Music\n  Music For 18 Musicians\n  Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organ\n  Drumming\n</code></pre>\nThere are also some very &quot;pretty&quot; ensemble orchestral works:<p><pre><code>  Sextet\n  Desert Music\n</code></pre>\nand then ... so much more!<p>For the adventurous, also check out the album &quot;Shift&quot; by Chris Hughes: renderings of various early Reich works (or ideas) using totally different timbres.')
