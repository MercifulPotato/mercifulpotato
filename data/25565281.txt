The state that you do have is generally called out more visibly. I do think that&#x27;s a product of defaulting to state avoidance, since the thing you&#x27;re avoiding becomes more visible whenever it is present.<p>I think FP does a good job of pushing as much state as possible into the &quot;state in the continuation&quot; category, but there seems to be a hard kernel of mutable state that doesn&#x27;t dissolve so easily. On the bright side, that makes for a bright, shining target to aim research at (LVars, CRDTs, logic programming).<p>&gt; thereâ€™s something that feels very distinct between static and runtime state<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m only thinking about runtime state here. Can you call out where it seems like I&#x27;m referring to static state?')
