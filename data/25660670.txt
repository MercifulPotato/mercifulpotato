In this system, I feel like it would be rude to bring yourself over to a group and then leave again when you decide you&#x27;re not interested in the conversation. Perhaps being able to mouse over a location to here the audio would be good. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much expectation of privacy in a space like this anyway.<p>I think this spacial arrangement would generally make such social dilemmas easier to handle.
