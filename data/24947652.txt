What circumstances would a four way stop sign allow for <i>more</i> traffic flow than a roundabout?<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s purely cost-cutting. Four way stop signs are extremely cheap compared to roundabouts. There&#x27;s no other advantage that I can think of.<p>Roundabouts are safer (there is no opportunity for t-boning at a roundabout), faster and simpler to navigate than four way stop signs (a roundabout you just give way to people already on the roundabout, a four way stop sign requires you to keep track of who arrived first and then do a weird dance if you both arrived at the same time, and you still need to watch out for people attempting to go out of turn -- which is not possible with a roundabout)')
