At least for me, I buy about 100 books a year from Amazon and 5-10 books a year from physical book stores. The value of physical book stores is when you can find something interesting by browsing through them and then you just want to read the physical book right away. For the best book stores (like City Lights in SF) I find books that I never would find otherwise. But whenever I learn about a new book online, Amazon will get me the book the fastest (for me usually Kindle, the physical book if I&#x27;m willing to wait) so it&#x27;s just a much better experience.')
