Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25316603], score=None, time=1607188302, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25313157, text='That assumes they all only go to one place, which then turns into a cesspool that immediately repels anyone who enters.<p>There are two problems with this. The first is that it works both ways. If you expel all the heretics then <i>your</i> site becomes a cesspool of groupthink that immediately repels anyone who has had so much as a conversation with someone from the other side, because you&#x27;ll be saying things that are transparently wrong to anyone who has had any real-world contact with the subject matter and be unable to correct yourself because anyone who spots the error fears being ejected for pointing it out.<p>And the second is that the version of the opposition on their best behavior for doing recruitment doesn&#x27;t actually disappear, it just ends up in separate places. Your opponents will have their home base which is full of their own obviously wrong groupthink, but there will also continue to exist places where moderates gather.<p>Which means you have a new problem. The place where moderates gather will still have the subtle extremism you were trying to eject, but now, because your population hasn&#x27;t been exposed to it, they&#x27;re more susceptible to it. They&#x27;re unvaccinated. So now you have to not only eject the extremists but also the moderates, because anyone who starts listening to the moderates may start to realize that some parts of the things your own extremists say aren&#x27;t exactly true. Which puts them at high risk of switching to the other team. And you&#x27;ve already turned the other team into a coalition of crazy extremists. But ejecting the moderates turns <i>your</i> team into a coalition of crazy extremists, which is likewise quite ungood.')
