There was like 1kB of JS thrown on top to add a bit of &quot;nice to have&quot; functionality.<p>I implemented an entire clone of Flappy Bird in like 50kB. The bulk of that was a polyfill so it worked on IE8.<p>I implemented a curling game that would open up a webcam in the background and continuously capture and process images to try and detect shapes you&#x27;d drawn on paper. When it detected one it would trace the shape and decompose it into a convex shape as that&#x27;s all the physics engine supported, then render this on a 65&quot; touchscreen coffee table and let you curl with your custom shaped rock with realistically calculated physics including an appropriate density for your curling rock based on the volume of the same you&#x27;d created. It would calculate scoring and use websockets to communicate that to another device which was hooked up to a TV that displayed a leaderboard. This was all in about 500kB, and the bulk of that was the physics engine (what could&#x27;ve been a &quot;computer vision&quot; library was like a kilobyte of vanilla JS). There was no effort made to prune unused code or anything because it was never loaded over the network or required to be optimized for load times and I only had a week to build it.<p>I honestly cannot even begin to comprehend how we&#x27;re shipping static websites with 1MB+ of JS. Damn kids, get off my lawn.')
