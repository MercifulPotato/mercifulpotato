Item(by='firebaze', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608154574, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25448000, text='My wife is of romanian origin, is a developer, <i>very</i> good at her job and her record contains surpassing and outcompeting principal engineers at her organization. I wouldn&#x27;t even feel the need to explain this, as it is natural. She is among the highest ranked engineers in a company in which most other employees in the engineering division are white, male, privileged and probably - pro forma - better educated. Nobody gives a shit though, since she&#x27;s doing her job exceptionally well.<p>Also, I didn&#x27;t <i>ever</i> feel the need to defend herself against any accusations. Why? Because there was no reason to. Sure, there is the usual office gossip, but this until then has been non-directional, &quot;brownian motion&quot;. This is simply the truth as experienced by both of us.<p>This changed in the last 3-4 years, though. Powered by the latest victim reporting, suddenly women and minorities have to feel victimized again (in order to not betray the spirit of equality), at least that&#x27;s what the changed climate feels to us (maybe she differs in nuances, this is my perception as a white privileged male).<p>I simply don&#x27;t get why we cannot accept as a civilization that females, blacks or whatever minority group (as our perception, guided by media, tells us) <i>are</i> still human with all the ups and downs, maybe accompanied by cultural differences which over time align with ours from both sides. If we altogether stopped discriminating against <i>and for</i> minorities, all would feel better. The thing is, this must be a majority consensus.<p>Maybe this will be misunderstood as me positioning against minority support, I hope it doesn&#x27;t since it&#x27;s meant as the absolute opposite: in my limited experience, the best support is to altogether eradicate the thought of having to support minorities - they are not helpless, they can stand for themselves, and they will succeed. Nobody, from no majority or minority must try to stigmatize and hamper them.')
