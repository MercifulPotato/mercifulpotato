You can expect each client to have its own ssh, git, and hooks and scripts, for example Ansible. I recommend getting those all under version control.<p>Each vpn will have its own dns and subnets. You might reduce context switching by setting those at your firewall or router instead of dev box. I do this for projects with multiple dev boxes, any hardware or server project will have more than one machine that might need to cross their vpn.<p>Combining several layers of vpn is tedious. For dns, I’ve needed my own local dns server to forward different domains for different clients. The stock dns server on consumer firewall routers often won’t do domain-level forwarding well.')
