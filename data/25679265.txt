Investors<p>To be fair, Tesla received bad press before Cathy Wood&#x27;s predictions came true and decimated all short sellers, leading to a short squeeze (major bull contributor)<p>- Car market: Stock price makes sense based on Ark&#x27;s predictions, at least for now. Taking into account total addressable market (TAM) and market cap, Tesla&#x27;s seeming monopoly with its 3-4 year lead on technology compared to all other competitors.<p>- It makes sense how investors are valuing Tesla to include all ICE companies, betting on Elon&#x27;s probability to capture this market (Market cap -&gt; TAM bet) This is not including additional speculative TAM (insurance, energy, self-driving, etc.).<p>Max bull case based on ARK&#x27;s 7k prediction = 7k&#x2F;5 (stock split) = 1.4k price target<p>- Governments are going to start banning ICEs by 2035. So the EV trend is definitely happening.<p>2. Consumers<p>- Product: Customers reviews and product seem solid. Value proposition to prospective new customers also make sense in terms of saving on gas long term compared to electricity.<p>- Hype: Yes, there is a cult around Elon, and defects or abuses get overlooked in favor of Tesla<p>Biased (shorts): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25360432" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25360432</a><p>- Supply: There might be a problem with cobalt supply due to its majority based on Democratic Republic of Congo. Ethical issues aside (child and forced labor)- One tesla contains ~4.5 kg of cobalt, compare this to global electronics&#x27; demand, there will be a big shortage (Glencore collaboration).<p>Elon is working with CATL do develop new batteries that get rid of cobalt, but this is a long shot, and even if realized, efficiency with a new tech is at stake.<p>- Demand: There is no doubt current market demand for EVs crossed an inflection point where consumer education is maturing due to Tesla. But most current customers are catered toward the rich (Boomers and Chinese).<p>- There is some research suggesting that millennials (Tesla&#x27;s next biggest target) don&#x27;t want to own a car (depreciating asset), let alone afford one- given current economic situation, home ownership (charging), and remote work. Tesla&#x27; promise on the $25k car might help here. But they are also the major fans and Robinhood investors in Tesla...<p>Not sure, overall I am glad that Tesla is forcing other companies to follow its lead, but a level headed approach is always good advice.<p>Note: I don&#x27;t own a car or Tesla stock')
