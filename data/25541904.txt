Designed as a telescopic pillar system—which Rosa patented —the pylons required “arranging a structure on the beach and floating it offshore to a predetermined location.” A telescopic pillar system is comprised of concentric, modular tubes that are designed to slide into each other, which can then be stretched out or collapsed to the required length—much like an adjustable office chair, or the old telescopes from which the system derives its name. As such, the nine pylons that were to endure the immense weight of the 400-square-meter platform (a mere cubic meter of reinforced concrete can weigh an exorbitant 2300 kg or 5070 lb!) were assembled in their telescopic modules on the beach and then transported to their final location.[..]<p>[..] Once the pylons were brought to their location, Rosa and his team would fill one end of the pylon with water, causing it to sink vertically into the seabed . Using this method, pylons would rivet into place through the sheer force of their own weight, rather like “self-tapping screws.” Steel tubes would then be inserted into the pylons and forced into the sea floor for further stability. The steel would also enhance the load-bearing capacity for the otherwise hollow pylons, not unlike steel rebars that are utilized in reinforced concrete.<p>Giorgio’s son, Lorenzo Rosa, summarizes the process as follows: “It was a modular system. He used these pipes—kind of like stilts—which were empty inside and then they would inject concrete in, which made them very stable and very strong to hold the island.”[..]')
