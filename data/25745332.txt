Item(by='rocgf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610450173, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25745059, text='This attitude towards cyclists is somewhat universal outside a few cycling-friendly countries, it is not US specific by any means.<p>Cyclists are always seen as a nuisance, since they block the road for the &quot;real&quot; traffic. Cycling lanes are also somewhat rare outside the Netherlands and Denmark, so bikes and cars almost always share the road.<p>I have a particular pet peeve, which is the term &quot;cycling city&quot;. I see it everywhere because it is sexy to proclaim that bikes are on your priority list as mayor&#x2F;government. As an example, in Manchester (UK) the mayor has proclaimed that Manchester will be a cycling city, yet bike lanes are rarely included in new projects. There was a redevelopment for one of the larger streets in Manchester, obviously without _any_ consideration for bikes.<p>If you want cycling cities, there are a few scattered around Europe, but nothing compared to the Netherlands and Denmark. The rest is just bs.')
