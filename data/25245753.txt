I&#x27;m not saying you are lying. I didn&#x27;t watch it properly so I may have missed it.<p>All the conflicts are shown as one-sided. Like the Iran one, where he mentions US&#x2F;CIA interference, but doesn&#x27;t mention all other players that also wanted to interfere there, because Iran and oil were essential to the global scenario of Cold War (and eventually a not cold war).<p>&gt;I don&#x27;t know what that means. Are you saying that something in the video is untrue or just that it contains facts that make the US government look bad? Would you describe a similar video criticizing an enemy of the US government (whether another government, terrorist organisation, or something else) in the same way?<p>I&#x27;m saying the video does indeed make an extra effort to make the US government &#x2F; CIA look bad indeed. The thing is, looks like there is an editorial choice to make that point, and the video went after it. No wonder it can&#x2F;will raise eyebrows in the US government &#x2F; CIA. Which is a completely sepparate problem from youtube&#x2F;online censoring.<p>&gt;I think the problem here is if YouTube&#x27;s goal is to help the government who (according to the author) is Google&#x27;s customer. YouTube is under no obligation to do anything to help spread the author&#x27;s video, but they should definitely be criticised for working with an organisation committing horrible abuses and acts of violence.<p>Indeed. That&#x27;s exactly what I mean. YouTube is in close ties with the government, and also led by advertisers, they explicitly want to make it more friendly to the most viewers possible. And that kind of documentary is not aligned with that goal, thus will not be promoted.<p>But it is important to notice the difference between promoting it and hiding it actively. I can&#x27;t find the video while searching for the exact title.')
