Feels like I can &quot;sit hard&quot; <i>into</i> it, snug, backrest gently pushing no matter how I stretch<p>- Leap V1 at home, almost better: armrests are stronger, enough so I can do dips directly on them, and the backrest stops shorter and rolls more (can actually lean head all the way back)<p>- Humanscale Freedom w&#x2F; headrest, past work favorite: nice recline geometry, armrests barely strong enough for dips, but surface not flexible like Leaps<p>- Herman Miller Mirra: recline is very nice, and the seat itself has a very nice geometry, but I don&#x27;t like how cold the mesh gets<p>- Herman Miller Aeron: pretty good when it fits, but recline is kinda binary, not as analog.  My biggest complaint is how hard it is, if you ever happen to touch something not mesh<p>I&#x27;d like to try a Gesture (and an Embody, sure..) to replace my L1, or just get an L2.  I&#x27;m not picky with desks (28-30&quot;) or keyboards.  The only thing I adjust on my Leaps is the recline resist, from time to time.')
