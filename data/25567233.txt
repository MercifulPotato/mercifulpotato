So $6,000 - $14,400 per year, plus any family members. That&#x27;s a huge chunk of a &quot;$30-60k hypothesized interest income.&quot;<p>2) That&#x27;s if the ACA pre-existing condition exemption is in place. If not, you have a pre-existing condition, and #1 doesn&#x27;t apply. You&#x27;ll be lucky to be offered any insurance.<p>3) I suggest you look at the price of insulin in the US - any recent formulation is sky-high, as in if you&#x27;re not the 1% then it&#x27;s not sustainable if you&#x27;re required to pay for it yourself.
