Although I&#x27;d prefer to do it pro se and keep costs down, I&#x27;ve always wanted to do a pro se case but never had the opportunity yet (all my cases have been big enough it would be dumb not to hire a lawyer.)<p>Still remains to be seen if others that have already been taken down will start filing cases. There&#x27;s at least one case that I linked above, although it&#x27;s not directly related to youtube-dl.')
