The issue was the situation escalated way beyond where it should have. George Floyd was being arrested for using a supposedly counterfeit $20 bill. Maybe they could have just let him run. I&#x27;m sure the US economy won&#x27;t be ruined by there being an extra $20 in circulation.<p>In the EMT case, I think we have to think about the alternative outcomes. If the EMTs can&#x27;t help because the person is irrationally violent due to drugs, and the EMTs can&#x27;t restrain them, I don&#x27;t really see why calling the cops would make the situation any better. All they&#x27;re doing is providing more hands, which could be done by simply having more EMTs. If they have a gun, then call the police. If they don&#x27;t, they&#x27;re unrestrainable, and you can clear out members of the the public, just let them be. The only other options simply make the situation worse for the person. Even using a taser in that situation can cause a heart attack.')
