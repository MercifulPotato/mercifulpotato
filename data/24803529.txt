Perhaps you should elaborate on an intersection that you see between the two.<p>I can speak only for Red: it takes its heritage in Lisp, Forth and Logo, has an embeded cross-platform GUI engine with a dedicated DSL for UI building, C-like sub-language for system level programming, OMeta-like PEG parser, and unique type system with literal forms for things like currencies, URLs, e-mail and dates with hashtags; all of that fitting in one-megabyte binary and valuing human-centered design above all.')
