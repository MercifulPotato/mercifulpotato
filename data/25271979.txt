Your Aunt may have good intentions but she probably doesn&#x27;t know what games you like but you sure as heck appreciated the gift because it translates to something you really like that was enabled by the gift giver.<p>I think the card being specific to 1 store also really helps personalize the gift. You can be sure the person will enjoy it instead of maybe feeling guilty about how they should really use it for every day living expenses.')
