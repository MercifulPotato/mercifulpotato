Or an individual contracted by Twitter who doesn&#x27;t like what you said. Or maybe they misunderstand what you said due to cultural differences.<p>I found my time on Twitter was fighting against a US-biased culture, and what I consider friendly banter with friends can be misconstrued as abuse by some random moderator or algorithm.')
