If we&#x27;re lucky, some members serve two consecutive years and there&#x27;s continuity. Some years, the board is lousy and can&#x27;t be counted on to transition duties responsibly.<p>There are about a dozen passwords (not currently consolidated in a single place) that need to be passed from one board to the next. Not every board member needs access to all the passwords (varies based on role).<p>We&#x27;d want certain people like the school admin and director to have access, as well as one or two long-term supporters of the school, who serve to preserve continuity in case the board fails to do so.<p>I&#x27;ve looked into solutions like Lastpass and Onelogin, but these cost ~$5&#x2F;month&#x2F;user and don&#x27;t provide discounts for non-profits. For us, that&#x27;s about $60&#x2F;month, and I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s the best solution?')
