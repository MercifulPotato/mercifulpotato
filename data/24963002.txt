Person A: water is wet, person b: [citation needed], etc or demanding citation for an ancedote about someone&#x27;s personal experience, but i dont think i see that very often.<p>I see this quite often. In particular, a common pattern:<p>Person A: water is wet<p>Person B: [citation needed], you clearly have an agenda<p>Person C: I experienced water and found it to be wet<p>Person B: [citation needed], anecdotes are not data<p>Person D: water is dry<p>(Person B silently clicks to upvote and does not respond, or less subtly, continues the discussion but does not apply the same &quot;standards&quot;)<p>Rare meta-discussion follow-up: Hey person B, you seem to be selective in your standards of evidence.<p>Person B: I&#x27;m neutral and rational!<p>All of this wastes people&#x27;s time and energy, and nobody (including B) are going to derive any value from any further responses to B&#x27;s comments.<p>The generous interpretation: Person B is fooling themselves into thinking they&#x27;re being rational by asking for evidence instead of saying &quot;nuh-uh!&quot;, but they don&#x27;t realize they&#x27;re only asking that of statements that bother them, and they&#x27;re unlikely to actually change their mind regardless of the amount of evidence.<p>The less generous version: Person B knows exactly what they&#x27;re doing, but is playing neutral to waste people&#x27;s time and effort.<p>Versions of this pattern, with more incendiary topics in place of the humidity of dihydrogen monoxide, appear often.')
