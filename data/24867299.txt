The student must be trying to learn something new with each new piece. Quantity iterates the feedback loop. The student still must  be able to identify mistakes or areas where improvement is needed. Doing that means paying attention to quality.<p>So it&#x27;s not really about ignoring quantity or quality for the sake of the other, but finding a good balance.')
