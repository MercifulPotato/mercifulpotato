I pay for private dental insurance.<p>As for everything else - I literally have no complaints about the treatment anyone in our family has had from the NHS. Of course, other people will have had bad experiences - that is inevitable with something the size of the NHS but I don&#x27;t.<p>NB We have neighbours who are NHS doctors who complain about the costs of the German healthcare system - everybody has some problems!<p>Edit: About a month ago, on a Sunday, my wife got what appeared to be an insect bite that had become infected. She phoned NHS 24, spoke to someone and had to wait for an hour for a nurse to phone back. The nurse said it was best to play safe and arranged a hospital appointment for about 7pm.  I drove her to the appointment and she was in, examined by a doctor and out again in about 30 minutes with a pack of antibiotics to take.<p>Cost: Â£0 (prescriptions are free in Scotland).<p>That is pretty typical of my experience of the NHS.')
