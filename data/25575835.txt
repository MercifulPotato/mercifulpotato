If it&#x27;s not worth it to do so, don&#x27;t. But if it is keep filing your taxes.<p>I could see improving things but your perspective still sounds like whinging. Accounting and filing is the cost of doing business. More troublesome is the SS and other tax contributions you&#x27;re responsible for, but that just means you should charge more.<p>To give you a comparison, this sounds to me like people stating we should wipe out student debt. Doing so is inherently regressive. Already well off people go to college anyway and people with a degree make more over their lifetime. They are <i>not</i> the people who need help the most. Likewise, if you are encountering serious financial strain because of this you need to charge more, but you&#x27;re still making more than most people do.')
