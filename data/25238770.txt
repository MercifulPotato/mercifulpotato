Tech people are niche conformists, a lot of them read the same books, speak the same language, share the same hobbies, look the same, and copy each others ideas.<p>Copying something well and then deluding yourself or others into thinking you&#x27;ve dug up novelty is in fact one of the best sales strategies there is.<p>Paul is also not accurate in one important way. Investors, by definition of how they make money, can&#x27;t be too novel. They only can be ahead of the curve, because if you&#x27;re so independent minded that the market doesn&#x27;t catch up with what you believe you don&#x27;t make any money. They&#x27;re not independent-minded so much as they know what others want when they don&#x27;t yet know it themselves. That&#x27;s a different thing.')
