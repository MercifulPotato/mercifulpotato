I did a write up on how the Touch input API is on different Game Engines here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ericonotes.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;a-quick-look-at-touch-handling-apis-in.html<p>I would like more experiences when using them. Do they work well with code completion in the respectives IDEs? What are gotchas to be aware? Are there important aspects of touch handling in them that are not made clear by looking only in the API?<p>I am gathering input because I want to add a touch API and touch handling for a game engine.')
