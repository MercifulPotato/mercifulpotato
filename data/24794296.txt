No censorship has taken place. The article still exists on the NY Post web site and their newspaper. Their audience is still sizable.<p>Their article included personal information and was consistent with policies that have been in place for almost a year.<p>Twitter is not a public utility in the way that phone services are. They were (rightly) criticized along with others for letting mis-information run amok in the last election and beyond. They have (slowly) taken steps to listen to these concerns and this is what happens.<p>I full support Twitter in this. This is not censorship, this is limitation of deliberate mis-information and personal information.')
