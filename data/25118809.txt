Yes, I cannot agree more that you need challenges like what Sedol faced.  He admitted playing AlphaGo made him a better player.  I too feel same whenever I get challenged but there is difference of the challenge&#x27;s virtue depending on the outcome.  An emotionally strong deeper understanding stable person will possibly see growth, but the flipside is someone not ready&#x2F;incapable&#x2F;not mentally mature enough will probably get their souls crashed.<p>In martial arts, we always fight against a belt above as one cannot better one self being challenged by stagnant skill level.<p>One of the main reason why I like coding.  Even if similar task, I try a different path to challenge myself.')
