It&#x27;s not about any concrete syllabuses but the whole approach to life and world. The answer varies a lot based on their age, school year, level etc. But in general, I would recommend you to plant a seed of self-education abilities in their life, if havenâ€™t already. By those abilities I mean mostly self-reflection but also others which result from self-reflection: self-assessment, self-directed learning and going further even self-determined learning. These are abilities that will help them to understand how they stand in any situation and adapt to unpredictable changes in the fast-changing world we indeed live in. Of course, the journey of life-long learning is a long run. I can elaborate more on this if it helps you.')
