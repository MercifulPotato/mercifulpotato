They were 10K.<p>In addition the MIPS chip was considerably worse than a dual proc x86 machine of the same vintage. I was working at a company where there was a C++ API. Compilation time on the SGI was 2 hours. It was 10 minutes on the Intergraph.<p>When cards like the Nvidia Quadro and FireGL cards came they were better than SGI machines and cost a few thousand dollars.<p>This guy worked for NEXT, who were eaten early because they produced massively overpriced workstations that there was a small market for. They didn&#x27;t even survive the workstation market, let alone the coming wave of better hardware from very large development budgets for mass market parts.')
