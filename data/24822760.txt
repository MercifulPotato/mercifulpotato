Being a member-in-good-standing of a community would be a standing default that one&#x27;s messaging is presumed conformant. Violations beyond the tolerance of the community would flip that &quot;presumed conformant&quot; bit to &quot;presumed in violation&quot;, so that software wanting to show the community-conformant view knows what to do. (This only requires cryptographic identities &amp; messaging, not centralized server sysops with delete privileges.)')
