But I was under the impression that this would not change the fact that a host audio app is running under user-space and can be pre-empted anytime? The way most pro-audio apps work is they have a callback they run once per audio vector size to fill a buffer of samples for the next buffer to pass to the audio subsystem. So if this gets knocked down the priority list, you get problems. Man I&#x27;d love to see any developments to improve that though, on an OS level we&#x27;ve been stalled for 20 FREAKING YEARS now. :-&#x2F;')
