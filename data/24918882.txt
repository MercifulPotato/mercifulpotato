I found that organizing and storing information is somewhat overrated unless you are very, very good at knowing ahead of time whether information you have come across will be useful in the future. If you don&#x27;t, then it&#x27;s better to just let your brain do the means-testing there naturally -- does something make the cut and you keep coming back to it month after month, year after year? Good news, you&#x27;ll probably commit it to memory as your brain needs to do so.<p>The problem is that if you overindex on what you choose to organize, you just end up with a bunch of junk and then you have to go back and tend it and delete it and figure out what makes the cut or not. It&#x27;s such a time intensive chore that takes away useful cycles that I&#x27;d rather be spending on deep work. My deep work is rarely information retrieval and organization, but instead handling strategic concerns in the moment and planning for the future -- both of which I need to balance and do with proper judgment.<p>And unfortunately, I do not find setting up a knowledge management system very useful for that. An old-fashioned journal that lets me get out my thoughts in the moment and log it at a point in time is really the best tool for that.')
