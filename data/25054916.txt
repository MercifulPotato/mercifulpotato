Once I hit burnout (which I can easily pinpoint in retrospect but couldn&#x27;t see in the moment), work stress started accelerating.<p>Tangentially related, I can&#x27;t believe how much a role can contribute to burnout. When I was going through my own journey of burnout, I thought it was all a &quot;me&quot; problem (I often quoted the saying: &quot;wherever I go, there I&#x27;ll be&quot; as an excuse to stay and &quot;work&quot; on myself).<p>I wish I could go back in time and slap myself. Once I left the role that was killing me (long hour, no appreciation, shit product -- the usual), I was at least 80% happier and was able to recover from my battle with burnout.<p>tl;dr: burnout sucks. If you&#x27;re in a shit job, leave. It might help you heal (maybe rapidly).')
