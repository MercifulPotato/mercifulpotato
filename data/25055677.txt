That is false consciousness.<p>You&#x27;re talking as if they rejected the idea.  They don&#x27;t even know what the idea is.<p>A sizable amount of working class Americans have no idea that people die.  They have no idea that their grandparents died.  They have been to wakes and have seen the corpse of their grandparents or whomever, but when I talk to them they say their grandparents are elsewhere and enjoying themselves.  They do not mean this metaphorically, or that they live on via children or their works or memories.  They have no concept that these people are not around any more, permanently.  They go to churches where a man stands in front and says this, I guess they believe him.  This would be part of false consciousness, although not a needed component of them.  They are as ignorant of death as they are of their economic exploitation.  They are ignorant and uneducated.  If you want to call them stupid as you do, that&#x27;s your right.')
