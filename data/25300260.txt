I can understand wanting such functionality bundled with git lfs, but all the different options seem very opinionated to me in ways that there isn&#x27;t a clear &quot;default&quot; choice. To me custom transfer agents and transports never felt like an afterthought, and fit quite nicely into there.<p>My main problems with git lfs were more UX problems where certain workloads are not as well supported (e.g. keeping only a portion of the LFS files local).<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sinbad&#x2F;lfs-folderstore" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sinbad&#x2F;lfs-folderstore</a>')
