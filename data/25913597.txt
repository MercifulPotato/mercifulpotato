He said it on multiple occasions. If you look at his work and tweet feed, it is strongly point of view driven and at times emotional (the prevailing emotion and perpetual outrage). He does not seem to like concrete politician, but it very very clear who his enemies are. Glenn Greenwald is not an example of someone who is not psychologically connected or avoids the appearance of impropriety.<p>Glenn Greenwald on Trump during Biden inauguration: &quot;Trump left the White House about as weak, cucked, and submissive as itâ€™s possible for a grown adult to scamper away.&quot; I really dont know what he wanted Trump to do, he was way more critical of Biden and democrats then of Trump last months. Leaving during innaguration without causing issues sounds like exactly what is expected.<p>But the very same day, he called the &quot;chills&quot; tween inappropriate, claimed that such tweet is overly emotional and equated that tweet with being on public tv. Glenn Greenwald is last person that has any grounds to pontificate about objectivity and bias.')
