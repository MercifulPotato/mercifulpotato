I you can still reproduce you should definitely look into it and email the maintainers, i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a bug. Right now sway is feature frozen and it seems to be rock-solid. Screen capture works with pipewire (which is a breath of fresh air in comparison with the pulse&#x2F;jack combo) and the xdg-desktop-portal extension. At this point i&#x27;m not sure i&#x27;ll switch to something else in my lifetime!')
