It also means services are lower for everyone - including white liberals who have limited options just due to living there.<p>What that also mean is that if one black family moves into white street, every white on that street is at risk to loose exact same things. They become redlined too.<p>Redlining means that white people have financial incentive to segregate themselves and to push away incoming blacks.
