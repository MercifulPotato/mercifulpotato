You don&#x27;t have to necessarily go ortholinear, and you certainly don&#x27;t have to stray from QWERTY. In fact, just learning to properly touch type and making sure the &quot;right&quot; fingers are hitting the right keys goes a long way with a split keyboard.<p>I found a lot of my own wrist pain was from the unnatural position that your arms and wrists are in to support a non split keyboard + the unnecessary hand&#x2F;wrist movement to hit keys with the &quot;wrong&quot; fingers. An ortholinear (or at least column linear) keyboard can go a long way in teaching you where your fingers are supposed to go as long as you are willing to spend a weekend or two learning how to type again.<p>If you are thinking of diving into making your own, I would recommend the following vendors for kits:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keyhive.xyz&#x2F;shop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keyhive.xyz&#x2F;shop</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keeb.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keeb.io&#x2F;</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.littlekeyboards.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.littlekeyboards.com&#x2F;</a>')
