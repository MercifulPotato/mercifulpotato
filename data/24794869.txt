That communication can obviously still happen over the internet.<p>The point is that when you&#x27;re looking for a toaster oven and your friend says that his coworker&#x27;s spouse just got a ToasterGenius Model Z and they&#x27;re happy with it, you can be fairly confident they&#x27;re not shilling for ToasterGenius. They may not know anything about toaster ovens, and they may not have the same toasting needs as you, but at least you can probably trust that their opinion is genuine. Of course, I suppose it could turn out that ToasterGenius is running an MLM and your friend&#x27;s coworker&#x27;s spouse hosts ToasterGenius home parties to sell ToasterGenius products!')
