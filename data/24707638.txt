Religion is, to quote  TeMPOraL\n&quot;Religions based on the Bible tend to be half faiths, half community management handbooks.&quot;<p>you can generalize that statement <i>very</i> far; religion is one of the key &quot;technologies&quot; which allows communities to scale past 5K people. Think &quot;city&quot;.<p>Thus religion has a very different purpose than physics. It is about psychological health on a community and individual level.<p>The stories of physics, on the other hand, &quot;eerie ideas such as force field, wavefunction, observable,...&quot; don&#x27;t really tell you much about how to handle things when your neighbor&#x27;s barking dog is frustrating you.<p>(insert snarky comment about engineering a force field to solve the problem)<p>Even assuming that the bible is the literal word of <i>deity</i>, it is inconsistent to believe that the creation stories of genesis are descriptions of actual physical processes. because that is not why <i>deity</i> put those stories there. because <i>deity</i> was talking using a language which is 1.5-3K years old (let&#x27;s agree to not argue dates, I&#x27;ll accept the date you prefer), and words like &quot;world&quot; and &quot;universe&quot; meant something very very different back then than they do today. So if it is <i>deity&#x27;s</i> literal word, then it must literally mean what it meant in the context of that earlier culture.')
