It is possible to capture a ”volume of light”, within which bokeh &amp; more can be adjusted after the fact. Issue is the amount of data generated and complexity of tech versus getting a ”good enough for most situations” image via simpler means (regular photo). Regular + depth images (Apple LiDAR etc) with help of AI can create something vaguely similar to actual bokeh, but they’re missing a lot of source data.<p>In the world of 3D rendering (content created from scratch) very advanced &amp; realistic bokeh effects are possible, as an example see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lentil.xyz" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lentil.xyz</a> for the Arnold renderer.')
