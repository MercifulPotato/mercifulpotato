JXTreetable makes me sad and wince everytime I have to open up the code. Cell renderers are OK... Until you want to go custom <i>and</i> synchronize events &amp; drawing between renderers <i>and</i> you want them all coherent... And don&#x27;t get me started on LnF and their interactions with JxTreetable... I know I should just shut up and go build mine own but this seems like such an oversight.')
