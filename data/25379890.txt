At least Apple is doing something with that money, maintaining the App Store, providing and developing tools like XCode and Swift.<p>Epic also would be spending some of their money on their own development, improvement to games etc. I don&#x27;t quite follow the line of argument here - if things are 30% more expensive to cover Apples costs, then the consumer is the one losing out in the transaction.')
