It just changes the way you think.<p>SBCL is a compiler, it let&#x27;s you use what was designed as an interpreted language, in an efficient, compiled way.<p>But this compiler has nothing to do with other compilers you probably know about. Instead of compiling the entire set, you just can compile fragments of code, or not compile them (interpret it for things like flexible self modifying code)if you want with total control.<p>Very very good for incremental programming, with tools like the REPL and debugging options you have nowhere else.<p>Having said that, I use my own dialect of Lisp in C, and I use that for writing code in the c world: c, c++, python, webasm, js.<p>I use SBCL only occasionally now.')
