And &quot;firmware&quot; is some special software required by the device itself to run (could be some ARM or MIPS binary or whatever arch is used by CPU(s) on the device). I guess that some peripherals have firmware on non-volatile storage while others require it provided by the host when they&#x27;re initialized.<p>So the &quot;firmware&quot; I required for my Thinkpad&#x27;s wifi to work (and which was included in that Debian nonfree image) is this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.debian.org&#x2F;iwlwifi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.debian.org&#x2F;iwlwifi</a><p>update: actually on that Debian wiki there&#x27;s a page called &quot;Firmware&quot; which explains things well <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.debian.org&#x2F;Firmware" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.debian.org&#x2F;Firmware</a>')
