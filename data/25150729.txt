Up to iteration 7 the mixed precision implementation tracks the 32-bit, but then fails to reduce the residual further. With this precision, machine precision is about 10^−3. We have observed this accuracy for  very well conditioned systems. Here, the growth of rounding  errors during the iterative solve explains the loss of an  additional factor of 10, leading to a plateau at a relative  residual of 10^−2.  We have not yet tested whether this accuracy is acceptable in the MFIX code.<p>&gt; We expect that for some realistic situations, mixed precision solvers  are usable as is; in others they may need to be  coupled with a correction scheme such as an iterative refinement or an outer iteration that solves a nonlinear system; and in other situations one may need to use higher precision arithmetic<p>[MFIX is the NETL CFD described in the article]<p>It feels a bit odd for the authors to declare the 200x speedup over fp64 runs on Joule, followed by &quot;we don&#x27;t know if these results at a lower precision are acceptable.&quot;<p>very cool stuff regardless. 18 GB of SRAM on the same (very large) chip is insane.')
