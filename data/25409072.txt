This author is dealing with several people who sat down and sequntially copied 35-45 plot twists&#x2F;details on a page by page basis.<p>If you take 45 sequential, critical, unique lines of code or equations from a patented, copyrighted project, you could be in a lot of trouble. I think it is okay to take less than 14 sequential, unique plot elements but I&#x27;m not sure about how this would apply to lines of code made up of proprietary equations.')
