Item(by='Tuna-Fish', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611840915, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25919205, text='&gt; Since you asked, here&#x27;s one non-truth:<p>No I didn&#x27;t. I specifically asked for an FCC or FAA reg that SpaceX has broken. This is a very different thing.<p>&gt; If you believe it&#x27;s okay to lie in FCC filings so that you win awards and change policies, then that&#x27;s a valid opinion to hold.<p>That&#x27;s not an opinion I have, and I don&#x27;t actually believe your claims about them lying are correct here (you seem to assume that FCC is composed of idiots), but regardless, it&#x27;s completely irrelevant to the point. Even if they do that, my point that once FCC or FAA puts something official on paper, SpaceX treats the words as holy remains.<p>Look back at the beginning of this thread. Someone made a statement that can be boiled down to &quot;SpaceX ignores FCC regs&quot;. They do not do that. My entire, and only, point here was that they do not do that. You apparently seemed to take that as a &quot;SpaceX is good&quot; statement, and have argued against it with essentially entirely random &quot;SpaceX is bad&quot; statements. How the f is the failure rate of SpaceX satellites even remotely connected to anything here? Or did you just jump to it because you wanted to say something negative about SpaceX.<p>So I ask again: Do you know of a single case where SpaceX broke or ignored FCC regs? Not things where they did something you think as bad, but where there was a rule, and they broke it. That&#x27;s a simple question.')
