Marlinspike is misspelled throughout the article as &quot;Merlinspike&quot; &amp;<p>2. This article is super mamón. That&#x27;s a word here in Mexico I&#x27;m not sure how to perfectly put into English, but here are some examples from the article:<p>&gt;Open Whisper Systems led by Moxie Merlinspike, who is behind Signal, is and was never behind freedom.<p>&gt;People died for freedom, they are still dying and struggling around the globe. Then someone comes and stomps over every ideal which human society ever build up until this point in history and proclaims themselves the world leader! Think about it!<p>I think in English I might say something like &#x27;Oh please&#x27;, or &#x27;stop wanking yourself so hard&#x27;.<p>The core message of &#x27;I would prefer a decentralized messaging service and Signal is lacking in that regard&#x27; is severely diminished by the suffocatingly wanky [I want to say mamón, whoever has a better word here please offer suggestions!] tone of this article')
