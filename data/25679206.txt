Take a radiation detector to a large&#x2F;old building sometime that has large granite blocks.<p>For similar reasons note that coal burning power plants add WAY more radiation into the environment than nuclear plants.<p>So humans don&#x27;t create radiation, they just mine it, concentrate it, extract energy from it, and then dispose of it.  So we are just moving it around, not creating additional radiation.<p>Imagine we extract uranium from ocean water, the radiation levels in the ocean would go from low, to even lower.  If we take the nuclear waste and distribute it across the ocean the radiation levels would (at worst) raise to the levels we started with.<p>Based on what I&#x27;ve read all the scientists that are experts in relevant fields say that dealing with nuclear waste is a political problem, not a scientific one.  There are multiple reasonable solutions.  My favorite it making giant spikes out of a mix of radioactive material and glass.  Covering the spike with steel and dropping it where the ocean is deep, near a subduction zone, and the sedimentation rate is higher than the leakage rate.  By the time the spike hits the ocean floor it&#x27;s going fast enough to bury itself deeply, the sediment fills in behind and will keep getting deeper, and the spikes will get sucked beneath the continental plate and not bother anyone ever again.')
