First, you need to be careful to avoid double-counting. If cotton sales account for 5% of the economy, you can&#x27;t go and add to that the money Eli Whitney makes from selling cotton gins to southern plantations. The cost of those cotton gins (rather, the amortized depreciation in the value of those cotton gins) is already baked into the sales price of the cotton. The economy is interconnected, but at the end of the day if the value of exported cotton produced by enslaved people is 5% of the economy, then the whole economy can&#x27;t be singularly dependent on that industry.<p>Second, whether the workers on the plantations are paid labor or enslaved people doesn&#x27;t change the economic calculus for Eli Whitney. He sells cotton gins either way. Back then cotton could be, and was, produced by free labor.
