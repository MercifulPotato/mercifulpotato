Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611165837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25849531, text='&gt; Since Congress makes its own rules, and 51&#x2F;49 is enough to change a rule (&#x27;the nuclear option&#x27;), supermajority would have to be a constitutional amendment... And then 45% would be enough to halt government. I guarantee you this would then happen regularly.<p>That was the problem with the Senate&#x27;s supermajoriy requirements: basically the only thing holding them in place was convention, so they fall in the face of someone willing and able to make unsentimental tactical power plays.<p>IMHO, someone like McConnell would have behaved very differently if he knew his opponents could block him just as easily as he has blocked them.  His apparent effectiveness is almost entirely a result of his greater willingness to hypocritically use then discard convention when it gets in his way.  He&#x27;d never have gotten his tax cuts or judges if he wasn&#x27;t able to bend the rules.<p>&gt; Other systems have mechanisms to force elections if deadlocks are persistent.<p>I think something like that could be a genuine improvement.')
