If the same thing that happened on Wednesday happened in Belarus, I&#x27;m sure a lot more people would be sympathetic toward it. Sometimes, as a last resort, violence is necessary to depose evil rulers. So the most important question is how did we get to the point where a large portion of the country is living in an alternative factual reality, to the point where they think the U.S. is now like Belarus in this sense. Also, generally, how do we align better as society on what is true and not true. And I have to say that I personally think Twitter banning the other side is potentially going in the wrong direction as far as solving this problem.')
