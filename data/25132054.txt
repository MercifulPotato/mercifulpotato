So once I bought in, the money would be tied up for months. Even when I won, after taking into account the withdrawal fee, it would have been a loss. (EDIT: Assuming I deposited the money for that specific market, and it wasn&#x27;t already on the platform facing down a future 5% fee)<p>If there are $0.95 markets that resolve in the near future, then yeah, I&#x27;d roll my money from one to the next. But now I&#x27;m wondering if those are more likely to be correctly-priced. (Because other &quot;investors&quot; are thinking the same thing, right?) So now I&#x27;m just picking up nickels in front of a steamroller.<p>I can&#x27;t remember the exact markets when I saw all these 95 cent shares, but the odds of them failing were far below 1&#x2F;20. Things like Hillary Clinton wining the Democratic nomination, or California voting for Trump. These are the same markets that, within a month of closing, were at 1Y&#x2F;99N.<p>So any market that&#x27;s going to resolve very soon, and is still at 5&#x2F;95, probably represents closer to a true 1&#x2F;20 odds, and now it&#x27;s just regular old gambling :)')
