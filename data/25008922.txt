It only took me a couple of times for me to learn it.<p>Unfortunately, it took only one more time for it to be forgotten, then another few times to be re-learned, then forgotten again, then half-remembered the wrong way, then....<p>I pretty much have it down now, though. The secret to my success: remembering that the differing behavior applies to the <i>source</i> side only. Trying to work out the matrix of possibilities between source, source&#x2F;, dest, and dest&#x2F; is where I usually got lost, until I finally got it through my head that the destination syntax is irrelevant.<p>Now it makes sense: &quot;foo&#x2F;bar&#x2F;&quot; is the directory named &quot;bar&quot;; &quot;foo&#x2F;bar&quot; is the directory entry within foo&#x2F; named &quot;bar&quot;. Copying a directory puts its contents on the destination side. Copying a named thing, whether the name refers to a file or directory, puts that name on the destination side.')
