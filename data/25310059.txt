I find it befuddling how you act as if non-owners of pets are the selfish ones. Let&#x27;s replace &quot;dogs&quot; with &quot;cigarettes&quot;. After all, smokers like nicotine as much or more than dog owners like dogs. Am I also selfish if I don&#x27;t wish to endure sitting next to a smoker on a flight?<p>Lots of things inconvenience me but are inescapable or benefit society at large. Dogs are neither of these things, and the burden of owning them should not be externalized to those who derive no benefit from them.')
