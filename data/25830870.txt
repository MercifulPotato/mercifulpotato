I read it and other classics when I was ~20. Maybe it was my age&#x2F;where I was in my life at the moment, or that I didnt &quot;read into it correctly&quot;, but it was one of the most boring things I&#x27;ve ever read. Nothing ever happened. I&#x27;m on of those the article mentions that would call it &quot;a dud&quot;.<p>At the same period of time I also read Catcher in the Rye and loved it. Not sure if I would feel the same about it today. And maybe Gatsby would have grown on me now. But I&#x27;m not gonna try again, so much other good stuff to read.')
