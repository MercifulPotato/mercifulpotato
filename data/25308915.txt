You have captured the difference between its value to you and its value to the seller, and the ten cents is wealth that didn&#x27;t exist before.<p>This also works for the seller, who sold her apple for $1 even though it only cost her $0.95. She captures five cents of the wealth created by the transaction.<p>Wealth is created because things have contextual value.  It&#x27;s the same when we exchange our labor for money.  They wanted our labor more than the money.  We wanted the money more than the time.  Win&#x2F;win for both of us.')
