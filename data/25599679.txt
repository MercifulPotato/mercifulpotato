Not that this is especially egregious. A more global term would be to call these &quot;treks&quot;. And some of these aren&#x27;t exactly &quot;long-distance&quot; either.<p>I&#x27;ve done the Paine Circuit (which includes the &quot;W&quot;), and would never call it a thru-hike or long-distance. It sounds weird to me to call any loop hike a thru-hike.')
