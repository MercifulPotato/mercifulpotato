More concerning was the loss of equipment.<p>Its like chess. Once the King&#x2F;Capital had fallen, the war would have been over, wouldn&#x27;t matter how many pieces are left on the board.<p>&gt;Again no, the blockade was later.<p>Rationing started in January 1940, the German U-boats were successful until Bletchly started cracking their navel codes, and that they managed by someone climbing into a sinking German sub.\n&quot;Die Gl√ºckliche Zeit&quot;<p>&gt;again, if the UK had no airforce, they wouldn&#x27;t have had air superiority. Which meant that the german airforce could have dominated the channel and harassed the British navy.<p>Its a matter of perception, force projection through the use of Radar meant Britain could spread what was left of the RAF in a manner that made the Germans think they were much larger than they were, when truth be told another month or so targeting the RAF instead of cities and they would have had that air superiority.<p>&gt;Second, should they take a port, they have to keep it stocked up with fuel, ammo and arms.<p>Not really, they captured Paris in a few days, London would&#x27;ve been quicker. \nBut I doubt it would have come to that, if Britain hadn&#x27;t known the invasion was cancelled they would most surely have surrendered.')
