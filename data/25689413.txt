People are charged and convicted of such crimes every election cycle. In a civil matter, a case is decided based on the preponderance of the evidence, not on the extraordinary nature of it.<p>I, too, will accept the outcome of the courts. What other recourse is there? But that doesn&#x27;t mean the conversation is over. You can walk away. You can&#x27;t shut people up. Well, you can try, and some actively are as we speak, but I vehemently oppose such efforts.')
