If I plug Ethernet into my home router it ends up killing all other ethernet links on this router in about two minutes. I unplug it and things come back to life in under a second.<p>The thing also has a habit to produce EM interference that makes WiFi useless. Would you believe, running a ping and wrapping the device&#x27;s cord in tin foil back and forth and you can see the packet stop dropping and start again.<p>Crazy.')
