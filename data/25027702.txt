The loss of trust from public is not because the system is simple or complex to understand. It is much deeper than that. Even if the voting process was simple, public trust has been eroded by people like Trump across all disciplines, and have propagated through a large percentage of his voter base - voting, health, climate, etc.<p>We need to get back to where average Joe the Bartender doesn&#x27;t need to delve into the election process to call it &quot;FAKE NEWS MEDIA IS TRYING TO STEAL THE ELECTION&quot;. We need to get out of the rut of &quot;If I can&#x27;t verify it myself, it must be false.&quot; There are a lot of things you can&#x27;t verify yourself - the measuring tape you have at home requires that you trust the manufacturer for its accuracy. No one asks for a NIST certificate and proof that it traces to the original standard of a meter. Or the pharmacist who gave you the pills. Or that the money is safe in your bank.<p>We trust our doctors, our scientists and our institutions. That&#x27;s how the society works. Please stop the nonsense of empowering each citizen to make their choice of truth - because they would be pretty horrible at evaluating it.<p>I personally think that voting should be based on physical ballots and ink&#x2F;paper. Not electronic. Yes, it is painful but there is a physical evidence to every vote, not some transaction line in the database - although we already trust our banks with the bank balance.')
