Most of the public articles I saw on it were sensationalistic pieces from far-right news sources, and I flagged those. I upvoted one sanely written scientific paper on the subject, and posted this because it was also not sensationalistic.<p>The problem is that if we discuss the possibility or the suspicion in public, a lot of people are going to run all the way to it being a certainty. This could lead to some fairly destructive geopolitical consequences with the worst case scenario being a world war that could kill far more people than the virus. It is prudent to be careful and maintain a high standard of evidence just like we should in our justice system: &quot;innocent until proven guilty.&quot;')
