And that&#x27;s the logic of making drugs like heroin <i>illegal</i>.<p>I think I understand your point, but it&#x27;s a point that is really difficult to articulate coherently. There are many subtleties in arguments that propose more compassionate--for lack of better phrasing--public responses to addiction. And it starkly exposes some paradoxes at the heart of human legal systems, including notions of volition and accountability. I think that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s such a difficult public policy issue. But if don&#x27;t appreciate the inherent tensions at play we&#x27;ll never understand why the other person doesn&#x27;t agree with whatever proposal we put forth.<p>[1] Where issues == dysfunction, otherwise we&#x27;re just restating a more general truism that all behaviors are consequences of each person&#x27;s history and state.')
