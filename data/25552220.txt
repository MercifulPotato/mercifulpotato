The timing for this was finicky, to the point that the cheap 1130 wasn&#x27;t capable of doing this fast enough, which was solved by IBM by making it run at a higher clock speed when at interrupt level 1. As you might imagine many of those machines spent a lot of time at interrupt level 1 doing things unrelated to printing')
