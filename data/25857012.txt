Not how it works or worse yet, how it will <i>know</i> how to self-correct.  What particular force decides that the friction on some surface will briefly rise and cause the gun to jam?  How does it know to do that?<p>In all of the paradox-forbidding time travel scenarios, nobody has ever mentioned anything deeper than &quot;Well, uh, reality just won&#x27;t let that happen.&quot;  If I right now posit that each time travel scenario spawns an intelligent angel whose sole job it is to dash about a closed timelike curve invisibly nudging away paradoxes through minuscule miracles of improbability, that&#x27;s quite literally more than you&#x27;ll see written about in these situations.')
