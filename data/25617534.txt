City maps are generally copyrighted and cannot be used in OpenStreetMap. Google has paid for access to proprietary address data. Osmand isn&#x27;t a source of data, it is not at fault here. OSM contributors need to add addresses manually by walking down the street and using an OSM mobile app like StreetComplete to fill in the gaps.')
