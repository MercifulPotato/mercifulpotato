Obviously, if you need to defend yourself you don&#x27;t have too many options.<p>But why the elite of a nation will start a war will all the consequences and the danger of loosing territory. Of course, this elite believes they will never suffer the consequences of war. That&#x27;s why nuclear weapons are a terrifying deterrent.<p>However, something I read recently was very illuminating: every time somebody decides to go to war, believes it is going to be short and quick. You don&#x27;t start a war when you don&#x27;t believe you have a clear advantage. We can also see that many times this thought was wrong and led to lengthy with a high cost on human lives.')
