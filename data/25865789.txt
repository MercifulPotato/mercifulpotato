Item(by='Daho0n', descendants=None, kids=[25866611], score=None, time=1611270046, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865553, text='I don&#x27;t know where you read this but it isn&#x27;t true.<p>&gt;only requires the inspection at regular intervals, not after every repair.<p>This is how it is in Scandinavian countries too by EU law (well, in EU member states, I don&#x27;t know about Norway). It is inspection every 4 years or if it is a vintage car (30+ yro) every 8. You also don&#x27;t need &quot;approved parts&quot; (what does that even mean?) and I can freely buy parts from the US and Germany and use if I want to and have done so (I have a US-only model motorcycle).<p>The manufacture have to get all their car types certified by the state, like how NCAP crash-test one of each model, and if it is certified in one EU country it is in all. But if you <i>change</i> the car significantly (like upgrade an old 80&#x27;s Trans-Am with modern parts) you have to get it certified all over again for that one car as it is now a unique untested car. Possible but extremely expensive. Sure it doesn&#x27;t give you the freedom to drive some of the homemade monstrosities some drive in the US but it also doesn&#x27;t block niche cars or vintage cars.')
