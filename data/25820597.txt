In terms of shortcut-ability VS Code plays in the top on par with emacs, vim and KDE. You are complaining about the missing 0.1%, not something like &gt;50% of lacking features.<p>Also, your original complain was that the shortcuts are &quot;arbitrary and donâ€™t seem to be logically organised&quot;.
