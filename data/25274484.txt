If you want a cheap air based solution then get an Apache Helicopter and a rocket pod filled with APKWS Hydra rockets and some Hellfire missiles just in case something actually dangerous pops up.<p>Do you know what&#x27;s even cheaper than that? Good old fashioned bullets. Artillery and armored fighting vehicles will never die out because they don&#x27;t cost ten thousands of dollars to operate per hour.<p>When you are holding onto ground for 24&#x2F;7 you can&#x27;t afford such an expense.')
