They&#x27;re generally populated by journalists who can actually write or have huge notoriety (Glenn Greenwald and the like) who are writing substantive news and not JS tutorials.  I think &quot;freedom of speech&quot; in time will be promulgated as metered and well thought out arguments that don&#x27;t seek to slander or directly attack any singular person.  This is how real adults talk, not how activists talk.<p>To be fair, Medium is shit.  It&#x27;s already started to become susceptible to similar &quot;creator negatives&quot; that have emerged on YouTube in the last 5 years (Casey Neistat personified this trend).  People now just write clickbait &#x2F; click-driven sharticles that sell ads.  Granted, it&#x27;s still better than what the NYT generally publishes.<p>Moreover - the boomer concept of physical newspaper delivery is equivalent to how millennials perceive well structured html &#x2F; css emails that contain &quot;news&quot; or &quot;journalism&quot;.  It&#x27;s a place I expect to see longer-ish form content and it&#x27;s not in an app or platform that wants me to look at ads, boobs or something else they want to glue my eyeballs to.')
