There are photos showing people that have Nazi symbols. One example is this guy in the “Camp Auschwitz” hoodie [1]. He also was present in a photo from the inside of Capitol, means he actively participated. There are more examples.<p>I had such a similar conversation with coworkers one time during lunch. I said that I had just seen a Nazi on a bike next to the office. One of my coworkers tried to argue, that not every biker was a Nazi and maybe I had jumped to conclusion too soon. Which of course is true, not every biker is a Nazi, but the one I’d seen had had a swastika and SS bolts tattooed on his shoulder.<p>And yes, there were looters during BML protests.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nypost.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;neo-nazis-among-protesters-who-stormed-us-capitol&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nypost.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;neo-nazis-among-protesters-who...</a>')
