The idea of some impartial body of judges who can strike down laws or in the case of qualified immunity just make them up is absurd.  Do you think that the fact that judges often split 5-4 along ideological lines is just a coincidence, or that conservatives put such a high importance on the court during the last election so they can elect an &quot;originalist&quot;?  The garbage passed by Roberts about &quot;balls and strikes&quot; is insulting, and the fact that people blindly accept it is beyond me.')
