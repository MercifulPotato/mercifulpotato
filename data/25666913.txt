Complete nonsense. It&#x27;s not only sold on Amazon, but on several other otherwise-not-that-dodgy sites as well.<p>The author even has an Australia-based business selling &quot;licenses&quot;, &quot;certifications&quot;, &quot;professional development&quot; etc. Blokdijk&#x2F;Blokdyk (he spells his name inconsistently) looks like a typical conman with a small number of Schroedinger accomplices and blindsided useful idiots.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theartofservice.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theartofservice.com&#x2F;</a><p>I get the vibe that if you sign up with them, you end up as a &quot;consultant&quot;&#x2F;&quot;affiliate&quot;&#x2F;&quot;coach&quot; spending your time acquiring new nodes in the network... Maybe there&#x27;s a scammy MLM-component, maybe not, it&#x27;s not spelled out, but I&#x27;ve seen that before even when it&#x27;s not obvious from anything public.<p>I&#x27;d be surprised if their business would hold up to legal scrutiny.<p>And given that, who are these purchasers of his books on Amazon, then? I can&#x27;t imagine anyone genuinely buying this and not asking for a refund. Is it just him buying from himself to boost his image, or are they that good at selling snake-oil?<p>------------<p>Then take a look at this, one of the top results I got when searching (warning, scam and probably contains malware): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iv.0li.ru&#x2F;books_db&#x2F;?q=OFdIalBBN1dvcU1DbThiNTJIOVp0YStwRVNyRHBpWmdmZmlCMDlvMk8yUHUrS1ZWczVleWNXQXJXOGYyckE3VEtGaUwvYm5BS0ZJUHdNYWEwVk5UMUg4aW0xcVAyekVVL0hZM2pvbFJTcHZpLzNzdThoekZpVUZ4T2NUaXlmNVg2alIyMlFod1N1UENxTEVwVEhGbmlUL0JVM0hZY3BYNHlVOFhXejNneFg0U2JXSDk3YmswZU91MUFHUkRObjBzVllnNUtRR3V3Z3A3dUwvazFlcTlxT1c4dDIvdDhwNE8vaVh2b25MaFUrOD0=&amp;enc=1&amp;id=536" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iv.0li.ru&#x2F;books_db&#x2F;?q=OFdIalBBN1dvcU1DbThiNTJIOVp0YS...</a><p>This is the most clever piracy-scam site I&#x27;ve seen.
