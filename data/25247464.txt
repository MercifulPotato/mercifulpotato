Some feedback, maybe not specifically for your implementation, I think these are the reasons I&#x27;ve never gotten that into Mahjong even though I really like these kind of games.<p>- Some of the bricks are too similar for me. Red symbol with a smaller black symbol above. As those symbols are meaningless to me, I&#x27;m unable to pattern match quickly. (It&#x27;s probably the standard look, but having variations would be nice)<p>-  I have trouble with the depth perception, it&#x27;s not extreme enough for me to intuitively know if a brick is available or not. If anything, fading those blocked just a tad would be very helpful to see it at a glance.<p>What I find enjoyable when playing puzzle games is to &quot;turn off my brain&quot; and just do it on intuition&#x2F;pattern matching&#x2F;experience. I feel I&#x27;m unable to do this here, it takes a lot of cognitive effort to search for the bricks, instead of actually solving the logic of the game. Which to me often makes Mahjong more of a hassle than other type of games.<p>- Whats the flower pot for?')
