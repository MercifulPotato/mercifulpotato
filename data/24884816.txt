I don&#x27;t think getting the size of my rooms will be that much of an improvement. They can infer maybe how much money I have, but they can probably already guess that from my address and my credit card company also knows. It&#x27;s not even clear that the data about my rooms is transferred to Facebook.<p>I don&#x27;t think making better targeted ads is the play here.
