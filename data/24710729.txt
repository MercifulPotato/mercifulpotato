This is a case about Google&#x27;s intention for copying the Java API. Oracle is claiming that Google copied their API because it was easier than designing a new language; Google is claiming that they did it for interoperability reasons.<p>There is no distinction between the two because these things are presented as <i>evidence</i> of Google&#x27;s intent, it&#x27;s not proof. There&#x27;s no line. Google&#x27;s case would be much stronger is Android-Java could run most Java software unmodified but it doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll lose just because it&#x27;s not true.')
