The new &quot;WebView2&quot; from Microsoft is powered by Chromium Edge so it should be a lot closer to Electron in practice (though still, updated at user&#x2F;system pace [just now on the much faster Chromium Edge cycle rather than the slower Windows cycle], not developer pace which is often the specific draw to Electron).')
