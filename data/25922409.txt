You don&#x27;t have to cut it at all in order to flatten it, if you allow as much stretching and bending as you want.  \nSo, 0 holes.<p>If you want to consider a more restrictive collection of modifications, like, say you want to preserve angles or something inside the shape, then that would be a different question.  \nUh, I guess if you had a surface which was generally smooth but possibly has some boundaries and&#x2F;or corner edge things, and&#x2F;or corner point things (e.g. sticking two cones together), you could also ask about how many cuts combined with conformal maps [edit : I think conformal maps isn&#x27;t the thing I&#x27;m looking for. Yeah, I think I&#x27;m looking for something related to developable surfaces maybe] would be needed to flatten such a thing out? (so this could maybe produce a similar question for which the  one or half or whatever cut between the edge of the cone and the center, could be an answer?)')
