I&#x27;ve seen people use entire plastic products they attach to their upper torso that seem great, as (1) I&#x27;m not confident on my knot making skills (and I have a lot to learn already) and (2) maybe that stuff distributes the weight around better?<p>But: maybe slings built out of whole cloth like the one shown in the picture are better somehow for parental attachment, and the structured kangaroo carrier is halfway a stroller. Maybe that&#x27;s not even the tradeoff and there are other health and hazard considerations (e.g. sometimes I get hyperfocused enough that I can forgo lunch; should I carry my child on my chest rather than my back so I&#x27;m better aware of her status?)<p>I want to know a lot about this subject and don&#x27;t even know what questions to ask.')
