Item(by='GordonS', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608588763, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25499876, text='Yes, the plan is to use that cash until we take pensions from 55 (or probably later if the gov moves the age forward); I meant the pensions weren&#x27;t included in the â‚¬500k I quoted, which is a mix of cash, stocks, bonds and P2P lending.<p>I&#x27;m pushing 40, so there&#x27;s another 10 years to build up the cash&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;bonds&#x2F;lending pot further, and another 15 to build up the pensions further (well, hopefully of course). Might even choose to retire before 50, since I&#x27;ll have enough that I&#x27;ll have the option of trading off yearly withdrawals vs working longer.<p>I think my point still stands: software engineers in Europe earn less than those in SV (and it&#x27;s important to remember than SV is an outlier even on the US), but you can still live a very comfortable life, save a lot, and retire early (even if not quite as early as 50), all while working far fewer hours and living in a society that provides free healthcare, education (including higher education in Scotland) and unemployment safety nets, and where society looks out for everyone, not just &quot;number 1&quot;.<p>Edit: forgot to also say that the company pension has not always been as great it is now, and to also mention that 2&#x2F;3 of our pension pot is actually in person pensions (SIPPs).')
