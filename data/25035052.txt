You can probably buy a cooler to put it in.  And you get a week to use it after thawing, so if there is a break in the supply chain you only need to detect it and announce a vaccination clinic to that area. There might be some small town that gets 100% vaccination early on just because the truck broke down nearby and so local doctors were suddenly called upon to vaccinate their whole town just to use doses that couldn&#x27;t be shipped any farther.')
