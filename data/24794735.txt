Just because it can be misused isn&#x27;t reason to banish it altogether.<p>In the end, readability and maintainability of the code is primary concern. I don&#x27;t really care for those fads that say &quot;you should absolutely ban switch statements&quot;. I look at these as a collection of tools that help me make the code more readable.<p>Usually radical statements like this come from people that will take the simple naive code and make it completely incomprehensible for exactly opposite effect that the &quot;best practice&quot; was supposed to achieve.<p>Heck, there are even good uses for goto that make the code more readable as long as you follow accepted convention and don&#x27;t try to be fancy with it. When I spent couple of years working on embedded ANSI C applications I often used it to make complicated inner loops (like reading and parsing input from device) more readable.')
