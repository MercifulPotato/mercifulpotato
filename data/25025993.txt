Plus, we could talk about how external sata just isn&#x27;t very good as a user experience, while usb is.<p>I haven&#x27;t shopped for really cheap storage hardware lately but I question that there&#x27;s really an area where sata could be a cost win.<p>&gt; And keep in mind that nowadays the price point of a fully kitted raspberry pi is already close to 100$.<p>There&#x27;s a really wide variance there, though - you can get a lot done for under $50.')
