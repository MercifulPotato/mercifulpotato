Whenever I go from a red zone to a green zone, I squirt a nice big splash all over my hands. For a normal candybar smartphone, it shouldn&#x27;t be too much trouble to pick up the phone while doing this and treat it like a third hand.<p>In my case, I own a Cosmo Communicator which has a qwerty keyboard, which means I have to be a little less liberal with the alcohol, and I usually use a tissue. But it still takes less than 10 seconds. Squirt, wipe, done.')
