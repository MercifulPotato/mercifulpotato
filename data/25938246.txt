Item(by='Robotbeat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611808709, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25937732, text='Yeah, the Tesla plugs are objectively better than the &quot;standards.&quot; I own 2 non-Tesla EVs, and using a Chademo charge plug is actually kind of comical. A Tesla supercharger plug (which can handle 5 times the power the typical Chademo plug does) is basically the same size as a regular L2 plug, maybe even slightly smaller (big cable, however), and only one port is needed for both L2 and Superchargers.<p>In an ideal world, everyone would just standardize to what Tesla uses because it&#x27;s the best. The only exception would be ports that support 800V charging, but that is extremely rare, still (basically, Porsche?).')
