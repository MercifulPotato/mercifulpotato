It&#x27;s more extractive. The point of buying a piece of software is the same as buying capital equipment - purchase once, and have it work &quot;forever&quot; (and since software doesn&#x27;t rot like real equipment, this should be even more true).<p>What i would pay a subscription for is live&#x2F;in-person support.')
