For Linux they provide a Cypress wrapper for libusb and some examples, that was straightforward.<p>For the ARM firmware, there is a short document called &quot;Using the FX3 SDK on Linux Platforms&quot;- it was pretty straightforward.  It&#x27;s arm gcc, plus a qt-based program called &quot;cyusb_linux&quot; to interact with the FX3&#x27;s bootloader (you program it over USB).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cypress.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;software-and-drivers&#x2F;ez-usb-fx3-software-development-kit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cypress.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;software-and-drivers&#x2F;e...</a><p>You can use Eclipse if you want (they have some kind of support for it), but I just used the Makefile in the example projects.<p>The ARM firmware uses ThreadX RTOS, but the actual application is pretty small (and the space is very limited as I recall).<p>The only stupid thing is that they have this thing called GPIF-II designer, which I think is a Windows-only tool.  The final output is a table in a C header file.  I think it&#x27;s a .NET program, so I think it would be easy for them to support it in Linux, but they don&#x27;t.')
