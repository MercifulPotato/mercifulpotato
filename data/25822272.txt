Item(by='dane-pgp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610981349, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25819861, text='&gt; Is there an architecture with on-device authenticators where you don&#x27;t have to trust the device manufacturer? The use of SE&#x2F;Keystore is a red herring here, no?<p>I was trying to draw a distinction between the OS (which could in principal be built from a trusted set of source code) and the firmware controlling the tamper-proof SE&#x2F;Keystore.<p>In the case where the SE&#x2F;Keystore is controlled by something like the Intel Management Engine, that distinction might be meaningful, but you&#x27;re probably right that in general if you don&#x27;t trust the device manufacturer then it doesn&#x27;t matter how the SE&#x2F;Keystore is implemented or managed.<p>Moreover, I suppose if you trust the OS to be doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, the only things a malicious SE&#x2F;Keystore can do are cause a denial of service or fail to keep your secrets (in the worst case by broadcasting them with a hidden antenna).')
