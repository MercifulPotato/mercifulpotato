So are my kids who are being harassed by the educational system and labeled &quot;white&quot;. This is reverse racism! Race is not a scientific concept either! Can we stop using it and calling people &quot;white&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, etc.?! I&#x27;m not even white per se - I&#x27;m only perceived as &quot;white&quot;, because I&#x27;m not dark-skinned during the winter when I see no sun. How is this humane? How is this progress? How is &quot;white and inherently racist&quot; not hate speech, but it&#x27;s allowed.')
