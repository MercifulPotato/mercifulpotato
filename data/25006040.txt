May be right, may be wrong.  Trump did in fact try this at one point, but it was shot down by the house.  Doesn&#x27;t really reveal how many voters would support it, though.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.defensenews.com&#x2F;congress&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;23&#x2F;us-house-votes-overwhelmingly-to-bar-us-exit-from-nato&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.defensenews.com&#x2F;congress&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;23&#x2F;us-house-vot...</a><p>&gt; It&#x27;s just that your point doesn&#x27;t carry much weight.<p>That&#x27;s a baseless assertion until you explain why.  Why shouldn&#x27;t the US polity reconsider it&#x27;s attachment to NATO?  What are the bad outcomes?  Bad for whom?  And what are the good outcomes for citizens? (eg. say, for instance, <i>but not exclusively</i>, less taxes, or money spent better else where)<p>What does it mean to the people?  That is the central question of democracy.  And my ultimate point is that&#x27;s what should be driving whether the US continues with NATO.  And I think that carries weight with anyone who believes the US should be a democracy')
