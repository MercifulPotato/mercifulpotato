Item(by='lxe', descendants=None, kids=[24915614, 24915621], score=None, time=1603863091, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24914501, text='&gt; Hoping to have his account reinstated and continue selling on the site, Govani put off the decision. He received a total of 11 emails from Amazon each giving him different dates at which time his inventory would be destroyed if he hadn&#x27;t removed it.<p>&gt; &quot;After being unable to resolve the matter following several appeals as part of our dispute resolution process, we informed this seller six separate times that they needed to remove their inventory from our store by specific dates or it would be destroyed,&quot; she said. &quot;The seller failed to request to remove their inventory by the dates provided.&quot;<p>I understand the core point here -- Amazon does have the upper hand when making deals with 3rd party sellers. But this is on the seller: he stored his inventory at Amazon, who decided they want to break their deal -- then he failed to move his inventory after what seems like a very lengthy communication, so they ended up doing what they said they would.')
