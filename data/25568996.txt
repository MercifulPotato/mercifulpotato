Even then, transparency didn&#x27;t seem to be supported?<p>Heirloom actually looks the most useful&#x2F;mature. At least the output looks pretty&#x2F;someone cared enough to make the example files pretty, there&#x27;s actual documentation. Limitations are still there (having to convert bitmaps to EPS?). I will say I&#x27;m at least slightly impressed by `gpresent`, which is like beamer (so for making presentations), and built-in hyphenation support.<p>I still don&#x27;t get Neatroff. It&#x27;s compatible with&#x2F;implements a lot that Heirloom does, but then the font support is worse again? It&#x27;s an impressive project though, the source is very readable, and RTL&#x2F;LTR support. Less impressive is the lack of a license - I think it&#x27;s ISC, based on a single comment, but who knows?<p>---<p>A repository and a makefile are distinctly different than an installer. Random macro packages that may or may not be on GitHub are different than `tlmgr`. Piping stuff around and having to convert images is different than just one command. GUI editors. Example documents (like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;texample.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;texample.net&#x2F;</a>). That is what I mean by ecosystem.<p>XeTeX outputs PDFs by default (granted, via xdvipdfmx), and can also include bitmaps directly (again, granted it needs graphicx or something). All TeX stuff isn&#x27;t without it&#x27;s warts, and seems overly complex (pdfTeX&#x2F;XeTeX&#x2F;XeLaTex&#x2F;LuaTeX&#x2F;ConTeXt, etc). But in practice, it kinda somehow just works (until it doesn&#x27;t).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rhaberkorn&#x2F;gpresent" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rhaberkorn&#x2F;gpresent</a>')
