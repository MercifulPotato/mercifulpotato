Chalfant in a tentative ruling issued Tuesday to a legal challenge from the California Restaurant Association.<p>Why is the judge trying to evaluate the object-level claim by the state? Isn&#x27;t the legal question here simply one of authority? Is there some kind of standard in the emergency powers law that says they have to meet some scientific-evidentiary threshold?<p>Curious if anyone has more insight into this.')
