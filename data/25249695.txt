Does Apple prohibit that?<p>I remember the days of very little Apple compatible software on the shelf at retailers, and no games. I was probably one of the first students to use a MacBook with OSX for CSCI 101 because many classes required Windows. That was lack of freedom. The App Store has more software than any other distribution channel at any point in my life.<p>Edit: I also love freedom from malware, which I understand is probably a temporary situation. But it’s been a good run so far.')
