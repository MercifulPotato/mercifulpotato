Lloyd argued that you could more easily detect an object against a bright background if, instead of merely reflecting light off it, you exploited a quantum connection between particles called entanglement.<p><i>Every photon has a frequency that determines its energy.</i><p>Quantum theory says, weirdly, that a photon can have<p><i>multiple frequencies at once</i><p>—until it’s measured and “collapses” randomly to one frequency or another.<p>Even weirder, <i>two such photons can then be entangled</i> so that their frequencies, although uncertain, are correlated:<p><i>They are sure to be identical whenever they’re measured.</i>&quot;')
