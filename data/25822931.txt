Nothing is going to de-throne Python in the next five years and it is EXTREMELY unlikely that anything will de-throne it in 10 years.  Any language that replaces Python in these tasks will need to be significantly better, and Julia just isn&#x27;t that.  Incremental improvement in a few areas that reek of premature optimization is not going to be a compelling argument for the masses.<p>The language that de-thrones Python has not been invented yet, and it will probably need some sort of hardware-coupled advance to have a chance (e.g. if the next big leap in mass-produced hardware were to drop 4K cores into a cheap SoC then a simple scripting language that handled internal data and execution concurrency might take over.)  Julia is nice, but if anything you are probably going to see more migration from MATLAB and similar older dead-ends to Python over the next five years than you are to see migration from Python to Julia.')
