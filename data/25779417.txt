We cannot find enough people with enough knowledge to be already productive in it. Not many want to learn it because it is considered pretty niche, and the ones willing to learn will need many months or years to be productive and build with some level of quality, and once they learn they move away to bigger companies which pay more. We end up paying to people to learn to then &quot;graduate&quot; and we end up with a platform built by people that were learning.<p>Some people here say the tooling is great. Compared to what? The editor plugins are terrible, slow, and blow away your CPU doing god knows what kind of indexing. Compilation is slow and takes a lot of time (in CI for example). Libraries for things you give for granted in other platforms (java, javascript, python, ruby) are non existent, implemented in erlang, unmantained, poorly documented, not popular enough, or a combination of these.<p>People are using it for creating traditional CRUD apps, and it is totally overkill. Something you would do in a day with django or ruby on rails takes a lot of time. Ok, you have tons of concurrency and scaling and.....but... unless you are facebook or google or amazon you won&#x27;t need this anyway.<p>Probably all of these things will be solved in the future, but at this moment, using Elixir for real production code in product focused companies is just a terrible mistake in my opinion. Certainly the ideas, the technology, and the BEAM are awesome...and it is technically superior to everything I&#x27;ve seen out there. But from a business perspective, it makes no sense to use it unless you&#x27;re building the next whatsapp or similar.')
