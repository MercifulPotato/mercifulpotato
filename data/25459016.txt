It implies that a solution exists and can&#x27;t be further improved upon. Just because a solution exists, or is the current fashion, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a &#x27;solved problem&#x27;. Beer brewing is a &#x27;solved problem&#x27;.. yet there are some brews you couldn&#x27;t pay me to drink.  Interesting problems are never fully solved, they are simply iterated on over and over. Payment processing was a &#x27;solved problem&#x27; until Stripe came along. Assembly line manufacturing of cars was a &#x27;solved problem&#x27; until Toyota showed Ford how it could be done better.')
