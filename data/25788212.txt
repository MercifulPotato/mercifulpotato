Perhaps they’re just grown up? Kinda crazy: it was exciting to think back then that these people were making careers of this web stuff! And there’s a seeming contradiction I feel when I think now that they’re <i>so</i> polished and professional that I think maybe they’ve lost something. Probably it’s just that the novelty has worn off and I’m not following that particular space as closely. That’s more me than them, I suspect.<p>And meyerweb.com, diveintomark, joeclark.org. When we were introduced to xml and xslt, and don’t forget xsl-fo; and css was the new kid on the block, and xhtml just a glimmer, and you still heard mention of sgml and DSSSL and the difference between valid and well-formed :)  And a couple of flavors of RSS (didn’t find myself on Winer’s scripting.com that much, though), oh, and now there’s Atom!
