AFAIK HP currently recommend you put the controller in AHCI mode for use with linux nowadays. I haven&#x27;t seen versions of their Linux fake-raid driver for a few years now. I think it&#x27;s been retired.<p>Another issue I&#x27;ve seen people report as a reason for the increased fan speed were hdds which didn&#x27;t report temperature properly to the controller so the controller didn&#x27;t know whether the drives were cool or hot.<p>What BIOS&#x2F;iLO versions are you running?')
