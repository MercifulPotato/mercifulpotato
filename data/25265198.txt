It may help to understand their intention.\nI guess maintaining plasma for 300 seconds seems one of their milestones to commercial development.<p>---<p>KSTAR is setting the world record for ultra-high temperature plasma driving every year since raising the plasma temperature to 100 million degrees for the first time in 2018 and maintaining it for 1.5 seconds.\n[...]\nThe fusion reactor aims to reach the stage of maintaining 100 million degrees of plasma at KSTAR for more than 300 seconds by 2025. &quot;Most of the physical variables that act as obstacles to commercialization appear within 300 seconds after the plasma temperature rises to 100 million degrees.&quot; It means that it is no different from that.‚Äù It means that commercial development is possible only after reaching this stage. Director Yoon added, &quot;We plan to maintain it until 30 seconds next year, and then achieve 50 seconds in 2023, 100 seconds in 2024, and 300 seconds in 2025 through facility upgrades.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hankookilbo.com&#x2F;News&#x2F;Read&#x2F;A2020112318570005798?did=DA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hankookilbo.com&#x2F;News&#x2F;Read&#x2F;A2020112318570005798?d...</a>')
