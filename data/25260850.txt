While we were having lunch I asked him about the longtime friend of his (15 years, went to his wedding) who he had framed for extortion. The friend later committed suicide when he got out of jail. This was all happening during the Nikola reverse-IPO process.<p>After a recording of our conversation was posted online, a bunch of women came forward with accusations against Trevor Milton. That and the Hindenburg report are why GM can&#x27;t do this deal anymore.<p>They weren&#x27;t investing anything. They were getting the equity for free essentially, just to let them use the GM hydrogen tech that GM was planning to throw away anyway. So why would GM back out of a deal that was so sweet for them? It was really that bad.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heyamifat.com&#x2F;robb.mp4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heyamifat.com&#x2F;robb.mp4</a>')
