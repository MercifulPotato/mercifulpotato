And, if a company could be bought out then your shares can get paid out that way.<p>But Google has nonvoting no-dividend shares, and I don&#x27;t think they are feasibly going to get bought out without crashing first, so the price isn&#x27;t from that either though. I think it really only makes sense if you think Google is going to issue dividends some day.')
