The knowledge was lost and that is the part that is most relevant here. The factors that caused it, be it the the &#x27;collapse of an empire&#x27; or just one illiterate glassblower&#x27;s creation not being documented before his death (or any other of the tremendous number of reasons) are less material than the fact that we have a chaotic system where we&#x27;re trying to stop entropy.<p>To that end, I don&#x27;t think he needed to consult a historian in order to make his point any more valid, but he could probably have done with a historian proofreader to tidy up any flowery language that might detract from the overall message.')
