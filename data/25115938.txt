It&#x27;s one &quot;if statement&quot; away.<p>And with machine learning we&#x27;re building our biases into the algorithms explicitly; see all those &quot;resume parsers are racist&quot; articles.<p>This is clearly an issue that needs to be dealth with but the problem is that it&#x27;s not a problem we can engineer our way of, we need to confront the biases that we have and try and build ways to expose biases we don&#x27;t even realize we have.<p>This is obviously quite hard and if I had a solution to it I&#x27;d probably be implementing it instead of waxing poetic on HN.')
