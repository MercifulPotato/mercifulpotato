The author should have a way to appeal through an independent state run office that will take the final decision.<p>Maybe it would not make things faster or better, but since public offices duty is to serve the public, it&#x27;s their natural role to respond and resolve disputes, if we let private companies decide on what&#x27;s right and what&#x27;s not, we lose control of the public speech, what we achieved building up democracies.<p>There are a lot of ways in which this setup could be abused by tyrants and dictatorships, but it&#x27;s already happening and letting SN do all the work it&#x27;s not gonna fix it.')
