The main problem with a rotating liquid mirror is that you don&#x27;t get to choose the axis of the parabola, and that axis rotates as the moon orbits the Earth.<p>You may be able to get a decent view of stars drifting through the view, and with enough orbits you could build up a decent picture, but that&#x27;s different from staring &quot;at the same patch of sky continuously&quot;.')
