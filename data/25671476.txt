I sent a message to a few people via iMessage using the &quot;Invite Friends&quot; menu item.<p>When I tried Signal, I saw an empty list and had to add numbers &#x2F; find people myself. Not much in the way of onboarding IMO. My complaints are likely met with &quot;duh, that&#x27;s how it works, idiot&quot;, I believe that&#x27;s just how Signal is designed as it&#x27;s a privacy-centric app.<p>I&#x27;m just looking for a non-Facebook WhatsApp alternative, rather than a complete focus on privacy and E2E messaging, so I don&#x27;t think Signal is &quot;bad&quot; but it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m looking for. I just want Facebook out of my life and its grubby hands off my data.')
