The BEAM in general is a very specialized VM, which is why I used as an example, as the Julia compiler is also a very specialized platform and other languages targeting it would also be just Julia. Like Julia with s-expression, a typescript like extension for Julia that maybe would focus on different tradeoffs by reducing polymorphism in exchange for type checked contracts (but still use the same machinery and ecosystem since it would compile to Julia&#x2F;Julia IR). I really wouldn&#x27;t expect something completely different like the JVM supports (as at this point it would be better to use the LLVM directly).')
