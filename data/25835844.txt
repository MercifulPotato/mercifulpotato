Think of some creative things that WFH uniquely enables and do them. Here are examples of things I&#x27;ve done:<p>1. Planned a 1-hour prank on a coworker over Zoom<p>2. Left work early to play golf all afternoon<p>3. Had a beer at noon once or twice<p>4. Worked on a side projects for about 2-hours during &quot;lunch&quot; one day<p>5. Worked from a lake house I rented for 3 weeks<p>6. Worked from the beach one day<p>7. Finished all my assignments in a 4-day work week and spent the entire day Friday reading books<p>8. Ate extremely lavish takeout for breakfast or lunch<p>When you look back on this time, you&#x27;ll be glad you did these things you would never otherwise do in an office.')
