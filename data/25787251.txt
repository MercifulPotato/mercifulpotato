Eg, the release after Ubuntu 20.04 Focal was Ubuntu 20.10 Groovy. This means that hearing the Ubuntu codename &quot;Bionic&quot; provides some information: it was 4 releases before Focal.<p>But Debian codenames are arbitrarily based on characters from the movie Toy Story, so there&#x27;s no relation to the Debian release.<p>To fix this, I propose for future releases the Debian codename naming scheme be replaced with numbers written out in words. Eg.<p>Debian 14 (fourteen)<p>Debian 13 (thirteen)<p>Debian 12 (twelve)<p>Debian 11 (bullseye)<p>Debian 10 (buster)<p>Debian 9 (stretch)<p>Debian 8 (jessie)<p>This retains the ability to easily search for eg, &quot;Debian Thirteen&quot;, while making it much easier to remember earlier codenames as time goes on.<p>Also unlike Ubuntu&#x27;s alphabetical naming scheme, the number approach doesn&#x27;t have any overflow issues (which isn&#x27;t as big of an issue anyway because Debian&#x27;s provides new releases every 2 years instead of 6 monthly).')
