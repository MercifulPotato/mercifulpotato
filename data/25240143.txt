Things like grpc rule sets are extremely fragmented right now. It&#x27;s a bit of A saying &quot;the B team should maintain the rules&quot; and B saying &quot;the A team should maintain the rules&quot;. As such almost every single language has inconsistent support for everything: code coverage, protobuf, grpc, external dependency management, IDE integration. Also because there&#x27;s no stubby, sponge, or other cool internal tools a lot of the benefits from blaze as a system are not externalized.<p>Also, the docker support in Bazel is pretty &quot;different&quot;. It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not immediately obvious to newcomers how this is meant to work.<p>It&#x27;s getting better every day though.')
