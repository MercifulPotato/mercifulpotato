For some you have to choose e.g. a vegetarian patty to make a burger vegetarian - I&#x27;m confused with this mostly.\nA feature which i would really like is a list of all the meals which I can order nearby restaurant independent and filter them e.g. by vegetarian&#x2F;vegan ones to discover new restaurants.')
