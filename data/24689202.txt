Here was always my take on having them.  They are an indicator that someone might be listening.  Everything can listen now, you&#x27;re phone, your computer, your tv.  Heck even your car.  Things most people don&#x27;t think about. I find them to be fun gadgets that I use and make life more convenient in certain things.  I also keep them around for another reason. Everyone knows they have mics that listen.  To me they are also a visual indicator that something you might say could be recorded.<p>In 1984, they got caught because they thought no one could hear them.  That was their mistake.  What I learned from it (well ok many things), but what that taught me is to be careful if you are going to do something you shouldn&#x27;t.  Never assume that someone isn&#x27;t watching when you&#x27;re doing something illegal.  I&#x27;m just posting signs for everyone else in the house, this area isn&#x27;t secure.')
