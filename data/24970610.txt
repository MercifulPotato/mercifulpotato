(October 2020)<p>At Offchain Labs, we’re building a platform to unlock the full potential of smart contracts, making them private, affordable, and easy for developers. Our working prototype of Arbitrum runs on top of Ethereum and interoperates with native Ethereum contracts and tokens. We make smart contracts easier to develop at scale, with production level security. Our developer tools do the heavy lifting to add a flexible second layer to decentralized application architecture so our clients can focus on business logic and user experience.\nWe are ready to hire a few strong Senior Software Engineers that have an interest in working in the blockchain space. We are looking for engineers who have a knack for approaching problems in unconventional ways and possess production experience with Backend Engineering (C&#x2F;C++, Go, or Rust).<p>Click here to apply!\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;offchainlabs&#x2F;9b024e89-1cb7-43f3-b6f8-c7a2d78636b5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;offchainlabs&#x2F;9b024e89-1cb7-43f3-b6f8-c...</a>')
