Alternatively, if one is inclined to think along darker lines, this was allowed to happen for whatever reason.<p>However, It&#x27;s easy to say this in hindsight now as before he was seen as a &#x27;joke&#x27; for running for the presidency in 2016.<p>But as time went on Trump was becoming known for translating most of his words into action, from protests to policy.
