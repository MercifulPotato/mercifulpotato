The dev experience is pretty good, actually - it &quot;just works&quot; - start it and point your browser at the URL. And certainly no problems setting up env vars or anything basic like that.<p>My only nitpick, and only specifically relating to dotnet, is that config files and env vars differ between Functions and regular ASP.NET Core web apps. I think there is some work going on to fix that, but it&#x27;s taking forever.')
