But I think the dramatically different circumstances of our time are playing a huge role in the distinction you&#x27;re drawing.<p>USW were fighting for the abolition of child labor -- this is not a direct concern for Alphabet employees, thankfully. Actor&#x27;s Equity Association were fighting against McCarthyism and blacklisting (which SAG participated in, and apologized for in 1997).<p>In particular, for the Alphabet union effort, I think their press release[0] is more concrete. I think the goals of increased workplace democracy, pressuring management to prevent pushing externalities, and preventing suppression and retaliation in the workplace are pretty relevant, and would be high on my list for a prospective union for tech workers.<p>Ironically, I think they would draw much more ire if they merely focused on analogous workplace&#x2F;worklife comfort improvements, for Software Engineers at least, given their famed perks. Hopefully the union targets the Alphabet employees who really do need workplace&#x2F;worklife improvements, mostly found in the non-full-time ranks.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alphabetworkersunion.org&#x2F;press&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2021-01-04-code-cwa-google-union&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alphabetworkersunion.org&#x2F;press&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2021-01-04-c...</a>')
