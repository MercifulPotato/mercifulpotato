We need concrete use cases to convince the public that privacy matters and to make it clear that technology can deliver it.<p>For example, in our local swim team, I pushed back on using Facebook live-stream for broadcasting a time trial (parent audience was not permitted due to COVID) and instead we distributed heat videos with a password protected server. It seems other teams went with the convenient approach, and now they are banned from recording (since a few parents, correctly, complained). Since then we have gotten permission to continue what we were doing, because we put privacy first. But even so, this begs the deeper question... why is privacy not the default?  It&#x27;s about monetization (cost) and convenience.')
