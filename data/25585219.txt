It starts with getting into the habit of leaving a little bit early on Fridays. Then people realize that they only have a few hours between lunch and leaving early, so they start checking out right after lunch. Then people realize that if they get in after 9AM on Friday, they don&#x27;t have many hours to get anything done before lunch, so they don&#x27;t want to get started on anything that requires focus. Eventually, Fridays are a short, laid-back day at the office where they catch up on stray e-mails before going home.<p>For those teams, going to a 4x8 workweek has no productivity drop because they weren&#x27;t doing much on Friday anyway. However, for teams that actually get things done on Friday, going to 4x8 or even 4x10 can start to decrease productivity.<p>Productivity and hours spent working aren&#x27;t the only things that matter, though. Going to a 4-day workweek is an easy way to keep employees happy, which is valuable in itself.<p>Also keep in mind that we aren&#x27;t great at judging our own productivity. We tend to perceive percentage of busy time as productivity, and a 4-day workweek will naturally have a higher percentage of time occupied by work than a 5-day workweek. This increase in percentage of busy time can mislead people into thinking they&#x27;re being even more productive on more time-compressed schedules, even if they&#x27;re putting out less work on an absolute scale.<p>Frankly, a lot of companies switch to 4-day workweeks because they can get 80-90% of the productivity while offering employees a perk they can&#x27;t usually get at big companies that pay higher salaries.')
