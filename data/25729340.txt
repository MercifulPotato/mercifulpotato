I run a POWER9 desktop, and the default page size is 64kb. A lot of ... interesting problems manifest.<p>Some filesystems like Btrfs and XFS (iirc) have elements that are page size dependent, and can only be opened on systems with the same page size as the one that made them.<p>Some stuff like Wine (and windows in general AFAIK) assumes 4k &quot;alignment&quot; and doesn&#x27;t like it when it differs)<p>Of course, on P9 you can just change the page size to 4k and be done with it. Apple appears to have only implemented 16KB pages and nothing else, presumably to minimize silicon cost&#x2F;maximize performance (?)')
