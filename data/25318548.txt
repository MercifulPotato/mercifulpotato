You can check this in task manager. The icing on the cake, if you gave a laptop with 2 GPUS(Optimus) is when you can run a demanding 3D app like a game in windowed mode in parallel with other stuff like watching videos on youtube and you can see in task manager how windows uses the external GPU to render the game and the integrated GPU to accelerate your web browser, all running butterly smooth.<p><i>&gt;In fact, their OS is in such shambles and is a disoriented mess with respect to UI consistency.</i><p>True, but that&#x27;s what you get with 30 years worth of built in backwards compatibility. I can run a copy of Unreal Tournament 1999 that was just copied off an old PC with no sweat right after ripping and tearing in Doom Eternal. Can you run 20 year old software on current Apple without emulation? Apple can afford to innovate in revolutionary ways when it dumps older baggage whenever it feels like it and start from a fresh drawing board without looking back, see intel to apple silicon transition. In 2 years x86 apps will be considered legacy&#x2F;obsolete on Mac hardware. Microsoft can&#x27;t really do this with windows so yeah, it&#x27;s a mess of new  GUI elements for the simple stuff and windows 2000 era GUI elements for the deep <i>pro</i> settings. The advantage is that if you&#x27;re an old time Windows user you can easily find your way using the &quot;old&quot; settings and if you&#x27;re new to windows you can do most configs through the &quot;new&quot; GUI without touching the scary looking &quot;old&quot; settings.')
