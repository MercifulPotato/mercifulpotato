Locked-in time schedules, a trend towards very short &quot;bitty&quot; and simplistic videos that don&#x27;t tend to offer any direction when they&#x27;re done.<p>Youtube lectures on the other hand have been immensely valuable, especially if you can find a relevant (university) reading list and&#x2F;or problem sets if they&#x27;re applicable. All you really need as a self-learner is someone to say &quot;head in this direction&quot;. After that I agree with op that finding something fun to do is the best way to learn.<p>On an aside, as a text highlighter (I highlight the text I&#x27;m reading), the javascript &quot;tweet this&quot; pop-up on this site is horrific.')
