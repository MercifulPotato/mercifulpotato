Much lesser. Even while in grad school, I knew that the arc of my career was not going to bend towards tenure. I wrote up what is somewhat disparagingly referred to in my field as an &quot;equipment thesis&quot; and went to industry. But today, I develop scientific equipment, so my equipment thesis wasn&#x27;t so far off base. ;-)<p>But front-line science research can&#x27;t be done without equipment that is developed by engineering teams that include some scientists. Likewise for a lot of important but less glamorous things such as figuring out if your water is safe to drink, or if you have COVID-19. And if those teams are going to include some scientists, then you also need people who get a science education and go into teaching.<p>And in a better world, you might even have a few science educated people who work at various levels of government.')
