A GPU is hundreds of simple ALUs stacked together. Minimal branch handling, no real speculative execution, no reordering buffers, etc... Very simple, very slow &quot;cores&quot;, and just a whole shitload of them &quot;copy&#x2F;pasted&quot; together. Some moderately complex management blocks then distribute work to all those ALUs, sure, but still nothing close to the complexity of a modern CPU core.<p>Which is also why GPUs can be built so large. It&#x27;s much easier for them to handle defects than for CPUs. The loss of a single core cluster on a GPU isn&#x27;t nearly as significant to the product&#x27;s overall performance as the loss of a single core on a CPU, and the amount of transistors you need to turn off to handle that defect is much less.')
