For example, I had not previously heard the term <i>Boston marriage.</i><p>But if you get nothing else out of this, please contemplate the paragraph about her father letting her know that being suicidal because of her endless physical suffering wasn&#x27;t &quot;crazy&quot; or unreasonable:<p><i>Subverting the dogma of his era, he responded that there is nothing sinful in wishing to end oneâ€™s extreme suffering, and gave her his fatherly permission to take her own life if the physical and psychological pain became too unbearable, asking her only to do it in a gentle way.</i><p>People who are suicidal are often people suffering deeply who get told their desire to stop suffering is somehow a mark of insanity or a personal defect. If you know someone who is suicidal, helping them cope with whatever serious problems they likely have is a much better thing than implying they don&#x27;t have any real problems and it&#x27;s &quot;all in their head.&quot;<p>I spent most of my life suicidal. I mostly no longer hurt these days and I mostly no longer feel suicidal. So my opinion is informed by personal experience.')
