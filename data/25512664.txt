It has issues. Those were factored into the price.  But he kept trying to talk me down further because he had a story in his head of what this house was going to mean for his life and it wasn&#x27;t turning out to be a deal that was too good to be true (note: banks reject loans for houses that are too good to be true).<p>On the last back and forth round I offered to meet below the middle and it turned out he wanted me to meet him 3&#x2F;4 of the way. When you consider the overall price of a house and how many % that is, it seems like a smallish thing to disagree over. But if your equity in the house is low, the house hasn&#x27;t appreciated much, or both, a few percent could be a good deal of your profit margin, especially if you count in taxes and repairs like a sober investor, instead of the typical magical thinking about houses as investments.<p>Between us and my realtor we finally convinced ourselves that his dreams were not our problem. I&#x27;m not going to sacrifice my future so someone else can go live their best life - particularly when the goal is for them to <i>live that life without me in it</i>. If you&#x27;re not my child that option isn&#x27;t even on the table. You selfish, selfish bastard.<p>(We called his bluff, he bought the house anyway.)')
