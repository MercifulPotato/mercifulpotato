Looks like a linux, smells like a linux, and performance is way faster than on my linux laptop (purely because the windows laptop hardware is much more beefy, I&#x27;m just saying WSL2 performance isn&#x27;t a bottleneck)<p>- Games, obviously, and I&#x27;m sure you know that. There&#x27;s a non-negligible overlap between gamers and developers. VR games on linux is a no-go at the moment.<p>- Printers. I&#x27;ve never had a linux laptop that <i>just worked</i> regarding scans and printing. Sometimes I works, sometimes (usually) it doesn&#x27;t.<p>- My otherwise well-supported thinkpad has a crappy broadcomm wifi+bluetooth chipset. It&#x27;s just not well supported on linux. I&#x27;ve had to stay in a hotel for 2 weeks covid quarantine, I&#x27;m glad I had my windows laptop with me, as linux didn&#x27;t want to connect to their wifi at all. Bridging wifi from my android phone is another workaround I use<p>- Regarding bluetooth, it&#x27;s bad too. Audio works after a decent amount of manual config (finding the right driver online, the one shipped on ubuntu is the wrong one), but with horrible latency (almost 1sec). My bluetooth mouse is now working without issues, besides a bluetooth systemctl restart from time to time.<p>The bad things about it:<p>- A couple of random BSOD. I have no idea where to even start to debug them. Only 2-3 in 6 months of usage though.<p>- Botched upgrades. This was a bad one, when I bought the laptop, the latest upgrade just didn&#x27;t work, it would brick the laptop. It seems to be a problem with my ryzen cpu, so the only solution was to reinstall and stop all updates until microsoft fixed it<p>- Upgrades in general, they&#x27;re shitty, forced, etc... Nothing new here. I use third-party programs to stop the forced upgrades, so at least I have control over that<p>- Autohotkey is required for basic customization, like shortcuts. I&#x27;m very specific about my shortcuts (I need my bazillion emacs keybindings to work the same as in linux), but ahk makes it work for me.<p>- Some annoying, but non-critical bugs in WSL2. It might get better with time.<p>- Virtual workspaces are now shipped with windows, but their keybindings suck in a non-fixable way<p>There you go. I&#x27;m still a linux guy, I prefer linux and will probably dual boot an ubuntu+i3 once I buy a bigger SSD, but WSL2 makes dev on windows quite painless. All I need for my work is a terminal, emacs and a browser after all.')
