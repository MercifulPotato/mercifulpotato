I had a herniated disc triggered by heavy lifting.  Spent about 10 months in pain (enough that it was a problem but not so much that it was debilitating).  Finally had an epidural after months of PT that was going nowhere and was 100% fine the next day!  I was lucky, the epidural broke the cycle of inflammation that in all likelihood the PT was actually aggravating.<p>BUT....<p>Last year I had another herniated disc triggered by axing down a tree.  This time it was really bad.  I spent two months in debilitating pain unable to move or really do much of anything.  Couldn&#x27;t stand, couldn&#x27;t walk, couldn&#x27;t sit, couldn&#x27;t lay down.  All I could do was dope myself up on narcotics and try to sleep the time away.<p>I had two epidurals.  The first one took the edge off the pain away but I was till unable to move.  The second epidural I actually regressed.<p>So I went and had a microdiscectomy done.  Turns out my nerve had slipped into a canal that had no room for it and was pinched inside.  A week or two of recovery and I felt great again.<p>BUT....<p>I didn&#x27;t change my habits, covid-19 hit, I started working from home where I did not have anything close to an ergonomic setup and my back started to ache again.  This time it was the original disc.  I was doing ok, but it was enough that I knew I should talk to my doctor. A couple weeks later, at the pool, I decided to go off the diving board while my back was slightly bothering, and that slight bother became nearly debilitating pain again and two months of physical therapy.<p>I feel great again, the PT worked this time.<p>What&#x27;s my point?  The injection doesn&#x27;t always work.  PT doesn&#x27;t always work. There&#x27;s lots of ways things can go wrong.  Take care of yourself and be careful, next time you might not be so lucky!')
