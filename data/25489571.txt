Item(by='drzaiusapelord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608498869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25479825, text='&gt;havenâ€™t had any issues with the game.<p>I try to be a kind and generous reviewer and it gets frustrating to hear people try to invalidate my experiences. I have a 2070 that runs this game just fine from a performance perspective but I&#x27;ve encountered multiple broken missions. I play stealth non-lethal, so me finishing a mission usually means lots of saves and a lot of time invested only to be rejected at the end because its too buggy to finish properly.  Target NPCs not spawning, scripting logic errors, hostile NPCs just staring into space, broken pathfinding, broken GPS, etc. Its all here.<p>And as you say, completeness is an issue. Night City feels empty and boring to me. Sure its super pretty but so what? NPCs just give some canned smart-ass one-liner, traffic&#x2F;life&#x2F;pedestrians, etc are all simple robots. There&#x27;s no &quot;soul&quot; in this game like in other virtual worlds I&#x27;ve experienced.<p>Also, so much of it is well written, but honestly, by game standards its where a YA novel would be. Think the first 3 Potter books, not the last 4. Its not challenging art. Its written on the 5th grade level especially Silverhand&#x27;s snotty and dismissive sophomoric politics.<p>Lastly, its all feels so &#x27;last gen&#x27; to me. I&#x27;m doing old school inventory management constantly because the game focuses so much on loot dropping. I can&#x27;t dress up V like I&#x27;d like her to look because I need to use the top armor pieces I have. The driving feels &#x27;cheap.&#x27; The driving GPS is not level aware so it&#x27;ll take you several stories below where you need to be. The world V lives in feels dead, not vibrant and alive, which was their major marketing point.<p>I think the &quot;there&#x27;s nothing wrong with this game&quot; crowd is either being dishonest or are just running and gunning speed runs and avoiding some of the more subtle bugs and don&#x27;t care about this game being anything but a dumb and pretty shooter.')
