(To what extent the individuals themselves vs. their cultures are &quot;collectivist&quot; is hotly debated, but I won&#x27;t wade into that here). To me this seems directly related to the problem at hand: individuals in Japan or Taiwan generally had the <i>freedom</i> to make bad choices, but instead chose not to; individuals in the United States or the UK had the same freedoms but as a whole made different choices.')
