Let&#x27;s try this crowd: We know what colors human faces have, so we can nail those, but coloring a film from, say, the 1950s the way photos from that era looked, is not what the colors back then actually looked like. That&#x27;s just how camera technology was able to capture them at the time.<p>So even if you captured color back then, it probably wasn&#x27;t very realistic.<p>I don&#x27;t think people should stop experimenting, I find these videos fascinating and loved Peter Jacksons film, but the past didn&#x27;t look like you think it did. You&#x27;re just used to it because all the photographs from the era look a certain way but they were limited.')
