It leads to what we have now - which, to me at least, is a frankly unusable operating system. A hodge-podge of 20 years worth of patterns, menus and systems. Some menus in windows feel they&#x27;re in a completely different operating system.<p>This is why they should have &#x27;Enterprise&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; to me - they dont even have to look at different, but it frees one windows kernel team to do whatever they want and not have to worry about supporting loads of legacy systems. They&#x27;ll naturally deviate.<p>It&#x27;s actually kind of ironic to me that the best feature they&#x27;ve released in years (WSL) is essentially jamming another operating system into the mix. Like there&#x27;s not enough going on there already!<p>I&#x27;m reading so much about how good Proton is that I&#x27;m considering dropping windows even for my gaming machine.')
