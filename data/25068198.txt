Item(by='Nullabillity', descendants=None, kids=[25068604], score=None, time=1605174464, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25068115, text='Bitcoin requires a linear history (apart from the genesis block and the currently latest block, every block has exactly one parent and one child). If a block has multiple children, the one with the longest chain (of children) is selected in turn. The child (and its subchildren in turn) that is not selected is called &quot;stale&quot;, and its transactions are effectively undone.<p>This <i>could</i> be a used to try do a &quot;double spend&quot; (send X bitcoins to address A, rollback the transaction, send the same bitcoins to B instead). However, according to the OP&#x27;s analysis that hasn&#x27;t been attempted (yet), and the active chain is far enough ahead that it seems unlikely that the stale chain would ever catch up and overtake it.')
