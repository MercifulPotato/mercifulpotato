This leads to some mild arbitrage where if I live on the border of LA County, I can go over to any city in Orange&#x2F;Ventura&#x2F;San Bernardino County and immediately save 3% off the purchase price.<p>To expect every taxpayer to keep track of where they&#x27;ve purchased items and pay a use tax so that taxes are going to the right places should <i>not</i> be on the burden of the tax payer. I&#x27;m a happy taxpayer and willingly will do so to fund our civic services and public goods, but not when the sale never occurred in the area where I purchased the item. People will find and exploit loopholes the minute they are revealed.<p>California (and some other states) have already gotten around this by requiring new cars registered to pay a tax adjustment if it was previously registered from another state. I don&#x27;t think the state government just has the time or resources to do that for all purchases.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdtfa.ca.gov&#x2F;formspubs&#x2F;cdtfa95.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdtfa.ca.gov&#x2F;formspubs&#x2F;cdtfa95.pdf</a>')
