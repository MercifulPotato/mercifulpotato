It’s better to simply make the item in question become a commodity, so much so that it’s universally accessible to even the poorest members of society.<p>Think of something like paper. Originally it was exceptionally expensive and only available to the wealthy or particular tradesmen. Scraps of already-used paper were reused because the material was so valuable.<p>Today, paper is basically free. In fact, we’ve gone to far in the opposite direction:  people waste paper constantly and it’s an environmental problem.<p>If, in the early stages of paper, we had said “We need to mandate paper for everyone,” I’m skeptical that it would have been commodified. It seems to me that whatever method we use to make internet access easier and cheaper, it probably isn’t going to come from ISPs.')
