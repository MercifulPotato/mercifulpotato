For one, we can make software more accessible to broader society.<p>You are right that many types of software produce orders of magnitude more money than was put in. But if you were to look at the broader workforce and industry, you&#x27;ll find that much software is just a small part of a much bigger machine that has almost nothing to do with software. That&#x27;s where I would rather see more software developers.<p>As it stands, VC pours billions into startups that make 0 money until they can flip the investment dollars on the public market. They stand somewhat isolated from the rest of the economy. That&#x27;s why wages can get so high. Not because the software itself sold billions of dollars worth of service or value.<p>There&#x27;s probably lots of software that doesn&#x27;t get written but would be hugely beneficial to the numerous facets of society, because small businesses can&#x27;t afford a software engineer when competing with SV wages.<p>That&#x27;s me looking at things from afar, I am not in SV, and my experience is on the ground floor of software companies that are producing work for industries that aren&#x27;t software. It&#x27;s a totally different market, and I would rather see more software in this space than making another overvalued software doodad valued entirely for it&#x27;s potential as an advertising platform.')
