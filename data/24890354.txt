However my laptops are gaming grade and most of the time I use one of those as a desktop. And this is how it goes again your list:<p>1) I have 2 &quot;big big&quot; 4K monitors hooked up to my laptop so no problems here. The laptop&#x27;s monitor is not used as the lid is closed.<p>2&#x2F;3) I use external keyboard and mouse. No problems here<p>4) I have 2TB worth of SSD in laptop and I also have huge external drives array.<p>5) Said laptop is sitting on my shelf, I do not even see it. On my desk are 2 huge monitors on arms with VESA mounts and wireless keyboard&#x2F;mouse. Said laptop is also running NOMACHINE so I can also access my few worktations and servers without lifting my butt.<p>6) I have external optical drive but frankly I do not recall single time in a last 3 years when I had to actually activate it.<p>7) I have 2 external 10 port USB 3.0 hubs hooked up to 40Gbps Thunderbolt 3 port of said laptop. Again no problem in this department.<p>8) Yep. Desktop is much better in this department.<p>9) Not my desktops ;) They&#x27;re server&#x2F;workstation type.<p>10) This is how I build my &quot;desktops&quot;. No argument here.<p>11) I do not know what to say about it.')
