This could be due to ad code or custom themes for part of the site.\nThat CSS would include selectors that would trigger different remote image requests for different partial matches on the value of the input.  Based upon what remote URLs were triggered, one could reconstruct all or part of a password.<p>But I get your point. The website should not <i>know</i> the plaintext of your password for an overlap check unless their security practices are really bad.  And if they are that bad, hopefully it is a throwaway password anyway.  A duplicate check could still be done with hashes, but partial hash leaks are NBD.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve had this happen though on password change prompts, which makes me think that the website is storing the value I just entered temporarily in the session.  That&#x27;s still bad even if it isn&#x27;t being persisted beyond that page post though.')
