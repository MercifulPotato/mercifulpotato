It doesn&#x27;t matter what their record is.<p>But for my business? Property can be insured, code can be copyrighted, lawsuits can be filed. I have recourse if one of my employees does something stupid. And on the other side, my employee can quit or sue me if I do something wrong.<p>&gt; how would you explain repeat offenders?<p>People choosing to hire everyone else over felons, leaving them no choice but to go back to the same bad people or the same bad crimes. Why would a felon go back to risking their life on a daily basis against other murderers and muggers when they could have a comfy $12-20&#x2F;hr job in an actual workplace with civilized coworkers?')
