Really?<p>Also why pick on Padilla, why not Jon Husted (Rep, Ohio). What about all the Republican lead states where massive fraud was supposed to have happened? Trump expended no political capital or effort whatsoever on doing anything meaningful about supposed voter fraud, and couldn&#x27;t even persuade any Republican state administrations he had any credible evidence or reason for alleging it. He just gave up immediately at the first hurdle of being asked what he wanted to do and why. In fact he didn&#x27;t even pursue this personally, he just delegated it to some flunkies and walked away from the issue until the next election.<p>How to explain this? It&#x27;s almost as if he had no credible reason for making the claims and the whole thing was just for show.')
