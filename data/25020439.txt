If an app is simply a neutral front end to a distributed set of independent back end services that are not managed by the owner of the app, then the app owner is not responsible for the content. Web browsers clearly match this description as the browser developer isn’t responsible for all the web sites you could visit. But it also applies to email clients, Mastodon clients, arguably even podcast clients and many more.<p>If the client app is only used to access content also owned, curated or managed by the client app vendor, then the client app vendor is on the hook for that content. Audible falls in this category, even though it’s superficially similar to a podcast app, because the app client vendor also owns or curates all the content. Sure there are some odd edge cases, but games streaming services pretty clearly fall into this category, and not the same category as web browsers.')
