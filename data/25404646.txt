I live in Boston, and rioters lit many fireworks in my neighborhood and in front of my house (all fireworks are illegal in Massachusetts) late into the night, for <i>months</i>. I am familiar and friendly with many people in my community, including my neighbor who is a black woman, and she was very displeased with the actions she was observing and experiencing, especially given she is a front-line medical worker who needed sleep to battle COVID.<p>In summation, the protests and property destruction indeed had psychological effects, even if you want to believe they did not.')
