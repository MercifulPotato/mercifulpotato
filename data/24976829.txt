Except that the &quot;spelling&quot; is er, compact.<p>For example, your &quot;real&quot; TLS 1.3 connections have a connection ID in them. That seems sane right? Well, the content of that ID is a bunch of random gibberish, echoed back by the server. It doesn&#x27;t do anything useful at all, it isn&#x27;t identifying anything, it&#x27;s just some random bytes in a system that already has dozens of random bytes that are there on purpose anyway. So why is it there? It&#x27;s there because in TLS 1.2 that connection ID field was used to resume previous sessions and so lots of middleboxes will just assume everything must be fine so long as you fill out the connection ID and then the remote server appears to continue the same session. Such middleboxes can&#x27;t snoop because they don&#x27;t know enough about this hypothetical session which never happened, but since they are just security theatre anyway it doesn&#x27;t matter, your connection succeeds. This makes TLS 1.3 actually work, developing such workarounds by tweaking the &quot;spelling&quot; took about a year.<p>But the security proofs are the same for compact TLS and the &quot;real&quot; TLS 1.3 shipped in your browser. It&#x27;s just that the real thing is &quot;a hack job piled on top of a hack job&quot; because that works.<p>Mathematics doesn&#x27;t care how you spell it, if you&#x27;ve come up with an incredibly convoluted way to do something apparently easy, but the math checks out anyway, it still works.')
