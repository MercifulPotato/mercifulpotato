I&#x27;ve been working on this problem space for a while and decided to write it all out one problem at a time. Yeah this one was quite heavy on the theory department but I plan to follow it up with a demo on how to actually use it. That should be more hands on. The problem was, I felt like I would be immediately asked on the theory behind it, plus there were people already interested so I thought it&#x27;s better to have it explained. I agree with your point though.')
