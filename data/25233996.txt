I&#x27;m reminded of a great essay, &quot;How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart&quot; by David Foster Wallace.<p>He writes about his admiration for a successful pro tennis athlete, her intensity and dedication to her sport, and her strangely vacuous response to the question &quot;How do you do it Tracy?&quot; - which she answers with some vague platitudes. His point is: very successful people are so busy being successful, they&#x27;re so deeply immersed in their craft, that they don&#x27;t seem to even have the conscious introspective wherewithal to articulate what it is they&#x27;re doing. Everything they know about their craft and their life is just so tacit to them. They&#x27;ve either never taken the time to really introspect, again because they&#x27;re so caught up in just winning and getting things done, or they&#x27;re just genuinely incapable of gleaning any wisdom from what it is that they do. So maybe it&#x27;s not particularly useful to take advice from these people after all.<p>Now, this is probably the case for most such people, but there is a very small minority that do eventually cultivate the ability to articulate their internalized understanding and wisdom of their success to others. Maybe PG is one of them. Maybe not.')
