What is taught in school makes it seem very “clean” (I understand there is no time to really cover it in detail).<p>Take the Vietnam War for example - what’s taught in school is the Domino theory, support for a corrupt Southern government, quagmire, withdrawal and fall of the South.  But, if you read through a bit of the Pentagon Papers you pretty quickly get a sense of how nuanced it was and how it wasn’t a single decision to support South Vietnam, it was a complex web of global geopolitics with messy arguments, fears, overconfidence, “fake news”, etc.  And the people making those decisions were not dumb, in fact, they were pretty damn smart and considered a lot of different options and the risks that went with them.  It just didn’t turn out how they thought it would.<p>And then it dawns on you just how much history is repeated over and over.  Sure it’s a little different each time (and those small differences have a big impact), but the same types of things happen again and again.')
