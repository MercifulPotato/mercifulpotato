I am looking for something just like this. I just downloaded Bunch which promises this same thing but with a lackluster&#x2F;missing GUI.<p>Bunch is programmable though, as I&#x27;m sure you know from your market analysis.<p>Does this allow everything Bunch does?<p>Also, what&#x27;s the price? I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with the pattern of new products hiding their pricing until after the user signs up and invests pretty heavily. If that actually works, I need to update my Saas :)')
