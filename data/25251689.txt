Not by many orders of magnitude.<p>You&#x27;re missing my point: that hoarding water is at the expense of anyone else who needs water.  One milliliter, one gigaliter, doesn&#x27;t matter; that&#x27;s still less for everyone else unless and until it is released, and during that time the mere storage of that water externalizes an opportunity cost on everyone else needing that water.<p>&gt; The sun does that for free, and has done for billions of years.<p>Right, because the sun magically drops all precipitation into lakes and rivers, and not a drop of it into the oceans.  I&#x27;m sure the sun has some sort of tracking system that realizes which molecules of water come from where and puts them right back whence they came, right?')
