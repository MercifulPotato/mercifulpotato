One guy waltzes up and steps right into the front of the line. People object to him pushing in, but the guy stays where he is and says &quot;sorry, I&#x27;m business class!&quot;.<p>The airline employees let him do it, and just repeat to us: &quot;Sorry, he&#x27;s business class!&quot; He gets served first, saving literally hours compared to joining the back of the line.<p>At least they were honest.')
