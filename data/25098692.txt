Yes, used for sleep disorders or shift workers to stay awake, but it is really not at all a traditional -etamine stimulant, and it can be extremely effective as an adjunctive treatment for depression, especially used in combination with another medication. Even when medications mostly work, they don&#x27;t always stop all symptoms. Modafinil is what has kept me functional through those times. Hard to get insurance to cover, but if you use GoodRx you can get generics at a reasonable price.')
