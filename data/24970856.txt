It&#x27;s available in blue and black and dries way faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever seen. It doesn&#x27;t feather or bleed on any paper I&#x27;ve tried it on.<p>I used to use Staples Sustainable Earth notebooks, now I&#x27;ve started using their TruRed series. I also use Rhodia notebooks, but am switching to TruRed because they&#x27;re easier to find, cheaper, and handle my other inks better (the rhodia stuff actually performs terribly with all my other inks -- no idea what the deal is).<p>Combined with a 0.3mm Platinum nib I never have any issues. If you&#x27;ve tried Parker Quink it&#x27;s significantly faster.')
