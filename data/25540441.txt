Things like pre-merge code reviews were very hard. If you wanted to send some incomplete code, you sent an email with . tar.gz file attached.<p>With GHE, everyone makes branches all the time. It works great for code sharing or review. And there are unique advantages too, like an ability to run a distributed set of tests on arbitrary unmerged fork&#x2F;branch, which rely on branches being very cheap.')
