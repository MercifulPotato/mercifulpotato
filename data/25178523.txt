It was as cheap as my kitchen scale. Still, I only use it for modernist ingredients like emulsifiers, where small variations can cause big outcome changes. For a quarter teaspoon yeast, yeah just use the quarter teaspoon.<p>Measuring by mass has a lot to recommend it, but converting a volumetric recipe to mass is not worth it. It&#x27;s not as precise a process as you&#x27;d like and will still need ad hoc adjustments.<p>* All scales are drug scales, if you&#x27;re bold enough')
