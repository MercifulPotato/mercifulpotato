All communication between occupants is peer to peer, the room creator has the video controls and any action is relayed to all peers. I built this thing in my spare time because it seemed like a fun idea to be able to stream a video file between a group of friends and it is very much a first pass, things will be broken, features missing, etc. I do plan on expanding it further when I have more spare time but please do comment with any feedback, roast it if you like.')
