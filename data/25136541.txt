We might see fewer ARM-related bugs, but were there many of these anyway?<p>Where I think it&#x27;s a game-changer is in Docker images. A lot of projects only build x86_64 images, M1 means they&#x27;ll build ARM images as well<p>Virtualization tools and host OSes will probably see a huge boost in ARM support as well, but the Raspberry Pi is a bit too limited to really take advantage of these improvements.')
