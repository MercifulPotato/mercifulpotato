If there are two parties who are going for Australia let them eat each other while you go for LatAm. Closer to the end of the game the 2 Australian armies count for very little against the number of armies you get for winning at least some battle every turn. Pro-tip: hold off on exchanging any sets as long as you can. Have fun!')
