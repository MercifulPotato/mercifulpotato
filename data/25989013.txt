Most of what it&#x27;s doing for you is stuff like &quot;foo = new Foo(); bar = new Bar(foo, 33);&quot; So there&#x27;s no strict &quot;need&quot; for them, they help with (and enable) complexity.<p>What F#&#x27;s aversion to cyclic dependencies does forces you to break cycles of types referring to types referring to types. The way you do that is by writing a generic function that avoids referring to a concrete type. Because it&#x27;s generic, such a function is inherently easier to test by means of a simple stub value.')
