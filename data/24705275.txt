I manage an analytics team and I am pretty annoyed with most dashboard tool out there (Tableau, PowerBI, etc), so I have been extending our internal python grizly library with server side components built as python classes and rendered “reactively” using htmx. The idea being that my team could easily build scalable server rendered apps from Jupyter notebooks. Most analytics requires server anyway to for instance do Excel extracts or in memory data transformations. It’s been an amazing discovery of simple but powerful patterns and it’s working. My question is why is this not more popular? Maybe I am doing something wrong?')
