It only affects channels not yet in the YPP. Larger channels who are in the YPP but explicitly choose not to monetize videos will not get these new ads placed into their videos. At least not with this TOS change.<p>Original comment:<p>The wording of this isn&#x27;t 100% crystal clear but I have a feeling this article might be making this out to be way worse than it is.<p>I have 10k subs on YouTube and made a decision not to run ads on my channel from the beginning because I care more about the viewing experience than profiting.<p>Technically I&#x27;m in the YouTube Partner Program and I choose not to turn on monetization for my videos. Monetization is basically a checkbox you can turn on and off for each video and then if you enable it, you choose some information about how the ads are shown.<p>Going by the TOS update&#x27;s wording, it sounds like if you&#x27;re in the YPP then your videos will have not have these new ads placed in them if you choose to disable monetization for a video.<p>It sounds like it&#x27;s only going to affect channels who have a handful of subs and views, in which case you were making $0 guaranteed anyways because you couldn&#x27;t turn monetization on due to not being in the YPP. The only difference now is YouTube will make some money off your views which seems reasonable since they are hosting it for free, and realistically it&#x27;ll be pennies at best if you have a small channel with 15 views per video.')
