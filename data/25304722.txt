Generally, I opt for languages that either compile away their nicities to avoid runtime hits, such as Rust being compiled to WASM, or languages that bring nicities in runtimes that they _completely own_, such as Java on the JVM.<p>The problem with Kotlin and the like is that they can&#x27;t easily compile away their features due to inherent runtime dependencies, e.g. garbage collection, making them poorly suited to environments with a very minimal runtime like WASM, while also being at the mercy of the host language creating runtime abstractions that have mismatches with their own language&#x27;s features.<p>Although it&#x27;d be unfair for me to say the JVM is designed only for Java; invokedynamic and non-reified generics both assist JVM targetting for non-Java languages such as Clojure.')
