From what you just wrote, the probability the test result is correct is at least 96%.   But, as the result is so surprising and the tests aren&#x27;t 100% reliable, it should still be checked.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t assume it&#x27;s a false positive simply because it doesn&#x27;t fit in with our current understanding.    Maybe our current understanding is wrong.')
