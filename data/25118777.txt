Completely static and no build&#x2F;JS necessary.<p>This could be opened up to others by combining it with issues and GitHub Actions, but who wants that?<p>Another better idea for a private URL shortener is hardcoding a list of URLs in a CloudFlare Worker. Much faster and with real 301 redirects.')
