IMHO the world might be a better place if there were a lot less killing, whether it&#x27;s in the context of a war or not. Some killings throughout history are certainly justifiable or excusable, but it seems far more dangerous to me to stick one&#x27;s head in the sand and avoid reflecting on whether each killing really needed to happen, or if the victim could reasonably have been spared without significant risk of harm or jeopardizing the larger cause (presuming the cause itself is just). &quot;Murder&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem like an unreasonable label in the latter case. (Whether and how the killer should be punished in such situations is a separate question that I&#x27;m not taking a position on here.)')
