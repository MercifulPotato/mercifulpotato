And it was GvR himself who told them that that wasn&#x27;t going to happen.<p>That was a long time ago, though, when scientific computing was a small niche for Python, and it might have been reasonable to say it&#x27;s not worthwhile to take on all that extra work just to support the needs of a small minority of users. Fast forward the better part of a decade, and it turns out that scientific computing did not stay a small niche. I think that one could make a strong argument that, in retrospect, that brush-off did not end up ultimately serving the best interests of the Python community. It made the community more fragmentary, in a way that divided, and therefore hindered, efforts at addressing what has proven to be one of Python&#x27;s biggest pain points.')
