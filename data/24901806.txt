Is there a dataset that disputes this? If testing has indeed gone back up, we&#x27;ll see the numbers in a week or two (because data from the past 2 weeks is always missing large chunks that get added later).<p>I believe we&#x27;re still in for a few surprises, and I can only pray the magnitude of those surprises remains tolerable.')
