Math aside, the ELO is a system that allows for the distribution of scores to evolve incrementally as matches are played.<p>All in all, if you want to interpret an ELO, you can always refer to the corresponding centile.<p>With an ELO of 1500 you are in the ~80 percentile of your pool (USCF). That places you as better than 80% of players (that are doing tournaments).<p>This requires a lot of work, and you would definitely not be a &quot;regular amateur player&quot;.<p>The center of the distribution should be around 1200 ELO at the 50th centile.<p>Imagine what that would mean to be in the top 20% of all basket ball players that play tournaments.')
