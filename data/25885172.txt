Moreover, the standard trick is to approximate that the nuclei doesn&#x27;t move, and then calculate the distributions of the electron with quantum mechanics. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Born%E2%80%93Oppenheimer_approximation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Born%E2%80%93Oppenheimer_appro...</a><p>Once you calculate the distribution of the electrons assuming the nuclei are at different positions, you can approximate an effective force between the nuclei and calculate how they move almost like classic objects.<p>The calculation is too difficult, and the other nearby atoms affect them, so there are a lot of approximations. For big system, you need to use something like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Born%E2%80%93Oppenheimer_approximation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Born%E2%80%93Oppenheimer_appro...</a> that approximate the force between the atoms, with some formulas that hide all the quantumness and then move as if they were classic objects.<p>So it&#x27;s a quantum system, like everything in this word. But the apparent atoms that appear and disappear are not explained by weird quantum effects. They can be explained with the simplified classic model when the camera takes too few frames, the objects are moving too much, and the background is too noisy.')
