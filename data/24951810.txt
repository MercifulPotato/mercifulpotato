If someone in your dorm, house has the virus, mask alone cannot help because there is shared contact with surfaces. So it does not imply masks do not work.<p><i>The face mask trials for influenza-like illness (ILI) reported poor compliance,</i><p>Well..<p><i>and showed that masks alone have no significant effect in interrupting the spread of ILI or influenza in the general population, nor in healthcare workers.</i><p>This is what everyone is saying, masks alone don&#x27;t help. But masks do help along with other precautions. If you are in a crowd, masks do help if someone standing next to you has the virus. If your coworker or spouse gets infected, masks alone might not help because the risk of surface contact related infection is higher.<p><i>It is debatable whether any of these results could be applied to the transmission of SARs-CoV-2.</i><p>Different disease with different IR.<p><i>However, recent reviews using lower quality evidence found masks to be effective.</i><p>This reduces the confidence of your source.<p>Regardless, even if it&#x27;s possible masks have a minute reduction on transmission, there is no harm in wearing one. Why not wear it until there are more confident studies which show masks don&#x27;t help. If that does happen we could even allow doctors to stop wearing masks during surgeries!')
