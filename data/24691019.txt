If a consistency test is what you&#x27;re after, you can attempt to perform an explication of someone else&#x27;s position without advocating that position yourself, and without accidentally advocating it by presenting it unchallenged.<p>If I can omit the &quot;devil&#x27;s advocate&quot; disclaimer and it still reads as a position earnestly advanced by the writer, then they are not playing at anything, they are making a real argument.')
