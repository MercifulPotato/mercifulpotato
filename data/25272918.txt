Item(by='robocat', descendants=None, kids=[25273051], score=None, time=1606879603, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25272716, text='&gt; $200 smart watch, and 1&#x2F;10th of those people avoid obesity, we can avoid $20,000 a year<p>Oh, I completely agree that that is a realistic and worthwhile scenario.<p>I just think that lifetime health costs <i>in dollars</i> do not decrease.<p>Let’s say we get 1&#x2F;10th less diabetes due to subsidised watches. The total number of people with chronic diseases remains constant because we just get a different chronic disease on average (because we all die of something!). So the $2000 saved is just spent elsewhere. Ignoring potential savings we could make by increasing the number of sudden deaths and decreasing chronic conditions.<p>Or from another angle, at an individual level many spend all they have on their final healthcare costs so our individual spending remains the same, and at a government level total healthcare spending mostly remains constant regardless of health improvements or lack thereof (e.g. we spend close to 0% on polio these days – however healthcare costs didn’t decline and instead other health costs substituted instead).<p>Now, quality and length of life may improve, but total spending has not changed. I suspect I lack the economic language for talking about situations where we need to optimise for cost substitutions and quality of life. I do believe that optimisation of healthcare for an economy just using dollars as inputs to the objective function would fail us miserably.<p>I find it really hard to think about healthcare costs, because it just doesn’t work like my intuitions might expect about saving money.<p>Edit: the original post “U.S. per capita healthcare spending is $11,172. If the U.S. gave everyone a $200 a year tax credit to spend on a smart health watch, we&#x27;d probably save $2,000 a year per capita and get a 10x ROI.”. I believe U.S. per capita p.a. healthcare spending would now be $11,372 (the extra $200 couldn’t be found in the budget, and the amount spent on diabetes did not decrease, the total budget was not decreased.) However people have a better QOL, and are living longer so they are better off, but the economy is worse off because we’ve added years of extra cost to support the longer-living elderly!')
