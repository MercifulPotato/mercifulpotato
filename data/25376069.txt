We&#x27;re seeing it play out and the difficulty you&#x27;re having is that people disagree with you about that number and you appear to be unable to understand why.<p>&gt; Restaurants can be compensated.<p>Oh geez why didn&#x27;t I or LA or the US think of that? Alright then, pack it in problem solved, let&#x27;s just make sure everyone&#x27;s compensated.<p>Of course were it that simple few would have a problem with the sacrifice, and a much more convincing argument could be made that it would be better for society as a whole to lock down.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s nothing authoritarian about it.<p>Nothing? There&#x27;s nothing authoritarian about the government imposing a lockdown? Are you somehow of the notion that &quot;democratically elected&quot; governments cannot be authoritarian in any way? I&#x27;m struggling to understand your perspective here.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s just as &quot;authoritarian&quot; as mandating seatbelts or childhood vaccinations.<p>Absolutely (well, for the sake of argument, I wouldn&#x27;t argue mandating seatbelts is on the same level as shutting down restaurants but for our purposes here let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re on the same page). We always make tradeoffs of this kind all the time to be sure. Few want anarchy (the opposite of authoritarianism). It&#x27;s again why the &quot;hypothetical&quot; question is important to understanding why people disagree with you. Where do we draw the line?<p>&gt; And that goes for authoritarian New Zealand and Australia too, I suppose?<p>Moreso than the US? Most definitely. Less than China? Of course. Australia and NZ benefit from largely homogenous cultures and low population density that allow them to better handle such things. Singapore would likely have been a better counter-example.<p>&gt; Populations in highly democratic countries will actually support strong lockdown measures if they believe they will be effective and if the government compensates people financially.<p>Sure, except none of your conditionals there actually get bourn out. Many people question the effectiveness (again not just of reducing cases, but on providing a net positive impact to society) and in the US stimulus measures haven&#x27;t been nearly precise enough to find themselves to the right hands.<p>&gt; But if it truly is impossible to gain public support for lockdowns in the US, then something is deeply wrong with American society<p>Rephrased: &quot;If American society cannot widely support the action I think is correct, there is something deeply wrong with American society.&quot; There is something deeply wrong with American society, but it is thinking like that.')
