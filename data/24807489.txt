Something like an an LED throwie, but with random cycling.  Put a bunch of them around and you&#x27;ll probably screw up most cheap CCDs by forcing them to constantly adjust their exposure.  Sure, a cheap filter can defeat them...  But eventually we&#x27;ll be in a world where there is no escape from integrated surveillance and jamming&#x2F;hiding just raises flags.')
