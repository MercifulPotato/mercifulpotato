They&#x27;re only interested in minimizing the risk from a treatment itself, and pay little to no attention to the risk from not having any treatment.<p>It&#x27;s been a full year since the first vaccines were formulated, and it took the FDA 11 months to give the OK. That was a large streamlining of their normal processes, but not a meaningful balancing of risk, the standards remained the same.<p>In the meantime, the virus has had millions of opportunities to mutate like this. If we&#x27;d accepted a bit more risk, we could have significantly decreased its opportunities to mutate.<p>At least in this case, the virus can&#x27;t mutate faster than our ability to formulate a new vaccine. Whether we can retool vaccine manufacturing I don&#x27;t know. But so long as the FDA won&#x27;t allow us to react quickly, the hole we&#x27;re in keeps getting deeper.')
