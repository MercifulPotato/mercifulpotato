These regions are called epitopes, and the immune system creates many antibodies for each invader.<p>If the spike protein mutates, it means that the structure of the spike is different. Obviously the spike can&#x27;t change too much, because it needs to still be able to latch onto cells, and many changes would be irrelevant. Even if one antibody suddenly stops working because of a slight shift in the protein, there are other antibodies targeting different parts of the protein that would still be effective.<p>Only if the spike changes so dramatically that literally none of the antibodies you had before are relevant anymore. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not super expected that we&#x27;ll get a version of the virus that these vaccines won&#x27;t at least produce some antibodies against.')
