What metrics show that you spent your life not insulting people and that another person did, and how do people know that? Care to quantify it? Where&#x27;s the line? Maybe to me the line is a single insult. I mean, given the sample size of my interaction with you, maybe that single insult would meet the threshold of insults&#x2F;compliments when compared to the insults&#x2F; compliments of another person over 4 years, even if there are more examples of insults due to sample size.')
