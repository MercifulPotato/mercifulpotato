It&#x27;s technically correct, but:<p>1. All mobile protocols reduce signal strength to the lowest possible to reach the device. The field strength isn&#x27;t some constant quantity. 5G is all about massive beamforming and super accurate power management. You&#x27;re being targeted with an individual beam that&#x27;s reduced the min strength possible to actually maintain radio contact. So moving closer doesn&#x27;t imply a stronger &#x27;field&#x27;.<p>2. Even with 4G it&#x27;s totally common to have lots of base stations in the middle of cities, on rooftops, etc. It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re all in the middle of empty fields today, far from it.')
