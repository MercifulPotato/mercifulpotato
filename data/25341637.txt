You’re isolated and trapped in your vehicle, if it’s done properly you have no means of running. They have a patrol car pull you over like a normal traffic stop, officer asks you to exit the vehicle and the two agents you didn’t see place you under arrest. Easy. It’s done in murder cases all the time.<p>This person clearly was not a fugitive and I’d be surprised if she or her family posed any threat but they chose to enter her home guns drawn.<p>Why?')
