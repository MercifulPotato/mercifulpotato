User&#x27;s already have to juggle Slack, FB Messenger, WhatsApp, Discord so I&#x27;m very sympathetic to users who are resisting&#x2F;not using it. The world doesn&#x27;t need 100 chat apps, we need to consolidate all this into one single app, if there something that solves that problem, sign me up :)')
