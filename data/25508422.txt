It&#x27;s buried down in the special access settings labelled as &#x27;install unknown apps and granted or removed on a per app basis. Notably, the google play store is not on this list.<p>The whole setup makes installing apps from other sources obtuse and &#x27;scary&#x27; to the average user.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how say an app from f-droid is more &#x27;unknown&#x27; than an app from the play store myself. Then of course, just to install f-droid, I have to download it, allow installing apps from my file manager, which comes with some scary popups, then I have to again enable the setting for f-droid, again after some scary popups.<p>The goal really does seem to be do make the idea of installing software one acquires outside the &#x27;official garden of known apps&#x27; to be something terrible and scary nobody should ever want to do.')
