Maybe blindly adopting permissive open source licenses to invite more corporate ownership isn&#x27;t the right answer.</i><p>I do think this is the answer. Try to use LGPL, GPL or AGPL as appropriate.<p>I also agree with some people that there&#x27;s an issue with framing the question as defending the right of developers to get paid for open source. This was never much of a thing by default. People have been trying to build FOSS companies, with varying success. But I would guess most end user-facing things, like GNU, Linux, VLC etc. were built by academics or hobbyists, or foundations. <i>Commercial</i> FOSS tries to sell infrastructure to enterprises. It&#x27;s not things you and I would use if we weren&#x27;t IT professionals.<p>(Linux is a peculiar beast here. The kernel is largely developed by big corps, but playing by the copyleft rules, because it&#x27;s such a fundamental infrastructure. Big distros like Ubuntu and Fedora are the middle ground where they can be freely used by individual people, but are a side effect of Canonical and Red Hat&#x27;s development processes.)<p>The correct framing of FOSS is benefit of the users and the society at large. We use .?GPL to ensure that the software that people use is inspectable, and modifiable if the vendor does something bad. Thus we serve people&#x27;s, and our own, interests in the long term. We reduce the area where companies can damage the public for profit, when hiding behind closed source, unchangeable dark patterns, &quot;hai we ban you there is no appeals&quot; etc. etc. That the essential software can be had free of charge in practice is also a nice thing... to some extent.<p>The answer to the problem of compensating the developers was never much directly solved by FOSS. (Of course, you can try to use it to <i>also</i> get hired, to sell hosting or support.) This is a social&#x2F;political&#x2F;economic problem. Trying to solve it with licensing (a.k.a. copyright law hacking) is and understandable effort, but very likely a dead end.<p>EDIT: I see under the sibling comments that the OP is more specifically concerned about the fundamental and &quot;invisible&quot; projects like sudo. I can&#x27;t add much on that, but I do think there&#x27;s value in getting (some) signaling and (some) bargaining power by choosing copyleft. Especially if there would be solidarity and consensus among developers in doing this.')
