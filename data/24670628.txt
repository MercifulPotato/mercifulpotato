I would like to recommend to everyone one of the few utilities I&#x27;ve found in the last few years which blew my socks off, called x2x [0]. It is a small console program you can use to link your X session with a remote session (over SSH), so that you can move your mouse off your current laptop (or whatever) desktop and onto the remote &quot;TV computer&quot; desktop, and type things into that desktop with your keyboard. I&#x27;d been dreaming about this for years before I randomly stumbled on it. You can run it and just forget about it since it isn&#x27;t literally streaming a series of JPGs like VNC. I&#x27;ve been using it with ZERO problems now for a couple of years exactly for this purpose.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dottedmag&#x2F;x2x" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dottedmag&#x2F;x2x</a>')
