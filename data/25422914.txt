Item(by='hsod', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607978133, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25415630, text='&gt; 1) The First Amendment says nothing about which content companies must produce, promote, or allow with their resources and on their platforms.<p>It&#x27;s not just that it says nothing about these things. It says the opposite of these things.<p>Any legal or social norm that attempts to enforce what content is produced, promoted, or allowed on private resources and platforms is fundamentally authoritarian. This includes the  &quot;principle of free speech&quot; from your 2nd statement. The first amendment is a protection <i>against</i> authoritarianism. Using the ideas behind it to coerce private parties into hosting or promoting content they don&#x27;t want to is a bit perverse.')
