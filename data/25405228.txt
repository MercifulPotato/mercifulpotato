This strikes extremely true for me as well.<p>I&#x27;ve been casually following urbit for 3 years now.<p>And by &quot;casually following&quot; I mean &quot;every now any then, they have some crypto meetup in San Francisco with free drinks, a tech talk, and stuff and sometimes I accidentally end up there&quot;.<p>And of the half dozen or so meetups that I&#x27;ve stumbled upon, for the free drinks and to meet people for fun, what I know about Urbit is as follows:<p>It is something related to crypto and also some new programming language, and also there are solar systems, and planets, and somehow that has something to do with people controlling their own code.<p>And also, there is something about Monarchy, or kings? No idea what that monarchy thing is about.<p>Pro tip for fellow people who are running community based projects or advertising your product through meetups:<p>You should tailor your pitches and tech talks to be understandable by a software engineer who is a couple drinks in, and only half paying attention to the talk. Because guess what, that&#x27;s what the majority of your audience is going to be!')
