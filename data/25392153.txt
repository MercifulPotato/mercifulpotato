You have some code that you want to run in the Cloud and you don&#x27;t want to worry about server ops.<p>Whether that&#x27;s your &quot;whole stack&quot; or something &quot;ad-hoc&quot; is a totally arbitrary distinction. Your &quot;whole stack&quot; will almost certainly involve external concerns, and your &quot;ad-hoc&quot; concerns will almost certainly grow in complexity until they converge on the same spot.<p>AppEngine is also running containers via gvisor.<p>The distinction is being driven by PMs and marketers but not by the needs of customers. What end-users need is one well-supported tool, not 8 separate tools with uncertainty about which one will receive future support and matrices and flowcharts to decide between them.')
