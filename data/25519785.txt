I saw posts where people kept upping the dose until it got to a point where it doesnt work anymore and you would have to increasingly take larger amounts to have the same effect. Heck some take as many as 3 after every meal. I cant imagine doing that.<p>I try to avoid doing this and luckily I can get away with one every few days but I dread the day I have to be in that situation.<p>One thing I noticed is that - it gives me incredible mental boost a day after taking it. It just makes me feel normal and that to me is a &#x27;boost&#x27;.')
