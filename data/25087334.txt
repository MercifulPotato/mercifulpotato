In the next quarter when that voucher is used on another $100 purchase, you can claim $100 revenue this quarter and remove the $80 liability. But you already took the $80 hit to revenue from the voucher on the previous quarter.<p>If you sell something for $100 and immediately give a $80 refund then you only take a $20 revenue.<p>People think the SEC and accountants are dumb or blind but they arenâ€™t.
