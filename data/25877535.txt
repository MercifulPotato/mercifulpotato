However some times on this pink plane there are little spots of blue. They represent thoughts that don&#x27;t belong in the pink plane.<p>Sometimes those blue spots turn into blue planes, and the ant we are following starts to move along that plane instead of the pink one. Everyone in the pink plane thinks he is wrong. Everyone can see the pink plane, in all its reality. It is not until you walk on the blue plane until you can see &quot;another way&quot;.<p>The metaphor being that we developers built a world where we started to take the general idea of OOP and construct a lot of &quot;reality&quot; around it. A lot of process, a lot of formalization so we could build mechanical systems of gears that slotted together. I think Alan&#x27;s idea of OOP was something more fluid, more organic than this. The world is messy and we often try to abstract the mess away in these overbearingly weighty and hierarchical programs that everyone agrees is the right way.<p>I think Objective-C was the most widely used and successful walk on this blue plane. Millions of developers were exposed to the idea of message passing as a form of OOP, which is an astounding accomplishment. It really is a neat language, and I had a lot of fun learning it.<p>Brad definitely walked on the blue plane. RIP.')
