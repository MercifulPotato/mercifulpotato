Item(by='colanderman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605497368, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25104407, text='(Speaking purely logically; not morally; I am not claiming belief of these statements one way or the other)<p>If you believe that:<p>A) a mother may choose to let someone end the life of her own human fetus; and<p>B) animals have no right to control their own bodies,<p>then I don&#x27;t see why there&#x27;s any dissonance to believe:<p>â†’ a human may choose to end the life of an animal&#x27;s human-like fetus.<p>It does not violate (A): the human-like fetus is no more special than a human fetus.  It does not violate (B): the mother&#x27;s right to control her own body&#x2F;fetus does not exist, since the mother is a non-human animal.<p>Do you see it differently?  How so?<p>I suppose one could make the case that, a human mother&#x2F;embryo is a single symbiotic organism, which expresses its collective will through the mother.  This new animal mother&#x2F;human-like embryo symbiotic organism should be afforded some of the same rights as a fully human mother&#x2F;embryo, but is unable to express its will due to the limitations of the mother.  Therefore the embryo&#x27;s right to life, which it could normally choose to waive through its human mother, is violated, since its animal mother is unable to communicate as much.<p>But I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s not how you (or anyone else) are looking at the situation.<p>(Personally (and I&#x27;m not making an argument here, just an observation), as someone who believes (A) but not (B), I can&#x27;t get agitated at this study; by my moral measure the violation of the animal mother&#x27;s rights is <i>way</i> tamer than so many other ways animals&#x27; rights are violated in the name of science.)')
