Item(by='twblalock', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607970515, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419216, text='&gt; I&#x27;m surprised at how much impact the NYT&#x27;s expose (I would personally consider it more of a hit piece) has had. I naively assumed that PornHub, as a top-10 site on the web would be immune to such a piece, but I guess I was wrong.<p>The NYT is among a small subset of papers that is read by elites and captains of industry. Most of the people at the top of large credit card companies heard this from the NYT, not from customer complaints or lower-level employees, and they immediately thought about the PR implications.<p>&gt; How many of the members of the NYT and the Visa and Mastercard boards who created on this outcome watched the videos that are now down? Probably a majority of them, but that wasn&#x27;t enough to stop the moral panic I guess.<p>Who knows? But that&#x27;s not why they are cutting off payments. They are cutting off payments because associating with a pornography site that was called out in an NYT op-ed is a bad look.')
