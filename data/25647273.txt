From 2000 to 2018, US healthcare costs went up by a factor of 2.3. Germany went up by 2.1, France 1.8, Canada 2.0, Italy 1.7, Japan 2.6, and UK 2.6. It&#x27;s similar for most other OECD countries, and also similar if you expand the range to 1970-2018. My data source doesn&#x27;t go back farther than 1970.<p>Here&#x27;s a comment from a while back with a source for those numbers [1].<p>The US has two problems with health care costs. (1) we pay a lot more than nearly anyone else per capita, and (2) the cost is going up in an unsustainable manner.<p>The first problem is mostly just a US problem, but the second is a problem for everyone. This suggests that the first problem is due to something the US is doing wrong and could fix. The second problem, though, seems to be one that nobody has figured out.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20923851" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20923851</a>')
