A domain I do understand a bit which is np-hard is the travelling sales man. Computing an exact solution is unrealistic, but doing heuristic searches that get you to 99% of the optimal 99% of the time is relatively doable.<p>But - you don&#x27;t know that you are 1% from the solution... even if you are pretty confident that you are. It&#x27;s quite possible (unlikely) that you are way off the optimal, but  if you have a decent solution that&#x27;s ok.')
