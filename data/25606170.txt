Coming from Israel I really notice in NL bootstrapped Dutch companies of high quality that are quite happy serving the local market and maybe Belgium and that&#x27;s about it. No expansion planned, or if one is planned it could take years and years. I read once its due to lack of ambition by Dutch entrepreneurs, but that isn&#x27;t it. Without VC money its simply realistic to stay local; how are you gonna compete with U.S companies without money? Even the big names in NL like WeTransfer, Mollie, Bux, Bunq etc would have raised way more in Israel or the US. It&#x27;s quite enough to raise a sizable 1st round in Israel, use connections + acquire traffic and customers to show growth, and then raise enormous subsequent rounds because you showed growth. I&#x27;m sure many Dutch entreprenuers could have done the same thing but it isn&#x27;t possible for them without funding. So they &quot;dream&quot; small.\nThere are probably a lot of missed chances in NL. On the other hand if the tech VC market implodes again Dutch companies won&#x27;t be hurt as bad.')
