For example you think by looking up the restaurant on an app then clicking the phone number button to place your order directly, that you might avoid the fees. Nope. It’s a man-in the middle phone number, and they take the cut anyway.<p>Go to the stores website and pick your order, and have it fulfilled via doordash? Fine, you’ll pay a fee for the delivery driver. But the restaurant doesn’t pay doordash fee since they didn’t drive the business to the restaurants website.<p>But, next week you use doordash app and reorder the same thing?  From now on the restaurant will pay the doordash fee.')
