There’s always a lot of attention on targeting because it’s user-facing, creepy, and strikes a nerve with the HN crowd.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that people try to sell conversion as something that benefits the ad viewer because if it increases sales, it must also be good for the people doing the buying or something like that. That argument of &quot;better ads&quot; then gets easily misunderstood as targeting but it is only indirectly about that.')
