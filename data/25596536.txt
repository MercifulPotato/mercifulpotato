Especially true during the Qualcomm &#x2F; Intel Modem era. You could literally tell they were intentionally leaked. And after that they somehow felt it was good the media help them sell their narrative ( quite successfully ) they have dialled it up even more.<p>I am guessing that is partly because their head of PR left last year ( 2019 ). And VP of Marketing Phil Schiller took the PR responsibility as well which later passed the whole Marketing alone with PR to Greg Joswiak. This left a management gap in PR, and what normally happens is the department continue to do what they were doing at a rate without realising the side effect. When all you have was a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  And this situation looks remarkably similar to Apple Retail head transition from John Browett ( Dixon CEO )to Angela Ahrendts ( Burberry ).<p>Just some observation from someone who has been watching Apple very closely for 20+ years.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;submarine.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;submarine.html</a>')
