We agree ahead of time that this never happens.<p>Now, since you know one of you is going to win, since Monty didn&#x27;t, who has the better chance?  Your friend started with a 1&#x2F;3 chance, and he hasn&#x27;t switched; does his chance suddenly change because Monty opened a door?  Most people (not all!) will agree that it has not.<p>Since one of you MUST win, and friend has 1&#x2F;3 chance, what&#x27;s left?')
