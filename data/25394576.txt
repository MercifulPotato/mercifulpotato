I&#x27;m surprised by all the comments that expect them to go head to head with John Deere right out of the gate. This autonomous tractor is their entrance into the foyer of this Ag space. Sure it&#x27;s not the Midwest behemoth that we have working the fields here in Ohio, but give them some years to get their tech in order to produce that. Bringing products to market is an expensive endeavor in time, money and resources.  Personally, I&#x27;ve only dealt with software so I cannot imagine something of this nature.  Good work with the Monarch and I&#x27;ll be watching this space to see what you turn out.')
