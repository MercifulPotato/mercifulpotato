There will be no observable performance difference for DDR4 SDRAM implementations with the same timing parameters, regardless of the trace length. There are systems out there with 15cm of traces between the memory controller pins and the DRAM chips. The only thing you can say against them is they might consume more power driving that trace. But you wouldn&#x27;t say they are meaningfully slower.')
