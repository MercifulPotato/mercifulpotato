You need a certain amount of gravity before you have a good tech scene, and I am interested in knowing &quot;what does that gravity look like? How can such friction to becoming a tech hub be erased?&quot;<p>Honestly, my current bets would be:\nGood office space (probably not a huge open office but whatever), a good space for hosting meetups &#x2F; other presentations (maybe even a conference!?), and frequent infusion of new talent -- from college or a program like the one described in the article<p>Then you just need a few people with a lot of initiative to build the community')
