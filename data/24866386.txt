I find it useful, but since I&#x27;m already conscious of breathing (with some slight effort to inhale), I tend to feel the need more than without the pack.<p>It does seem to help to hum (for some) or at least purse your lips (for me) to drag out the exhalation step without having to inhale right away. I would certainly like to be better at this though, those packs don&#x27;t last that long.')
