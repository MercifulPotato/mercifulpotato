You&#x27;re obscuring what&#x27;s actually going on here. I was being nice when I said it was like &quot;doubling the length of the federalist papers.&quot; In a proper analogy, our fake document would be 24 times the length of the federalist papers. 96% of our document would be completely fabricated. FAKE. At that point you&#x27;re learning more about the computer than whatever document you&#x27;re viewing and it&#x27;s the same for video. Scaling up from 480p to 4k requires the computer to fill in 96% of the information. That&#x27;s really only good for entertainment value, not serious academic research into a historical period.<p>Computers aren&#x27;t magic time-traveling machines. If you want 4k reproductions of old films, just scan the actual film with better equipment. If you want colorization, that requires actual investigation and to figure out what colors were in use, and how to map them onto the video data. If no such investigation is possible then we&#x27;re SHIT OUT OF LUCK. It happens. Move on. Stop revising history for entertainment.')
