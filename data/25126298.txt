It&#x27;s critical for global software engineering productivity. I have no doubt that a similar (if not exact copy) of git would be produced in <i>very</i> short time.<p>Let&#x27;s take another piece of Torvald&#x27;s software and ask the same question: if Linux disappeared overnight would things be done different? Well, yes... sure. but would things also be re-created near 1:1 due to the known success of the Kernel? Also yes, and as fast as humanly possible.')
