In my experience on r&#x2F;electricvehicles, self-promotion&#x2F;spam posts stay at 0 upvotes with a handful of reports and complaints in the comment section. It&#x27;s literally just spam that wastes everyone&#x27;s time.<p>One pattern is for a YouTube channel to try to spam their content on the sub. I know it&#x27;s the channel owner (or someone affiliated with the channel owner) because each video they post everywhere has the same logo in the upper-left corner. And those videos are pretty much all they post. They get banned from my sub very quickly, and in my experience they don&#x27;t come back.')
