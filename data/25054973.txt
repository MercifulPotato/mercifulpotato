Even that webauthn website demo works in a mobile browser via NFC.<p>2) For TOTP secrets, I enroll them in both my yubikey and in the Aegis android app. I mainly use these with the Yubico Authenticator software for windows or linux, but I can pull out my phone if I need to.<p>3) For any account that is using U2F, I have a second backup key (the blue security key) that I also enroll for that account.')
