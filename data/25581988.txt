I agree with, well, all of it -- as it stands now the Agora is decentralized only for users that can control their own infrastructure; and is indeed usable at all only by users with a certain degree of technical know how.<p>I intend to do what I can to <i>fix</i> this and make the Agora [[maximally inclusive]] -- it is not arcane as a design principle, but rather due to limitations of the current implementation. Put another way, I consider the current implementation just an MVP that might allow us to test some interesting hypotheses and perhaps bootstrap a more inclusive distributed architecture.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anagora.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;maximally-inclusive" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anagora.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;maximally-inclusive</a>')
