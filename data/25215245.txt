The high taxes of 1950-2020 doesn&#x27;t seem to have done much for making people happy. I&#x27;m always happy to start a fight - I reckon the biggest impact of things like the 1950-2020 tax regime is a bunch of factories to China.<p>Obviously there is a lot more going on than taxes, but America isn&#x27;t investing in itself and it is starting to show. Where did the money go? Is the answer in that extra 10% of the GDP being directed to the Federal government? After 70 years that would be starting to show up.')
