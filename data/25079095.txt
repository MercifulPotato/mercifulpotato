Because they seem like logos to me. I feel it&#x27;s pretty funny that you think they&#x27;re not logos. Mitsubishi etc might disagree with you.<p>I like that link. I think that was original inspiration for me, added to how many logos are abstract and geometric. When MML originally came out with new logo I really liked the idea of a logo that can sort of evolve or be dynamic and not be a single static image. It seemed to fit well with a software company you know because software is on the move. plus I thought it&#x27;s an easy way to create like a family of branded assets both conceptually because they&#x27;re all you know from the same concept or base like, 3 way symmetric, procedurally generated, as well as visually. as I knew I&#x27;d be building lots of different products I thought it was an easy way to have a family of logos sharing the same brand identity.<p>But I actually haven&#x27;t felt the need to use any of them so far because the overall looking feel doesn&#x27;t really match with the way I feel about it right now. But I still think it&#x27;s interesting that&#x27;s why I posted it.<p>People can use the code and logos however they like.')
