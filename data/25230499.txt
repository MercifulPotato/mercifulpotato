It&#x27;s really easy and unprofessional: really you could divide society up by uncountable distinctions. But distinctions do not make dialectics or aren&#x27;t anything but misleading if you&#x27;re just asserting them.<p>Also the distinctions between conventional and independent are just blurry ones here, only derived by example; not by definition. There is no intellectual sharpness to the argument, right from the start of the &quot;essay&quot; â€“ in that, that it appeals only to the intuition, not to the mind. There are no studies about &quot;independent-minded&quot; or &quot;conventional-minded&quot; people; not in hte sense he is using the term here. Quite the opposite: he is using the terms to appeal to a feeling. In no earnest science, or literature, someone talks so dull and undifferentiated about human beings.<p>Also I wouldn&#x27;t ever think about a friend of mine, or someone close to me with such cold efficiency that derives from that really simplistic way of handling people and amateur psychology.')
