The bytecode is a highly optimized constrained language that looks a whole lot like machine language.  It would not be unreasonable to build hardware that runs it, if you wanted to.  I guess it would not be unreasonable to say, it&#x27;s interpreted in the same way that running arm-compiled code on qemu on an x86 is interpreted.')
