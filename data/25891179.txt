In the worst case you see your collegues as some abstract force that constantly makes your day worse, while you yourself wouldn&#x27;t even go an extra milimeter to make things clear, easy to parse or simply less pain in the ass for the next person.<p>Knowing the people you work with can make these relationships less abstract and more emphatic.<p>In the worst case interpersonal communication in the workplace is all about who tends to offload work on whom  (e.g. the manager who records a 15 min voice message where precisely one minute matter to each of the receipients offloaded the effort of sorting and parsing to the recipients. This manager wasted then 14 minutes times the number of receipients time, just out of pure lazyness).<p>Remote communications makes this worse, because every email that leaves open a questions takes time&#x2F;energy as it goes back and forth.')
