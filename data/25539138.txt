But we are doing it and that should be a warning to us.  Also the consider that mass incarceration and poverty in America, which disproportionately affect minorities, are brutalization of a different sort.<p>Again, this is not me or anybody claiming that America is bad, or directly comparable to Nazi Germany.<p>But, it&#x27;s our duty to rigorously analyze ourselves and think about which parts of America are good and which parts resemble fascist or otherwise evil regimes. I honestly cannot think of anything more fundamentally good and patriotic!<p>Just as we hopefully think about ourselves as individuals and think about which parts of us are good and which parts are bad, or perhaps represent the seeds of something bad.')
