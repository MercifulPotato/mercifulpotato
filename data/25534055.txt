Many poeple don&#x27;t. For someone who doesn&#x27;t care whether the Earth goes around the Sun or the Sun around the Earth, or what the correct mathematical definition of &quot;even&quot; and &quot;odd&quot; is, your article absolutely could come across as elitist, because you&#x27;re implying that they <i>should</i> care, and that your job is to explain to them why they should care.<p>But as a matter of simple pragmatic fact, <i>there is no reason why they should care</i>. As a matter of simple pragmatic fact, it is perfectly possible for someone to live an entire human life without ever having to know whether the Sun goes around the Earth or the Earth around the Sun, or what the definition of parity is. So people might not be interested for the simple pragmatic reason that they see no reason why they need to be interested.<p>One can make a case that there are benefits to be gained from being interested in such things even if they don&#x27;t appear to have any pragmatic relevance; but making that case takes a lot longer than one blog post.')
