Data engineers are like the essential workers of the data world, people who today may not receive the appropriate level of appreciation that they deserve.<p>I think the glut of data scientist occurs because we clump so many different skills and disciplines under the single term &quot;data scientist&quot;. Data scientists today come from so many different backgrounds that the definition means something different to everyone. Because of this, the surface area of possible skills that could be expected of a data scientist is vast, to the point where it&#x27;s pretty unlikely to be sufficiently competent in all of them, let alone a majority.<p>I&#x27;d like to go back to a world where we had a little more specificity about what kind of data scientist you are (e.g. I had no problem with terms like statistician and data miner), which could help ground expectations that others have of us, and it&#x27;d also help clearly define the scope of various career paths for the next generation.<p>Sadly the individual who coined the term shows no contrition for the degree of confusion that the rest of us have been left to deal with: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observer.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;data-scientist-inventor-dj-patil-interview-linkedin-job-market-trend&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observer.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;data-scientist-inventor-dj-pati...</a>')
