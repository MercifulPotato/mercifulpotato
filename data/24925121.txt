Item(by='bavila', descendants=None, kids=[24926282, 24925530, 24925710], score=None, time=1603925703, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24922268, text='&gt; I guess this brings up and interesting issue -- once someone knows the ins and outs of a system, sometimes there are very few barriers internally to check that an order&#x2F;paperwork is legit.<p>I used to work as a criminal defense attorney, and the job regularly required that I obtain subpoenas from the court in order to mandate a witness&#x27;s appearance at court. My state courts have a template that subpoenas must follow, wherein you would include the case number, attorney name, witness name, and other basic details.<p>Once the template is completed, you take the original along with a certain number of copies to the court clerk for filing. All the clerks would do is make sure that the case number on the subpoena corresponds to a case that actually exists in the system, and that the names of the plaintiff(s)&#x2F;defendant(s) are accurate.<p>The clerks never asked me any questions about my role in the case (e.g., whether I was a party to the case, an attorney, or a staff member of the law firm representing a party), nor did they ever ask me to provide any sort of identification. I just give the clerk the papers, they look at the papers, they stamp the original and copies, and then they return the copies to me (which are to be served on the witness and&#x2F;or opposing counsel).<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a ton of value someone could get out of obtaining a fake subpoena (other than perhaps issuing your own self a subpoena as an excuse to get out of work, or maybe just to screw with someone), but it was always pretty astonishing to me that anyone off the street can just dump some papers in front of a court clerk and receive a legal order mandating someone&#x27;s appearance in court--no questions asked.')
