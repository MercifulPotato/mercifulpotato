How do you feel about these people (I&#x27;ll call them a basket of incapables) voting?<p>This is a good question , though not one which is too interesting.  I think it&#x27;s largely hypothetical since I believe voter turnout amongst the group I was speaking about would be abysmal.  Nevertheless, I think I can answer definitively:  I actually like the non-mandatory system America has, but I don&#x27;t like the artificial impediments to voting that we&#x27;ve been seeing lately and for most of our history.   So, in general, I would oppose almost any form of disenfranchisement, but I also don&#x27;t really feel like someone that doesn&#x27;t otherwise care enough to vote really needs to vote, or that they even should.  ...and I&#x27;d oppose any form of mandatory voting like some nations have tried.<p>Interestingly, for much of my youth, I did not vote.  Primarily, this was because I felt inadequately informed on the respective issues to be qualified to vote on them.  I also felt like my opinion was too easily swayed and misled by information that wasn&#x27;t in fact substantive at the end of the day.<p>I now vote, but I only fill out my ballot for issues which I feel I am informed enough to vote on.  This means I usually only vote on 40-50% of the items on the ballot.')
