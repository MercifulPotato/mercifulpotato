Unless there&#x27;s dedicated thought to teaching them though, it could be an issue as well.<p>I&#x27;m certainly not defending the way it worked out, but we focus on an idealised education from the perspective of the learner (i.e. curiosity, passion, zest for self improvement), it might not prepare them if they end up in more traditional scenarios. Fully support the notion of it being taught like a traditional subject, just that it&#x27;s important those lessons don&#x27;t get lost (which I can foresee happening).<p>If the light behind your eyes hasn&#x27;t been diminished by the experiences at school, it&#x27;s likely it&#x27;ll be extinguished in less than ideal real-world scenarios. I&#x27;d hate to see the joy of someone who genuinely has a zest of learning and curiosity to be crushed the minute they come across the things a lot of us deal with on a daily basis.')
