If there&#x27;s a constant trickle of new entrants always giving away the store to attract me to sign up, I&#x27;d be stupid not to use them all.<p>As a restaurant or driver, they&#x27;d have to offer some very expensive incentives to make me say &quot;DoorDash only, no UberEats&#x2F;etc.&quot;<p>I feel like there was a large bet made on autonomous vehicles being ready before the music stops.  Once you no longer have to hire human drivers, the &quot;big ball of capital&quot; model works better-- buy a million robovans and you can provide a service level or geographic scale no new entrant can match without a similar up-front spend..')
