Focusing just on people is how we got to the stage of having extremely fast CPUs that can compute billions if not trillions of operations and yet websites and apps lag. We can run full fledged games at 240 FPS and yet, websites and apps lag. It truly is heresy to not fully utilize the hardware we create, such a waste, simply because people don&#x27;t optimize at every step of the process, useless abstraction on top of useless abstraction. In game engines they do, to some extent, because they have to, and so should they in general purpose applications as well.')
