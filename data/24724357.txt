It will be from a breakthrough out of left field.  In other words, &quot;we&quot; will have thrown out millions of lines of code and billions of dollars of investment, and started over.<p>Obviously, if they roll it out, then I&#x27;ll be wrong!  But if I thought that was possible now, then I wouldn&#x27;t bother calling them out on it.<p>Previous comments: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22632588" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22632588</a>')
