Increase the sample size as needed.<p>Georgia was the closest percentagewise in 2020. 4935487 votes were cast between Trump and Biden, and the difference was 11779 votes. However, even if Georgia went to Trump, Biden still wins, so you&#x27;re forced to check states with even larger gaps.<p>However, even in Georgia, to claim the election should have gone the other way with 99% certainty, it is not hard to check wherever you want. This was done by many groups, for example here [1]. Of course, given the sheer idiocy of Trump followers and news support, they don&#x27;t educate their supporters on any of this, because the facts destroy their claims.<p>Since voter records are public in pretty much every state (every one I&#x27;ve looked at over the past few elections let you download them), it&#x27;s trivial for researchers to do this sampling. They do this every election, and that is how they make the statements they do about the extremely low rates of fraud - they did do the testing.<p>Trump and co did it too, and found nothing. They had the lists immediately, because they started publishing names they claimed were fraudulent, and in each case the media showed them wrong. So they were looking at the names.<p>And even with those names, and the ability to sample, they still didn&#x27;t put forth any solid evidence. Sampling irregularities would have been enough to get more eyes looking. But they knew (just like Trump knew in 2016 with his Clinton 3M illegal votes charade that he eventually dropped) that this is a lie.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sos.ga.gov&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;elections&#x2F;3rd_strike_against_voter_fraud_claims_means_theyre_out_after_signature_audit_finds_no_fraud" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sos.ga.gov&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;elections&#x2F;3rd_strike_against_vo...</a>')
