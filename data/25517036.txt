Their revenue growth for 2020 was 40%, 2019 14.52%, 2018 82.51%, and 2017 67.98%.<p>So, you really need to predict when that stops before you can get a reasonable estimate for sock value.<p>A more reasonable 144x in 2022 after 2 years of ~40% growth is the equivalent of ~282x today.  That’s not exactly the huge drop people are expecting.  In other words I do expect a drop, but I don’t expect short selling is a great risk adjusted investment.')
