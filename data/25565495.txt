Because the Apple logo on the back? Once you put a case on your phone, most people can&#x27;t tell the difference between one brand and another.<p>People like iOS because of the software, both the OS, and the software which runs atop it. This is why WWDC is Apple&#x27;s single biggest event of the year.<p>Likewise, people don&#x27;t buy Macs because they are metal and have a shiny fruit on the backside. Developers were among the first to migrate to Apple back in the 00s when they discovered its Unix underpinnings made it great for doing web development.<p>This idea that Apple doesn&#x27;t care about developers doesn&#x27;t hold water. If they didn&#x27;t care, they wouldn&#x27;t have bothered to add Hypervisor support into the M series CPUs. This is a feature which has almost no purpose outside of software development or as a server platform and Apple doesn&#x27;t make dedicated server hardware so where does that leave us?')
