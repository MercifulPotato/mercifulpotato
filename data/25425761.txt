You can take the cigar smoking community and a majority don&#x27;t have an addiction to smoking. They all have similar stories to me of just stopping without thinking about it for long stretches of time.<p>Then you have the cigarette and ecig community that are constantly sucking on those things every hour. Mostly children because pipes and cigars are more of a 30+ year old product. Maybe there&#x27;s something to the age demographic.<p>Anyways, one is just pure tobacco with nicotine, the others are chemical cocktails. All nicotine studies I&#x27;ve seen come from cigarettes. Haven&#x27;t looked at the ecig ones mostly because I never cared for that crap for the exact same reason as cigarettes, they&#x27;re chemical cocktails.<p>Look, I&#x27;m just tired of people telling me that &quot;You&#x27;re addicted and just don&#x27;t know it&quot;. Until this discussion, the last cigar I had was... August? Or it was late July. I don&#x27;t remember. I know I had a few during July. Maybe one or two in August. I just haven&#x27;t thought about it and I never had an urge. After 3 years of smoking, I might be on maybe cigar number 40 or 50. While there are some who just chain smoke everyday, a vast majority don&#x27;t. My observations and experiences on cigar smoking don&#x27;t add up (by a lot, not a little bit) to what you&#x27;re saying and it&#x27;s not like you hang out at cigar bars either, so you can only trust some other prude random schmuck or this crass internet random schmuck.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not advocating that cigar smoking is safe. You probably shouldn&#x27;t do it. Hell, I&#x27;ll tell you right now not to, just to make sure I never have to chat with someone like you at a cigar shop. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s smart to apply ecig and cigarette studies to cigars when the ingredients don&#x27;t match just because you have a knee jerk reaction from following what Nancy Reagan said back in the day.')
