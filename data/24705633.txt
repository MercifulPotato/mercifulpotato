It has only non-friendly non-expandable LINQ-to-Object equivalent.<p>Example for bad parts: Handling checked exception in lambda, no extension method support, calling &quot;.collect(Collectors.toList())&quot; every time, no real closure support, complex lambda type due to primitive types.<p>I should mention async&#x2F;await for C# feature compared to Java.<p>IMO Scala&#x2F;Clojure is too much for me, C# is balanced option.')
