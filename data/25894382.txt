You might consider that “repulsive” but I think there’s a lot of room for debate on that. Less than half of Americans believe that “changing gender roles have made it easier for women to live more satisfying lives.” <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewsocialtrends.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;18&#x2F;wide-partisan-gaps-in-u-s-over-how-far-the-country-has-come-on-gender-equality" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewsocialtrends.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;18&#x2F;wide-partisan-gap...</a>. That includes less than 60% of <i>Democrats</i>.<p>Scripture also teaches the centrality of procreation to marriage and society. I happen to agree with the <i>Obergefell</i> approach, which relied on relatively recent research (based on the 2010 census) showing the astounding number of same-sex couples raising children together. I think it’s no surprise that views on same-sex relationships have shifted quickly as people came to understand that it’s compatible with traditional understandings of marriage’s societal function. (That research, by the way, was not available 5 decades ago. The scientific research on homosexuality being an immutable characteristic really got going in the 1990s, and became widely acknowledge among the public only around 2010.)<p>I will point out that the western world is almost <i>entirely</i> dependent on immigrants from societies that have traditional religious views on these issues for their population stability. Western social liberalism has many positive attributes, but it hasn’t proven to be self-perpetuating. Maybe it’s adherents should be a little circumspect before calling other attitudes “repulsive.”')
