Bureaucratic systems are somewhat rule based usually, but since they weren&#x27;t automated from the beginning, they usually have some conflicting rules, some missing rules, and some ambiguous rules. Which means there&#x27;s a lot of human intuition involved in decision making which isn&#x27;t encoded anywhere.<p>So to start creating a new software that is better you would first have to understand the old software + human decision-making.')
