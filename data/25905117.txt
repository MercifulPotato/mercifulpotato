Earlier models like the original&#x2F;3G&#x2F;3GS are so much slower they’re practically on a different plane of existence.<p>It’s almost like the difference between an early-90s 68k Mac and and early 2000s PowerMac G3&#x2F;G4 towers. The gulf between the two was so wide that continuing to support even the most powerful 68k models just wasn’t practical.')
