It takes a lot of time, then you have to wire everything together. In typical custom ways. If someone makes a off the shelf version typically the learning curve is greater than building a custom version.<p>I think software takes so log because each dev tries to rebuild the wheel. And often times the wheel does need to be rebuilt. But due to time issues things never get finished to the degree you planned and your custom code has been rewritten 10 times and each new feature take a logx longer to not break the old stuff.')
