I was talking with a Trump supporter (I held my nose and voted for Biden, as I did for Clinton in 2016). He was pretty heated, because a lady he flirts with at work let him know that she was a hardcore Democrat and that she didn&#x27;t think anyone should vote for Trump. It was toward the end of a long day, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was up for the conversation, but he&#x27;s a pretty decent guy, so I engaged, and we had a solid chat.<p>I made a point that seemed to resonate with him - Biden represents high-level corruption, the kind of slick corruption that maintains stability and is relatively predictable. Trump, though, represents a mob style of corruption - or the kind of corruption you see from dictators in developing nations. If it benefits him in the short-term, and he can do it, he will. Chess vs Checkers. Some people prefer the latter, and it seems some view it as a more honest type of corruption, but for most people, stability is important.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of Right-leaning people would also like to see some form of ranked voting, so I think it&#x27;s the political parties (both of them) rather than the people holding things back.<p>I think you bring up key issues in your closing paragraph, but the implementation of Globalization is what really hurt the middle class in the US. Whenever people lose a proper balance, they will suffer, and I think most everyone can agree that the US did a particularly poor job of ensuring balance - probably not by accident.<p>Anyway, I feel for people who are troubled by the result of the election. I was in their shoes in 2016, and I can relate to some of their concerns. If we start from a place of understanding&#x2F;trying to understand, we can build systems that work for everyone. If we allow the two-party system to perpetuate artificial divides, progress will be much slower, and we&#x27;ll take more false steps. The loudest are typically the worst of us. We can&#x27;t fall into the trap of using them as stand-ins for the other side. This was much more ranty than I intended, but I hope it makes sense.')
