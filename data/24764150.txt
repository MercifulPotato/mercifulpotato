I often read the first hypothesis is far more likely than the second, but I do not agree. The actual probabilities to be compared are:<p>- the likelihood of a virus outbreak due to natural selection <i>in Wuhan</i><p>- the likelihood of a virus resulting from a gain of function experiment &quot;escapes&quot; from Wuhan BSL4<p>Note that we are sure that Wuhan BSL4 was doing gain of function experiments. Also note that natural virus outbreaks are quite likely when looking at China as a whole, China is big, or even when looking at the whole world. But that does not answer the question at hand, and that does not make the natural selection hypothesis &quot;far more likely&quot;.')
