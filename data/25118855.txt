Item(by='willyt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605572095, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25113026, text='Cod is pretty widespread, but salted cod is not common here in the UK or I think in Ireland and I had never come across that particular way of cooking it before. When we eat it, traditionally it is street food cooked from fresh, battered and deep fried, which can be nice if it&#x27;s done right but many places mess it up and the fish gets too oily.<p>That paella sounds nice. Barcelona is also a great city, great food, culture, beaches, amusement park on a mountain! Seville, Madrid, Cordoba and Granada, even Valladolid are also great. The only Spanish city I didn&#x27;t like was Malaga. In fact, I think that in general Spain is excellent at urbanism and liveable cities.')
