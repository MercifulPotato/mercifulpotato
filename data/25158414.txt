Some of the integrations that I need, like firebase, don&#x27;t have official frameworks for Swift beyond iOS.<p>For example, I need to be able connect to Firestore and listen continuously for new data and changes so I can fetch them, do some calculations and put the results back on Firestore. I am doing it with NodeJS because of the official support but I have to tell you that it melts my brain when I have to switch to NodeJS way of thinking and back again.<p>If I could have used Vapor, I would have been able to just use some the already implemented algorithms in the user facing App instead of re-implementing everything in again but this time in a NodeJS way.')
