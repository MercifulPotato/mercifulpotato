Are seasons 1-3 still worth watching even though 4-6 are mediocre and 7-8 are dumpster fires?</i><p>As someone who enjoyed the show for a long time and watched it all the way through, I&#x27;m not sure the answer to that is obvious. They wrecked it <i>so</i> badly in the final episodes that I don&#x27;t currently see myself doing the marathon rewatching thing with it. I&#x27;m also not sure I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend who hadn&#x27;t seen it, knowing it was setting them up for such a huge disappointment.')
