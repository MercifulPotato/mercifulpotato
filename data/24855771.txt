The office was definitely less crowded than last time I had one (pre-covid).  Now&#x27;s a good time to beat the inevitable rush, and you might be safer with fewer people around compared to if everything opens up again but covid isn&#x27;t fully under control.<p>If you think of each day that goes by a 1% chance of getting cancer, that might work as a motivator.  (I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s an accurate probability, but really I wouldn&#x27;t risk it.  I had a nasty bleeding tumor removed a few years back and it was no big deal because it was caught early and hadn&#x27;t become cancerous yet.  If I had waited a year things might have turned out a lot worse.)')
