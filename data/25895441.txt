There isn&#x27;t a 1:1 correlation.<p>i didn&#x27;t say &quot;==&quot;. I stated &quot;-&gt;&quot;, i.e. positive causality from testosterone to aggressiveness (The opposite is obviously not true as evidenced by  aggressiveness without testosterone, say in women).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3693622&#x2F;#:~:text=There%20is%20evidence%20that%20testosterone,aggressive%20phases%20of%20sports%20games" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3693622&#x2F;#:~:tex...</a>.<p>&quot;Atavistic residues of aggressive behavior prevailing in animal life, determined by testosterone, remain attenuated in man and suppressed through familial and social inhibitions. However, it still manifests itself in various intensities and forms from; thoughts, anger, verbal aggressiveness, competition, dominance behavior, to physical violence. Testosterone plays a significant role in the arousal of these behavioral manifestations in the brain centers involved in aggression and on the development of the muscular system that enables their realization. There is evidence that testosterone levels are higher in individuals with aggressive behavior, such as prisoners who have committed violent crimes.&quot;<p>&gt;Also you are implying that natural selection is currently existing in human society. It does not.<p>natural selection never stops. Some people naively think that the &quot;fittest&quot; necessarily means strongest&#x2F;healthiest&#x2F;etc. which is just not the case.<p>So, then it comes to the drivers, one can say that  societal natural selection is less &quot;natural&quot; (in that very naive understanding of it) and more like selective dog breeding and similarly it works very fast. Add to that the positive feedback between testosterone production and testosterone style behavior - ie. the more testosteronish style behavior of an individual causes more testosterone production in his body and vise versa (that famous barn swallow experiment where they painted the male bird chests dark to fake high testosterone characteristic or the article referred above:<p>&quot;Several field studies have also shown that testosterone levels increase during the aggressive phases of sports games. In more sensitive laboratory paradigms, it has been observed that participantâ€™s testosterone rises in the winners of; competitions, dominance trials or in confrontations with factitious opponents.&quot;).')
