You could announce results early but they wouldn&#x27;t be official so what&#x27;s the point?<p>And if the count only gets verified every once in a while, what triggers the process? Something abnormal? A random check? Something else?<p>What tells you the count is valid or not? How do you ensure the machine is working as it should, wasn&#x27;t altered in any way and so on?<p>To me these problems can&#x27;t really be fixed: you need the paper trail. And you can&#x27;t &quot;count&quot; (haha) on a machine you can&#x27;t really audit.')
