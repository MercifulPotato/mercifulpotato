If I make a file with an mtime of 1952 and then I update the kernel and that file has an mtime of 2077 or something, that&#x27;s the kernel violating the contract it has with userspace, and Linux does not break kernel ABI.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter whether <i>you</i> think that such timestamps are &quot;lie[s]&quot;: the contract is the contract. You have no idea how someone might be using the system, and you don&#x27;t get to break uses that are legal within the contract but contrary to your sense of good taste.')
