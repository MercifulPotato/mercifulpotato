For example, I&#x27;m a low level manager. I&#x27;ve got an area for admin paperwork. One category is Me, other categories are for each of my subordinates. Each of those has a ID for annual performance reports. So mine is 11.01. My subordinates are all 12.01&#x2F;13.01&#x2F;14.01. This may result in skipped IDs, as not all subordinates have all of the IDs in use. But this is still helpful, as I know that 01 is always for annual performance reports, 02 is always for training, etc.<p>Another thing for Johnny: You may not need to get the IT team to make you a Sharepoint list for tracking your IDs. You may have your own little Sharepoint site if they use MS365. OneDrive for MS365 business runs on Sharepoint. So just make your own there.<p>Admittedly, I don&#x27;t, because I&#x27;m actually using OneNote for that, as well as storing the notes. So every Area is a section group, Category is a section, and every ID is a page. And if I need to make more notes in an ID, I can make a subpage. But normally it&#x27;s group-section-page. This leads into: the default page is 00.00, which is the table of contents. If you want to go really crazy, you could just embed any files into the pages as well, but I currently think that&#x27;s a kinda nasty way to do it.<p>A third thing: if somehow you end up with more than 9 categories (see prior note on categories corresponding to people), nothing stops you from using Base36 for the category numbers. As above, if I became a middle manager, and had to track more than just a few guys, I&#x27;d still continue with lexicographic sorting category &quot;numbers&quot;. It&#x27;d just be non-numeric. This goes into breaking the rules, but rules are there to be broke when necessary and sensible.')
