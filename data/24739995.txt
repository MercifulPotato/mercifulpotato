An app like Reddit is allowed, meanwhile Telegram not only has to not show porn channels to users, but now has to ban content from the whole platform or be removed from the App Store. On Reddit, there by far more porn accessible to users, and probably more &quot;incitement of violence&quot; too. There&#x27;s no way to support Apple here. Just another example of the tyranny of the App Store.')
