There is a cap on both visas granted and applications. There are three caps: Regular, C&#x2F;S (treaty obligations with Chile and Singapore), and US Master&#x27;s (US master&#x27;s degrees or higher). The USCIS will publish a memo when enough applications are received, closing the application season (normally six months) until next year.<p>Applicants with a US master&#x27;s degree (or higher) have two chances to receive an H1-B visa. A lottery is held to award the visas available to master&#x27;s degree holders, and those not selected are entered in the regular lottery.')
