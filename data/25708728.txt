I&#x27;m not an economist, I tried to read some textbooks at some point, but finished not a one. I&#x27;ve decided to read article because I was interested how it is going to deal with the costs of R&amp;D. I had no clear idea how to do it. And with first read-through I missed the quoted excerpt, so I though that it should be a part of a variable capital, though I was surprised it was not mentioned in the article. I reread article and found the statement that R&amp;D costs should be ignored.')
