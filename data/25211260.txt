Some are distributed (to app developers) as compiled binaries.<p>Any app with a facebook login button, for example, is transmitting some of your activity data (with coarse geolocation from your IP) to facebook, even if you don&#x27;t use the facebook login button.<p>Google and Apple could ban this sort of stealth location tracking (via the widespread practice of ad company SDK embedding) in the mobile app stores, but they don&#x27;t.')
