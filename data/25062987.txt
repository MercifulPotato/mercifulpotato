It adds another layer of stability which is important for planning kids, careers, finances, and so forth. We can make choices as though our relationship will still exist X years down the line -- this isn&#x27;t necessarily true, of course, but in the medium-term it becomes a reasonable assumption.<p>It also brought us closer. Mutually agreeing to be each other&#x27;s life partners is a big step. I don&#x27;t have to worry that my partner is going to choose their career over me or vice-versa. We&#x27;ve both decided to put our relationship first, which causes a subtle-but-important shift in your relationship.')
