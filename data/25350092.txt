The other day I came across brand new Nintendo Switches. It seems like someone got a pile of special edition ones and then set up a flash shop where they sold them for like $120.<p>But yeah, overall there seems to be lots of shops reselling stuff. For example, I recently bought a little dollhouse kit, and I noticed that multiple sellers were selling it. And I&#x27;ve watched youtube vids on how to make money on Etsy, and while the examples I found don&#x27;t explicitly say to buy stuff from aliexpress, it&#x27;s clear that they weren&#x27;t making and packaging those bath bombs themselves.')
