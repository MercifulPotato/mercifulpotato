Bush, but there&#x27;s no way your data here would include that (and that still places him at a very low number), so I&#x27;m wondering where you&#x27;re getting this data, and how you qualify &quot;corrupt.&quot;<p>If we look at a handful of Bill Clinton&#x27;s corrupt pardons on his last day in office alone as mentioned in the gp comment above:<p>(1) Susan McDougal who went to jail for contempt of court for him, \n(2) Braswell who paid Hillary $200k for the pardon, \n(3) his brother Roger Clinton Jr,\n(4) Democrat Mel Reynolds who was granted clemency after being found guilty of sexual abuse of a minor.<p>Thus, Trump must have had at least 40?
