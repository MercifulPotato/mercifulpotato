Most of those companies do not presently manufacture entire aircraft, but they&#x27;re all in a position to do so if they acquired only a fraction of Boeing&#x27;s assets.  Raytheon Technologies in particular already makes engines, avionics, and interior systems.  All they&#x27;d need is a manufacturing plant to assemble everything onto a fuselage.<p>Boeing and Lockheed Martin get a lot of name recognition for handling the high-level design and manufacturing of aircraft.  But in reality, their planes are an amalgamation of engines, avionics, and interior systems which are often contracted out to other companies like those I listed.  Many of them could step up and fill Boeing&#x27;s shoes if a good deal presents itself - especially if there was extra incentive seeing as it would be a matter of national interest.')
