Gatsby just doesn&#x27;t take care of enough stuff without having to install a bunch of other solutions. I&#x27;m not sure of the extent I will use it in client sites.<p>I haven&#x27;t regularly done client WP work in several years but I&#x27;m planning on doing some over the next year and I&#x27;m curious - how good is Gutenberg now? Before it would be adding fields to the admin with a plugin like Advanced Custom Fields - were they able to make it truly WYSIWYG for editing content?')
