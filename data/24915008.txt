Miners spend electricity. They&#x27;re getting block rewards and fee rewards, they&#x27;ll exchange earned bitcoins to dollars and pay their bills. So ultimately energy spent per block = (block reward + fee reward) x bitcoin price.<p>Right now block reward is 6.25 BTC. Last block fee reward was 2.13 BTC. Block reward will go down as time goes on.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand economics of fee rewards and whether they&#x27;ll grow over time linearly or exponentially. I checked historical data and it does not seem to grow at all. So I&#x27;ll suppose that reward fee will not grow.<p>So in the end you&#x27;ll have block reward of 10-20 BTC. That&#x27;s all you have to pay your electricity bills after you mined block. So basically energy spent per block is directly correlated to bitcoin price, and that&#x27;s about it.<p>Obviously bitcoin price won&#x27;t grow to the moon and its price is limited by some economical factors.<p>So while bitcoin network might draw non-negligible amount of electricity, it still is limited by design.<p>Now if miners will decide to change bitcoin design, for example to increase block size, that&#x27;s another matter. But it&#x27;s not clear if that would happen.')
