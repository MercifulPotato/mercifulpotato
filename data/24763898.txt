It seems easy until you have to show someone who isn&#x27;t literally obsessed with it how to do it, at which point you start to realize how much experience and reading and studying and experimentation you&#x27;re drawing from that you can&#x27;t really skip over without missing important stuff.<p>There <i>is</i> a huge element of luck or privilege in having the intellectual space to be obsessed with code&#x2F;math&#x2F;business&#x2F;design&#x2F;etc at all, which factors in heavily as a filter, but yes, you need to do hella work as well. Being naturally smart is super helpful, too, and can cut the amount of work by a large factor, but by itself it&#x27;s not enough.')
