Not because of what it says, but because of what it doesn’t say.  It completely ignored the fact (explicitly mentioned in my comment) that in this case - the case this entire thread is talking about - government officials pressured the company into suppressing free speech.  That is not the situation in the AOL case you mentioned, and makes your entire analysis irrelevant to this case.<p>We aren’t talking about AOL.  We are talking about a group of partisan senators pressuring a company that has a de facto monopoly in online video distribution into suppressing free speech for no reason other than “we don’t like it”.<p>Your analysis, even ignoring the fact that it has nothing to do with the present case, is also entirely incorrect as it relates to my comment.  The CDA requires that the removal be “in good faith”.  Removals that aren’t in line with “clear, previously set guidelines” can be ruled to not be in good faith.  We essentially said the same thing, but you managed to hurl insults at me - saying that my “sources must be garbage” - while you said your version of it.  Well done.')
