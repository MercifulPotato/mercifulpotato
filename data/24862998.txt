Even the slowest of passenger vehicles are capable of reaching unsafe speeds for surface streets within a couple of seconds. The majority of pedestrian collisions are due to inattention -- which is almost universally correlative with a lack of driver inputs.  Someone looking at their phone is almost never applying 100% throttle.<p>I would bet that your relative difference in experience between different types of vehicles is more of a function of:<p>1. vehicle size and shape compared to the total available road space<p>2. differences in driver attitudes as they correlate with the vehicles they choose to drive<p>It is worth noting that the Hummers you find to be particular problematic are some of the slowest vehicles on the road.  The average sedan today accelerates faster than any hummer ever made.')
