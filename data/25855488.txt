They&#x27;re almost always prebuilts that had originally ran Windows or macOS, and there&#x27;s often some amount of urgency attached â€” I need that Linux install <i>now</i>, not in a week when that replacement wifi&#x2F;bluetooth card from eBay shows up.<p>It&#x27;s lead to some ridiculous hijinks to get things working. On more than one occasion, I ended up using a rocky tethered connection to my iPhone, retrying several times due to dropouts, to get Broadcom wifi drivers installed because figuring out the exact package I needed to put on a thumb drive to install offline was nigh impossible.')
