Here&#x27;s a GitLab employee claiming GitHub uses alternates:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22179208" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22179208</a><p>The thing is, that both the dmca repo and its forks must have alternates files to the same underlying common repo, otherwise the PR ref in the dmca repo wouldn&#x27;t be able to see the merge commit pushed to the fork. Pushing the merge must have duplicated all the youtube-dl commits into the common repo used by both the dmca repo and its forks because youtube-dl and dmca would have different common repos.')
