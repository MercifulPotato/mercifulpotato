It doesn&#x27;t have to be super expensive this way, though. Both Tesla and Electrify America offer decent per minute rates here.<p>EVGo here is over twice as expensive and tends to underperform on charge rate, depending on the state of charge. Or at least I hope it improves at higher charge levels... I think it is amperage limited like CHAdeMO.')
