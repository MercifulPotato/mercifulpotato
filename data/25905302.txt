Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[25906361], score=None, time=1611593136, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25904340, text='War might be one of the consequences of climate change. India and Pakistan both depend heavily on Himalayan glaciers for their fresh water (as do several other countries). Those glaciers are rapidly shrinking due to climate change.<p>It is not implausible that this could lead to war over control of the dwindling fresh glacial water. And they both have nukes. They don&#x27;t have the really big nukes that the big nuclear powers have, but it doesn&#x27;t take big nukes to cause a worldwide catastrophe.<p>This paper [1] (article about that paper here [2]) looks at the effect of a nuclear war between Pakistan and India with an exchange of 100 Hiroshima-size nukes between them (about 1&#x2F;3 of their total arsenals) directed at their 100 most populated areas.<p>The nukes are of course devastating to those in the area they hit, but it is the firestorms that follow that are bad for the rest of the world. Based on the amount of combustible material in those regions, the paper estimates about 1.5 Tg of soot aerosol would end up in the upper atmosphere.<p>They used climate models to analyze that, and come up with a 1.8 C temperature reduction and 8% precipitation reduction for several years. They then used state of the art crop models to estimate the effect that would have on food crops. They found that the strongest effects would be in temperate regions of the US, Europe, and China for 10-15 years.<p>It would not be a collapse of civilization type event, but it would result in a decade or more of serious food shortages worldwide which would probably kill a lot of people. And since it would not just be hitting the poor, undeveloped countries like the usual famines do nowadays, it could trigger more wars involving the countries that do have the large arsenals of much much bigger nukes than India and Pakistan have.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;117&#x2F;13&#x2F;7071" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;117&#x2F;13&#x2F;7071</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.ei.columbia.edu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;even-limited-india-pakistan-nuclear-war-would-bring-global-famine&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.ei.columbia.edu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;even-limited-india-...</a>')
