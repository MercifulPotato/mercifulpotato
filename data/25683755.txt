At the time I had an account with Wells Fargo, but it was just a nightmare. I was working minimum wage, more or less paycheck to paycheck. I had been burned several times by those predatory overdraft fees, and they had started to introduce minimum balance fees.<p>Switching to Simple was a breath of fresh air. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about any of those fees anymore. I could look at their tiny list of possible fees and know what to expect rather than having to deal with the nightmare of poor information that I had before. They saved me so much money, and helped me get out of the paycheck-to-paycheck spiral.<p>Like you the budgeting feature have been incredibly powerful for me too. Being able to hide away money without risking an overdraft or declined payment was a game changer.<p>Now I find myself in a very unfortunate position where I&#x27;m not even in the states so I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;m going to manage a switch to somebody else.')
