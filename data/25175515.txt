You should be proud of what you created.<p>However.<p>Gimp was always just slightly too good, mature, stable and complete, to justify alternative projects.<p>Gimp IMHO is the reason we don&#x27;t have a layered raster (&amp; vector) editor in 2020 which can hold a candle to Photoshop.<p>There have been attempts, but Gimp really sucked the wind out of the motivation to do competing OSS projects - for all really good reasons mentioned above.<p>So no criticism of the software it&#x27;s self here... just sometimes something succesful can stifle competition.<p>I&#x27;d love to see more clean sheet &#x27;Photoshop alternatives&#x27;.')
