USD&#x27;s are backed by TBills, Euros are backed by some kind of asset.<p>Oh yeah?  And what assets are these exactly?  It sounds to me like you&#x27;re just describing things without intrinsic value that are &quot;backed&quot; by other things without intrinsic value.  There is no economist that would tell you that government currencies or bonds have &quot;intrinsic value&quot;; they&#x27;re just paper.  Their value can go entirely to zero (and this has happened many times in the past).<p>&gt; &quot;There&#x27;s lots of things with fundamentally no intrinsic value &quot; like what?<p>Anything collectible has no inherent value.  Think baseball cards, art, whatever.  They&#x27;re worth money only because they&#x27;re rare and people are willing to pay big for them.  But the actual intrinsic value of the materials in a rare painting worth hundreds of millions of dollars might be a few bucks at best.<p>And yes, precious metals do have intrinsic value as defined by economists.  Currency <i>doesn&#x27;t</i>.')
