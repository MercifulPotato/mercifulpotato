One is from a chief security employee in the Twin Towers, along the lines of &quot;Never run to the roof&quot;. Which he did to try to save more people, which IIRC he didn&#x27;t&#x2F;&#x2F;couldn&#x27;t.<p>In other related stories, taking note of emergency exists whilst boarding an airplane [and similar for other folks in similar situations] noted out better survival over others. &quot;Triangle crowding&quot; at exits is also mentioned, which is partly why folks in charge scream &quot;single file! walk do not run&quot; at you as everyone rushes for the door to escape.<p>The distinction is also made between &quot;flight&quot; and &quot;fight&quot; and the often left-out &quot;freeze&quot; response to in-time disaster.<p>I found it a worth-while read.')
