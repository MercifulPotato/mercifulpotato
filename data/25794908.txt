It&#x27;s interesting to see HN decided to discuss this.<p>I was worn down by undiagnosed celiac for years. That was finally diagnosed, but then I became mysteriously ill again for a couple years, which turned out to be type 1 diabetes (actually 1.5, LADA). People definitely don&#x27;t understand what it&#x27;s like living with a limiting factor like chronic pain, fatigue or organ dysfunction until they&#x27;ve experienced it personally or watched someone very close cope with such a thing. Besides how difficult as the physical and mental issues have been, it&#x27;s also cost me many relationships, financial independence, personal development and a great deal of work opportunities.<p>I can easily connect with the message of the spoon holding, but I see I misunderstood the metaphor. I didn&#x27;t realize spoons were like effort tokens... I thought it just meant you had to do everything all day with the inconvenience of holding a bunch of spoons.')
