I&#x27;d love to know how much of the brainpower in the US is set aside for the purpose of doing nothing more than extracting wealth from the markets.<p>Additionally, I&#x27;ve long held the opinion that if your primary method of earning a living is by extracting wealth from the market, then your &quot;capital gains&quot; are just a fancy way of earning a living and you should be taxed at the exact same rate that everyone else is. You don&#x27;t deserve to pay half the taxes just because your earnings are derived from stocks.')
