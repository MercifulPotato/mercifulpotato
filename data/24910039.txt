Item(by='newscracker', descendants=None, kids=[24910070], score=None, time=1603821597, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24908227, text='I’ve seen this publicized many times on HN before, mostly in comments, but I always dismissed it because it supported only PDF and didn’t support ePub (the format I primarily use, since I’m not in a field where PDF is mandated or necessary).<p>Since this new release has ePub support, is it possible to use it without the cloud and subscription?<p>Edit: From other comments here it seems like 2.x is cloud-only (and tied to the Polarized service storage). Though it says that there’s a latest update to the local supporting 1.x, I doubt if that would remain supported for longer (of course, someone could say it’s open source, so just fork it).<p>I wouldn’t mind paying a small license fee for the freedom of local storage or being able to use another cloud storage along with better support. Since 1GB on the free tier is not enough for me and since I have other cloud storage already available, even the Plus plan it quite expensive for me.')
