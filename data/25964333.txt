I&#x27;ve seen every possible article on the topic in the last two days. Every single narrative exists. Brilliant retail investors. David and Goliath. Idiotic YOLOing. Claims that Robinhood, etc are in cahoots to sabotage people. Claims that this isn&#x27;t about the money and actually it is about screwing the rich. The squeeze is illegal&#x2F;legal. The trading halts are illegal&#x2F;legal.<p>There is clearly no coordinated agenda among news agencies here. It is a compelling story and a bunch of people wrote their hot takes on the topic.')
