It&#x27;s an absolutely gorgeous language, especially for being so practical.<p>There&#x27;s a bit of a progression with Rust, where at first you see the examples and you go &quot;this language is so beautiful!&quot; Then you try to write something nontrivial in Rust and you go &quot;wow the compiler will NOT stop yelling at me, how does anyone write anything in this language?&quot; Rust has a fairly austere learning curve in general, and it takes some getting used to.<p>That passes, though, and then you really do get to experience the elegance and power which sold you on Rust in the first place. There&#x27;s a period where writing Rust feels substantially slower that writing in anything else, but that passes too.<p>It really is as good as it sounds, but it might take a while before you&#x27;re accustomed enough to Rust&#x27;s paradigm that it feels that way.')
