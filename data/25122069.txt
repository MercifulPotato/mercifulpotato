It really is a better way to live than spending your time on earth with your face buried in an app exploiting the poorest.</i><p>I think I&#x27;ve seen this vulture capitalism self-cannablize itself in my Lifetime in the US in so many industries its become the norm and I not only expect it I plan for it: things aren&#x27;t meant to last anymore. Everything is made to be disposable.<p>Industries and Communities alike are not immune, especially large urban sprawling ones and specifically speaking the tech based ones I&#x27;ve lived in the US where you have large swaths of diasporas coming in waves.<p>All of which is some how strongly encouraged in order to be a part of the &#x27;disruptive wave&#x27; and make your mark for the entrenched players who benefit from this model, that is until you finally get fed up with overpaying for old, cramped and often poorly kept housing situations and you finally decide to return to where you came from in the East Coast, Rust Belt or Midwest where Life seemed more &#x27;normal&#x27; only to see that too has been hallowed out and been devastated by substance abuse as a result of large amounts of displaced&#x2F;under or unemployed workers.<p>This is now the norm, and while California is in a bad place many people who came to the Valley from outside CA and isolated themselves in its bubble are in for a very sobering realization of what many of their Industries have done now that they have the option to work from home and they return to their home states in most of the US.<p>I think this is the big take away from the article:<p>&gt; <i>When a multi-billion dollar tech company takes a hidden audit regulatory exemption, that&#x27;s on all of us. They&#x27;re going to keep doing it. Building a business model that relies on a permanent underclass under the doublespeak of &quot;entrepreneurship&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot;, and then spending tens of millions to make sure that you will never have to provide health insurance to your workers will always continue on if it&#x27;s allowed. As a formerly famous person once said, &quot;they let you do it. You can do anything&quot;.</i><p>I&#x27;ve been in the culinary Industry in the US and in Europe, and sadly I thought prior to COVID the US was finally making significant inroads (outside of California and NY) to Asian and European standards of culinary culture, wherein a restaurant and restaurateur is a proud beacon of a vibrant community. A hub for locals to gather and enjoy each others company and patronage alike in a mutual beneficial manner that helps embody and nourish itself.<p>Instead, what has happened is that these low margin businesses that struggled to make payroll and keep the lights on unless they had outside investment(s)&#x2F;investors are bending at the seams and the rest just gave way to the weight of well funded commercial chains and what I&#x27;m now convinced will be the re-structuring to make the Ghost Kitchen Model the new de-facto way most people get their meals when &#x27;going out.&#x27;<p>As a former chef, biodynamic farmer and proponent of farm to table business models as way of making environmentalism viable (read: profitable) I felt we were robbed of many more years (possibly decades) of experimentation and progress, but the truth is that the model was always joined at the hip to a very precarious, exploitative and quite frankly unsustainable Industry: restaurants&#x2F;hospitality.<p>I&#x27;m still close with my old Team and have many friends with (struggling) restaurants and while they were all apprehensive of the disruption they understood why I welcomed it and how it would be indifferent to their acceptance either way. And to me Doordash is just the 21st embodiment of the same model, the advent being logistics and supply chain management are sold as a SaaS business model via a horrible&#x2F;buggy app and system, wherein its ok to lose millions.billions so long as you have access to untapped labor in an ever growing underclass that can attract another round from a VC like Softbank flush with cheap&#x2F;hot money that seems almost eager to lose money so long as you structure it correctly to keep the illusion of infinite growth via multi-billion IPOs going.<p>I&#x27;m glad to have had the opportunity to step away from Fintech for a period and got to work and live through what now seems like an unrepeatable period in the culinary Industry that spanned everything from Michelin star, James Beard awarded restaurants as well as my primary focus in agro-tourisms and farm to table models. I think it is an end of an era as more restaurants are forced to close their doors forever and are giving way to a handful of well financed players with access to immense amount of Capital in a race to the bottom to capture ever thinner margins and displacing anything that poses a threat.<p>The model that Roy Choi created after the 2008 financial crisis, that disrupted the culinary World with the advent of marketing via social media and food truck distribution in lieu of brick and mortars, may be the only viable model that the most well funded and equally daring cooks&#x2F;chefs will have to aspire to moving forward if they have any chance of being independent.<p>I can only hope that they too learn the lessons from Roy, and his imperative to be involved in locally based community investment as a measure of their success instead of what are now at best gilded awards like Michelin stars and James Beard awards now that so much of the competition has been unfairly removed from the equation due to COVID.')
