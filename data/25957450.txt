Even if we assume 100% renewable grid (which is currently impossible) the computers that run the cloud require an enormous amount raw materials and labor to manufacture.<p>But far more importantly, where does your <i>clients</i> capital come from?<p>The greatest accounting trick capitalism every pulled was to get people to think of individual parts of a system rather then the entire thing.<p>There&#x27;s real magical thinking involved to think that capital just appears in these clients at now real cost. At some point labor and resource exploitation is required to create economic value which is then passed around throughout the system. Just because you can skim off some surplus value selling some SaaS product in the cloud doesn&#x27;t mean that the value you are paid with doesn&#x27;t come from the exploitation of resources.<p>Finally, you can easily dispel this myth by looking at the current state of our global environment. Show me any period of economic growth that isn&#x27;t also tied to increased energy and resource usage.')
