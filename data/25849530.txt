Obviously nobody believes you&#x27;re supposed to recreate society every 20 years ex nihilo. What I&#x27;m arguing is that the case for reading history has been overstated. Specifically, I was reacting to the claim that, &quot;Human behavior seems to be notoriously consistent across centuries.&quot; I agree. It is. Human beings react to the same emotions and incentives they always have and there&#x27;s no library big enough to change that.<p>This is like arguing about whether dieting &quot;works.&quot; On the one hand, obviously, yes, it works. There&#x27;s no credible debate about the efficacy of calorie restriction for losing weight. It simply works. On the other hand, most human beings can&#x27;t actually follow a diet, so, no, it doesn&#x27;t actually work, for any reasonable definition of &quot;works.&quot;<p>Reading history is probably a lot like that.')
