Elastic means not fixed. The demand for housing can vary quite a lot even for a fixed population, so it is quite elastic. Demand for food on the other hand is much less elastic, but even there, I wouldn&#x27;t call it completely fixed as people can change what they eat even if they can&#x27;t drastically change the number of calories they consume.')
