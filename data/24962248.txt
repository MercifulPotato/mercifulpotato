That might seem like a good thing, but it really isn&#x27;t.   In part because they use an unusual signalling patterm and in part because the cycle time for this pattern is too long in your case.<p>At the very least I think I would at least double the speed of the animation to lessen the amount of time people looking right at them. Also, these lights seem awfully bright.  Especially at night, this might endanger other drivers in confusing situations. You may want to add some ambient light sensing so you can adapt the brightness to the ambient lighting conditions.<p>Think of attention as a budget.  You have X amount of time to look at and understand things around you in traffic.  The more time you allocate to one thing, the less time you will have for the dozens of other things you need to keep an eye on.  A common mistake when driving is to spend too much of your attention budget on one thing.  You really don&#x27;t want other drivers to spend 2-3 seconds staring at your blinkers.  Ideally they shouldn&#x27;t need more than 500ms or so.<p>As a fellow motorcycle rider, what I would recommend would be to find traditional turn signals mounted on stalks further from the centerline of the motorcycle.  Those are much more of an improvement since they communicate more clearly and are far less &quot;remarkable&quot; and attention-demanding.  I know, this is boring, but in my view, a much safer option.')
