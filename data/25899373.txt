From most recent article with comment on Nikons financial situation:<p>&gt; That said, if I were one of those financial rating companies, I&#x27;d be downgrading Nikon&#x27;s rating at the moment. You know, from something like A to BBB (using Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s rating board). <i>(Nikon publishes their Japan Credit Rating Agency value, which is currently A+&#x2F;Negative for long-term debt. That would be the third highest rating, or &quot;a high level of certainty to honor the financial obligations,&quot; though the outlook [Negative] is that the rating might be lowered.)</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bythom.com&#x2F;newsviews&#x2F;archives&#x2F;12-2020.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bythom.com&#x2F;newsviews&#x2F;archives&#x2F;12-2020.html</a>')
