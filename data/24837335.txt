I get snail mail ads all the time with misleading claims. The way targeted advertising works in the article sounds a bit less invasive than what gets addressed and mailed to me personally. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s the solution here but whatever it is, I&#x27;d like to see it extended to USPS delivered advertisements too.')
