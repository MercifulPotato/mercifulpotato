We fund the &quot;wrong&quot; things when it comes to education.<p>Simply pumping more money into poorly performing school districts isn&#x27;t a solution, but we continue to do so.  Some of that money might be better spent on social services to help ensure stable households and early education for the kids in those areas.  Or higher minimum wages to help ensure the parents don&#x27;t need to work 12 hours&#x2F;day to make ends meet.
