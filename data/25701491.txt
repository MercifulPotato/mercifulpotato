In many ways it reminds me of the (ultimately successful) 1998 anti-trust lawsuit against Microsoft which ironically allowed the rise of Google, Twitter, and Facebook who are today engaging in similar behavior.  Although perhaps if the Microsoft lawsuit were brought today, Microsoft could simply argue that they were afraid of the &quot;hate speech&quot; that might occur on these new platforms and were therefore justified in using their massive market share to stifle all competition.')
