Power ultimately comes from resources - as security apparatus requires resources to function. What this means is that states try to maximize effective real level of taxes.<p>Only two forces prevent taxes from going to ~100%: tax evasion and military risk from other states. As taxes become higher, more people start evading, reducing the real effective tax rate, which reduces real relative power of bureaucrats and politicians. Smart governments reduce taxes in that situation. If evasion becomes impossible, taxes are going to approach 100%: everything over resources needed for survival goes to the ruling class (slavery), which is historically the dominant arrangement (eg. serfdom).<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be a fundamentally new situation even in modern times - in the Soviet Union everyone, officially, made roughly the same regardless of what they did, and that amount was barely enough for survival. Which wasn&#x27;t smart, because tax evasion was enormous (in the form of bribes and black market), which created a new ruling class (now called oligarchs).<p>Military risk is another force acting against high taxes, as states that kill its economic activity (due to people having weak motivation) risk being conquered eventually by wealthier and stronger states. However, looking at North Korea in particular, it appears as long as some form of MAD is in place (in the case of NK - destruction of Seoul for decades, lately also nuclear missiles) that doesn&#x27;t matter that much today.<p>To sum it up: I&#x27;m convinced total financial surveillance inevitably means a return to slavery. Physical money is going to disappear in decades. Anonymous crypto appears to be the only force that can prevent this future.')
