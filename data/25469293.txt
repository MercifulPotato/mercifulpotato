Some examples of what I mean by fundamentals:<p>- data structures;<p>- computer architecture (no need to design your own hardware, but you should know how all the components interact);<p>- basics of complexity theory;<p>- at least one scripting language.<p>- knowing how to write low-level programs in at least two operating systems. For example, write a simple HTTP proxy in C by using just the C standard library and BSD sockets. If you don&#x27;t want to use C, use another compiled language but avoid any fancy libraries for this kind of exercise.<p>If you&#x27;re good at all of the above you&#x27;ll never run out of companies that want to hire you. You won&#x27;t know everything, but you&#x27;ll be able to learn most things quickly enough.')
