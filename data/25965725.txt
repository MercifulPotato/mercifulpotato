That’s not unreasonably tight, but 4-bit color would be 86 KiB.<p>The IBM EGA card came out in 1984, same year as the Mac, and supported 640x350 with 16 colors, but I think the cost of the monitor + card was somewhere around $1K, and the 640x350@4bpp mode was only supported if you also bought a RAM expansion daughterboard. The Mac’s launch price was $2,500, for comparison.<p>Adjusting for inflation, the EGA card was something around $2,500 in 2020 dollars, and the Mac was around $6,200.')
