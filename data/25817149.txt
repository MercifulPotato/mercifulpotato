You can’t effectively hide away a mesh unless if it also handled versioning and service dependencies automatically.<p>I’ve seen several codebases now where the company decided to move to a full SOA-architecture without much effort put into maintaining stable, public interfaces at every service.<p>The goals defined sometimes are quite misguided, eg: “We’ve moved 80% of our services over to k8s”.<p>Okay. Goal achieved. Then I see engineers face issues over coordinating changes across several services. It’s very easy to fall into the trap of solving the problem of making sure coupled service deployments all happen at the same time. Rather than defining public interfaces and making the services be able to handle several versions.')
