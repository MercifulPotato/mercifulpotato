Why your rules would protect them is beyond any explanation.  I have never once been the person shoveling BS on this forum. But you treat your posters like a bunch of thin-skinned babies. Some deep self-reflection would do these passive-aggressive egomanics some good.  I&#x27;ve been around the engineering community long enough to know how these self-important trolls work. You should know it by now as well Dang.  I frankly don&#x27;t know what you are trying to save them from except maybe you pity them.')
