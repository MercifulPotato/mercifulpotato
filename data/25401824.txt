There was a famous academic troll[1] that revealed some of these humanities for the make believe they are. These people basically made up garbage papers that sounded like these feminist, gender studies, and critical race disciplines and published them in peer reviewed journals. Even the people in these disciplines can&#x27;t tell satire from seriousness - and that&#x27;s damning. They even published a rewrite of mein kampf. Why should my tax dollars go towards that?

Worth a listen.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;JoeRogan&#x2F;comments&#x2F;9l1lzs&#x2F;three_academics_write_hoax_articles_for_peer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;JoeRogan&#x2F;comments&#x2F;9l1lzs&#x2F;three_acad...</a>')
