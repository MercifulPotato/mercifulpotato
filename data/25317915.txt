Do any of those interest you?<p>Edit: I also want to say that I <i>strongly</i> encourage people interested in reading and learning philosophy to do it in a class or group setting, at least initially. It&#x27;s good to be an independent reader and interpreter, but most philosophy makes heavy use of terms of art that can be <i>profoundly</i> misleading or easy to misinterpret on one&#x27;s own, particularly when getting started.')
