Item(by='smichel17', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611079472, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835703, text='Fundamentally, there&#x27;s no &quot;profit&quot; to be made in OSS, nor public goods in general. If you try to charge for more than &quot;at cost&quot;, someone else can and will come along and undercut you.<p>Why the scare quotes? Well, I don&#x27;t mean <i>all</i> profit according to definition, but specifically the &quot;returns for investors&quot; type. <i>Company profits.</i> Technically you can run a sole proprietorship, and make (say) $100k in profit.. or you could structure as a corporation, pay yourself a $100k salary, and make no profit. It&#x27;s all the same money, but it&#x27;s two ways of looking at the portion that I would like to describe as fair compensation to a human for the work they do. When I say &quot;at cost&quot;, I don&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s fundamentally impossible to make a living working on OSS; I mean it&#x27;s fundamentally impossible to <i>get filthy rich</i> with it.<p>And in my opinion that&#x27;s a good thing. In my experience, &quot;getting filthy rich&quot; &#x2F; providing outsized returns to investors almost always comes at someone else&#x27;s expense. Usually the little guy. It happens when the poor sod paying you can&#x27;t afford to switch to a competitor, so you&#x27;re able to wring them dry. The counter-argument goes that we need the &quot;filthy rich&quot; incentive to motivate people to make these things. I think it likely increases the rate of innovation, but I think the amount of cool and useful OSS written by people in their spare time is evidence enough that profit is not a <i>requirement</i> in that area, only financial security.<p>There is a problem, though, where it&#x27;s currently very difficult to even make a living wage working on OSS (again, or public goods in general). I think can be solved, and I am working on a project trying to solve this (as a volunteer; we could use help). I&#x27;ll cut it here (I spent far too much time writing this comment already...), but you can read more at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.snowdrift.coop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.snowdrift.coop</a>')
