Cursive reduces the number of times you lift the stylus from the paper, greatly reducing the number of blots or gaps in flow of a fountain pen. Biros don&#x27;t have that problem. Still, writing in cursive on good paper with a proper fountain pen has an aesthetic that I&#x27;d not like to give up.<p>Arguably, the shift to keyboarding completed cursive&#x27;s downfall. My children report that, although they did learn cursive in primary school, they now (High School) don&#x27;t know anyone who uses it. I&#x27;ve had post-secondary students complain that they have difficultly reading cursive comments on submissions, even if I&#x27;ve taken pains to write neatly (I no longer challenge them thus.)<p>I do find one thing puzzling: why has the effort once expended on teaching elegant cursive not shifted over to instruction in touch typing? None of my students report having had instruction in that (I&#x27;ve polled them several times). It seems odd to me that very so very few of the so-called &quot;digital natives&quot; I work with can challenge the skills I learned on an IBM electric 45 years ago.')
