I have a good memory and could remember a great deal of what I had read. But I quickly learned that there were only so many hours in the day, and I had only been alive for so many days.<p>It is just extremely hard to out study or out smart years and years of experience. When someone has been alive and cognitively able for 20+ years more than another person, they will inevitably have come across more information than the younger person could possibly have digested. Even if they aren&#x27;t really trying and don&#x27;t have the best memory.<p>This is not to say that knowing facts = smart. But just like being alive a lot longer gives you more facts, it also gives you a lot more experience.<p>Being young might mean you can think and learn a little faster, but I&#x27;ll take knowledge and experience over speed any day.')
