I wasn’t too bothered by it though because they still had some good normal ones. However, I was so infuriated when I found out all their new attachments only work on their crappy smart blenders.<p>As a brand they’re known for simplicity, performance, durability, and an extreme level of interoperability with their attachments. They’ve just thrown out everything that’s brought them their entire history of being incredibly successful. Compatibility is gone, the touch screen interface is tedious, and there’s no way it’s going to last longer than a single mechanical dial.<p>Also, I know how I want my food&#x2F;drinks blended better than some damn engineer at Vitamix HQ does. The programmed modes are beyond useless. Personally I suspect that the business model of selling a product to each customer only once per lifetime might not have been working out to satisfactory levels any more. &#x2F;rant')
