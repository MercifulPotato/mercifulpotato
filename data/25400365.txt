Because, to make sense in that order, ‘great’ can’t be merely a reference to the speaker’s opinion about the dragon (‘it’s grrrreat!’) or the size of it (‘great big enormous’), but instead a qualifier for a kind of dragon.<p>That you can infer that ‘great’ connotes something different because of its position in the adjective sequence is an argument in favor of the idea that the sequencing is semantically meaningful, not against it.')
