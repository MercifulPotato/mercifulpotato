Even if a small one given a lack of supporting argument.<p>If tptacek, security researcher, says a case is no real case (even with arguments) and an attorney contradicts him then that is evidence tptacek is wrong.<p>Realistically, I still expect Ptacek to be right - I don&#x27;t see how Amazon could be forced to host something they don&#x27;t want to. Nor why it would make sense to make them to. So I hope this lawsuit fails. But the way Parler was assassinated seems a bit questionable and there might be some cause for complaint there. It may be that AWS&#x27;s terms of service are overruled by some law somewhere and they&#x27;ll owe someone money.')
