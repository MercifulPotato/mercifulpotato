Aside from the wages his employer reports to the federal government, property ownership records, and an SSN, he simply doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>His get paid each week in cash.  Doesn&#x27;t have a bank account or credit card.  Because of his lifestyle and the type of vehicle he uses, he doesn&#x27;t need a driver&#x27;s license, registration, or insurance.  His home has solar panels, a propane generator, and a well, so no utilities.  I don&#x27;t know what he does about trash service, but having seen the town, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s still legal to burn your garbage on your property.<p>He&#x27;s happy. Not paranoid that I can tell. He just lives a simple life where satisfaction comes from reading books and improving his mind, and not from hoarding electronic gadgets and social media thumbs to prove his worth.')
