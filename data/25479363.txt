I absolutely agree that this type of death squad summary \nexecution crap is unacceptable. It&#x27;s less reported now, but the taliban use the same type of tactics of fear to project control over the population. Leaving a power vacuum for the taliban will also lead to atrocities and medieval rules for the female population. I&#x27;m sure the military industrial complex has played some role in this war,  but there really are lots of people in our military trying to be honorable and do the right thing.')
