Launched with a post on hacker news. I added couple of contractors who share the development on-demand. Last month, for the first time, we hit 10K users, no paid advertising, hitting 170K requests per month. Not expecting to cash out any profits now, investing them in the development. Now, I&#x27;m dealing B2B contracts and taking customizations for the businesses. The goal is to hit at least 3K in profit by next year end.
