Item(by='xienze', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610149327, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25692125, text='&gt; Is it just my perception, or is their actual justification using the 2 quoted tweets kinda weak? Interpreting his boycott of an even as call to violence seems like a huge stretch.<p>Of course it is.  They’ve been itching to ban him since day one but held off due to the negative PR of saying “the president of the US isn’t allowed on our platform” and the obvious fuel to the “bias in tech” fire.  I’m not even mad, we all knew this day would come.<p>What bothers me is there have been plenty of tweets all summer long by Democrats and others cheering on the protests which, to put it lightly, caused a bit of violence and certainly didn’t help in the spread of Covid.<p>And there is of course the recent tweet where AOC said the point of protests is to make people uncomfortable.  There is definitely more than one way someone could interpret the meaning of “uncomfortable”, for sure.  I just wish Twitter and other big tech companies would apply  the same principles across the board instead of selectively playing the “well if you consider it with THIS context...” game.')
