Sleep phase issues, obstructive sleep apnea, and now not sleeping long enough, possibly related to acid reflux &#x2F; hiatal hernia. I need to get an updated CPAP.<p>Already take a multivitamin, b complex, and 5k IU D3 and 250 IU K2 MK7.<p>Changed diet to cut weight by 40 lbs in 3 months by budgeting macros to 1500 cal&#x2F;day (43% protein, 21% carbs, 36% fats).<p>I exercise in the morning (best time to improve sleep). I walk fast to stores some distance away and do weightlifting.<p>Fast caffeine metabolizer but it&#x27;s bad for my stomach and anxiety levels. caffeine might be neuroprotective and boost workout performance, and coffee hepatoprotective, but it&#x27;s not worth the other issues it creates.')
