They might send the order to a broker or if they are a broker, then to the market. I think Swift messages are part of that communication. They usually are sent to custodial banks. I forget if the broker or custodial bank holds the certificate. Then theres a whole clearing process which takes 2 days. Dark pools and other agents can be involved. I think CFA foundations has details on the whole process.<p>There&#x27;s also a similar process for funds. Sometimes the orders don&#x27;t need to be sent to the market. Basically if fund A is selling a stock and fund B is buying the same stock, then only the net order is sent to the market.<p>Symbiont is working on blockchain tech to shorten the settle time make the records immutable. Sort of interesting stuff.')
