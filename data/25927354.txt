D-bus is fantastic in its own right and good at abstracting functionalities.<p>It still annoys me that Linux went down the route of hald for so long, before making the pivot to dbus (and udev). Especially since I was using FreeBSD in the 00&#x27;s and early 10&#x27;s, which had devd (an event-based system similar to udev, vs hald&#x27;s polling system) and had to be hacked for all those years to emulate HAL&#x27;s interface.<p>It would be far less annoying if there were some benefits to HAL&#x27;s approuch, but event-based systems had long since been proven in nearly every OS except Linux.')
