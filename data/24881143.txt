Sure, C++ isn&#x27;t a perfect superset of C, but you could mostly write C-style code in C++, right?<p>I&#x27;ve seen this sentiment before from C enthusiasts. Maybe it makes sense on the Linux kernel, where you don&#x27;t want to keep telling contributors not to use the most common C++ features.<p>But I don&#x27;t think it makes sense on very small projects, and maybe I just draw the dividing line for where it stops working at a different size of project than he did.<p>[1] Exceptions suck and constructors suck and C++ would be better if it was just Rust with no borrow-checker.')
