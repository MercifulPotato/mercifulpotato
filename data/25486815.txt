For example, I remember we paid one company a fair bit of money to fax us any data sheets they had on specific competitive products when we were about to do a product announcement. (Oh, and we paid them for each category of computer systems we wanted access to information on.) Basically, everyone sent this firm their data sheets because we couldn&#x27;t really ask each other directly. That was how one did competitive analysis.<p>I think if I were to go back in time, I&#x27;d quit after a week because I would feel I simply didn&#x27;t have access to the information I needed to do my job.')
