For us Store means key-value or crud data storage. I think if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re calling repository for persistence then that&#x27;s it. If you&#x27;re thinking repository as in git then that&#x27;s a separate connective piece from &quot;source to running&quot; which basically you can do by running the git URL.<p>On the store front. We are working on a data model so we can move beyond key-value which might end up being of interest.')
