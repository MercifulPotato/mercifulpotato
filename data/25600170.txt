No body wants to be one when they grow up.<p>That said, were I in your shoes, I&#x27;d spend a lot of time studying the theses of the shorts that have both profited and been buried by TSLA over the last 5 years. Tesla was savaged by them and endured one highlighted, publicized flaw after another. They are even well known and called into Tesla&#x27;s quarterly calls, looking for responses they could use against the stock. If you&#x27;re a player you might be able to get them on the phone and ask what did and didn&#x27;t work.<p>I&#x27;ve been long TSLA for 8 years. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve said to my wife, &#x27;we really should sell some now&#x27;. I said it at $100, $250, $500, and now $700. We still haven&#x27;t sold.<p>It&#x27;s not rational, but even irrational behavior can have an explanation. 2020 was a hopeless year. Tesla, and it&#x27;s older brother SpaceX, both engender hope and point to a better future. Maybe people need to buy in as a way to get through this time.')
