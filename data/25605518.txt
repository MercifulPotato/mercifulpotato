That kind of thing can happen in any company. Apple is thousands of employees, it only requires a few bad people to create a situation like that.<p>I&#x27;m not sure though, creating a post like that is the best thing. I don&#x27;t know what exists in the US, but in France, you can sue your employer for free (You don&#x27;t even need a lawyer), and if you are able to show a few emails showing abuse, there is like almost 100% chance the company will loose<p>EDIT: To the people who downvote me, seriously why ?')
