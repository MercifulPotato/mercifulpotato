Item(by='__blockcipher__', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603997280, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24933831, text='&gt; What do you think is more probable. That every single news  organization out there, every single journalist, including NPR as you mention, are trying to hide this very real story and are wrong, while the one publication is in the right. Or that maybe, just maybe, it&#x27;s the other way around and NYP published something that has not been well vetted?<p>Great thought exercise. I&#x27;m happy to inform you that I have actually already considered both scenarios and am confident that it really is this:<p>&gt; every single news organization out there, every single journalist, including NPR as you mention, are trying to hide this very real story and are wrong<p>If you look back at the media in the last four years that shouldn&#x27;t be as surprising as you are implying.<p>Although I take issue with &quot;every single journalist&quot;, since the point of Greenwald&#x27;s piece, among others, is that even if one journalist wants to tell the truth, they will be suppressed.<p>---<p>To go more concrete here though, are you specifically claim that the <i>materials</i> are not real, or that the story of how they were acquired is false? The former is absolutely undeniable; the latter is up for debate but I personally don&#x27;t even think the laptop repair shop story is fabricated.<p>I personally watched (part of) the video of Hunter Biden smoking crack while receiving a footjob, so unless you think it&#x27;s a body double or a deepfake there is no doubt in my mind that these documents are real. Furthermore the big smoking gun is the financial documents which should be trivially easy for a journalist to debunk. So if you want to question how the materials are acquired, go ahead, but the documents themselves are real, and they show very questionable business dealings in China, Ukraine, and Russia.<p>BTW, the existence for years now of the Russia Collusion hoax - namely, the debunked notion that Trump is a vassal of Vladimir Putin and directly colluded with Russia to win the US election - should tell us everything we need to know about the intellectual integrity of the corporate press.')
