But things were just fine.<p>I admit I haven&#x27;t really done this for a while--though I came close last year. But TBH, I&#x27;ll keep vaguely in touch these days when I conveniently can and deal with anything that&#x27;s urgent or really can&#x27;t wait. (Like I did an interview from a B&amp;B room that really needed to be done--an then wasn&#x27;t used of course.)<p>IMO, a lot of people put way too much pressure on themselves to be available 24&#x2F;7&#x2F;365 who don&#x27;t need to. And if that really is the expectation maybe they should look someplace else unless it&#x27;s their company or something something really special to them.')
