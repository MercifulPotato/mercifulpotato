If any of the 100UL candidates pass certification, it’s a fair bet that they’ll be safe and I’ll have no concern with flying on them.<p>The real issue is that while you can suffer a 10% power or energy-density  reduction (such as from alcohol displacing gasoline in the fuel) in an automotive application without any appreciable loss of safety and minimal loss of functionality, the same is not true for aircraft. Piston aircraft takeoffs are always* done at maximum available power and a 10% loss of power is cause for an abort.<p>So it’s unlikely that a fuel with materially worse performance would be certified.<p>* - There were some extremely old multi-engine transports which had tables for reduced power takeoffs and some pilots mistakenly do them today, but the overwhelming practice is 100% of available.')
