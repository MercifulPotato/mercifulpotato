It&#x27;s a zero cost action for them, and easily lets them control what opinions other readers see about a topic.<p>Example: In every thread about browsers, if most people say they dislike Edge, anyone simply saying &quot;Hey I like Edge, it&#x27;s not so bad&quot; gets downvoted.<p>So after a while that Edge user will be preemptively defensive the next time they voice their opinion, if they even feel like participating anymore.')
