Very recently FBs position was that their platform shouldn’t be filtering ‘fake news’ because they are a communication platform rather than a media company.<p>Clearly different sites will choose a different position on filter vs free speech.<p>Filtering &#x2F; moderation has usually been applied to “forums” (of which I would lump HN with) rather than “social graph websites” where posts are typically shared between friends and followers.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m sure you would expect basic protections.<p>Actually I don’t to be honest! I think free speech is generally the best policy. I do think reform is required though in how posts (and advertisements) are displayed and ranked on social feeds though for instance.')
