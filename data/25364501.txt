Item(by='everdrive', descendants=None, kids=[25364996], score=None, time=1607546287, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25364318, text='&gt;Many people have beliefs about Trump where, IF I had the same beliefs I&#x27;d totally be on board with voter fraud to get him out of office.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t, but this is because of the game theory sort of nature of democracy. If I can do it, so can my opponents. Suppose Trump is evil, and defeated, and next election my side has a truly wonderful and excellent candidate. (again, I&#x27;m just being theoretical.) I don&#x27;t want the other side to be able to beat my candidate using voter fraud. Ideally, no one can beat anyone using voter fraud.<p>&gt;The rationalistic question is something along the lines of &quot;how do you adjust your priors of voter<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean, but I&#x27;m guessing you mean &quot;this party has previously had issues with voter fraud, and therefore it&#x27;s not stretch to be concerned about it again.&quot; If I have you correct, I&#x27;d again say that this is a fine suspicion, but then evidence must be produced. If evidence cannot be produced, then the priors alone are not enough. To use a very flimsy metaphor, suppose in a small town there is a kid who has robbed a convenience store. Later, when another convenience store is robbed it might make sense to suspect the kid. But, you had better not charge or convict him unless you can produce some real evidence. (and to be clear, I am not comparing either party to a common criminal, I just wanted a simple metaphor which I thought best explained the argument.)')
