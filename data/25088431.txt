People expect electricity to just work. People also are likely to plug their cars in at peak time after they get home from work and may want them somewhat charged before going out again in the evening.<p>I think demand response can help, but there is the fundamental issue that transportation uses as much as all electrical consumption currently, so there will be twice as much kWh needed.<p>That 7:1 ratio looks actually a lot worse in power terms. A streetlight consumes maybe 100W, 7 EVs could soak up 350kW for a period of time.<p>This is made much worse in N America with 110V everywhere.')
