Targeting these people with harassment should be encouraged, NOT because they support Trump, but because they are Nazis.<p>Trump and non-nazi Trump supporters MUST NOT be harassed by simple association, EXCEPT to the extent that they are themselves protecting the nazis, or trying to muddy the waters.<p>Because a lot of people ARE muddying the waters from the &quot;Trump&quot; side as well: instead of recognizing that many attacks are against literal nazis who happen to support Trump, they act as if the attacks are against Trump supporters in general, or that people are calling a crowd nazis because they support Trump, not because they were chanting &quot;jews will not replace us&quot;. Or claiming that Trump, who said about the crowd chanting &quot;jews will not replace us&quot; and the antifa counter-protest &quot;there are fine people on both sides&quot;, was not literally defending nazis in this case.')
