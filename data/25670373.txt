It&#x27;s an area of current research[1].<p>A datalog implementation can serve as DSL, learning tool, and&#x2F;or efficient solver of large problems.  For the first two, most languages have a little datalog implementation or three.<p>For datalog engines, perhaps Z3 and its fixpoint engine from python??  Or maybe Souffl√© from python??  But I really have no idea what&#x27;s plausible.  I too would be interested.<p>&gt; database&#x2F;persistence<p>That&#x27;s something with a big diverse active market.  Datalog engines, not so much.  So I&#x27;m unclear that datalog is a place to go for that?  But I also pay no attention to non-open-source offerings.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1909.08246.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1909.08246.pdf</a>')
