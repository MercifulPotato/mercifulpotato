Which, in theory, act as a buffer to stabilize prices.<p>The problem is that the cost savings of moving is so great that it was cheaper to pay to break the lease than it would be to stay.  We saw the reverse of this before: when landlords were paying people $8,000 to move early because rent inflation meant they could charge much more than that to the next tenant.<p>SF is an outlier because of the income disparity, relatively low housing density, and unique climate &amp; economic opportunity available there.')
