I know the guys who wrote SoundFlower. I asked them why they wrote SoundFlower when JACK already existed. They said it was because 90% of their user base never wanted 90% of what JACK made possible, so they cooked up a really simple version. &quot;But it barely does anything!&quot; I insisted, grumpily. &quot;Precisely&quot;, they said.<p>If you don&#x27;t understand the engineering mindset that says that you probably shouldn&#x27;t do this, then certainly, macOS will look like a much better idea (along with SoundFlower).<p>That will likely remain true until you run into a situation involving one of the many things that JACK makes possible (note however that I generally advise most new&#x2F;casual users against using JACK these days, not because it is broken but because as your comment demonstrates, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to the mindset&#x2F;workflow that they bring to the table).')
