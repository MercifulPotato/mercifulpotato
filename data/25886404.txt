Item(by='rubyn00bie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611438030, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25882722, text='I&#x27;d really like to point out this:<p>&gt; Hyperinflation is so incredibly destructive that youâ€™d think macroeconomists would spend a lot of time studying the phenomenon, figuring out when and why it happens. Especially because the answer to the question of hyperinflation is also the answer to the question of how much the government can borrow. An understanding of hyperinflation would give us a flashlight to shine down the infinite corridor, so we could avoid the pit.<p>... is pretty ignorant. You have an unrealistic fear of hyperinflation propagated by your ideals; to the point, you think it&#x27;s important or relevant in situations where it&#x27;s not. Perhaps, and this is just a thought here, if no one educated on the matter seems to give a shit about it there might be a reason. The US deficit is by and large a bogey-man most people love to wax on but hate to learn about... unless you like the scientific method but even then it is mostly depressing.<p>To me, the whole things sounds like a rant telling physicists, &quot;you haven&#x27;t studied enough planets like Jupiter, and without Jupiter, I cannot explain Earth. Please explain Jupiter!&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s the real shit, that&#x27;s boring, but true:<p>Hyperinflation is no risk to the US economy at present. We are the world&#x27;s piggy-bank, the wealthiest piggies in the world love the US, because we&#x27;re the only nation on the planet who has always let&#x27;s them have it back. The USA has never frozen the dollar. This puts the US an unbelievable economic advantage that nearly all of its citizens fail to realize.<p>Think about it:<p>1. The US dollar is the defacto (for now) global currency.<p>2. It&#x27;s really hard to default when your debt is in your own currency.

Yep, that&#x27;s the rub. We can 100% print money.<p>Nope, instead of printing it [1] to invest in our infrastructure, citizens, and planet we share-- we piss it away. We piss it away handing out tax cuts to the rich. We piss it away blowing shit up in deserts fighting other nation&#x27;s equivalent of rednecks. We piss it away funding racist police and prison systems. We piss it away every day; that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called the &quot;trickle down.&quot;<p>In another 50 or a 100 years, when other nations are financially larger, more stable, and many, many, trillions of dollars of risk could be safely diversified anywhere else... then yes, the US could be at risk because it may not be able to issue debt in its own currency.<p>[1] Most everyone doesn&#x27;t understand extremely large numbers and when one looks at the quantities over a certain size they all muddle together. It takes a lot of effort and reading to be able to look at billions, hundreds of billions, and trillions to make sense of and not fear those numbers. That&#x27;s why people are able to fear things that would literally help them; the numbers are &quot;all the same to them&quot; and thus they&#x27;re all equally bad or misunderstood.')
