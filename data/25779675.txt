Just smash as many buttons as they could at the same time at all sorts of random points in the game. This was a <i>constant</i> source of bugs. It was surprisingly easy to get the game into a state where it was totally hung because of this.<p>One of the main culprits was transitions between screens in the UI. So much of the UI code assumed that the initial state of a screen is that no buttons are currently pressed. But if you mash a bunch down in the middle of a transition, the screen can end up receiving a button up event that did not precede any button down event. If the screen&#x27;s code assumed every up has a preceding down, it could get into a broken state.<p>I never did see any clean systematic solution to this problem. I still think about it a lot when I do UI programming. In the back of my head, I&#x27;m always wondering, &quot;what will happen if the user presses X in the middle of this animation?&quot;<p>Programmers are particularly prone to these bugs because we have unconsciously trained ourselves to baby our own software. We&#x27;re careful to wait for transitions to complete and only send input when the app is in a known state.')
