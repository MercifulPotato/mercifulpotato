Most people are not Nazis, and most of the bad discourse on the internet does not involve Nazis.<p>Two somewhat-reasonable people, even if they&#x27;re complete strangers, could have a productive discussion (or at least resolve to agree to disagree, if it gets a little heated) if they were to meet in person to hash things out.  But in an online conversation, especially on a limited medium like Twitter or Mastodon, they could both easily devolve into talking past each other, name-calling, and arguing in bad faith.')
