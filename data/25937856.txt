It, like the GPL, discourages commercial use by encouraging users of the software to open source any software they want to build on top of this software.<p>RMS would not be upset that the GPL poisons the well because companies don&#x27;t want to open source their code, RMS would say they are denying user freedoms by failing to open source their code. The SSPL merely builds on this.<p>The only real sticking point here seems to be the OSI, and probably some manner of lobbying by tech firms to keep the SSPL from being accepted more widely as an open source license.')
