There would be a price point that will trigger a run-off but it still seems to be sustained by the &quot;fuck you&quot; message and playing chicken.<p>The problem here is that game theory completely mess the incentives, everyone needs to play chicken (or buy out the ones selling) or everyone loses on potential profit. But if just a few people trigger a sell out, everyone loses.<p>It&#x27;s a very strange Mexican stand-off and my take is that is held, for now, by anger and excitement to see what happens when the shorts have to cover. When the shorts start buying and driving the price up we will see how many are able to hold (and up to what point).<p>This is quite fascinating to me, game theory would predict this shouldn&#x27;t have happened with so many different players with conflicting interests.')
