This is mistaken as the information also holds temporal information, which is actually what is very useful. It&#x27;s not a Yo at some random point, it&#x27;s a Yo now. It&#x27;s really encoding &quot;now!&quot;. Still not very much information but a ton more than 1 bit, its a timestamps worth in fact...<p>&#x2F;pedant')
