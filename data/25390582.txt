Item(by='snapetom', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607718739, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25387635, text='&gt; Bluetooth just works better on Apple devices<p>My experience with Bluetooth headphones are Airpods 1, 2, and my Senneheiser Momentums.<p>I think I can count on one hand how many times the Sennheisers needed a re-pairing, and that&#x27;s using them pretty much every work day.  The Airpods are far from reliable.  I use them for running 3x a week, and I probably have to re-pair them once a month.  This has been consistent with the 1 and 2.<p>However, this is due to what Apple is trying to do.  The Sennheisers just pairs and plays music.  The AirPods are detecting what ear they&#x27;re in, connecting when in the ear, tapping, Siri, etc.  There are much more opportunities for failure with the AirPods.')
