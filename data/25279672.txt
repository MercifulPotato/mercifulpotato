Is it that owning your own cheap launch platform makes launching lots of satellites instead of one big one feasible? Is it some new antenna miniaturization technology? If that were the case, I would think this would have been invented by one of the myriad existing players in the space. Why is this apparently revolutionary progress in internet satellite technologies coming out of nowhere from a company (SpaceX) that has nothing to do with connectivity or satellites?')
