You can&#x27;t continue doing this and expect it to be recieved well.<p>Yes the extreme right is ridiculous.  But the extreme left is too.<p>Spend some time outside silicon valley and other liberal hubs.  Understand the perspective of others.<p>I am not in favor of violence.  I am not in favor of Trump&#x27;s behavior.  However Trumps stance on policy typically aligns more closely with what I believe than Biden.  Behavior like this alienates me.<p>Again, I do not love Trump.  Far from it.  But these moves come across not as anti-extreme-right, but anti-conservative.')
