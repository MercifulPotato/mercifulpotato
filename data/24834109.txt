Google and Apple are not going to be harmed in the least, because Google and Apple already pay a disproportionate amount of real property taxes in Santa Clara County. If Prop 15 makes legacy businesses pay a fair assessment on their parcels, relative newcomers like Google will be helped, not harmed. Google is Santa Clara County&#x27;s largest taxpayer, paying $65 million in secured property taxes last year. If older large companies like Intel begin to pay realistic assessments, it won&#x27;t be so skewed.')
