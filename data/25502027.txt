One thing goes in, one thing comes out (in an abstract sense). Multiple side effects starts getting dodgy as it makes the function harder to predict and reason about. I do err for longer easier to read functions. And don’t compose into functions until it’s clear you will actually reuse the code or you actually need to reuse it :) DRY is good but premature composition is just as annoying as premature optimization.')
