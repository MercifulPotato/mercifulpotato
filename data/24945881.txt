It is a close race, with great potential for a 3rd party influencing the outcome. This is exactly where RCV is the right way to tally the votes.<p>Interesting bit is that RCV was implemented as a result of Maine ballot initiative in 2016, but it took years to actually implement it because of the lawsuits.<p>The politicians fought hard against it: the people&#x27;s vote  was repealed by Maine legislature right away. In 2017 voters had to vote on it again, and overruled the repeal.<p>Maine is viewed as a testbed: if RCV works there, it could be the model for the nation. It is on the ballot for congressional elections in Massachusetts right now.')
