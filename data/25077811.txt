Item(by='AnimalMuppet', descendants=None, kids=[25077822], score=None, time=1605231394, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25077678, text='&gt; None of which you were willing to enumerate...<p>Because it&#x27;s pretty obvious.  You&#x27;re trying to score some cheap rhetorical points, and I decline to give them to you.<p>&gt; Protections of free speech are much weaker in most of the rest of the free and rich world. Why donâ€™t those negative effects show up there?<p>They don&#x27;t at the moment show up strongly in most of the rest of the free and rich world.  They show up in, for example, China.  (Though negative effects show up in England from their libel laws, for example.  They just aren&#x27;t as flagrant as what you see in China.)<p>To put the burden of proof on the other foot:  Is there any reason to think that the absence of FA-type free speech guarantees is making things <i>better</i> in the rest of the free and rich world?  If not, I&#x27;ll keep the guarantee, because I <i>really like</i> being able to say what I please.')
