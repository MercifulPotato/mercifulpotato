That feeling lasted a few months, but now (after hearing about others&#x27; expectations of happiness after the pandemic prompted me to ruminate) I&#x27;m more anxious than before lock-down.<p>I&#x27;m not receiving mental healthcare now (because I &quot;completed&quot; my previous bouts of mental healthcare, even though I don&#x27;t think they had much effect).<p>I do have a support network of sorts, but I&#x27;m not sure how best to raise my problems. I&#x27;ll probably seek professional help again, but I suspect activating my support network could transform the success of treatment.')
