I tried to document as much as possible. Currently, a lot of UI features are not ready, and the HTML and CSS parser both need major rework.<p>&gt; Right now it looks like the whole V-lang debacle IMO with lots of features promised and no way to know what is implemented and not, while wrapping other projects without acknowledging it.<p>Not a single external library included. Pretty much everything implemented by myself over the last 1 1&#x2F;2 years.<p>Please don&#x27;t confuse a Browser with a Browser Engine. I never claimed to replace WebKit, Blink and neither Gecko.<p>For now, I, as a single person working on the project, just didn&#x27;t have the time to fork Servo into a reduced library that can be bundled anyhow - because that&#x27;s a shitload of work to be done. For now I&#x27;m focussing on parsing and filtering, because the underlying network concept was proven to work. I had to build a test runner, too, to be able to even test these behaviours.<p>Currently the prototype of the UI is implemented in HTML5, reusing as much as possible from the nodejs-side ES2018 modules.')
