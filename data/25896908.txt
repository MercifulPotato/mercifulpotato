He certainly was one of the first people to publicly call out that companies like Google and VC-backed startups spend a LOT of effort on PR that they are &quot;social good&quot; despite being as ruthlessly money-making oriented as any conventional companies they claimed not to be. He coined one of my favorite sayings that &quot;Silicon Valley is just Wall St for people who can&#x27;t wake up early.&quot; Those takes are a little less novel in 2021 now that everyone realizes how morally bankrupt companies like Google are but credit&#x27;s due where it&#x27;s due so I&#x27;d recommend checking out his old blog posts.')
