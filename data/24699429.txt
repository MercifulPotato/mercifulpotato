If you&#x27;re hiking, adding feral pig encounter to the existing mountain lion or bear encounter, can be overwhelming.<p>I found it interesting how hunting backfires (scatters them and increases their range) as it seems to be always pounded into me &quot;hunted out of existence&quot; was a common thing that hunters would do if left to their own devices (I know, there is a LOT of propaganda in this space!) That said, I&#x27;m surprised there are not more trapping &amp; slaughtering programs in place.<p>The engineer in me wants to slaughter the pigs, use the cesium capsules at Hanford to irradiate&#x2F;sterilize the meat of all bacteria and parasites, and then turn it into free bacon and&#x2F;or jerky for whomever needs it. Impractical for sure but free bacon right?')
