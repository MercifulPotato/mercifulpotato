To be in the study you it looks like you had to joined voluntarily on your own accord, indicating a participant group with an interest in it:<p>&gt; Recruitment involved media advertisements and contacting private companies and public organizations<p>If anything, I find it easy to believe that adherence would be less in the general population than in this study. Particularly stuff like wearing masks incorrectly, eg not covering the nose, leaving gaps, etc.')
