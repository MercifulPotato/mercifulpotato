Because your comment talks about Asians, Irish, Italians, Mexicans, Indians and others but not about Gypsys at all.<p>&quot;Lynchings, pogroms, and gas chambers&quot; - are you serious?! What world do you live in?<p>And please check yourself with that racial hate on gypsy culture. Their culture is dark, mysterious, romantic, nomadic, wonderful and beautiful in its own way. It has different values from your culture (and mine) and leads to different outcomes but you shouldn&#x27;t hate it.<p>Get yourself involved with a community or organization working with Gypsy people and maybe you&#x27;ll start to understand them better instead of summarily judge them and those who know them.')
