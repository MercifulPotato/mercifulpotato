Reason being customised GPUs don&#x27;t really save any significant cost but their resale value is basically nil, while they can resell consumer cards once they stop making money on the mining (they are usually still relevant by that point, though most savvy buyers will try to avoid old mining cards because they&#x27;ve been run pretty heavily already and are more likely to fail).')
