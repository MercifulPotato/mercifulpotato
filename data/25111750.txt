So 2 billion doses.<p>I believe that if Moderna found their vaccine didn&#x27;t work they would license the Pfizer one as I assume their factories can be converted in a few months. Note that these are mRNA factories - I wouldn&#x27;t expect a someone working on a different type of vaccine to be able to convert their factory. I would also expect that the process of conversion to produce a different vaccine will takes some months and cost us half a billion doses next year. This is just speculation though, there is no reason to make a license deal so we won&#x27;t find out.<p>You can assume all manufacturers are watching each other. Some of the &quot;getting ready to enter phase one trials&quot; vaccines will probably be canceled as there is no point. If one of the promising candidates in trials fails Pfizer and Moderna will build (or license) more factory space because there is less competition for the demand.')
