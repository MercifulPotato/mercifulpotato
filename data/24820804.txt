The apartment I had didn&#x27;t come with any kind of oven. That was 10 years ago. I still use it everyday and it&#x27;s almost flawless. I use it over any oven I get with rentals I live in now. It keeps temperature way better and heats up incredibly fast compared to any gas or electric oven I&#x27;ve used. I don&#x27;t even have to wait for it to warm up, I just throw stuff in and it works out.<p>Double-walled cups&#x2F;glasses&#x2F;containers. I really like Bodum&#x27;s double walled glasses and so does my partner. They really transform the way you drink things - allowing you to go much slower. I also use double-walled cups that have a top to them like those 30oz RTIC Tumblers and with a straw. This allows for carbonated beverages to last <i>way</i> longer than in an open container and they stay cool for a really long time. It&#x27;s not uncommon for me to come back after 8+ hours and there still be a lot of ice in the cup. We also have other double-walled containers like Hydroflasks and what not too.<p>High performance cordless drills&#x2F;impacts. I know it seems a bit obvious but get the best set you can and it&#x27;ll do you wonders for speed. I use powered ratchets and everything and jobs just go so much quicker now. I used to only use hand tools for everything and now everything is a joke. Rusted old exhaust bolts don&#x27;t need penetrating oil or anything - everything just flies off. It&#x27;s just incredible. They&#x27;re not a full replacement for hand tools but a great supplement.<p>High(er) quality headphones. I started with Sennheiser HD555s some years back and they were great. In fact, I&#x27;d say that level of jump is all you really need. Everything after has incredible diminishing returns. Comfort is really key - as I had headphones that physically would hurt after 30 minutes to an hour. So, get ones that fit you well or you can put different earpads on that will help. Whatever you need.<p>Better fitting and looking clothes. I used a resource like Ashley Weston for guidance. You&#x27;ll have to figure out who has guidance that best fits your own taste but she worked for me a bit.')
