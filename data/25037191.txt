(It&#x27;s so very common to work on things side-by-side and then want to split things out into more logical commits to describe things as individual changes.)<p>Coming from a darcs background where that was a natural and very easy part of the UX, I had reason to learn how to do it in git (because I was used to doing it quite often in darcs). When people watch me do it, they can&#x27;t believe that magic exists in git.<p>I agree with the above poster that if graphical user interfaces prioritized it better, if the CLI had a bit fewer warts (I still often confuse when to use `git add --patch` and when to use `git add --interactive` though it isn&#x27;t an awful confusion because you can get to one from the other when you remember how to use it), and if tutorials tried better to train people on the tools that already exist, a lot more people would presumably use them (daily in some cases). More awareness of tools like darcs and pijul does help in that by presenting UXes built around it, it does drive people to ask how to do equivalents in git.<p>(Why just the other week there was an HN headline where someone was really excited they hacked the email-focused `git format-patch` and a workflow akin to sending email to oneself to replicate `git add --patch` because they didn&#x27;t realize `git add --patch` was also a built-in tool.)')
