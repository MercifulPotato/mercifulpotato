The problem is if the reporters remain intrepid (as they currently seem to be), the people they interview-- like Ted Cruz-- end up looking like complete dumbasses. I&#x27;m honestly surprised they continue to get interviews with prominent figures.<p>That, to me, is the bigger problem. There are plenty of partisan pundits who feel comfortable appearing on the &quot;other&quot; cable news to play the wrestling villain. Nearly none of them will ever appear on Democracy Now, for example, because Amy will:<p>1. not negotiate ground rules for the interview in advance<p>2. ask occasional follow-up questions<p>Amy Goodman clearly sits pretty far on the left. But those two simple rules essentially made her as much of a nuisance to Bill Clinton as to George Bush. (And if you haven&#x27;t heard it, go on youtube and watch her grill Clinton when he was attempting to campaign during Hilary&#x27;s Senate run on Democracy Now.)<p>And that&#x27;s the bigger issue. I don&#x27;t really care whether some pundit reinforces my worldview or not. I care whether they fold under pressure when an intrepid reporter reveals they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about. The problem with MSNBC&#x2F;Fox&#x2F;CNN is they don&#x27;t usually (or even consistently) apply that pressure. (And sometimes actively suppress it, e.g., not telling their audience that one of their military analysts who is arguing for an invasion is also a board member of a defense contractor that would benefit from the invasion.)<p>Edit: clarifications')
