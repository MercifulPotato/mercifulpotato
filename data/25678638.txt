I don&#x27;t condone the looting and destruction, especially when it hits bystanders. But it didn&#x27;t start that way. The movement against racism did go through peaceful actions to make itself heard. Their demands were pushed back and the discriminations continued so they had to escalate.<p>They were cornered into that position.<p>The protesters who invaded the Capitol were not discriminated against. They just lost an election.\nNo one would&#x27;ve died if they protested peacefully.<p>You can&#x27;t equate these protests, just like you can&#x27;t equate self-defense and murder. The context is important.')
