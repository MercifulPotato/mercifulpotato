The disease model itself is necessarily limited.  Sure you have a molecule that hits the target, great.  But the struggle comes from being able to get that molecule to target in vivo without causing toxic effects.<p>Maybe we&#x27;re just missing on how we&#x27;re using words.  I don&#x27;t see how having a better disease model necessarily gets you to a better place on this.  Sure, you can get better SAR and can decrease the dose.  But as you point out, dosage is not just a function of SAR.<p>Having better tox models seems like the highest value, albeit very difficult, route here.  Which to me is a separate, more general, problem than a specific disease model.')
