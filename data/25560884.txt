You&#x27;re right.<p>But there&#x27;s an engineer in his 50&#x27;s, who worked in his company for many years. He had intimate knowledge of its systems and domain. But his company got bought out, and the new owners decided they don&#x27;t need that group anymore and lays off the entire group. Suddenly, his domain expertise is near-useless unless he can find another, similar position.<p>He interviews for other positions, but he is hit with questions he&#x27;s not familiar with. He drones on about his old systems&#x2F;architect like an old fogey who not up to date with the new, shiny stuff. He tries to study the new stuff, but he&#x27;s tired, overwhelmed, burnt out, etc. His interviewers realizes he has a lot of experience and probably highly skilled, but his skills and experience aren&#x27;t relevant enough to what their company is doing. They offer to hire him at a junior rate, or not hire him at all. Is this ageism, or is he not good enough?')
