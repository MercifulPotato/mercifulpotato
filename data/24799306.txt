The same way you can use phone number to log in to your google account even though it was not originally meant for it.<p>Also you mix debit&#x2F;credit thing with other stuff. Debit and credit cards authorize the same way. The difference is how the transactions are processed at your bank, but this has nothing to do with whether the transaction is pin or signature.')
