I can tell that your analysis separates out harmony and percussion as advertised as the video reacts very well to transients in music. This is a common criticism I have of music visualizers--often they don&#x27;t react to transients quickly enough to communicate the percussion patterns and that&#x27;s not an issue here.<p>The whole process creating the video was very easy. Some more control over the images used would be cool, but I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;d work. I do also like that the images are generated and unique for each project. Perhaps if it&#x27;s possible there could be an advanced feature to upload a pool of images to seed the generation of images. For example, if I wanted to create a video using landscape images of a particular type (mountains, forests, etc), this kind of feature would be very useful.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be a paying customer for this product, as I don&#x27;t have a commercial use for music visualization at the moment, but I&#x27;ll be playing around with it some more for sure. I have a big collection of synthesized versions of classical music I created for a project that never materialized, so I can see using this tool to revisit that music and perhaps create videos to share. Thanks for sharing this very cool project!')
