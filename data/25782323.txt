I was able to put up with taking BART with people openly smoking meth and shooting heroin but it was my wife&#x27;s safety that finally was the breaking point. We lived on the edge of Glen Park and Noe Valley and once my wife became pregnant we could no longer live in SF and feel safe. Every day I had to walk my wife to her car because we had constant trespassers in our building garage that the SFPD refused to address. The law protects criminals in SF, not the middle class. Want to go into Walgreens and steal all the makeup and fence it on Market Street? No one will stop you, but god forbid you ask the cops to remove a criminal on your property--no one will lift a finger.')
