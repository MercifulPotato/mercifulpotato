Disagreeing with company policy doesn&#x27;t mean that she was not a diligent worker doing the tasks she had been assigned to in good faith.<p>So far Google hasn&#x27;t stated the thing she did exactly that led her to being fired, ie the actionable thing she did that would have to be produced if she took it to a tribunal or to court?')
