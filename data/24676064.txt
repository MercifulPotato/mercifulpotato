If the format ever needs to be read by a machine, <i>something</i> has to do that disambiguation.<p>If it’s not provided by the format, you’ve turned every usage into a potential source of bugs that would otherwise be restricted to interchange&#x2F;stack implementation incompatibilities. In other words, now your format can have a different set of expectations even on the same system.<p>The natural response to that problem will be to bolt on validation, types, and documentation that is provided arbitrarily (and with varying quality).<p>IMO, efforts in human friendly formats should focus less on stripping out funny characters, and more on which minimal set of funny characters provide:<p>- Good readability<p>- Good editability<p>- Clarity of structure<p>- Clarity of data types<p>- Reasonable tolerance and flexibility for variance in arbitrary formatting&#x2F;style preference (particularly in delimiting long form&#x2F;multiline text and annotations), because no one can agree what good readability or editability means<p>- A flexible type system that allows machines and humans to <i>know</i> what a given datum is without variation or surprises<p>- Maybe humans should just use a GUI?')
