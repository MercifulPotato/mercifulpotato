I had been too eager to see a politically unambitious Silicon Valley engineer, a relic of the good old days of computer science graduate culture on the West Coast. But that is not the sort of person who attends the Bilderberg conference four years running, who pays regular visits to the White House, or who delivers “fireside chats” at the World Economic Forum in Davos.<p>My Grandmother had a subscription to <i>American Free Press</i>, a weekly&#x2F;biweekly&#x2F;monthly (?) newspaper. One of their reporters had covered the annual Bilderberg conference for decades.<p>The regular media did not discuss the Bilderburgers&#x27; activities. The organization kept a very tight lid on the existence of their group and where they&#x27;d be meeting, but that reporter successfully figured out what they&#x27;d discussed year after year. Future presidents tended to show up -- it was a part of the vetting process I guess, &quot;will this &#x27;Bill Clinton&#x27; fellow be useful to us?&quot; and so forth. Both parties&#x27; candidates would tend to make an appearance, so they&#x27;d be up to date on the Agenda for the years to come.<p>The Bilderberg group was named after their first meeting location, &quot;Bilderberg Hotel, a hotel in Oosterbeek in the Netherlands, namesake of the Bilderberg Group&quot; (wikipedia disambiguation page).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bilderberg_meeting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bilderberg_meeting</a>')
