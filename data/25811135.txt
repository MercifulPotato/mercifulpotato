Item(by='CryptoPunk', descendants=None, kids=[25819336], score=None, time=1610895507, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25809612, text='&gt;&gt;Unfortunately libertarianism today is more of a &quot;live and let die&quot;-type ideology, where those who cannot support themselves must fail, as they provide &quot;no value&quot;. It is social darwinism writ large.<p>Altruism is completely orthogonal to libertarianism. The only consistent property of libertarian policies is that they protect and preserve the right to voluntary interaction.<p>How people choose to voluntarily associate is in no way a concern of what&#x27;s defined as libertarianism.<p>In other words, one can believe and promote a society based on compassion, sharing and collectivism, or a society based on self-sufficiency and only profit-motivated interaction, and be equally libertarian.<p>&gt;&gt;the effects of gutting for instance the EPA has massive consequences, irreparable damage to the environment and to people&#x27;s health. Or do you think the people in Flint, Michigan should just move somewhere else?<p>There are a multitude of types of regulations, and not all of them violate the non-aggression moral principle that libertarianism holds as inviolable. Environmental regulations generally do not violate the right to free association, and can indeed protect rights, so are generally consistent with libertarianism.<p>Moreover, regulations have a multitude of effects, and not all of them positive. To quantify their net effect on human welfare requires far more evidence than the single data point you&#x27;ve provided. It requires a comprehensive and methodological accounting of their entire impact.<p>&gt;&gt;Voluntarism doesn&#x27;t work, for that exact reason. Hence why regulations and laws are needed.<p>Voluntarism does not imply a lack of laws. Voluntaryism can only be enforced with laws and a state to back it. There is a distinction between laws that protect people&#x27;s right to their life, liberty and property, and laws that violate it.')
