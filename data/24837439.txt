That is standard practice.<p>Only protocols which have withstood serious scrutiny and incentivized adversaries can be considered to have a level of security.<p>So if you want to claim MTProto 2 to be secure, it isn’t enough to say ‘it uses standard primitives’. It also isn’t enough to say ‘nobody has found any bugs yet’.<p>You need to demonstrate that received sufficient attention from motivated attackers before you can claim it is secure.  That’s just how it is with crypto.')
