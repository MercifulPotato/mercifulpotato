There is a price people are willing to buy and a price that people are willing to sell- which makes sense because if there&#x27;s a price in the market someone is willing to sell at and I&#x27;m willing to buy at that price I won&#x27;t put an order in the market at all - I&#x27;ll just trade against their order. So there&#x27;s a difference between the bid and the ask. So in the market you&#x27;ll have people willing to buy at $9.90 and sell for $10. Now in reality the true value is somewhere in that range. But if I think the real value is $9.93 I might not want to put an offer in the market for $9.95 because the price might move, and if the price moves I&#x27;m stuck paying $9.95 for something that just dropped to $9.70. For the offers I put into the market, I have to add some extra margin to account for risk. Whereas if you come directly to me and say you want to $9.95 - well I know you&#x27;re not going to move the market, so maybe I&#x27;m willing to trade with you for a smaller margin, safe in the knowledge I&#x27;m not taking on a very risky trade.')
