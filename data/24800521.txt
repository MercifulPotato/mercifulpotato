Your old Nim code will continue to work, and will just get faster‡.<p>† We are not sure that it&#x27;s bug-free yet, which is why it&#x27;s not the default for this release.<p>‡ Most of the time ORC speeds things up, but there are edge cases where it might slow things down. You&#x27;re encouraged to test your code with --gc:orc against our default GC and report performance regressions.')
