Each emergence of life probably only gets one roll of this die. While I&#x27;m sure a chemistry exists that supports vertical scaling 1000x beyond our own, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to speculate that such genetic chemistry could be rare.<p>Energetics and thermodynamics are absolutely capable of imposing harsh boundaries. How long has our battery technology been stuck at this order of magnitude? How long have internal combustion and explosives been stuck at this order of magnitude? A long time, and that&#x27;s with an enormous number of very clever and motivated people chipping away at the problem.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why I chose distributed systems in my analogy: it proves that information science and engineering are not immune to the &quot;difficulty barrier&quot; problem. Vertical scaling hit a soft limit in the software industry long before it enabled the largest cloud-scale applications we see today. The transition from vertical to horizontal scaling was painful, but not nearly as painful as it would have been to wait for vertical scaling to catch up. We&#x27;d still be waiting.')
