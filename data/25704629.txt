Item(by='ekzy', descendants=None, kids=[25704950], score=None, time=1610225611, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700135, text='2 years ago I created a guitar chords website to solve a problem I have with finding songs to play on my guitar&#x2F;ukulele. You can login with your Spotify account and get some suggestions based on your listening history, and also import Spotify playlists.<p>I wanted to create a website that is lightweight, more accessible and less invasive for the user. Existing chords&#x2F;tabs websites can be a real pain to use. The design and the UX of my app is a bit clunky, but it&#x27;s fast and works and without JS. I have not really touched it since but I kept it online because some people use it (including me). I&#x27;m getting around 5-10k unique visitors per months, I think mostly from google searches.<p>I also worked on a feature that generates printable songbooks that people can order but I am concerned about copyright and legal issues, any comment on that would be welcome. I&#x27;ve implemented it already but activated just for me, and I ordered a few books already... (all the pdf generation, payment and shipping workflow works).<p>I&#x27;d love to get some design help or some fresh ideas for the project.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lyrink.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lyrink.com</a>')
