But if you don&#x27;t trust them to fix a single flaw, why in god&#x27;s name do you trust them to design an entirely new plane? This is not a reason to push for a redesign.<p>Well it&#x27;s not just experts. There&#x27;s a bunch of factors surrounding this design decision. Business pressure. I would say the experts are aware of the flaw and went with it because of pressure. I would ask that the experts design the plane AS if they weren&#x27;t under that same kind of pressure.<p>&gt;Ever heard of speed tape?<p>Duct tape was a metaphor for a patch work fix that is unsound. Think: speed tape used to tape an entire tail onto a plane.<p>&gt;Most people will either get on the plane when it&#x27;s fixed, or they will never get on the plane. They&#x27;re not going to care about the exact details.<p>Hard to say. I think for myself I can (possibly) be convinced to get back onto that plane if I knew more details and the details sounded pretty good to me.<p>&gt;I&#x27;m wise enough to not play armchair plane engineer when my life is on the line. If I don&#x27;t trust the process, then I&#x27;ll wait for a certain number of flight hours instead. I&#x27;m not going to depend on my own ability to analyze plane design.<p>Agreed. Data trumps my own BS judgement. Still even with my garbage aerospace engineering knowledge I&#x27;m sure I can tell the difference in safety between an entire air frame redesign versus just software patches and if the latter was all they did, likely I&#x27;m never getting on that plane unless the data says otherwise.')
