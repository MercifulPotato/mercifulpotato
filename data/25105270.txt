Item(by='crooked-v', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605477182, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25099967, text='Well, there&#x27;s two different types of smart switch:<p>- The first type isn&#x27;t actually connected to wall power, and is basically just a small remote that tells your lighting to turn on&#x2F;off.<p>- The second type is connected to the wall power, and works perfectly fine as a normal wall switch and controls the lights in the same way. Along with being a normal wall switch, it&#x27;s a receiver and can receive commands from elsewhere (including the first type of smart switch) to trigger the normal wall switch functionality.<p>The second type is an easy retrofit for existing homes with lots of lights, but doesn&#x27;t play nice with smart bulbs that need to be always on for advanced functionality (like having automatic step-up&#x2F;step-down lighting levels at sunrise&#x2F;sunset).<p>At the moment I feel like the best use of the first type are switches that fit neatly over normal hardwired wall switches (like the Lutron Aurora), or adding a spacer (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shapeways.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;35B9F36RD&#x2F;philips-hue-dimmer-switch-spacer-plate-us-toggle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shapeways.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;35B9F36RD&#x2F;philips-hue-dimm...</a> for one example) so that your smart switch can just be popped off to access the normal hardware.')
