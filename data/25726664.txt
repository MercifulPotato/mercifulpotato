It is perfectly legal to not have an ID or social security number.  Not having those things proves nothing.  And nobody is going to track down everyone in the country with the same name and DOB that you selected and ask them if they are the Fred Wilson (example) that voted in California.  People move all the time, so it wouldn’t be unusual if they went by the house and that person doesn’t live there.<p>The way that system is setup to accept voters without ID verification, there is not a way to legally disprove that the person with whatever name and DOB chosen does not exist (assuming more than 1 other person in the country shares those characteristics). Hence it would be impossible to legally prove that this invented person isn’t real.')
