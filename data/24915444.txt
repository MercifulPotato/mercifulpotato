He does not seem to understand me or what I was saying at all.<p>Also, &quot;my ilk&quot; are the very people he praises, including Paul Graham and YC founders pre-2012. I&#x27;m tempted to write a rebuttal, because while I agree that there was a marked change in the startup community around that time, I think it happened for reasons very different from the ones Rhinehart outlines in his piece.<p>(For reference: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dcurt.is&#x2F;the-best" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dcurt.is&#x2F;the-best</a> )')
