After about 1.5 years, I can&#x27;t get enough of the narrative-driven games.<p>I&#x27;m thinking I need to try out some more roguelikes for trial and error.

But at first I thought I wouldn&#x27;t love platformers at all, then I played the first Ori and finished it, now have 9 hours in Hollow knight and just started Celeste.<p>It&#x27;s been a fun journey, gonna look into the reccs posted here and see if roguelike is my thing<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;IuLB3k5.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;IuLB3k5.png</a> this is my ranked list of games on a site i&#x27;ve been working on')
