Remember that the US has cultural representation from many European countries and also quite a few non-European countries.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that Italy or Greece or Germany are actually homogeneous culturally but with smaller populations and significantly less immigration than the US I suspect that the variances are smaller and perhaps more surmountable.<p>Germany&#x27;s population (83 million) is only about 1&#x2F;4 of the US and as you go down the list the countries only get smaller.')
