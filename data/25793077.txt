I can&#x27;t even imagine how bad it must be with multiple big groups. Sending takes ages, often being out of sync with the phone app, and I get notifications for messages I replied to half an hour ago on my Desktop when unlocking my phone.<p>Not sure if I&#x27;d wanna stay on Signal at the moment if it stays like this, maybe Matrix is really the better choice - at least Element on the web is by far superior to signal.')
