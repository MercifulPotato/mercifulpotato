The fact that you have to pay for treatment in parts of the US is unbelievable to me.<p>&gt; Having access to naloxone and injection kits for free surely saved me from getting a blood-borne infection, and the counselling from the charity really helped.<p>Naloxone and Suboxone are so tightly controlled in the US that many addicts who want to get clean go back to heroin to self medicate (and many die).  Why?  The DEA bars any kind of relaxation and the private prison companies and the prison guard and police unions fund candidates that oppose any sympathy for addicts.<p>Itâ€™s capitalism all the way down.')
