Item(by='davidy123', descendants=None, kids=[24951522], score=None, time=1604152114, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24951384, text='Vendor discretion whether something is in warranty is a pain point, I&#x27;ve seen people bitten from all vendors. If they don&#x27;t respond to pressure (for example, finding other people with the same problem for a united voice), it might be a minor problem. If you don&#x27;t want to take it apart yourself (don&#x27;t blame you) you could find a local authorized dealer who could hopefully fix it for not much money. I wish they would just offer hardware like this on a subscription.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to avoid Samsung (or any other Android) devices altogether, just don&#x27;t use anything that takes away your portability within the Android ecosystem (which, granted, has various lines in the sand when you rely on Google, outside going no-identity, which is impossible on iPhone). It was easy enough to do when I had my Note2, there are many people within user communities who care about things like this and make sure it&#x27;s possible without much effort; for example by putting pressure on vendors to enable choice for what apps are used for what purposes. In my experience, Samsung offers its own App Store, I just ignored it, I used Google&#x27;s calendar instead of Samsung&#x27;s default enhanced one, etc.<p>There are some cases, per your examples, where there&#x27;s a distinct branch in what&#x27;s supported. Samsung and Huawei are really competitors to Apple more than Google in this case. I can only say that like repairability is the best answer to some questions, interoperability is the best answer to others. Being locked in to any ecosystem, especially over time as our digital lives become linked to health and wealth, is bad for everyone.<p>My last comment, about &quot;cheap&quot; perceptions, was intended for another comment in the thread, sorry about the confusion.')
