I can accidentally kill a pedestrian, a pedestrian can&#x27;t accidentally kill me unless they throw a brick off an overpass.<p>&gt; Why should pedestrians keep out of your way and not cross your path?<p>So that they take responsibility for their own safety.<p>&gt; Why don&#x27;t we instead say you should keep out of the pedestrians way and not cross their path?<p>Because I disagree I should be liable if someone darts out into traffic and is struck by my car.<p>&gt; Maybe we should reset the expectation that cars own the streets, and make them a guest there, deferring to human beings in the first instance.<p>In dense cities... sure, I agree. In car-heavy suburban areas where everything is super spread out? I don&#x27;t think this is a necessarily a good idea.')
