Combine that with:<p>* The FBI, the DOJ, and the DNI all refuting the &quot;Russian disinfo&quot; theory<p>* Biden&#x27;s campaign explicitly refusing to call the emails inauthentic<p>* Pics of Hunter in compromising positions<p>* The laptop being the subject of a grand jury subpoena<p>...and there&#x27;s more evidence pointing towards the story&#x27;s legitimacy than away from it. In fact, that leaves the only real thing pointing away as &quot;it&#x27;s a sketchy-ass tabloid&quot;, which is adhom at the end of the day.')
