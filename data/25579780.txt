Ireland for instance has no Air Force, and has to call on the RAF to provide air defence (as it happened when Russian Tu-95s intruded). Likewise, the rest of Europe relies entirely on NATO&#x27;s firepower against Russian belligerence.<p>You can certainly shape a better society internally and have equitable social justice if you&#x27;re free from the distraction of having to defend against external aggression.')
