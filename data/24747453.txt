Have a pat on the head.<p>Again, I suggest you adjust your tone, as site rules are pretty clear.<p>&gt; Except even if all of that were true (which it isn&#x27;t)<p>[citation needed], as of course, I provided mine.<p>&gt; As for Yucca Mountain, funny that the &quot;genuinely tiny amount&quot; of nuclear waste produced in the USA as of 2011.<p>You&#x27;re going to have to provide some clarification there, like, all the nuclear waste generated in the history of nuclear power in the United States in the last hundred years? The GAO says the nation has produced 80,000 metric tons to this day. [1] This is in line with Yucca Mountain&#x27;s capacity. Consider that was generated since <i>1958</i> when Shippingport opened.<p>The government believes that 2000T of waste are generated per year at this stage, meaning Yucca Mountain would be able to house 40 years of new waste. At one site.<p>Did the magnitude 7 earthquake near yucca mountain compromise the structural integrity of the proposed storage site? Because if not, then your point is moot. Which is what the DOE said. [2] And in fact when this article was written they said the tectonics of the region wouldn&#x27;t yield an earthquake in excess of a magnitude 7. It&#x27;s almost like they considered this, and planned for it.<p>Further, modern fast-neutron reactors and breeder reactors generate an order of magnitude less high level waste than classical designs.
