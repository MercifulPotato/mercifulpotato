New development and legacy support are always at odds.<p>If customers want new software, then they must accept that it has modern requirements. Same situation for continued development and evolution of existing software.<p>In situations where support for legacy systems is more important than new development, then existing applications can just continue to use Qt 5. I don&#x27;t see how it would make sense to migrate to Qt 6 in this situation.')
