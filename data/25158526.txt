Could it be that you&#x27;re hiding your true feelings to be more in line with the expectations of the community? The modern web development establishment has managed to convince people that it has merit, when in fact it&#x27;s a case study in accidental complexity.<p>Every now and then some poor soul realizes what a mess they&#x27;re in and writes a blog about the miserable state of web development, but the wider community cannot face the truth, because it would mean that the last 20 years of &quot;progress&quot; have been wasted.<p>And indeed, after two decades of support from every player in the industry, shoving countless APIs in the pseudo web standards controlled by Google, modern web applications work almost as well as a Flash app - except with thousands of tiny packages and tools cobbled together into one big ball of nonsense.')
