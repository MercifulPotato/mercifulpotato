Obviously there was a ton of reporting on the spread of disinformation, hate speech and even foreign sock puppeting on social media because it was all 100% true.<p>If you want to blame &quot;journalists&quot; or &quot;the media&quot; then blame Greenwald too because he&#x27;s one of them. Otherwise you have to acknowledge there was wide range of public and professional opinion. And that social media orgs have all done what they felt they had to do to protect their businesses bottom lines.<p>Greenwald left The Intercept because his editors had the audacity to ask for edits. That&#x27;s like living in a Gestapo prison as far as he&#x27;s concerned. So his absolutely paranoid belief that journalistic authoritarianism is directly to blame for private companies taking action to hide incitement to armed revolution is just far-fetched to me.')
