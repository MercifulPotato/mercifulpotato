I get incessantly, monotonously followed by bad versions of what I’m interested in, which I cannot shake off. It’s a galling imposition not only to be shown that I am being tracked , but that the narrow cluster of products I am bombarded with are bad, ugly versions of the things I particularly like. I dislike them more intensely than products I have no interest in.
