Some examples I appreciate: GNU, POSIX, Linux, Perl, SQLite, PHP, Apache, Tcl.<p>For all of these examples there are many accessible resources with oodles of knowledge in many different convenient forms.<p>Newer stuff, where the main resources are Reddit and StackOverflow, and the writing is limited to just a couple of years, is nowhere near as rich or useful.<p>Many newer sites are also heavy and JavaScript-laden, both of which slows down access and skimming speed, if I can access them at all.')
