You can continue going to the gas station and paying $10-20&#x2F;gallon if you wish. Have fun.<p>Battery technology seems to anecdotally increase capacity at 10% year on year, at best.  The typical electric car has a battery that gets 150-200 miles at the moment.  I don&#x27;t expect to see a 1500-2000 mile range battery in 10 years.  Or even 20 years.<p>You&#x27;ll also &quot;pay&quot; the same tax&#x2F;duty per mile as you currently do, when the law changes to include GPS chips in every car to track your mileage, since the government can no longer tax petrol at the pump.  The next 10 years might be the golden &#x27;cheap&#x27; era for electric cars before governments figure out how to make up the fossil fuel tax shortfall.')
