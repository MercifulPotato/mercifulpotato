It used to put me off a lot when I started meditating.<p>Now I take it as simply something that&#x27;s there. They are statements that someone makes. If they&#x27;re talking about states that someone could reach and they also give instructions, I might consider trying them to see what happens.<p>In any case as a programmer and scientifically minded meditator, I encourage you to pursue your interest in meditation. Try different techniques until you find something that works. Take it easy, take it slow, cultivate play and joy in your practice. If you manage to do that, you&#x27;ll reap the fruit of your practice.<p>I wish you good luck!')
