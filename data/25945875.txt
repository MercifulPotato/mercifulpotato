They didn&#x27;t ask for a 400k mortgage. They asked for a home they could afford. When the bank, that they have trusted their entire life, says, &#x27;you can afford this much per month&#x27;, they had no reason to question that.<p>They&#x27;re unsophisticated people, who trusted the system not to fuck them. And that&#x27;s precisely what it tried to do.<p>While I get that people need to take control of their own money, when the people <i>responsible for looking after your money, the actual, literal bank</i> tells you you&#x27;re good, why wouldn&#x27;t you believe them?')
