For example, Intel&#x27;s RNG will statistically observe bit patterns from their RNG.  Eg, it fills up a FIFO and checks for the counts of certain bit patterns.  If they aren&#x27;t sufficiently random, it will throw away the data.  Even if they dont have sufficient RNG data, unless you can predict how a PRNG is seeded it should be safe for quite some time without new true entropy.')
