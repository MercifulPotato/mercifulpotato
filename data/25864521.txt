They could get more efficiency with multiple gears, but it’s be a smaller benefit than in an ICE vehicle.<p>One of the big early problems was that the amount of instant torque that an electric vehicle puts out just shreds a gearbox. You could limit the initial torque in software, but that’d kill the joy of the EV. I’m sure someone has managed to work this by now.<p>On the other hand, different axles don’t have to use the same gearing ratio. That’s how dual motor Teslas work - the front wheels are geared for higher speeds, and more power is shifted towards those as you go faster. No gear-shifting required.')
