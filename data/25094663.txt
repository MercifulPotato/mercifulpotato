If the company has core expertise and advantages that can deliver a decisive win in a known-lucrative market, then it&#x27;s a no brainer. But if that&#x27;s not the case, why run around chasing shadows everywhere, instead of focusing on harvesting the markets where you&#x27;re already winning.<p>The risk is that a competitor comes out of these adjacent markets and edges you out. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s looking likely to happen with ARM, which is slowly moving from embedded &#x2F; cellphone to laptops and servers.')
