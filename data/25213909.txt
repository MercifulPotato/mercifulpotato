It&#x27;s yet another meme that has spread that has the convenient side effect (or main effect) of shutting people off from considering the effects of their food choices. There are an abundance of plant-based protein supplements for hitting your nutrition targets.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re talking about the broader community of people who self-identify as athletes but I&#x27;ll restrict the discussion to professional athletes for the sake of clarity.<p>Here&#x27;s a few household-name professional vegan athletes:<p>* Venus Williams<p>* Lewis Hamilton<p>* Colin Kaepernick<p>* Kyrie Irving<p>* Tia Blanco<p>* Meagan Duhamel<p>Veganism isn&#x27;t very popular in general so I&#x27;m not sure if this &quot;if professional athletes don&#x27;t do it, then it must be bad&quot; argument holds. If we could compile a list of all professional athletes, find the vegan population, and then compare that to the general population, I would wager that veganism might have a higher percentage in the athlete population than the general population. Pure speculation, though, and obviously I&#x27;m biased. But I follow lots of vegan channel and they&#x27;re very proud and vocal about vegan athletes and it&#x27;s the kind of news that I think you won&#x27;t be exposed to unless you&#x27;re inside the vegan community.')
