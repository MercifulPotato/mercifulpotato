Granted, I avoid almost everything that talks about US computer programmers vs the rest of the world computer programmers, discussions which tend to have not that nice xenophobic nuance to them, but the rest of the discussions are pretty civil.<p>Also (and of course), I also avoid almost everything related to Apple-Google-Tesla, the conflict of interests in here are too big (lots of Apple&#x2F;Google employees, lots of owners of Tesla shares), so I realise that nothing productive can come out of those conversations. Surprisingly, I find that Microsoft employees are a lot more open to criticism, and I say that as a person who used to dislike MS massively (I still hold them partly responsible for the failure of OLPC)')
