A tech stack that might give you some easy early gains might fail you at 3 a.m. when the site&#x27;s down and you have no idea how to fix it.

Recruitment in tech X is much harder because there&#x27;s nobody around with decent experience in it.<p>These are all problems that you really don&#x27;t want when your focus needs to be on the business.
