High risk for Down&#x27;s. My mother didn&#x27;t get the test, which could&#x27;ve introduced more problems. She believed I was already alive, because I was, and I was therefore sacred to her, and the outcome of the test would be irrelevant to her choice. Notice in all of this, I didn&#x27;t have a choice.<p>I&#x27;m glad she didn&#x27;t abort me. If I don&#x27;t want to be alive now, now it&#x27;s my decision.<p>I guess you can keep arguing that killing unborn children diagnosed with Down&#x27;s isn&#x27;t eugenics but my perspective is pretty heavily informed by the fact that I&#x27;m alive thanks to my mother being bothered by the idea that she might kill me in utero if I had a developmental disorder.<p>I&#x27;d like to see you explain the position that a baby diagnosed with Down&#x27;s should be aborted to someone with Down&#x27;s, frankly.')
