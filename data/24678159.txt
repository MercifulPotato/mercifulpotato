That never really appealed to me. It makes it harder to accept occasional contributions, while I also find it somewhat dubious to ask people to transfer copyright to a for profit entity without paying them for the work they did.<p>One thing I wanted to try, but never really got to, was to ask contributors to license additions to a GPL project under the MIT license. These can be shipped under the proprietary license. As long as the original authors continue to do a large part of the work, most code remains GPL preventing proprietary forks and safeguarding your proprietary revenue model.<p>[edit: clarity]')
