Somebody digs up which stack it&#x27;s running, suggests a config change and the discussion evolves around that. Some Rust thing is weird? People discuss fixes, patterns, some code example. Fabrice Bellard made a new magic thing? People celebrate with links, their experiences and cool own Show HN things.<p>But here? &quot;I bought $consumer_device, it sucks&quot; .. &quot;Yeah I can&#x27;t believe latency is still not fixed.&quot; .. &quot;Oh man when my wife comes home $weird_device connects to her car&quot;. That&#x27;s how my aunts discuss technology. Guys, this is <i>Hacker</i> News, why is the deepest we are actually talking hacking here just the mention of different bluetooth profiles?<p>Is this a sign of how closed and proprietary all bluetooth stacks are so that even technically skilled people can only conclude that it sucks and move on? Otherwise I&#x27;d have expected people to already have suggestions for fixes. This is a very sad state of affairs..')
