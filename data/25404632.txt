A lot of housing demand was pushed back during the first half of 2020. I don&#x27;t think the pushed back demand was enough to last three years. Also there are many homeowners who are unable to service their mortgages now. Once assistance for these people expires, there will be a wave of foreclosures.<p>I think the latter half housing demand in 2020 was due to pent-up demand as well as extraordinary measures shoring up mortgage holders, thus preventing more supply coming onto the market. I don&#x27;t see either trend continuing into 2023.')
