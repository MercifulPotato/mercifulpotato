Blackmagic introduced a full raw workflow recently which was a game changer. Red holds a patent on raw video which they’ve been real dicks about aggressively enforcing. It has stifled innovation. BM got around that by partially debayering their capture and storing it in a format that gives you the flexibility of raw but is more performant and avoids Red’s patent bullshit. It’s amazing to grade BRaw footage. You just keep pushing it and, oh look there’s detail in those shadows and those highlights aren’t actually blown out. No banding, no grain, massive color depth at 12bit and the flexibility to change ISO in post.')
