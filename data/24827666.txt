It is, by definition, a subset of the string type. All HTML is a string, but not all strings are HTML.<p>The following is valid C, but I would absolutely argue that it isn&#x27;t a program:<p><pre><code>    char str[] = &quot;Geeks&quot;;\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s a declaration, just like HTML is. It is a string that is being declared and stored.<p>Still, that C example is more of a program than any HTML is because it contains an instruction. It manipulates memory.<p>HTML is literally just a file format. It is not any more of a program than a PNG file is.')
