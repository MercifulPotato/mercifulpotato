And it&#x27;s well documented. It sure is more expensive, but it&#x27;s easier to achieve the same result. And faster. And keep in mind, the dev isn&#x27;t footing the AWS bill. And isn&#x27;t getting paid a penny extra for trimming down said AWS bill.<p>Of course, if you add stocks to the compensation structure or a bonus based on cloud spending, that changes the incentives.')
