A dual-socket Rome system with 128 cores (256 threads), 8TB of RAM, and 128 PCIe 4.0 lanes <i>is</i> an enormous machine. A full 8 socket Platinum system is going to cost an order of magnitude (or two) more, and the performance improvement is going to be <i>less than</i> 2x.<p>An 8-socket system is going to consume an enormous amount of power, cost an unbelievable amount of money, and the complex NUMA domain combined with Intel&#x27;s interconnect isn&#x27;t going to &quot;just work&quot; for almost any software, so you&#x27;re likely going to put a lot of effort into making that system barely work.<p>Intel Platinum is priced crazy because Intel is building monolithic processors (which means low yields) and Intel likes to have a substantial profit margin. Together, those mean high prices.<p>At a certain point, you&#x27;re better off investing in making your application work on an accelerator of some kind, in the form of a GPU or an FPGA or task-specific ASIC, rather than giving Intel <i>all your money</i> in the hopes of eeking out a marginal performance improvement. Alternatively, finding software that can scale to more than one machine.<p>Maybe IBM has truly large systems that are worth considering. Intel doesn&#x27;t right now, unless you&#x27;re using some software that <i>demands</i> Intel for contractual reasons no one can argue with.')
