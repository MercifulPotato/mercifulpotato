In that world it doesn&#x27;t matter if AWS or Google or Microsoft or anyone else want to offer hosted versions of it because ES still gets their cut.<p>But co-opting open source to grow your user-base and then switching your license because you don&#x27;t like the reality of what open source actually entails leaves a bad taste in everyone&#x27;s mouth.')
