For reference, the incompatibility I faced was for the CloudFlare DNS plugin, which added support for API Tokens that had granular permissions somewhere between version 0.23 distributed in stable and 1.11 distributed via snap. Certbot docs and CloudFlare docs both encourage you to use API tokens instead of account-wide API secrets and the previous install instructions for wildcard DNS support suggested installing the CloudFlare DNS plugin by default on the Certbot site. As CloudFlare is used by a lot of folks for DNS, and was a suggested default install, I’m probably not the only one that encountered problems setting it up, without a backport available for a newer package of Certbot.')
