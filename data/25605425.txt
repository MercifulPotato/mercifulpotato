Not to mention the restaurants that don&#x27;t want any part of the delivery platforms altogether because they don&#x27;t like what they&#x27;re seeing.<p>In an opt-out model, the restaurant has to take time to deal with (and possibly remove themselves) from a platform that didn&#x27;t ask for their business, potentially dealing with upset customers along the way. Wasn&#x27;t the whole point of this idea to reduce time and energy spent on these kinds of activities to focus on the food and the community? If you had no idea that you were on one of these platforms and an angry customer reaches out to you, how does that benefit the restaurant?<p>It&#x27;s really strange to see a collectivist for-the-greater-good argument being applied in a business sense here because it&#x27;s based on two incorrect underlying assumptions: that every business owner wants the same thing (automated marketing and logistics services handled by one provider), and that platforms will always act in the best interests of their users. As a hypothetical business owner, shouldn&#x27;t I have the right to prevent delivery platforms from using my restaurant without my permission? Say I get a bad experience with a delivery platform once, and I remove myself. Now I have a keep a lookout for any other platform that wants to use my name, all because those platforms made the argument that they know what&#x27;s best for the restaurants and then didn&#x27;t measure up. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.')
