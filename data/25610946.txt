However, at the time, I didn&#x27;t realize that he was writing a sequence of 10-year predictions, so I didn&#x27;t look at the corresponding predictions for 2009 or 2029.<p>When you instead grade his foresight on the basis of how he predicts the development of technology over time, it&#x27;s clear that a lot of what would seem to be partial hits if assessed alone should actually be graded as hard fails. Discussion about the ubiquity of computers and their use in non-traditional roles for computers is a firm example here.<p>&gt; “Many of the life processes encoded in the human genome, which was deciphered more than ten years earlier, are now largely understood, along with the information-processing mechanisms underlying aging and degenerative conditions such as cancer and heart disease.”<p>This is an example of where the author is going <i>way</i> too easy on Ray (he called it &quot;partly right&quot;). One of the biggest futurist misses of the 21st century is the role of genomics. While genomic sequencing has become incredibly routine, that <i>hasn&#x27;t</i> actually resulted in the revolution in medicine that it was thought to have by, well, everybody. A key case in point is COVID-19 and some of the mutations: we understand very well details about some of its evolution, and we can pinpoint those mutations to individual genetic letters, but we still struggle to actually develop any predictive effects on its behavior (e.g., is this new strain more infective? more deadly? more resistant against vaccines?--we can&#x27;t answer those questions without seeing what happens in real infections).<p>Contrast with organic chemistry. Decades ago, figuring out how to synthesize something ugly like vitamin B12 was insanely difficult, even Nobel Prize-worthy. But nowadays, it&#x27;s the sort of task you might give to a junior chemical engineer in the first week to onboard them (although maybe not for something as difficult as vitamin B12). The thought was that genomics would lead biology to a similar sort of plane of existence--that we could treat genes as a ready menu for achieving various biological goals, and treating disease (at least those with genetic components) would be handled with a similarly combination of picking and choosing from this well-understood menu. That&#x27;s what Ray was predicting here (more specifically, that the genetic influence on aging, cancer, and heart disease has succumbed to this process), and we really haven&#x27;t made any progress on that front.')
