I find a lot to agree with in Rayiner&#x27;s position and a lot to think about in the concerns of people who worry that it would be impossible to administer.<p>All I have to contribute is the fact that whatever the impact of slavery was, it wasn&#x27;t confined to our distant past. This country practiced economic apartheid well into my own lifetime, and the aftereffects are impossible to miss.<p>I live near Division and Chicago, just outside of Chicago in Oak Park. If I cross my alley and the street behind it, Austin Blvd, I&#x27;m in the Chicago neighborhood of Austin, where, if I&#x27;m a teenaged Black kid, my likelihood of being murdered shoots up dramatically. And Austin is a middle-class neighborhood (a  typical Black household making $75k&#x2F;yr lives in a higher-poverty neighborhood than a white family making $40k&#x2F;yr). What changes when you cross that street is that you cross a famous redlining boundary.<p>A few years back you could easily get a map of Chicago redlining without consulting an encyclopedia or doing any research; you just needed to look at Uber&#x27;s Chicago service map. The neighborhoods they wouldn&#x27;t commit to serving were uncannily the redlined neighborhoods of the 1960s.<p>It wasn&#x27;t because Uber was trying to perpetuate the practice, but because redlining ravaged west- and south-side Chicago, and we are nowhere close to digging our way out of it.<p>Lots of different groups of people have been economically disadvantaged in the United States, but I don&#x27;t think anything like this, at this scale, with this impact. It fucked my city --- the best city in the country --- right up. It fucked up Detroit. It fucked up STL. It&#x27;s a big deal and we should all be freshly furious about it.')
