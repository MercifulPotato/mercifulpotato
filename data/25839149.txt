Item(by='Brendinooo', descendants=None, kids=[25839575, 25839233], score=None, time=1611091887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837632, text='&gt;“The mailbox has not been disrupted since 1858 (when the U.S. Postal Service was launched),” said O’Toole. “Between smart cars, smart phones and smart houses, it’s time for the mailbox to catch up.”<p>That is such an irksome sentence. And inaccurate, too? The Post Office goes back to the late 1700s, home delivery wasn&#x27;t a thing until 1863, and the mailbox wasn&#x27;t really a thing until around 1915.')
