I feel like developers (and power-users generally) have internalized this notion that we&#x27;re a rounding error compared to the general public (perhaps a holdover from the old days, when regular folks didn&#x27;t use the internet or computers at all). But in 2020, software development is a massive portion of the economy, and Macs seem to be disproportionately popular with startups and developers.<p>A little lazy googling puts the graphic design industry at $12.7 billion, and the software development industry at $388.98 billion.')
