If so, are you finding it difficult? Has it been taking you months or years to learn it and still feel like you don&#x27;t know it well enough? How long have you spent trying to learn?<p>Or are you someone who knows Elixir very well and has worked at the company for a long time doing Elixir work and you&#x27;re observing the struggle to find new junior hires that are willing to learn it and finding it hard to teach it to them? It be nice if you could tell us the number of years of experience you have with Beam and Elixir as well.<p>Thanks')
