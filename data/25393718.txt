They are observing that the same factors that make audiences vulnerable to misinformation affect the censors and the process by which censors determine which information is harmful.<p>If we had a test for truth or sincerity we could use it to determine which information was false or put forth in bad faith. We don&#x27;t, so any person who acts as an information gatekeeper could be one of those people who is lying or deceived and they would then be able to corrupt the discourse by censoring the information that exposes their lies or misunderstandings.')
