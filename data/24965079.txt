Germany had to be re-integrated into the West, the problem was that the vocabulary relating to politics and democracy had been <i>erased</i> in the East. Several generations of people grew up without even thinking about various aspects of politics. There literally was no <i>language</i> for the W. Germans to use to re-introduce E. Germans to political dialogue.<p>You can erase democracy by suppressing language, and therefore by suppressing thought. It doesn&#x27;t exist if nobody is thinking about it.<p>The idea is to enforce the rules through the daily rituals, language, constructs that people use - there&#x27;s no need for facts or ideology then.<p>The beginning of this I think happens more or less out in the open with certain subjects now in 2020, when we see language and culture shifting - but it shifts slow enough that it&#x27;s not noticed.<p>Go ahead and look at episodes of &#x27;30 Rock&#x27; - a brilliant, first rate, amazing production from literally just 10 years ago --&gt; it&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t be made today, or rather, it would have to be &#x27;heavily censored&#x27; today because so many of those jokes are just a little to un PC (jokes about women&#x27;s pay, harassment in the workplace). But today, it wouldn&#x27;t be &#x27;network censorship&#x27; - it would be a kind of &#x27;thought and behaviour censorship&#x27; right from the writers room and producers edict. When I look at &#x27;30 Rock&#x27; from a  2020 communications perspective I&#x27;m actually very, very concerned - the level of suppression that has slowly been sinking in is alarming.')
