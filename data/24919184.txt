I think you currently get a very nice luxury benefit, and stoping that isn&#x27;t &quot;penalizing&quot; you.<p>I think it is a little silly that companies pay someone more just because they like living in a city. I admit that I have a strong preference for rural areas, but I don&#x27;t expect an employer to pay me more (or less) because of that. I am constantly surprised that more companies don&#x27;t setup in lower COL areas, but I guess that much of the in-person talent desires that enough to make it work.<p>Most people agree that it is good to treat people equally regardless of their background, and this policy seems to promote that.')
