I&#x27;m quite happy with the improvement from 1440p =&gt; &quot;4K with scaling&quot; transition, and won&#x27;t consider buying 1440p in future.<p>Scaled 4K may be not the best for high precision design work, but for development tasks &#x2F; text reading that&#x27;s an improvement, in my experience.')
