An ESP8266, one of the cheapest modern embedded systems can do TLS without problems. Heck, I&#x27;ve seen one or two ATTiny85&#x27;s doing TLS (with some stability problems... But they&#x27;re not called tiny for nothing).<p>If the AmigaOS project can do TLS (builtin since a decade ago) with less than half of the resources that the authour says results in an unreasonable wait time (their System6), maybe it isn&#x27;t actually the hardware that is the problem.')
