It seems to me this would have serious consequences for physics and the universe in general if the following relationship didin&#x27;t hold under all conditions:<p>c = 1&#x2F;(μ0 ε0)^0.5<p>If the speed of light were instantaneous in one direction, then the value of (μ0 ε0)^0.5 would have to be zero when light was travelling in that direction. Surely that has to be a serious problem?\n__<p>†  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24876598" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24876598</a>')
