Life actually does a pretty good job of turning CO2 into dirt which gets buried<p>Coal: about 350m years ago we didn&#x27;t have trees because lignin had not evolved. Then we got lignin, and trees, and when trees died and fell they just stayed there because we didn&#x27;t have fungus that could decompose them. Then (about 50m years later) fungus evolved that could decompose trees.  All coal exists in that 300m to 350m old seam.<p>Life takes CO2, turns it into carbon, which is then released when those plants die and decompose.<p>Forests are a buffer, not a sink.')
