What would make a car from Apple special relative to a car from VW or Tesla? Is the Apple brand really that compelling? A car is not a watch or a phone. If you really like cars, you could think of a car as a kind of a personal sculpture or trophy, and Apple is good at making nice looking, prized objects. I suppose a car is a container for an &quot;information experience&quot; as well as a logistical one. Apple&#x27;s good at that. So, is the Apple Car basically going to be a big pair of Beats headphones that will take you the grocery store? I don&#x27;t get it.')
