Last year during college applications I wondered if there was a way to modify content or know when a university looks at my website. Sounded crazy but it would mean you could do something as blatant as &quot;I love Harvard University&quot; except it changes to Stanford when someone from there visits. While that is probably not a good idea, it still felt intellectually stimulating to have the ability.<p>I had thought I&#x27;d need to do complex location related tricks so didn&#x27;t really try, but realized a much simpler way to do it a few days ago and threw together a quick API¹ on a cloudflare worker and a proof of concept to go with it that has worked perfectly so far. The worker code is directly on there and not on github, but it just uses isp and org filtering to determine university or not.<p>Got hit by a DoS attack yesterday, ironic considering Cloudflare, that exhausted the 100,000 req&#x2F;day limit but it&#x27;s back up now.²<p>I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d really use it for, but I&#x27;m glad it exists.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uni.aadibajpai.workers.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uni.aadibajpai.workers.dev</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;UzCwfdp.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;UzCwfdp.jpg</a>')
