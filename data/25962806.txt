It is the only way to install software on an iPhone without jailbraking it, and if you do jailbreak it, then there might be other apps that refuse to work.<p>In Denmark we have a national login system (NemID), and if you got a Jailbroken iPhone, then you will not be able to use the (required) two-factor code-generation app, and then you will not be able to buy stuff online via credit card.

Basically it just showed a popup telling me I had to use the app. That is NOT okay.<p>If Apple opened up their platform more, then more power would be in the users hands, and Apple would not be able to abuse their power to shut out apps or require huge developer-fees and percentages of app-developers sales.
