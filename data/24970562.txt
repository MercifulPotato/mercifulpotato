An r4.16xlarge spot instance in Paris for one year would cost $8,900, about half the price of OVH and that is assuming that the customer needs the server 24x7. Having a server 24x7 obviously wouldn&#x27;t work on spot, but the point is that AWS is built more for customers who are frequently creating, destroying, and scaling their clusters based on need.')
