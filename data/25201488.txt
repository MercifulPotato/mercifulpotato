Item(by='emn13', descendants=None, kids=[25201871], score=None, time=1606243292, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25186060, text='The original article did not propose any specifically formualated law, and additionally it&#x27;s clear from the article that the author is concerned with the <i>effects</i> of the law, not the exact formulation.  Criticizing the formulation isn&#x27;t constructive, since he obviously doesn&#x27;t care. And as I tried (and clearly failed) to convince you of, the issues you suggest exist if you were to read a blog-post as a literal law (which you shouldn&#x27;t) are obviously not intrinsic to his proposal.<p>In essence your criticism boils down to: copy-pasting this blog post as law and thus disregarding its intent would result in a law that violates the first amendment.  But it&#x27;s (A) not clear the form of very limited compelled speech you point to would be struck down (again there clearly have been exceptions that have not been struck down - a quick google finds stuff like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Turner_Broadcasting_System,_Inc._v._FCC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Turner_Broadcasting_System,_In...</a>, but many other cases too - and you haven&#x27;t explained why you believe this is any different), and more crucially (B) it&#x27;s mostly irrelevant to the point of the article, which is about how the author views parts of the DMCA as ways to censor speech, and how he believes that&#x27;s problematic. Applying <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Principle_of_charity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Principle_of_charity</a> - we should be trying to read the post in its &quot;best, strongest possible interpretation&quot; - i.e. not split hairs on a technicality that doesn&#x27;t really affect the core argument.')
