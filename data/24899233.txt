We are entering a new period of MSM censorship but this time we&#x27;re seeing the social media platforms out in front taking active measures to censor political speech, probably due to a mix of short-sighted &quot;best intentions&quot; (flyover country is no more susceptible to indoctrination than the sophisticates on the coasts) and partly to avoid anti-trust suits from the likely victors in the upcoming election. Just like they censor on behalf of authoritarian regimes abroad to protect access to markets, they will do the same here. Good reason to break up the FAANGs for the public good.')
