It&#x27;s always cluttered. I&#x27;d expect most of the local helicopter services and pilots that ferry the oil industry would be also be ferrying for SpaceX.<p>&gt;Tesla&#x27;s use case<p>The <i>SpaceX</i> use case is based on high frequency launches. You don&#x27;t get high frequency by sticking to Space Shuttle blue-sky launch requirements. (And the safety-obsessed oil industry isn&#x27;t flying in weather it shouldn&#x27;t be.)<p>But it&#x27;s still coastal weather, and even blue-sky launches are going to require pre-dawn (or after dark), foggy and&#x2F;or windy flights out to the rig (and back to shore).<p>If it&#x27;s point-to-point rocket travel, daylight at the launch site means it&#x27;s likely to be dark at landing, and vice-versa. Otherwise flight windows are going to be very restricted.<p>If anything, time windows are likely to be more constrained for launches than for the oil industry (who might have a day-long+ window for personnel changes), which means more flying when you have to, not waiting for when conditions are ideal.')
