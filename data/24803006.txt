What makes it so dangerous is using big data and algorithmically driven “improvements” in time on site and engagement is exploiting subconscious weaknesses in our brains to do this.<p>You can design an optical illusion to trick our visual perceptions to the point that even with we know for a fact what is happening, we can’t “fix” our perception in our brain. Imagine if you built an entire interactive space of optical illusions that were iterated and improved millions of times over so that a person was physically incapable of determining accurate visual data about the world around them.<p>This is what is happening in our digital spaces. It is becoming physically harder and harder to disengage from those digital spaces, not because of individual moral failings, but because our reward centers are being continually bombarded by illusions that warp our perception.')
