I.e. much less efficient than an equivalent ASIC, but good for prototyping and something to use in production if you can&#x27;t afford to manufacture your own chip (which is most low-volume use cases). Under this metaphor, memristor-based ASICs will obviously be more efficient than FPGAs emulating them, but that&#x27;s predicated on there being a high-volume use case justifying the creation of a memristor chip in the first place.')
