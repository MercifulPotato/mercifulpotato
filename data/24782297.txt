Though I&#x27;ve added m3u links to radio stations and use that for some discovery, alongside bandcamp, reddit, youtube. Personally I find independent radio is underrated, they often save their streams in archives online. Wefunkradio is a good example.<p>EDIT: incidentally there was a recent Spotify integration component: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foobar2000.org&#x2F;components&#x2F;view&#x2F;foo_spotify" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foobar2000.org&#x2F;components&#x2F;view&#x2F;foo_spotify</a> , not sure if that still works. It also looks like there was an older one for creating playlists using last.fm.')
