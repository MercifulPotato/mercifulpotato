I don&#x27;t know how much they&#x27;ve improved since but a few years back I was in a short merge for my daily commute and there was a Waymo car in the lane I was trying to merge into which just drove parallel to me without speeding up or slowing down as most human drivers do to make way. This was the most difficult merge I had experienced on that spot in years of driving that same commute.')
