I&#x27;ll also say, respectfully, it isn&#x27;t terribly relevant to my observation of someone who made their point by collectivizing an entire nation of people, and did so in a pretty ham-fisted way, while availing themselves of the thing they seek to restrict.<p>Maybe I just find the complete absence of self-awareness in that comment to be oddly charming.')
