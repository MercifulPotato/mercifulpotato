The floating from task to task is <i>almost</i> always avoidant behavior. The experience is usually accompanied by a &quot;slippery&quot; thought -- something you don&#x27;t want to think about, something that makes you feel sick or causes you stress, and so your thoughts are trying to latch onto something to distract them.<p>2. One solution is to eliminate distractions, rest calmly in yourself, and practice mindful attention. Meditate. Engage rationally with the slippery thought. Or just observe it, practice letting it happen without interrupting it. Teach yourself: that thought is not to be feared.<p>3. The long-term solution is to resolve the concerns that your slippery thoughts are related to. For example, In the case of the person you replied to, they mentioned this phrase: &quot;thoughts that center around a perceived lack of meaning in my life.&quot; In that case, there might be actual life changes that you can make to introduce a greater sense of meaning. On the other hand, if the underlying thought is &quot;I have a presentation tomorrow,&quot; that&#x27;s a case where you may want to look at reducing your performance anxiety in general. And so forth.<p>Of course every case is different, but when this happens to you next I&#x27;d strongly recommend looking inward to see if there are any of those slippery, &quot;hot potato&quot; thoughts that you&#x27;re subconsciously trying to avoid. If so -- I suggest addressing that. If not -- well, maybe you&#x27;ve got a dopamine addiction :)')
