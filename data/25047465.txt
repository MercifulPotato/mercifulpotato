You have to cover:<p>* Health Insurance<p>* No paid time off: Want 4 weeks off a year? That&#x27;s a 7.6% reduction in pay.<p>* You have to pay both the employee &amp; employer side of payroll taxes<p>* You&#x27;re not eligible for unemployment, so you need to save more money to cover that possibility<p>* No retirement fund so you don&#x27;t get any matching funds and have to really be on top of what your long term needs are and take that off the top of your income.<p>As an example, I have a normal salary full-time job, but I also have a hobby business on the side. The money I make from that given the tax bracket I&#x27;m in, federal, state, payroll taxes, means my &quot;take home&quot; pay from is taxed around 43%. And that&#x27;s without needing to take anything extra out of it for paid time off, health insurance, or retirement, all of which are well covered by my salaried position.')
