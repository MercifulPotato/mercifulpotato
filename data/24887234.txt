Especially in comparison to others such as Blender which managed to build something better than the proprietary alternatives by gathering fund through sponsors &amp; donations without ever sacrificing their values such as the GPL openness and while keeping all the focus on Blender.<p>They even obtained a place at Khronos and have a voice on the future of compute &amp; graphic standards.<p>I donate to Blender because I know that not a single cent is wasted.<p>Mozilla is the opposite, everything is wasted &amp; there is no focus.<p>I would gladly donate to a new foundation for a browser that takes the same model as Blender, Godot, etc. : start small, stay focused &amp; don&#x27;t sacrifice your core values')
