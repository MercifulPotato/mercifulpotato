Stories about Japan by Western news outlets often limit themselves to a few common &quot;takes&quot; on Japan:<p>&gt; Japan&#x27;s economy is stagnant (e.g. [1])! --  Western media tends to apply Western economic metrics to everything--and as we have all seen recently, the stock market is NOT the economy!  It&#x27;s not necessarily a problem for an economy to stop &quot;growing&quot; once it has reached a comfortable size.  These same articles often conveniently ignore that lower- and middle-class workers in places like the United States are suffering from similar problems.<p>&gt; Japan is &quot;weird&quot;!  Maid cafes!  Kawaii culture! -- Conveniently forgetting that in a metropolis of 14 million people like Tokyo, it&#x27;s not difficult to find 10,000 people interested in absolutely any niche topic you can think of.  New York is just as &quot;weird&quot; [2].<p>&gt; Japanese people are sad! -- Articles often misrepresent Japan&#x27;s suicide rates as being higher than Western countries [3].<p>&gt; Tokyo is expensive! -- I live in Tokyo, and this is patently false.  I pay less in rent, groceries, transportation, restaurants, and entertainment than I ever did in a major city in the United States.  See [4].<p>&gt; Japanese people are racist! -- Sure, some people face discrimination, Chinese and Korean immigrants especially, and it can difficult to fully assimilate.  However, I feel incredibly welcome as a foreigner, and I believe that most friction between native Japanese and foreigners can be attributed to a language barrier.  For instance, renting apartments can be an issue for foreign residents with poor Japanese language skills [5].  It is exceedingly rare to meet someone who is outwardly hostile towards foreigners, but the same cannot be said for places like the United States.<p>After seeing these patterns and actually living here, I can&#x27;t help but view most writing about Japan as pro-Western propaganda, whether intentional or not.  Certainly the United States has a thing or two to learn from Japan when it comes to infrastructure, city planning [6], healthcare, and safety.  Most articles, though, serve the purpose of reiterating to American audiences that America is the best country on Earth, and there&#x27;s no reason to ever change or question anything!<p>As the author said at the beginning, there is a great deal of writing about Japanese economics and government that hasn&#x27;t been translated.  If anyone can point me to some English resources giving the Japanese perspective, I would love to read more!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;e5b9e75a-a8b8-4899-a0e4-4aea19d97ff6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;e5b9e75a-a8b8-4899-a0e4-4aea19d97...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;How_To_with_John_Wilson" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;How_To_with_John_Wilson</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;japan&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k39yps&#x2F;in_japan_more_people_died_from_suicide_last_month&#x2F;ge3n2n4&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;japan&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k39yps&#x2F;in_japan_more...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2Vi2xePezOE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2Vi2xePezOE</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iZ5f_QokinY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iZ5f_QokinY</a><p>[6] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;urbankchoze.blogspot.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;japanese-zoning.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;urbankchoze.blogspot.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;japanese-zoning.html</a>')
