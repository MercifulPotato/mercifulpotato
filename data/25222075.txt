And when purchasing a house in the past year, I noticed fiber was available if the entire subdivision was newly built in the past 5, maybe 10 years, otherwise fiber is unavailable.  So the telecom companies are laying fiber, but only if the entire area is new and they&#x27;re laying new everything.  If you build a new house in an area with existing homes, you won&#x27;t get new fiber.  And I didn&#x27;t find any pre-2010 houses with fiber period.')
