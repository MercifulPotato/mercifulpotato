I&#x27;m building an app that lets you play html5 games while you video chat. My multiplayer games like checkers and Ludo keep losing state mid-game session but I noticed games like Poker with friends (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn-factory.marketjs.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;poker-with-friends&#x2F;index.html) &amp; Ludo with friends don&#x27;t have this problem no matter how many times I minimize the browser window.<p>My game communication interface currently uses websockets and engages a retry mechanism with message acknowledgement, so a message gets resent if the ack fails to arrive within a short period of time. Does anyone know how html5 online multiplayer games like those listed above maintain their state no matter what? can anyone see a problem with my websockets implementation?')
