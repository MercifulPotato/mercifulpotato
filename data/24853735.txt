The latter statement doesn&#x27;t really hold for us. Super patchy coverage on trains.<p>Germany has a different issue, you have multiple providers and those combined have pretty good coverage. I visit germany frequently by train and roam and it kicks me from provider to provider.<p>Iirc your providers are mandated by the gov to also service these rather unprofitable areas, which they do. They split up the uninhabited regions, build a few antennas there. So if you have a plan with a national provider you get shitty coverage. If you roam and can use any provider, it&#x27;s actually mostly fine (in my experience).<p>I don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t do national roaming in these areas.')
