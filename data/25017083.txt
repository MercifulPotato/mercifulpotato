Item(by='toomuchtodo', descendants=None, kids=[25017165], score=None, time=1604773225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25017033, text='Across the board, the GOP would need to convert minorities to consistent GOP voters faster than the electorate conversion (where the electorate tilts progressive) occurs naturally due to older voters dying and newer voters turning 18 or naturalizing, and this conversion needs to happen even faster in states that are turning blue (to overcome sociopolitical demographic momentum). I will add that just because <i>Trump</i> was able to pull more minority votes doesn&#x27;t mean <i>the GOP</i> will be able to do the same; different messaging. Someone supporting Trump is unlikely to vote for Mitt Romney (who is, imho, a reasonable conservative), for example. Also, historically, the GOP typically doesn&#x27;t put forth public policy that is friendly to most minorities and immigrants.<p>Sorry my thesis wasn&#x27;t clear, although I appreciate the opportunity to refine the message. Better to get the kinks out here before speaking to an audience IRL.')
