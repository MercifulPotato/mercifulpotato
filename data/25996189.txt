The quality of the worksmanship aside, what has always struck me is that the predominant gemstone in these hoards is garnets - sourced from India. How do Indian gemstones end up in far off pagan Anglo Saxon Britain, largely cut off from the rest of the continental trade networks? Even those networks would be greatly diminished with the decline of Rome. The pagan Anglo Saxons probably traded with their kindred on the continent, but to source indian garnets of such quality &amp; quantity? Astounding.')
