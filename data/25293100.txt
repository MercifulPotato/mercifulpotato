That is, you can&#x27;t employ this only rhetorically, it doesn&#x27;t work that way. I don&#x27;t know what the conditions were, and in a lot of ways there is important information being tactically withheld here, so it&#x27;s hard to say for certain.<p>But generally, unless you yourself are <i>really really</i> important to the company, you should prepare for it not to go your way. And it&#x27;s going to be rare in a huge place like Google, with tons of people they could put in your place, for a person to be that important. Maybe this person is, I&#x27;m unfamiliar. But as far as I can see this doesn&#x27;t seem outrageous on Google&#x27;s part.')
