Before you can tell what effect the conditions have on yield you have to compare the grow area. Each vertical pane contributes to the grow area. What is the grow area of the vertical farm? It&#x27;s not even in the damn article at all. What&#x27;s the cost per kilogram of plant matter? Per kg of dry yield?<p><i>Plenty’s farms grow non-GMO crops and don’t use herbicides or pesticides.</i><p>Ah, there it is. This isn&#x27;t a project to save the world; it&#x27;s a project to lure investors and then lose money for ten years before getting bought out and shut down.')
