Capturing the waste heat from the exhaust stack of that engine gave us 7MW of net generation, at a cost of $30 million, and much lower operating expenses to boot.<p>the main issue here is actually such a low efficiency turbine - an efficient one wouldn&#x27;t have such an easy capturable exhaust heat to start with. One can understand that a gas turbine on a plane for example has weight  limits so you can&#x27;t tack on additional turbine stages, etc. to increase efficiency, yet for ground based it would  only be about increased capital costs of such a turbine - so that means that running inefficient turbine is cheaper, i.e. the energy&#x2F;fuel is still very cheap.')
