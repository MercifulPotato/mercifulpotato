I like that ic includes a hook for logging, which I think is an advantage over calling print directly. I realize for a lot of examples, theyâ€™re quick and dirty but I almost always end up setting up a logger with an stderr or stdout handler so that other handlers can also send it to a file if desired. This makes it easier to run these in production on daemons and such where your code might not have an stdout to print to.')
