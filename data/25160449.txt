I believe you are projecting.<p>I see people pining for this forgotten past time a lot, and it makes me realize that none of them remember or think the same way of things like the satanic panic, moral majority, etc, let alone remember the times when people got offended over the mere suggestion of an interracial couple or a woman who didn&#x27;t want to be a housewife. Oh the scandals that would occur if basically any program run today were to be broadcast then. They don&#x27;t remember the Television Code or the CCA, nor did they grow up on a diet of classic Hays-code era films, dripping in extreme sensitivity.')
