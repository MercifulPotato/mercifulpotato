Think of a place in the app where the user might be happy<p>2. Hardcode an in-app rating prompt<p>3. Never think about it again<p>I wanted to build a smart rating solution that:<p>- Constantly tests different locations in the app to find our happiest users<p>- Produces a steady stream of 5-star ratings instead of spikes of ratings and then no ratings<p>- Doesn&#x27;t annoy users<p>- Works with a few lines of code<p>The SDK is currently closed source but we want to make it open source soon.<p>Feel free to ask questions or request the SDK at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;get.asogiraffe.com&#x2F;promptimizer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;get.asogiraffe.com&#x2F;promptimizer</a>')
