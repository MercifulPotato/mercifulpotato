Everybody and its dog have one at home.<p>I wonder if those Dracaena could have a similar effect. They have cutting finely toothed leaves so chew it or put it in the mouth does not seem a wise move in any case, (And to confound it by a Dieffenbachia would be a lethal mistake), but for external use... may work. Would be a really easy way for researchers to prove if orangutans feel any pain relief.')
