It&#x27;s not trivial to get it working and the ecosystem isn&#x27;t ready for it yet.<p>There are certain things that just work (i.e. quarkus, which I have a web service running on 13 mb of ram), but I have never been able to successfully compile to native on my own because of library dependencies. Getting things like Weld or H2 to work is pretty difficult.')
