What I am going to say is not true about conservatives overall, but definitely true for every single MAGA cultist out there.<p>They generally have completely baseless opinions and are not ready to discuss anything, have an argument, learn or compromise. This is what democracy is based on: compromise. Therefore, they are <i>fundamentally undemocratic</i> and if you&#x27;re being honest they are fascists.<p>So fuck their ability to spout their violent garbage online. These are dehumanizing assholes incapable of discussing with liberals and finding compromise. They just want a dictatorship suppressing and killing liberals, if possible.<p>Good luck America, you need it.')
