Item(by='heisenbit', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608459813, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25482916, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve mentioned as much to several C-suite executives and professional venture investors I know who tend to wax philosophical about &quot;exponential growth in cloud services and big data&quot; and whatnot. Invariably, their response has been to tell me that I just don&#x27;t get it, or that I make no sense. They give me puzzled looks and maybe even get a bit exasperated with me.<p>One word: Worldcom<p>I still remember coming up to 2000 sitting in a meeting room of an equipment provider I recently joined looking at projections of market growth, competitors and our own sales and profitability. Shortly afterwards that part of the business was sold, I remained with the other non internet part and we sailed through the .com crash unscathed.<p>A lot of what AWS offers makes no sense. A lot what some AWS customer&#x27;s teams are building is overly complex and a horror show to maintain. But there is also value: Maintained images, backups, on demand resources and specialized resources. We hit one of the inflection points in Moore&#x27;s Law and that drives us into horizontal scaling and specialized hardware.<p>Like with Worldcom and the fantastic internet growth story back then there is a kernel of truth and value. Find people that understand it and be glad others are playing around and subsidizing the investments in the core.')
