Intuitively it sounds sort of like Grisham’s law were bad money drives out good, but it can’t be quite that simple, can it?  Is it more of an empirical thing?  I know I am being lazy just asking but a quick search turns up only statements of the law.  I can make up my own thinking behind it but I’d like to get it from Pournelle if possible. \n(Aside: Rothbard was great at this sort of logic chaining I think)\nAlso nice rabbit hole generally here!')
