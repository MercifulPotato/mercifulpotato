I was big on the whole linux customization &#x2F; &quot;ricing&quot; scene in my early years of university, and because of how my desk was set up, i was close enough to my computer to be able to read it. I ran Arch, with tewi, at a 9 point font size. I just liked how it looked.<p>Eventually my desk setup changed and having such a small font was no longer viable. I went with Anonymous Pro because I found it to be similar, but also easier to read at larger sizes. For a while I coded primarily in vim, so maybe there was something about just setting it once in the terminal config and having what I needed. I also picked it because patched versions existed with powerline symbols, which I was into at the time.<p>I now primarily use VS Code on Windows, but I still use Anonymous Pro. I think the narrow strokes and the sharp cruves that you dislike are actually easier for me to read. They give characters a kind of crisp shape, and I find that helpful in distinguishing which characters are which. When I look at the colleciton of fonts, ones like Cascadia, Ubuntu Mono, and <i>especially</i> Nova Mono all look awful to me, because of how rounded they are. I&#x27;m also in the crowd of people who dislike ligatures in programming fonts<p>If I were to pick any of the fonts from this list to try, I would probably pick Hack or Noto Mono for something a bit more robust, or Source Code Pro for something similar to the slenderness of Anonymous Pro. But I think the more important thing is knowing what you like and picking one and settling on it. It surprised me when I went back to my dotfiles and I was looking at screenshots, just how long I&#x27;ve been using the same font. But it makes things easy.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lucy&#x2F;tewi-font" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lucy&#x2F;tewi-font</a>')
