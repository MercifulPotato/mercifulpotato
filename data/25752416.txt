Item(by='pcl', descendants=None, kids=[25752727], score=None, time=1610480841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25749539, text='&gt; I&#x27;m in favor of internet access being considered a public utility or even government funded; nobody should be &quot;deplatformed&quot; from basic internet access. Assuming that&#x27;s the case, I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s stopping Parler from setting up a server.<p>This raises a really interesting question about where the line between regulated utility and free commerce should be drawn. I generally agree with what you&#x27;ve written in your post, and struggle to come up with an answer.<p>For some of the reasons you mention, I think that I think Facebook and Twitter and the various App Stores generally belong on the &quot;free commerce&quot; side of that line.<p>But what about DNS providers and ISPs? What about browser vendors and certificate authorities? And in particular, what about AWS?<p>I could imagine a world in which DNS providers and ISPs are regulated and cannot deny service without a court order, and in which AWS ends up straddling this: EC2 + Route53 get regulated, but S3 and on up are treated as unregulated free-commerce businesses.<p>As an aside, I&#x27;m really surprised that the Parler team didn&#x27;t defend against this by hosting with multiple providers. Given their positioning, it seems like a pretty obvious risk. I wonder if that&#x27;s an oversight &#x2F; miscalculation, or if they made a decision that getting de-platformed at some point would be a good thing for their long-term brand &#x2F; agenda.')
