I&#x27;m supposing that there&#x27;s some upper&#x2F;lower limits that you can use to estimate. For a startup that is traveling well I&#x27;m guessing that the lower limit is the amount they&#x27;ve raised so far and the upper limit is somewhere on the order of 10x-20x the amount they&#x27;ve raised so far. But that is a total guess - does anyone have any better intuition than me?<p>As an example, without knowing anything else about the company, what sort of ballpark would you guess for a series B company that has raised $50 million so far? Would $100 mil - $500 mil be typical?')
