Nobody bats an eye when they&#x27;re the ones profiting off of it.<p>I&#x27;m sorry if that&#x27;s dismissive but it&#x27;s extremely frustrating hearing these kinds of things in the context of social media companies, who have never had a problem with advertisers milking FOMO and gaslighting their entire audience with this stuff for years now. (you are inadequate if you don&#x27;t buy this product, you are a loser if you don&#x27;t share this article right now, you are an enemy of the state if you don&#x27;t vote for this candidate, etc) And actually they love all that because it drives clicks!<p>The uncomfortable situation they find themselves in now is: At what point is the line drawn, where companies and special interests with millions to spend on ads can no longer lie and gaslight the public? It seems to have been easier for these companies to be the ones to dismiss this when the stakes weren&#x27;t as high.')
