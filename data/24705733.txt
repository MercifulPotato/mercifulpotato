There&#x27;s a lot more than just that. Ancient Buddhist cosmology frequently uses metaphors to describe aeons, such as grinding mountains to dust by brushing it with silk cloth once per century, etc. They do the same with countable objects to describe the numbers of worlds and so forth.<p>I have the opposite experience you described. Contemplating the infinitude of reality draws me toward religion via logic. Through contemplation it seems to follow that there&#x27;s something important happening with meaning beyond our comprehension.')
