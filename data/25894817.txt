I share different thoughts on the issue though.<p>In all seriousness my post is lampooning the absurdity of calling something an objective opinion because anything can be classified as such and I&#x27;m subtly hinting at the fact that it&#x27;s pointless and we should have the capability to label certain things as wrong or right rather then call it just a collection of opinions. I think you&#x27;re mistaken here, we are actually in agreement.<p>All of Css is a design mistake and guess what? I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s my opinion, that&#x27;s fact.')
