For me it is strange that it seems for many such a hard concept to grasp, since the advantages are huge and obvious.<p>Today some tasks like mass renaming of files of a certain type require an extra tool for a casual users, which is in most cases not available and the task therefor not doable. This is a pity and wastes a lot of potential&#x2F;productivity.<p>If programs where things you could easily talk to - and I don&#x27;t mean by using a programming language - then filtering and renaming some files should be easy.<p>This kind of mechanism would also allow to blur the line between the traditional desktop, the cloud and AI (something that has been tried before, but failed because the use-case where not compelling). For example, if Microsoft would update Windows in such a way, every user could have some cloud points for AI image recognition per month. If for some reason you needed to do a lot of image recognition, you would have to pay extra. Which would be okay, since using &quot;more resources&quot; creates costs somewhere and we as society agree that someone has to pay for it -&gt; capitalism. This blending of ecosystems and capabilities is where things should be going, but strangely none of the big tech companies seem to pursuer such a path.')
