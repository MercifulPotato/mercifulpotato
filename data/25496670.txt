This isn&#x27;t some crazy new notion, companies do this all the time for quality control purposes. They can therefore do it for human rights purposes too.<p>They can also stop it, by having a contract that requires specific working conditions for all the suppliers, and if they are violated, the contract is voided and immediately goes to a competitor.<p>Apple has no responsibility to anybody but its shareholders. They can use literal slaves for work, they don&#x27;t care. But we, the consumers and shareholders, can care. And we can express our displeasure by getting outraged, and demanding they not do business with a supply chain that abuses its workers.<p>This even happened back in the 17th century, when people boycotted companies who profited from slavery. People literally purchased items whose design advertised that &quot;no slaves were used in the making of this product&quot;. A lot of people thought companies should not be held responsible for using the product of slave labor, but over time, the force of popular opinion was able to get them to change their business models and not use slavery.<p>Today we do the same things, with products advertising not using rBST or antibiotics or engineered crops, or having fair trade or rainforest alliance certifications. We demand products that are produced ethically, and over time that can force companies to do better.<p>This isn&#x27;t always effective. There&#x27;s still diamonds being sold that were mined basically using slavery, and most coffee farmers can barely scrape by and can starve from one bad season. We do need to get outraged, or they really will never change.')
