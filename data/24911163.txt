Having experienced it, from my perspective it was time travel in a way that normal sleep never is.  When you wake up from sleep there is some perception of time passed, and therefore a sort of continuity.  Not so under general anesthesia.  The time spent under is simply <i>gone</i> without even leaving a sensation of a missing gap.')
