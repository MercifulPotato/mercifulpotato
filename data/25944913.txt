You&#x27;re not basing the stock price on earnings but intangibles.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s absolutely (informed) speculation.<p>This is how the stock market works. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft before them, Google... people said exactly what you are saying about how they were valued at some point in time.<p>Every single stock is valued based on how stocks will perform <i>in the future</i>. Last year&#x27;s performance is only interesting for informing investors of what the next 10 years will bring.<p>I do think Tesla is a risky stock to own (I do own some shares), but it always has been.
