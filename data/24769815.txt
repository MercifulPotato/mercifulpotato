And they say &quot;at least&quot; like maybe the RDA should be even higher than three-fourths the maximum safe daily dose?<p>I mean, maybe the human body really does have such a tight tolerance, it really needs 75% of what would be dangerous to maximize health. That would be surprising to me, but could be. It still seems like a recommendation like that is likely to lead to many people exceeding the designated maximum safe daily amount.<p>(Of course, it could also be that the safe upper tolerable daily intake dose is mistakenly too low?)')
