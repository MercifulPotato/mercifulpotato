Mythic Quest is great.<p>Boys State was a great purchase. I haven&#x27;t watched Earth at Night in Color yet, but it looks really cool and promising.<p>It&#x27;s not really worth $5&#x2F;mo yet. But it came for free with my new iPhone and I&#x27;ve enjoyed the content so far.<p>Edit: Why on earth would anyone downvote this? Because I liked a few shows on AppleTV?
