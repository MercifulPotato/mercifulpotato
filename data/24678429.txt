Water purification is done with a UV filter. The infrastructure costs are almost nil.<p>We are in an age now where houses don&#x27;t even need to be on the power grid -- a set of solar panels and a lithium battery makes traditional power distribution obsolete.<p>If it costs a typical suburban house $10k a year to maintain infrastructure, that&#x27;s outrageous. Move to individually or community based infrastructure.')
