Remove the leader, and what&#x27;s left is just a collection of projects sharing the GNU brand.  And it looks to me that this is what the Guix maintainers are trying to do: reduce the GNU project to a mere formality (participation in it would mean no more than a simple declaration of support for Free software), keep the GNU brand, position Guix as THE GNU operating system.')
