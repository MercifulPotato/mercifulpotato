Item(by='beerandt', descendants=None, kids=[25351499], score=None, time=1607458094, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25347573, text='Maybe &quot;ultimate&quot; is a more accurate word than &quot;sole,&quot; but in general, short of declaring War, foreign policy power eventually falls on the executive when tensions exist between branches.<p>The president can unilaterally leave treaties, arguably universally. SCOTUS has said that as head of State, even the recognition that other countries exist and&#x2F;or are legitimate falls upon him.<p>Yesterday&#x27;s SG argument at SCOTUS brought up many of the reasons why the judicial has historically, and should continue, to stay out of foreign policy matters.<p>Foreign commerce clause is a better argument, but I&#x27;d say regardless, here the President is operating within the laws and framework as Congress has legislated under that authority.<p>Whether the judge agrees is sort of circular logic here, not affirmation.')
