Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602537301, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756378, text='&gt; To be fair, it makes some sense: cars are one of the biggest killers of kids, and they&#x27;re a much bigger risk in the suburbs (where most streets are wide and fast) than the city.<p>On the flip side, I see far more reckless driving in the city than in the burbs. Blowing lights or stop signs or excessive speeding are all more common in the city often directly in front of police. That wouldn&#x27;t fly in the suburbs, and moreover people sort of expect traffic laws to be followed within reason (people still speed, but it&#x27;s not normal to go 70 in a 45). Further, I have a strong suspicion that there are more hit-and-runs in the city than the suburbs. In the burbs, streets are wider and the speed limits are higher, but they have push-to-walk buttons and almost everyone stops well before the light turns red.')
