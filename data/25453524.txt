Past Me is a lazy asshole who doesn&#x27;t want to make the effort at the moment, so he does something like buying a book and leaves it for Present Me to finish. Everything from the dishes to articles to books.<p>Sometimes that jerk doesn&#x27;t even bother to make a long term memory, so I open my Kindle reader and there&#x27;s books in there I barely recognize. The Complete History of Czarist Russia?? Who the hell does Past Me think I am? It&#x27;s like he thinks between then and now, I&#x27;ve suddenly become a completely different person.<p>Of course, I try not to do this to Future Me. I might bookmark a few sites, added a few movies to my watch list and signed up for an class or whatever. But I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll have the time and focus that I don&#x27;t have now. I&#x27;m sure of it. He&#x27;ll thank me, really, I&#x27;m sure.')
