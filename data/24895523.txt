There is inherent sexism in our vocabulary. The word &quot;man&quot; did uniquely mean &quot;human&quot; in the old English (and the words w√¶pman and wifman meant male human and female human, respectively), but it doesn&#x27;t anymore. In the same way that males aren&#x27;t the defacto representatives of the species, the word man should not refer to the species and the sex at the same time.<p>By the way, the verb to man, as in to man the decks, comes from military and nautical contexts, which used to be male-only occupations. To continue to use the verb &quot;man&quot; in that context is just unnecessary baggage.')
