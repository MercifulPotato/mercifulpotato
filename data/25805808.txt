I&#x27;d easily take bets that Signal&#x27;s current system could easily outperform your cargo cult alternative written in erlang.<p>So you’re expecting someone here to create an open-source alternative to Signal using Erlang for free? With that $60M in funding, Signal can easily hire someone who has <i>’first hand experience’</i> just like you to rearchitect their systems to be more reliable and fault tolerant.<p>The job [0] is still there. I can also bet you won’t help them out, even with your <i>’experience’</i>.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;signal&#x2F;2a5fee8b-5875-46d4-a41d-773a28a6b553" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;signal&#x2F;2a5fee8b-5875-46d4-a41d-773a28a...</a>')
