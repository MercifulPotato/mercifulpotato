It may not be a nostalgia trip in terms of blinking marquees, but it has simple links, a website-specific markup, forums, and probably a LAMP stack based on its unsophisticated styling. You can post your writings there, and review other&#x27;s writings for in-site currency, which you can spend on getting others to review what you&#x27;ve written for said currency. The community there is friendly and also has other groups for journal passing, mailed handwriting practice, poetry&#x2F;story contests and more.<p>Edit Bonus: doing NANOWRIMO each year really helps the writing habit since you are trying to get to 50,000+ words written in a month.')
