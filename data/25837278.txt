I don&#x27;t have any experience with book authoring but I would expect stuff like Geronimo Stilton to be hard to produce with markdown: it is peppered with creative text highlighting (e.g. words written in a custom cheese-pattern font) and this is common in primary school geared books.<p>Even decidedly grown-up books like GEB might have illustrations and diagrams, and it&#x27;s important to consider where said illustrations go - they must fit in a physical page.<p>There are also other small quality of life things that word does automatically, e.g. replace ASCII 0x22 (keyboard quote) with 0x201C &#x2F; 0x201D (left and right double quotes, respectively), etc.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love to use markdown for programming documentation and it&#x27;s pretty good for that, especially when you adopt flavors like GFM. But I&#x27;m legitimately curious what makes one consider markdown superior for book writing. It just seems like it would have a different set of priorities.')
