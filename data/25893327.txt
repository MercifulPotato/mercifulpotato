The United States wasn’t deluged with spread from Mexico and Canada, and there is no reason why we couldn’t have used the same airport quarantine system they used, public mask requirements, and paying inherently unsafe businesses like indoor dining to close until spread was under control.<p>The difference is that our response was dictated by political calls made by people who famously dislike expertise whereas the countries I mentioned followed scientific principles. The earlier SARS outbreak helped but the US CDC was hardly unaware of that - this is almost exactly a practice scenario they used years before in the Obama-era playbook the Trump administration ignored. The 2019 HHS exercise had travelers to China bringing back a novel influenza variant but otherwise was very similar: no antiviral drugs or vaccine, depleted PPE stockpiles, local governments refusing to close schools and restaurants, etc.')
