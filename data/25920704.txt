The value of the shares has nothing to do with the value of the company, it&#x27;s entirely about manipulating the flow of shares.  I don&#x27;t see a way that this is different from a pump and dump scheme, it just happens in reverse and is entirely unavoidable.<p>If this isn&#x27;t market manipulation, shorting stocks is dead.  Institutional investors will add checks that scan for stocks that are above 50% shorted and analyze if buying enough stock to push it to 120% or 150% shorted will make them money.  They could buy 50,000 shares of a company, sell 25,000 of them at 3x the price, burn the other 25,000, and still come away with a 50% return on investment.<p>That&#x27;s why people are calling it manipulation.  Shorting stocks was already risky, but adding in a risk that a hedgefund will come in and ruin an otherwise-healthy investment makes them extremely unappealing.')
