There is a 1&#x2F;1000 chance door 429 has the car.<p>2a. If it has the car, then when Monty accidentally opens 998 doors no car will be revealed. This does not change the chances that 429 has that car, which remain 1&#x2F;1000.<p>2b. If 429 does NOT have the car, then 998&#x2F;999 times that Monty accidentally opens 998 doors, he will reveal a car, which presumably ends that game. There is only a 1&#x2F;999 chance that he will not reveal the car and the game proceeds.<p>3. Thus, there are two cases where the game reaches the point of two remaining doors, with 998 revealed, the car is behind one of the two, and you have a chance to switch.<p>3a. Your door has the car, which happens 1&#x2F;1000 games.<p>3b. Your door does not have the car, which happens 999&#x2F;1000 x 1&#x2F;999 games, or 1&#x2F;1000 games.<p>In other words, if the clumsy Monty version is played repeatedly, 998 out of 1000 games end without even getting too the point you get a chance to switch, and 2 get to where you get the chance. In those two, one has the car in your door, one not. There is no advantage to switching.<p>In the case of the systematic Monty who knows where everything is and ALWAYS opens 998 goats, it goes like this:<p>1. There is a 1&#x2F;1000 chance your door, 429, has the car.<p>2a. If it had the car, Monty opens 998 doors that do not have the car, leaving one door besides your yours.<p>2b. If your door did not have the car, it is one of the 999, and Monty systematically opens the 998 of those 999 that do not have the car.<p>3. You always reach the choice stage. You can either get there via 2a, which always results in the car being behind your door, or via 2b, which always results in the car being behind the other door.<p>3a. You get there via 2a in 1&#x2F;1000 games.<p>3b. You get there via 2b in 999&#x2F;1000 games.<p>If you do not switch, you only if and only if you got there via 2a, so you only win 1&#x2F;1000 games. If you always switch, you win if and only if you get there via 2b, so you win 999&#x2F;1000 games.')
