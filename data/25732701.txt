For years everyone went along with the fringe right and placated them. The mainstream media covered Trump closely. Talked to his supporters to try to understand them. The more mainstream Republicans have backed up all the things Trump has done and said until now. Facebook got tons of flack the last 4 years for not silencing them sooner. Now it has escalated to dangerous levels of inciting violence that actually came pass, which has led to a stronger response. But you&#x27;re arguing for continuing to go along with them? Why should we expect that continuing down the path we&#x27;ve been on for years would reverse the trend of them getting more and more extreme?')
