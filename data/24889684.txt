Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603658243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24889388, text='&gt; It would seem the commenters on this site are mostly Americans<p>Probably.<p>&gt; who donâ€™t know that their two-party system only represents two flavors of pro-capitalist neoliberalism.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to know something that isn&#x27;t true. From about the late 1980s to sometime in 2016-2017 (the end was more sudden than the beginning), the dominant factions of both parties supported pro-capitalist neoliberalism, it&#x27;s true, but each has had significant factions <i>not</i> focussed on that position the whole time, and the neoliberal faction of the Democratic Party has been weakening for most of the last decade or so, and the neoliberal faction of the Republican Party was overthrown for dominance by a party that, insofar as it has a coherent economic policy at all, would be more populist protectionist than neoliberal (if one is being generous; kleptocratic opportunist if one is less generous.) American political parties are much more diverse than is the case of parties in systems that is typical in either proportional or parliamentary systems (and, especially, systems with both PR and parliamentary systems.)')
