The more honest the better - don&#x27;t hold back if you hate it! Just please tell me why.<p>App Link: (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;spotiplushn)<p>SpotiPlus, is an easy-to-use tool dedicated to design nice looking cover arts for your Spotify playlists, tracks, albums, podcast. From Rock to Hip Hop, I&#x27;ve prepared a variety of ready to use styles for everyone<p>Here&#x27;s what sets Spotiplus apart from other design tools<p>Easy to use, no design skills needed\nI believe that Photoshop is an excellent design editor however it requires a huge learning curve to design a simple playlist cover. With that in mind, I tried to simplify the experience and make an easy-to-use editor that offers only the necessary tools to design the cover in no-time<p>Export the cover art straight to Spotify\nAnother issue I found with exporting the cover image, was that I need to download the image first then I had to open the Spotify desktop app to upload the new cover. I thought “wouldn’t it be nice if we could upload the cover straight to Spotify with no hustle?”, For this, I linked the Spotify API with Spotiplus in order to upload the cover with 1 simple button click<p>Choose from a variety of built-in templates\nWhile playing with the editor, I found that finding the perfect background and text colors is time-consuming and requires an artistic eye. For this, I handpicked a collection of copyright-free pictures that match the Spotify vibe in addition to a cool list of the color combinations that work together well and gives good looking results.<p>Spotiplus is launched today, you could find it on Playstore by typing  Spotiplus or use this direct link (link)<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;spotiplushn<p>It would be great to get feedback on the app.')
