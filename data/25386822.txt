It can keep sending logs over the network even if a kernel panic has occurred. If both netconsole and the Ethernet driver is built into the kernel, it&#x27;s almost a serial-port substitute, a really handy debug tool for all kinds of black-screen-of-death issues. To debug an issue like that, I prefer connecting my workstation directly to the target (without routers and switches) and assign a static IP address on both ends. Netconsole for kernel space, SSH for userspace.<p>The only thing it cannot do is collecting logs from the very earlyboot process. &quot;The AMDGPU modules weren&#x27;t loading&quot; may or may not be an earlyboot problem, just try and see if you are lucky enough.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;latest&#x2F;networking&#x2F;netconsole.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;latest&#x2F;networking&#x2F;netconsole...</a>')
