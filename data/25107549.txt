I have some serious issues with resume from sleep. All browsers and electron apps have significant rendering issues after I resume and I have to close them down and restart them. I was able to fix Chrome and Firefox by enabling Vulkan, but Slack still requires a restart after every resume.<p>My external monitors periodically stop working due to an NVIDIA driver bug.<p>Have you had any similar issues?')
