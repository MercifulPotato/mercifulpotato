Even the Republican Senate acknowledges this.<p>- Trump&#x27;s campaign had various (documented) unsavoury links with Russia.<p>- Mueller didn&#x27;t clear Trump of collusion with Russia, and indeed stated that the (clear) obstruction prevented a full investigation of the topic.<p>- Trump himself has been extraordinarily soft on Russia, while burning relationships with traditional allies.<p>- Trump is also pretty effusive in his praise of Putin - dictator of a geopolitical enemy and all-round bad dude.<p>None of this is speculative - it&#x27;s all backed up by the facts. This is not to say that Trump is a KGB asset, but it&#x27;s not hard to see why people might see indications in that direction and take it a step too far. Honestly my personal view is it&#x27;s highly unlikely - if he was a Russian asset it&#x27;s likely our intelligence agencies would have known in advance and done something about it. Personally my view is simply that Trump wishes to be an autocrat, and admires other autocrats.<p>The Q stuff, the Bill Gates microchip stuff, on the other hand, is just completely out of left field.')
