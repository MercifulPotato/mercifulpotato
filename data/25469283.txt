What are the warning signs?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='For the first time in my (20 year) career, I&#x27;m quitting a job I&#x27;ve only worked at for a few weeks. Until now, the minimum I&#x27;d worked at a job was for 18 months. Never been fired. Never gotten a bad review. I&#x27;m a &quot;jump in with both feet&quot; type and have a strong personality. I&#x27;ve been in leadership positions for 15 years.<p>The job I quite was a team lead&#x2F;manager job and was very lucrative for the market. The software organization is new in this company and so is its executive leadership. The teams haven&#x27;t yet shipped a product, but two previous prototypes failed. In the interview they claimed to use scaled agile framework in one of those &quot;starting fresh, big budget, hiring the best&quot; situations. Sounded awesome.<p>I got good feedback over the few weeks I was there but I could see the environment was a complete command-and-control waterfall environment. Micromanaging executive. Directors that came with him from a previous job. Design your database up front. Despite a simple and well-trod problem domain, teams of (only) junior developers had spent <i>months</i> talking&#x2F;meeting&#x2F;designing - with poor results. Every day was a calendar full of meetings to prepare for other meetings. I discovered other teams were reporting fraudulent statuses creating the illusion of progress when no actual progress actually existed. Clearly a deathmarch.<p>The leadership situation is pretty much exactly what Joel Spolsky describes in his (now 14-year-old!) post The Command and Control Management Method:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;08&#x2F;08&#x2F;the-command-and-control-management-method&#x2F;<p>I&#x27;m aware that if I find the perfect software team, I shouldn&#x27;t ruin it by joining. I just <i>really really</i> care about making excellent software and felt like I was in a situation where that was impossible.<p>So I ask the Hacker News Hivemind: what can you do before accepting a job to ensure the work environment is a good one to be a part of? How can I make sure not to repeat this situation in the future?')
