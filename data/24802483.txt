In newer ones, the ongoing fight of, &quot;you can&#x27;t address debt or build foundations for the future, we need features, if it can&#x27;t be done in less than a week it&#x27;s not MVP enough&quot;<p>There&#x27;s a fine balance in that I think a good EM lets their team know this is going on and get involved where they want without dumping all the crap downward. Not least because they should be coaching their team leads in that responsibility, so they can take the career step when they want.<p>Going back to the article, as others mentioned it does read a little bit more like a &quot;why I&#x27;m frustrated with my manager&quot; than a &quot;how to be a good EM&quot;, but it&#x27;s easy to misconstrue the meaning of text.')
