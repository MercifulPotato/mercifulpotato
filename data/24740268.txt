What?<p>Compelling via contractual agreement. This is typically referred to as &quot;forcing&quot; a conditiobn. Classic enforcement of a clause.<p>&gt; Apple is giving Proton Mail the opportunity to come on to their platform and make more revenue.<p>No. That is not what Apple is granting PM. Me putting up a hello world app does not grant me an opportunity to make more (any) revenue. There are additional concerns and limitations.<p>&gt;  They are not forcing them on to their platform.<p>Correct.<p>&gt; If Apple didn’t exist, PM would simply not even have this opportunity.<p>Incorrect. If Apple and Apple USERS didn&#x27;t exist, PM would not be able to be utilized by those users from an Apple device (since nothing else is special about the platform). This is a matter of perspective which we fundamentally disagree on.<p>&gt; Mobs come into your business and demand revenue.<p>That is one of many tactics.<p>&gt; Here proton mail is coming into Apple’s business and demanding revenue.<p>Incorrect.<p>This is tiresome.<p>It&#x27;s not really worth picking apart your statements when you are disingenuously starting from :<p>&gt; if you want to be credible and taken seriously<p>Name calling and no-true-scotsman is all heresay or noise.
