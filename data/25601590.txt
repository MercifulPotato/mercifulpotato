Following the herd and insisting on agile ceremonies “because everyone else does it &#x2F; someone told us to”, even to your team’s detriment, is cargo-culting.<p>In your case you clearly tailored your process to something that improved your efficiency and met your reporting requirements, so, as far as I’m concerned, you’re doing agile “right”.')
