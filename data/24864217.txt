Everything else, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, is fundamentally trivial to deal with. I&#x27;ve kept SIP turned off since it was introduced, and in the brief time I was using Catalina, I had a launchd job that ran at load to set the rootfs to read write. The computer was mine, and I edited plenty of system files like this.<p>But Big Sur makes it all much harder, because changes to the root filesystem don&#x27;t take effect until you reboot. That is <i>really</i>, persistently annoying!<p>During early betas, some Macrumors users reported that if you powered off a computer at the right point during the install process, you&#x27;d end up with a version of Big Sur that didn&#x27;t use a root snapshot. If there was a more consistent way to enable that, it would help a lot.')
