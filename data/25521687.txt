In cases where the president has a conflict of interest, the power to pardon should be passed to an entity that does not have a conflict of interest.  Due to general conflicts of interest at the Federal level due to potential pressure by the president, I would suggest having the governors of each state vote.  I find that better than having Congress vote because there&#x27;s less of a tie between state governors and the president.  It&#x27;s a lot harder for the president to offer each state a tit-for-tat arrangement.')
