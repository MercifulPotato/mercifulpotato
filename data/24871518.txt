Item(by='rsynnott', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603472436, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24871314, text='&gt; The electoral college is designed (from the start) to prevent the larger, more populous states from dominating the country.<p>You&#x27;re probably thinking of the senate. While very small states do have an advantage in the electoral college, it&#x27;s not very big at all. The electoral college is largely an artifact of a time when the electors were directed by state governments, not state populations.<p>The brokenness of the electoral college is more about the winner-takes-all allocation of electors that is (usually) practiced. This makes the votes of people who live in divided states far more relevant than those of people who live in states where most people vote the same way.')
