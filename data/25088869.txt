(I am the author of DataGridXL: I was very happy to see the lib reach the front page on Hacker News some three months ago.)<p>I have created editCSVonline for a couple of reasons:<p>1) It&#x27;s nice for anyone to not have to resort to Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel to edit a simple CSV file.<p>2) I use simple tools like this (tools that aid developers) all the time: tools like JSON linters, favicon generators or SVG icon finders. This is my free help-a-fellow-dev web app.<p>3) To promote my Javacript product DataGridXL.<p>Please let me know if you have any suggestions or comments!')
