I bought a Microsoft brand keyboard under the assumption that it would be good since Microsoft hardware seems to be well reviewed when it comes to the surface line.<p>The keyboard is garbage, feels cheap, has dumb &#x27;emoji&#x27; and office hotkeys that I can&#x27;t easily disable or remap. And it typed that super long string of t&#x27;s up there for some reason.<p>I know that apple has made bad keyboards, but I use one of their butterfly keyboards daily and it is better than the Microsoft one. I can walk into the apple store and know that even if I buy the cheapest product, it is still a well-built product.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to give non-apple hardware a fair shake, and it just never matches up. I had a project where I needed to use a windows laptop and the company provided me with a Lenovo Carbon x1 (admittedly not the most recent generation). I still can&#x27;t believe that was what people recommend from Lenovo against macbook pros.')
