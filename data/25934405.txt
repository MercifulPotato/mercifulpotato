Got back go just structures and functions.<p>Most OO in most OO languages is just polymorphism and inheritance is merely a roundabout way to construct or traverse the method graph for polymorphic objects. It&#x27;s often much easier to do polymorphism directly and only if you really need it: quite often you can fare well without polymorphism at all and simply write branching instructions.<p>The useful OO must be about changing state in a controlled manner, but this remains largely unaddressed.')
