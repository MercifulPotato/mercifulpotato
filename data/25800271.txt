Cheney warned about the possibility that other nations, such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, would acquire nuclear components after the Soviet collapse.</i><p>and later in that biography:<p>&gt; <i>A draft Defense Planning Guidance issued early in 1992 envisioned several scenarios in which the United States might have to fight two large regional wars at one timeâ€“for example, against Iraq again, against North Korea, or in Europe against a resurgent, expansionist Russia.</i><p>Come Cheney&#x27;s vice presidency, there was all of a sudden talk about an &quot;axis of evil&quot; - Iraq, Iran, and North Korea.<p>Anyway, obviously Pompeo hasn&#x27;t announced, but there is widespread speculation based on concrete actions by him - see e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;elections&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-12-09&#x2F;mike-pompeo-turns-presidential-transition-to-his-advantage" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;elections&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-12-09&#x2F;mi...</a> - so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable for me to say &quot;<i>If</i> Pompeo is running.&quot;<p>And the most direct way it would be comparable to Bush&#x2F;Iraq is that it would falsely allege that al-Qaeda is linked to the government of a Middle Eastern country and use it as an excuse for regime change in that country.')
