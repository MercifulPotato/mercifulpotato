Perhaps the former is just because a contest ended at that time.  For the latter, of course, importance is subjective, but ranking these two as equivalent is silly:<p><pre><code>  * How many cases per day will Washington state average for the week ending June 7? (Tom: good prediction, Experts: bad)\n  * How many US COVID deaths will occur in 2020? (Tom: bad prediction, Experts: good)</code></pre>')
