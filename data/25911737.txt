I own a RowPerfect 3 and it is far superior in terms of motion and workout compared to any static rower. I&#x27;ve never really seen anyone learn good form that has either not been on the water or used a dynamic rower. Those who only have experience with static rowers really only learn to row poorly and then reinforce that poor form through repetition.')
