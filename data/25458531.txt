There are two parts of GDPR that would specifically go against putting consent to tracking in the EULA:<p>1. GDPR requires the consent check to be somewhere obvious and in plain language. That was specifically to deal with EULA&#x27;s given to you in tiny legally compliant text boxes.<p>2. GDPR requires that you cannot make consent for non-essential usages of data mandatory as a condition for providing your services. Tracking only logged-in people for analytics falls into the category of non-essential purposes. That requires explicit consent, even if consent is not required to use the exact same data for authentication checks.')
