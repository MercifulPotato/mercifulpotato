I think we view having many client libraries as an advantage over something like Spring Cloud Config that I believe only has Java implementation &#x2F; HTTP -- since many folks have clients in several languages. I could be wrong, but I also don&#x27;t think Spring Cloud Config has a fancy web UI with version history nor caching (so you can let PMs update copy instead of interrupting developers!).<p>The hope is that these and more features for Config.ly along with the fast integration will make it a no-brainer over rolling your own implementation as many folks do today.')
