It even explains in the article that people with Down&#x27;s syndrome are more susceptible to respiratory viruses (the person discussed in the beginning of the article got hospitalized with pneumonia multiple times and got put on a ventilator due to it years before COVID pandemic was even a thing).<p>So it seems to be less about something special about Down&#x27;s syndrome that makes COVID more deadly to someone with Down&#x27;s, but that it is just a subset of people who tend to have increased severity of respiratory infections in general. And COVID, being a somewhat respiratory virus, naturally hits those people harder than those without extra susceptibility to respiratory viruses.')
