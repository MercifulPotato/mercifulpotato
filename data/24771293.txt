And I think most in  the 1940s would be very surprised at what computers can do now. It only takes little imagination because we’ve already seen it in action.<p>Similarly, you can say that deep learning is just a series of matrix multiplications with nonlinearities applied, which is true, but it certainly wasn’t obvious to most that when you scale that way up, that that would lead to computers being able to interpret images, sound, <i>and</i> text. For example, my AI course professor described neural nets as something of interest mostly for historical reasons, something that was tried, but was an evolutionary dead end. And he was no slouch.<p>The hype has gotten ahead of its current abilities, but I simultaneously think that it will be one of the most impactful inventions we’ve ever created.')
