Or that your references to socialism are all red herrings?<p>My point is food is cheap because the government intervenes, it&#x27;s not a free market as you make it out to be, and yes food is provided to those in need. However, there aren&#x27;t many in need in no small part because food is already the cheapest in the world in the US. That&#x27;s not an exaggeration [3].<p>If medicine were the cheapest in the world in the US then nobody would be calling for its socialization. The current system is an abject failure. The food market, while I disagree with it, would likely be defined as a success.<p>I&#x27;m saying that in other countries with socialized medicine costs are controlled far better. Medicare controls costs far better than the private sector. Canada&#x27;s system costs half as much, covers everyone and is ranked <i>better</i> along basically ever major axis. Life expectancy is declining in the US. Healthcare in the US is among the worst in the OECD and <i>far</i> more expensive. [4]<p>I&#x27;m saying that it&#x27;s not as big a leap as you make it out to be, and that there&#x27;s lots of precedent, domestically and abroad.<p>&gt; You are not defining coercion properly. It means force or threats of force.<p>Coercion (&#x2F;koʊˈɜːrʒən, -ʃən&#x2F;) is the practice of forcing another party to act in an involuntary manner by use of threats or force. Threats <i>or</i> force. Pay up or get out and die is a threat, IMO, levvied by the system.<p>But even if you choose not to take that definition - it remains true (the only thing I&#x27;ve been arguing) that health care is not a voluntary contractual agreement but one taken out of necessity on an uneven playing field. This makes healthcare <i>not</i> a free market under most circumstances.<p>&gt; Apparently you define all government spending as socialism, making the only other possible form of &quot;govt&quot; anarchy itself?<p>&quot;In the theoretical works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and subsequent Marxist writers, socialization (or the socialization of production) is the process of transforming the act of producing and distributing goods and services from a solitary to a social relationship and collective endeavor.&quot; [1]<p>Socialization in a primarily capitalist economy is defined as taking a for-profit institution and transforming it into an institution collectively funded and carried out for the public benefit. If the government owns and operates a service for the public benefit it is a socialized service. It is socialism - well, democratic socialism&#x2F;social democracy. It is not incompatible with freedom, or democracy, or private property rights.<p>Yes, these are all socialized services. Explicitly yes for Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE. [2]<p>The alternative to socialized services are privately owned and operated businesses. Not anarchy, necessarily, but libertarianism.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Socialization_(Marxism)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Socialization_(Marxism)</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Socialized_medicine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Socialized_medicine</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ibtimes.com&#x2F;us-spends-less-food-any-other-country-world-maps-1546945" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ibtimes.com&#x2F;us-spends-less-food-any-other-countr...</a><p>[4] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;health&#x2F;health-systems&#x2F;health-at-a-glance-19991312.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;health&#x2F;health-systems&#x2F;health-at-a-glance...</a>')
