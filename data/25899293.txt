[2] is Moxie saying that he is also against federating with other Signal servers (and implies that they use their trademark aggressively to stop the term &quot;Signal&quot; from being used by third-party apps).<p>Given how explicit he was about this at the time (and the lack of comments to the contrary in the past 5 years), I honestly don&#x27;t think any clarification is necessary. That&#x27;s his opinion and while I may disagree with his opinion, we shouldn&#x27;t pretend that he is likely to change it in the future (or to imply that isn&#x27;t his opinion on the topic). If you feel strongly that you want decentralised instant messaging, use Matrix (or something like it) rather than hoping Signal will become something Moxie has said he is against it becoming.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LibreSignal&#x2F;LibreSignal&#x2F;issues&#x2F;37#issuecomment-217211165" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LibreSignal&#x2F;LibreSignal&#x2F;issues&#x2F;37#issueco...</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LibreSignal&#x2F;LibreSignal&#x2F;issues&#x2F;37#issuecomment-217231557" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LibreSignal&#x2F;LibreSignal&#x2F;issues&#x2F;37#issueco...</a>')
