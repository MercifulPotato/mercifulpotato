Surprisingly, many of them are being rejected by judges because of not being fair.<p>Police officers can fine you if they believe you are infringing the law, and civils have to take their word as granted until a judge makes the final decission. People were fined in the spring for things such as driving to pick up groceries in a store different than the one closest to their homes [2], or because of walking the dog (one of the very few exceptions to leave the house) &quot;too far from home&quot;, despite the law having never settled an official maximum distance [3].<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.as.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;20&#x2F;other_sports&#x2F;1590007192_285496.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.as.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;20&#x2F;other_sports&#x2F;1590007192_2854...</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.niusdiario.es&#x2F;nacional&#x2F;tribunales&#x2F;justicia-claro-delito-supermercado-domicilio-coronavirus_18_2942370316.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.niusdiario.es&#x2F;nacional&#x2F;tribunales&#x2F;justicia-claro...</a>\n[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;diariolaley.laleynext.es&#x2F;dll&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;se-anula-la-multa-por-pasear-al-perro-a-mas-de-un-km-del-domicilio-durante-el-estado-de-alarma" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;diariolaley.laleynext.es&#x2F;dll&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;se-anula-la-...</a>')
