They are not offering any contact or explanation. We use them because it simplifies the scope of our PCI DSS certification as service providers.<p>What other alternatives to Okta can you recommend considering the PCI DSS compliance requirements?<p>Colombia doesn&#x27;t have US sanctions or any trade restriction, nor do we have been late in our payments or violated any terms as customers. It&#x27;s a strictly discriminatory action that entirely disregards our investment using their platform.')
