I use git for things I work on alone, I find the ability to branch and stash etc. a net productivity improvement, not something that hampers me; add in collaborating with even one other person and I wouldn&#x27;t even consider not using it, I&#x27;d honestly decline a job offer (well, everything has its price I suppose..!) over it, there&#x27;s no way that&#x27;s not a nightmare.')
