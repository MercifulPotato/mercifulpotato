Consider that a functional community is characterized by an overarching sense of cooperation and mutual support that is NOT tied to an individual&#x27;s identity. HN provides succor to those who look at the world in a certain way, with a combination of probing curiosity, healthy skepticism, and intellectual humility.<p>It&#x27;s true that there are some elements of history that might remove you from that sphere.
