And I&#x27;m sure most fans would much rather switch back to the v10 engines even though they are more &quot;obsolete&quot;, a conventional powertrain doesn&#x27;t make them any more boring to watch (it actually makes them more exciting imo).<p>And if battery technology is ever good enough to last a full F1 race without adding tonnes of extra weight, I&#x27;m sure they will switch over to electric. Powertrain isn&#x27;t the main focus of F1, teams are quite limited in what they can do there.')
