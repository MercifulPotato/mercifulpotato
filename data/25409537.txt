I have glasses for nearsightedness that are focused very far out (the common case). Wearing them for constant work at arms length really tired my eyes out. So, I&#x27;d frequently work without my glasses, but hunch forward a little to make seeing things easier.<p>With glasses dedicated for computer work, I can read everything I need to, my body can stay in the position it should be, and my eyes don&#x27;t get nearly as tired.<p>As a side benefit, the glasses help me focus in other areas of my life. I frequently wear them while cooking, and it helps me do one thing at time, as other stuff is blurry.')
