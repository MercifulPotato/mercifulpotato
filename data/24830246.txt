That is why I initially tried the TIF thing because it was minimally invasive laparoscopic including repair of a small hernia and I was out the next day.  But it didn&#x27;t stick, and didn&#x27;t work for my breathing issues.<p>But I have been very hesitant to try another different surgery because it has risks.  Just some days when I wake up and my throat is closed up and I am tired etc. I second-guess that.  For me Nexium and Omeprazole handle almost all of the actual heartburn.  It&#x27;s just the throat closing up and breathing issues especially when I lay down and sometimes more significant fatigue after meals that don&#x27;t really go away.')
