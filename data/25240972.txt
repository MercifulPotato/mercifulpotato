Most of the shifts will tolerate a light load, but going from 7-8 while steaming up a hill will immediately bind the gears and you need to backpedal a few teeth to get it unstuck.  By the time that&#x27;s all sorted, you&#x27;ve lost your momentum and need to downshift again, not to mention taken months off of the lifetime of your very expensive hardware.  As you can probably tell from my description, this is a mistake I&#x27;ve made.  Binding up your brand new $1500 transmission is a great lesson to <i>never</i> do that again.')
