The authors repeatedly describe Apple&#x27;s approach as &quot;non-standard&quot; when what they mean is &quot;not what Linux does&quot;.  That&#x27;s pretty grating.  It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that in several cases (such as Mach-O), Apple&#x27;s approach predates the very existence of Linux.')
