Item(by='at-fates-hands', descendants=None, kids=[25352062, 25350718], score=None, time=1607455962, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25349929, text='&gt;&gt; I learned their stuff is just made in China in a factory.<p>When it first started out, I had a lot of friends in distant states that had shops on Etsy and I would find really cool, inexpensive stuff from theirs and other shops. I really like the eclectic feel of the stuff people were making and it was original and I have always gotten compliments on the stuff I was buying from their shops.<p>Last couple years, you really have to search to find stuff that isn&#x27;t being mass produced in China or overseas. Looking back, thinking of other &quot;eclectic&quot; online shops, it seems to be a pattern. You get the people who set up their shops with their hand made goods, then it gets popular, then it gets overrun with China knockoffs and other people just reselling China goods for a markup.<p>Even with the requirements in place, I&#x27;m not sure how you eradicate it once it gets a foothold like it has now.')
