I haven&#x27;t really seen anyone who has it say they dislike it. But they do seem willing to jump through extra hoops to make the machine work for them.<p>So I think there is <i>some</i> reliable evidence in it&#x27;s favour. But I don&#x27;t think you should be downvoted for disagreeing with that. Since it definitely up for debate! Someone seems to have downvoted your comment here, and I think that is the wrong action to take on what is clearly a thoughtfull response on your part.')
