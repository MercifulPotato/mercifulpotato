If we cannot heal what we cannot feel, by supporting patriarchal culture that socializes men to deny feelings, we doom them to live in states of emotional numbness. We construct a culture where male pain can have no voice, where male hurt cannot be named or healed.&quot; — bell hooks<p>Does this resonate with you?<p>I think American culture has evolved into a culture that glorifies violence, turns young girls into sex objects, sends young working class men to their deaths to ‘defend&#x27; their country, and indoctrinates it&#x27;s citizens with bizarre nationalistic views (talking about US here) and a sense superiority that to me is completely removed from a compassionate view of life.<p>Last year I learned that that there is not just one type of abuse, ‘disempowering abuse’, which is shaming someone and making that person consider themselves ‘less than’ others, but two types of abuse. The second type of abuse, which I think American culture suffers from a lot, is what Pia Mellody calls: ‘false empowerment’. It leads to codependent individuals, on both sides. Here is a description by psychologist Terrence Real, from his book ‘How Can I Get Through to You’:<p>“What Pia has called “disempowering abuse” is the one we can all readily identify. It is made up of transactions that shame a child, hurt him, physically or psychologically, make him feel unwanted, helpless, unworthy. What Pia has called “false empowerment,” by contrast, is comprised of transactions that pump up a child’s grandiosity, or at the least, that do not actively hold it in check. Pia’s genius was in understanding that falsely empowering a child is also a form of abuse.”<p>At the same time, I think our society also has a massive fear of grief and sadness.<p>“In this culture we display a compulsive avoidance of difficult matters and an obsession with distraction. Because we cannot acknowledge our grief, we’re forced to stay on the surface of life. Poet Kahlil Gibran said, “The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.” We experience little genuine joy in part because we avoid the depths. We are an ascension culture. We love rising, and we fear going down. Consequently we find ways to deny the reality of this rich but difficult territory, and we are thinned psychically. We live in what I call a “flat-line culture,” where the band is narrow in terms of what we let ourselves fully feel. We may cry at a wedding or when we watch a movie, but the full-throated expression of emotion is off-limits.” — Francis Weller<p>I found a great introduction to Weller&#x27;s work in this podcast: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;charleseisenstein.net&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;new-and-ancient-story-podcast&#x2F;episode-03-deep-wealth-and-transformation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;charleseisenstein.net&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;new-and-ancient-story...</a><p>Also have you heard about Nonviolent Communication? There are some great facebook groups where people practise together. Marshall Rosenberg&#x27;s voice is often a voice in the dark for me, helping me become aware of what&#x27;s going on inside me: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DgaeHeIL39Y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DgaeHeIL39Y</a><p>Also lastly, I love Gabor Maté: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TIjvXtZRerY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TIjvXtZRerY</a>')
