Unless they collude, which is illegal, and impractical for many markets such as GP visits.<p>For these particular goods, does your view differ, when compared to emergency services which we agree are price inelastic? And if not, how do such services differ to the foods market - holding aside regulatory capture of things such as insulin which we both probably agree is not a good thing?')
