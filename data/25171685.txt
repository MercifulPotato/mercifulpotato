I think if you show someone the screenshots they will say it looks like Doom and the kind of engine doesn&#x27;t matter that much (many modern &quot;Doom clones&quot; also use modern engines, not the original BSP one). But of course your points about the engine are correct, it is simpler than Doom, which I mention in the readme. I haven&#x27;t chosen that subtitle as a means of getting more attention, I don&#x27;t really think about this as I despise marketing, I simply tried to describe it in a simple way.<p>&gt; I didn&#x27;t read long enough to understand if this is a satire or not.<p>Not a satire.')
