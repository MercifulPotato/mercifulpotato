It seems like you lost access to your company account, based on your comment, so who is &quot;we&quot; that lost thousands of dollars worth of project code? If it was your employer that you had the email with, why couldn&#x27;t you just restore the email?<p>What in your opinion should github do when an employee loses access to their company email, and 2FA, because they&#x27;re fired? Should the employee gain access to all the code and the account by just contacting github via their personal email?')
