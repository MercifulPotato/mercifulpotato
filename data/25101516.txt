Also shows, by the &#x27;missing apps&#x27; between ecosystems, how much we need replacements for all the proprietary social sites, chat, collaboration etc.<p>However there is a lot that needs to be done software wise, which made me think that if I want to have a solid Linux device that really fits in my pocket like a phone with actual speech and 4g(5g?) then a lot more people will need to help with this. I don&#x27;t know how that will happen, but, like I did with the Pandora, with this device I will try to work with the community in reporting and fixing bugs.<p>For now, this is a device for people who like freedom of their device (well, at least as much as we can get with modern circuits) and who like to tinker. I would recommend it to those people who envision an open source phone in their future; we need to help + stimulate the people trying.<p>Edit: it is trivial to try all OSs, so whatever you buy, you can switch rather rapidly and take them all for a spin.')
