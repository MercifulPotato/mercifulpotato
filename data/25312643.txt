Why don&#x27;t you show some evidence instead that faster than light entanglement has been &quot;accepted&quot;?<p>The fact is, there are theories of QM that do not assume that entanglement happens faster than light. The Many Worlds theory is one that has no need for such hypothesis. And more generally, since you need to send the results via a classical (no faster than light) communication method, there&#x27;s no way to be sure that the entanglement has happened faster than light.')
