From a Swiss person</i><p>This is simply not true. I&#x27;m Swiss and working as a developer and consultant in Switzerland since the nineties. I - as many others - was able to do several studies at a world-class university right on my doorstep without getting into debt. People are fair, hardworking, innovative and responsible. Switzerland has ideal conditions for companies and people looking for work. And it&#x27;s a great place to live. Why do you think Google and others have large development departments in Switzerland? And it&#x27;s also good for start-ups. Have a look at e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.organisator.ch&#x2F;die-100-besten-startups-der-schweiz-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.organisator.ch&#x2F;die-100-besten-startups-der-schwe...</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.top100startups.swiss&#x2F;index.cfm?page=136340&amp;cfid=407903024&amp;cftoken=c257d6e2e698cba3-6DEF22F5-F482-4E24-240E27A83C801E68&amp;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.top100startups.swiss&#x2F;index.cfm?page=136340&amp;cfid=...</a>.<p>Also see e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_Swiss_companies_by_revenue" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_Swiss_companies_by_rev...</a>.')
