I tried keeping syncing on for a year, but ultimately switched back to a local library.<p>It worked 99% of the time. But then every few weeks it would overwrite my newer-annotated version of a PDF with an older one, and I&#x27;d lose chapters&#x27; worth (in one case an entire books&#x27; worth) of highlights. It was infuriating.<p>It had to be some kind of iDrive sync bug. It seems insane that type of stuff passes QA, I can&#x27;t even imagine.')
