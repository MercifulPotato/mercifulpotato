Somewhat simplistically, Communism is 1) A viewpoint on the historical development of society, most notably the economy 2) An extrapolation from that viewpoint on where things are headed, which is judged by communists to be a bad path 3) Advocacy for a path that diverges from #2.<p>There&#x27;s a dozen different major branches&#x2F;interpretations, but at heart they are all socio-political&#x2F;economic philosophies that are far more complex than simply who owns a thing.<p>About the only parallel I see between free software is that both want property to be owned by the community. Though even then, I&#x27;m not sure <i>free</i> software would have even the restrictions that might be imposed by community ownership. (The community might say &quot;no, don&#x27;t build that thing.&quot; etc.)<p>Perhaps in a purely communist society software would be free, but free software itself is not inherently communist.')
