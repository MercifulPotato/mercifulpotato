Ad blocking relies on blocking network requests for the most part, which can still absolutely be blocked when done by WASM.<p>Some ad blockers also optionally relies on removing DOM nodes for greater coverage. It&#x27;s important to note that this technique is used to reduce visual clutter, but doesn&#x27;t prevent tracking, and doesn&#x27;t increase browsing performance as the ad still gets downloaded before being removed.<p>Yes, a purely canvas-based app could work around DOM blocking, but WASM has nothing to do with it: you can do pure canvas-based UIs in javascript too, that&#x27;s what all the modern web games do.')
