I always try and do the best job possible, but I don&#x27;t do it for the company, I do it for me.  I think of it as training to make myself better.  I am always looking out for my skills and experience, so when the next opportunity comes around, I&#x27;m ready to take it.  You could say that it&#x27;s resume stuffing, but I don&#x27;t think of it and mean it that way.  I want to see how things work and practice what I know.  I want to incorporate that knowledge and associate it with my past experiences to figure out new things.')
