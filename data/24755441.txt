Two major groups buying windows are business clients (who would rather you not change things so that their 20 year old custom software still runs in Internet Explorer) and the average user (who couldn&#x27;t care if the Kernel was NT, Linux, or a literal peice of Corn as long as things work).<p>The hypothesis is that users would not even know. API compatibility would be retained through emulation layers, or perhaps hosting legacy Windows inside a VM.<p>Not proposing that Windows Subsystem On Linux (WSoL) is going to be real, but this attack seems out of touch to me with the technics of the matter. I don&#x27;t think it is so unimaginable for Microsoft to create a non-disruptive rebase of their OS platform APIs onto another environment. Many have already, in their free time, done just that, quite successfully, albeit Microsoft would have to go further.')
