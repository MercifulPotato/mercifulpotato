That is <i>specifically</i> the OS. Not MacBook the hardware ( which I increasingly hate... )<p>As a matter of fact I dont even remember what difference &#x2F; new improvement they made in the past few macOS version. Other than instability and compatibility problems.<p>Safari needs lots of love. Stop dumping down Safari into iOS Safari. I use Desktop &#x2F; PC for a reason.<p>As a matter of fact, I wish they would stop releasing new macOS every year for <i>features</i>. There is no need for that. Just do bug fix, library &#x2F; API update and performance improvement.<p>Edit: Actually Text Layout is still crap, no one has solve text layout that takes writing Top to Bottom into account. That is including the Web Engine as well.')
