I&#x27;ve just made this visually clean and simple tool that lets you access any website mobile version from Desktop.<p>This is useful for me as I hadn&#x27;t a tool like this and sometimes I dont want to open DevTools for checking mobile version of a site, or also develop on localhost with DevTools opened.<p>Hope this to be useful for someone else!')
