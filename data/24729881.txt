It originated among physicists and mathematicians, so it has a &quot;head start&quot; in these areas.<p>Julia is a general-purpose programming language, despite having roots in scientific programming. Its performance characteristics with its high latency and runtime memory overhead makes it unsuitable for a number of non-scientific applications. But not all. I think Julia would work excellent as a webserver backend, for example.<p>I mostly use it for DNA sequence processing, which is not really numerical programming, but more string processing. There it shines. I wouldn&#x27;t want to make a video game in Julia or fly a plane using Julia software.')
