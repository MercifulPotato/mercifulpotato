Optimized for a triage-save-read-trash loop.<p>I&#x27;m a long-time Instapaper&#x2F;Pocket&#x2F;Wallabag user. I love scanning my RSS feeds, saving links into those apps, and clicking &#x27;mark all as read&#x27;. Then, when I have some downtime, I pore over all the interesting articles&#x2F;videos I saved. I always have something interesting to read, and I can read it with focus, not doomscrolling and hoping to luck into something good.<p>But Instapaper et al. aren&#x27;t built for the way I use them. I put a link in, read it, and delete it. No tagging, no archiving. I usually don&#x27;t even want text extraction. I just want to read something interesting, then I&#x27;m done with it. I can bookmark the link in my browser if I really want to.<p>Also, I want to open HN&#x2F;Reddit&#x2F;YouTube links in their native mobile apps. Instapaper&#x2F;Wallabag make that clumsy, Pocket makes it almost impossible. These apps also have bugs with sync, but I don&#x27;t care about offline access, so why am I paying the cost for buggy offline sync I don&#x27;t use?<p>Impermalink is designed to streamline my workflow. You can share to it from other apps[0]. When you click a link to open it, it&#x27;s marked for deletion and will disappear the next time you click another link. You can rescue a link from the recycle bin if you want to come back to it later. Links are grouped by domain, so it&#x27;s easy to lump all those YouTube videos under a collapsed header so you can focus on other content. Links are just links - your browser will open them however it&#x27;s normally configured to, including opening them in native apps on mobile.<p>The app&#x27;s condition is &quot;rough and ready&quot;. It works enough that I use it every day and really enjoy it. The UX has obvious areas for improvement. The home page has no content. Svelte has bugs that double-render some of the content sometimes. But it&#x27;s there, and it works.<p>Give it a try, let me know what you think, impermalink@spiffy.tech<p>[0] Install the app to your home screen with Chrome on Android. Yes, Chrome, not anything else, not even Chrome derivatives. I haven&#x27;t tried on iOS yet. You can <i>use</i> the app in any browser you want, but only Chrome on Android knows how to share links to web apps.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;impermalink.spiffy.tech" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;impermalink.spiffy.tech</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;spiffytech&#x2F;impermalink" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;spiffytech&#x2F;impermalink</a>')
