Item(by='bestinterest', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611916917, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25952180, text='I&#x27;ve seen this comment before when it comes to turbolinks and it is a pain but if that is what I&#x27;m giving up to avoid doubling my state with an SPA, writing a ton more code to create an api and then writing more to hook it up to speak to the backend, double error checking, losing access to my whole database when creating a page and having to create a ton of endpoints to get the data I need, etc... Then I&#x27;ll take that trade.<p>I do think SPA&#x27;s still have their usecase for when it comes to complex screens but I would like to see that screen only have the incremental complexity on it. Svelte would be my goto for that page at the moment.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like what HEY done with their mobile app, most of the app is SSR HTML but the main inbox screen calls out to the JSON API with a native screen.<p>I say all this but I do love the component nature of frontend frameworks, it is nice to put things in boxes like that and have pulled in data change the view in reaction. But this new hotwire turbo frame idea sounds again much simpler where say we have a chart we want to update over time and display, in SPA world we would speak to some API change some context&#x2F;store&#x2F;component prop etc and let the rerender happen. With a turboframe we just make a call out to get the new updated HTML from an endpoint.<p>I would love some examples of people comparing and contrasting the exact same webpages + functionality with SSR + Hotwire vs SPA. Take this page for example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nomadlist.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nomadlist.com&#x2F;</a> its just PHP SSR but on my initial viewing I would think this warrants a SPA.')
