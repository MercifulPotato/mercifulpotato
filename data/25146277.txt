(which make them useless in many outdoor work environments)<p>Absolutely, I&#x27;m in the middle of Saskatchewan where it can get down to -40 and this was my biggest gripe with some of my old iPhones. Weirdly enough my BlackBerries (including my Key2!) managed a bit better. Only major issue I noticed was that capacity would rise when coming into a warmer environ. The Titan seems to be faring pretty well so far this winter, but it also is more battery then phone.<p>Was always funny walking in and having my phone restart, just to shutdown though.')
