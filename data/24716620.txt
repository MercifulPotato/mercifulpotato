Item(by='bartread', descendants=None, kids=[24716692], score=None, time=1602140500, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707924, text='It&#x27;s not an unattractive piece of hardware and, by pure luck, the aesthetic will probably work well enough in my living room, but it&#x27;s absolutely <i>massive</i>, and I have no idea where I&#x27;m going to put is.<p>I know it&#x27;s not terribly exciting but I do wish console makers would give a little more thought to this kind of thing when designing their devices. Weird and wonderful shapes - not to mention form factors biasing toward the vertical - are all very well but, for me at least, something that&#x27;s about the same size and shape as a typical hi-fi separate is a lot easier to slot in to my media centre.<p>Also, options on colour (which I imagine will come in this case) would be appreciated.')
