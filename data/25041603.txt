In most countries you are allowed to enter ENTIRELY at the discretion of the border control agent. If they don&#x27;t like the look of you, don&#x27;t like your name, find something they think is suspicious, are in a bad mood or are being ridden by their boss, they can turn you around and put you on the next plane home, regardless of what bit of paper you&#x27;re holding.<p>There are obvious exceptions for citizen and diplomats, but that&#x27;s generally how it works.')
