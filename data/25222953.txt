Everybody is different; some may get different things out of it.<p>It&#x27;s obviously going to be wrong in terms of exactness, but likely will be roughly right in terms of framing. That is, if you have 50 years, 3 days, and 2 seconds left, it might actually be 48 or 55 years, but the exact timing doesn&#x27;t matter so much to me. It&#x27;s more the quantification of the information that&#x27;s implicit in our lives but for some reason we don&#x27;t normally think about unless it&#x27;s a particularly harrowing experience.<p>For myself, I spent some time in the ER last year. I honestly didn&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;d live or not. It made me think really hard about what I was doing with what I was given. This serves as a reminder for me to do things that matter. To not optimize for the hour or the day, but the decades.<p>Plus it was fun to build.<p>Happy Thanksgiving,\nLong')
