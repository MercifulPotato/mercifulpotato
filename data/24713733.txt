It&#x27;s very much a universal problem with higher speeds. And the notion that &quot;you can make any speed reliable and fool proof&quot; is just absurd denying physics.</i><p>I&#x27;m not denying physics. Funny that you use Gigabit Ethernet as an example... I&#x27;m still debugging a hobby Gigabit Ethernet project. For some complicated reasons, It has to use a standard BASE1000-T PHY, but instead of communicating over a CAT-6 cable, it has to communicate over the circuit board backplane. Previous prototypes couldn&#x27;t even reliably auto-negotiate. Apparently, in Ethernet, not only a long cable and heavy attenuation can be the problem, an extremely short link with low attenuation can also confuse the &quot;Feed-Forward Equalization&quot; DSP algorithm in the PHY and create problems. I totally understand the inherent challenges of high-speed designs and have some hand-on experience.<p>But I have to say, yes, you can make any speed reliable, given a controlled environment and a reasonable technical constraints. It&#x27;s called engineering. Howard Johnson (the author of the famed engineering handbook <i>High-Speed Digital Design - A Handbook of Black Magic</i>), in a 1997 article on Gigabit Ethernet, which he heavily involved in its standardization, he discussed its enormous challenges [0]...<p>&gt; Key ingredients in any Gigabit Ethernet design will include:<p>&gt; Careful control of clock skew on the 125-MHz 10-bit bus.<p>&gt; Attention to crosstalk between massive, 125 MHz TTL-level parallel buses and critical high-speed serial circuits.<p>&gt; EMI considerations on the serial cables (if you are not an expert in this area, I suggest choose fiber)<p>&gt; Huge pin counts, especially on complex switching or routing ASICS, some of which will be using 512-bit bus interconnections<p>&gt; More than usual emphasis on time-to-market; everybody will want their products ASAP<p>&gt; If you thought Fast Ethernet 100BASE-T layouts were tricky, think again. Gigabit Ethernet is going to be faster, with more parallel signals, and tighter layout constraints.<p>However, he also said,<p>&gt; It will work, and it will work reliably, but you will have to follow the rules.<p>You can make any speed reliable within a reasonable engineering constrict, and in a controlled setup. Using off-the-shelf PHYs and controllers, doing hardware compliance testing, and installing good cables are all supposed to create this controlled setup. Failures to do so is what we call &quot;hardware compliance problems&quot;. I agree that it&#x27;s definitely not foolproof. Saying it is would be denying physics, but I didn&#x27;t say that. EMI&#x2F;EFI is a serious problem for USB 3.o. I&#x27;m only saying that a lot of USB 3.0 problems in practice is bad hardware compliance, true electrical problems can be fewer.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigcon.com&#x2F;Pubs&#x2F;straight&#x2F;gigabit.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigcon.com&#x2F;Pubs&#x2F;straight&#x2F;gigabit.htm</a>')
