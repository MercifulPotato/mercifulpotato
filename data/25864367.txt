I find it&#x27;s not as calculated or insensitive as it might first appear. If it&#x27;s not &quot;on the calendar&quot; then any surprises, efforts, or frustrations (friction) that arises is on that party. Really cuts down on those &quot;I told you about this last month&quot; arguments, and also from welching on friends or family events. Keeps us both honest and on the same page. Might not be high-speed, but certainly is low-drag as far as relationships go.')
