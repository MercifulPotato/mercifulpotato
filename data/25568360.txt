What has happened here is what people would term &quot;state capture&quot;, where someone uses the state to gain an advantage. Probably though, the solution is to not _completely_ demolish any standard of pasta and let the market solely decide, because we&#x27;ve seen what happens in a variety of other unregulated industries. However, I won&#x27;t make my stand on any solution here: I&#x27;m more of a polenta person honestly.<p>It&#x27;s a true problem that requires nuance, or lacking that, constant vigilance to make sure the system works for everyone. I&#x27;m realizing more and more that there will never be a political promised land, a polity will always have to perform the maintenance of their system, and every generation will have to actively work to bend their systems toward justice.')
