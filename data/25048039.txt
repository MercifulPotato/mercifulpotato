If doxxing individuals would be the only way for a voter to learn &quot;if left handed people are significantly overrepresented&quot;, you would need to make all properties of everyone public, because there could be significant overrepresentation for any property.<p>And if you already know that &quot;left handed people are significantly overrepresented&quot; from some other source, you don&#x27;t have to make the information public for these cases --  you know it already.
