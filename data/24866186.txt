No one would be making sound decisions with those yeas and nays.<p>I have no idea what terms limits of 1 day would do; it&#x27;s not obvious to me. Please argue your point.<p>&gt; And why would they always be 50 &#x2F; 50 and &quot;cancel out&quot;?<p>I&#x27;m not talking about a vote split additive cancel out. I&#x27;m talking about how in `(termLimit * nFor) &#x2F; (termLimit * nAgainst)` the `termLimit` factors cancel out.<p>&gt; If you know nothing about a fairly complex topic, it&#x27;s easy to be mislead, especially by someone with an ulterior motive that&#x27;s playing a game much longer than your term limits.<p>Again you seem to be imagining legislators are dead at the end of the term and born at the beginning or something. They have plenty time to study the role before (c.f. the stereotypical centrist-psychopath politician planning from elementary school), and plenty of their career to be judged on their actions after.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there are <i>plenty</i> of factors that reinforce the status quo, but I still haven&#x27;t heard a decent argument term limits aren&#x27;t obviously among them one way or the other.')
