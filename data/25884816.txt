Item(by='jitendrac', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611426465, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25875386, text='If I have an option to pay every article, post, tutorial I read automatically pay $0.01, I will willingly do so. But in real world all website want their own payment processing independence, on top of that payment processors charges some minimum fixed 20-30 cents per transaction + 2-3% of transaction and that is crazy. I will not pay 30 cents for a brief article written in 20 minutes, also not pay to a website that I am going to visit once in a lifetime. the only solution I can think is a crypto wallet based browser add-on which takes deposit of $xx from me every month and distribute the 1 cent per article I read to original author every once in a while with a pool of thousands of transactions ultimately making processing fees negligible per transaction.')
