You&#x27;d really have to twist yourself into a knot to convince yourself that a work-from-home administrator falls into the categories specified above. Shame on any state who didn&#x27;t include wording like that - there was nothing stopping them from putting some common-sense wording in their plans. Beyond the written rules, you&#x27;d also have to be a selfish idiot to think that just because you&#x27;re related to a healthcare company that you should get it this week if you&#x27;re working from home. If I were in that kind of role, shame would be enough to stop me but as we&#x27;ve seen the elite often have no shame.<p>(edit)\nCalifornia&#x27;s own plan [0] says Phase 1-A includes &quot;paid and unpaid persons serving in healthcare settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients and infectious materials <i>and are unable to work from home</i>&quot;. So if Stanford was really vaccinating admins who are working from home, then it seems like they violated state guidelines and should be punished appropriately.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdph.ca.gov&#x2F;Programs&#x2F;CID&#x2F;DCDC&#x2F;CDPH%20Document%20Library&#x2F;COVID-19&#x2F;COVID-19-Vaccination-Plan-California-Interim-Draft_V1.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdph.ca.gov&#x2F;Programs&#x2F;CID&#x2F;DCDC&#x2F;CDPH%20Document%20...</a>')
