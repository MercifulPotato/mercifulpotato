And publicly attacking a big corporation is quite risky so they prefer presenting the bug as general problem in the technology.<p>That doesn&#x27;t sound right to me. The industry norm for security research is &#x27;responsible disclosure&#x27;, which is intended to give the vendor reasonable time to implement the fix, while <i>eventually</i> publishing the knowledge for all to know.<p>Unless they&#x27;re simply being paid for their silence, I can&#x27;t imagine a security researcher wanting to keep quiet about a major achievement like that.<p>&gt; bugs in hypervisors exist, see CVE&#x27;s for Xen for the past decade<p>Sure, but I&#x27;m talking specifically about the big 3 cloud providers, not vanilla Xen. Amazon in particular have gone to pretty extreme lengths with their <i>Nitro</i> system.')
