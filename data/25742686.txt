It showed 62%. 70% is a pooled result when you put the (too few) people into the calculation who got 90% efficacy, which scientists can&#x27;t explain as that testing regimen was completely fucked up by Jenner and AZN (different dosage, different timing, different age group &lt;55yr only). So it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s really 90% (due to sample size) or WHY it might be more effective than the 62% number.\nThe approvals so far for the AZN&#x2F;Oxford vaccine have been for the full-full dose regimen, which has shown to be 62% effective only.')
