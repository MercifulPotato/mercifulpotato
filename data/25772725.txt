Some of the teachers who understood how to teach me were male. Only one woman knew how to teach me. In India, school teachers are almost always women. I turned to programming as soon as I got a computer. I also read a lot of escapist fiction. Fiction that wasn&#x27;t based in India or in the real world. Tolkien, Eddings, Robert Jordan, Terry Brook, Agatha Christie (I know but her books weren&#x27;t based in our time so I seemed to see it as escapism).<p>Thanks for making the effort to point this out. Do you have any reading material on the topic?')
