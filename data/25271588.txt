I would not 1 star a paid app for $5 because I wanted it for $0.99, that&#x27;s dumb (though think about how smart the average person is, and assume half of them are less than average, and they all have phones too).<p>Let&#x27;s say a free app advertises &quot;play online with friends and play by yourself&quot; and is free to play, free to download. Then you finish wasting 2GB of your mobile data ($30+ in US) and create an account (monetized, spammed) and now you find out that a mandatory payment IAP is required to play multiplayer. That deserves 1 star and probably a report.<p>Unrelated: You also have the shitty-behaviour apps that are either legitimately good or bad, but pop up &quot;RATE US 5 STARS&quot; every other launch. I would like those permanently banned from the store forever.')
