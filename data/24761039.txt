Writing proofs in Agda is a joy, but it completely fails to document what I spend most of my time looking at: The context and the subgoal. Tactics only documenting this when you&#x27;re able to step through them isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d hold against them, they&#x27;re intended for interactive provers after all.')
