In order to get the US Gov to care, you have to start costing capital money.<p>The only reason we got mad about Vietnam, Cuba, South America is not because of &quot;Communism&quot; as an abstract concept. It&#x27;s because the government seized or threatened to seize assets. See also Pinochet. We had no problem with him.<p>The reason why this is relevant to China is that China has made a lot of people a lot of money. So they commit a genocide every so often. As long as it doesn&#x27;t cost American capital money, we&#x27;ll ignore it.<p>Why were people so up in arms about Cuba, but not Ethiopia? Well, Cuba is much closer, true. But the real issue was that people owned stuff in Cuba. There was no significant interest in Ethiopia.')
