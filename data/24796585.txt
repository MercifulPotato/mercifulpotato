The parts that I worked on weren&#x27;t &quot;new&quot; per se, these were modifications to existing parts to comply to new loads or new materials, fasteners etc.<p>Once envelopes + safety factors are set, we literally sketch out basic FBD (free body diagrams) along with shear-moment diagrams depending on the type of the part. You know the kind of diagrams you had to do in Statics class in University. Most of us knew the appendix formulas and many other empirical results by heart, and some of the guys at work were total nerds. They knew every possible cross sectional moment of inertia formulas, etc. It was really humbling. You&#x27;d think that aircraft industry some slow moving folks, but it couldn&#x27;t be more false. The discipline was astounding. Then we consult existing parts directory, fastener books and materials for conceptual design. During the first conceptual design review (CDR), Principal engineers (depending on how critical this part is) get involved and provide us feedback.<p>Post CDR, we send out parts to our FEA dept (mostly part time workers, some of them even commercial pilots) that get the models from the drafting department (Catia V4 at the time) and run some discretization scripts, they are pretty versed on how fine the mesh should be, but everything must be documented. Sensitivity study against mesh size needs to be proven. Converged models are sent back to us, we test it against intuition, and theoretical predictions (but not always).<p>Detail design: Flange thickeness to thread pitch is set in stone, about 1800 fastener choices are narrowed down to a few, cost implications are non-existent, so most of the times weight is king. Coatings if any are specified. Prototypes are made by our supplier, GD&amp;T red marks are fixed. Goodman diagram is consulted for fatigue studies, and sometimes even simulated in the FEA model. Same with creep and crack propagation studies. Detail Design review takes place and we are blessed by principal engineer. If it is an external part with any sort of interaction with the airflow, flutter dynamics to CFD guys are called, I honestly never worked on any farrings or anything affecting flight dynamics.<p>Then comes the guaging (where to put rosette and stress gauges) and ground test certification process. Prototypes are tested against real world conditions and failures. Depending on the part, various tensile strength tests are conducted and sometimes with simulated internal cabin pressure. Not all parts were tested though. All in all, it takes forever to make a part in an airplane. My memory is fading so I can&#x27;t recall everything. It was a lot of paperwork and documentation. We took that seriously.<p>Having designed parts in an airplane, I just can&#x27;t take 3D printing seriously. You wouldn&#x27;t believe the kind of work that goes into designing parts from composites - that was a new thing at the time when I was in the industry.')
