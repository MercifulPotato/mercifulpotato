Your assumption de facto dismisses the choice of the woman in the relationship, as if her opinion is irrelevant.<p>I think there are multiple factors involved in that trend, one of which is that women tend to be more socially savvy than men. I think women tend to prefer men who are a little older because, on average, a man needs to be a little older to have a similar level of social savvy and this is a critical detail for a personal relationship.<p>There are other things in your comment that I don&#x27;t agree with. But I don&#x27;t care to elaborate, so this is where we get to &quot;agree to disagree&quot; I guess.<p>Thank you for actually discussing the details of the article with me.')
