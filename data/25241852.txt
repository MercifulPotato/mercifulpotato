Different people have different types of back issues though. Sit&#x2F;stand desk is hardly an option for me, since standing is painful. Sitting is much less painful. A chair like those linked, would generate the least pain in the short term. Long term, the mere fact that you would likely use it in the reclined position, means your muscles become weaker. This may contribute to spinal issues. It is almost not worth becoming dependent on it. I have the easiest time sitting long hours in a super adjustable chair such as the affordable workpro quantum 9000 chair. Herman Miller makes quality chairs and may have better options. The Aeron may be one.<p>The two most important things for me are the proper seating position in the chair(lower back) and raising the height of the monitor so that I almost have to look up(neck).')
