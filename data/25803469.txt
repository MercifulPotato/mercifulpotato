There is no such thing as a neutral source. When it comes to China, if it&#x27;s not the CCP party line then it&#x27;s probably relayed through Falun Gong affiliated media.<p>&gt; This is a farrago of rumour and hearsay.<p>I disagree. I can see two unsupported claims here:<p><i>&quot;The U.S. government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;Despite the WIV presenting itself as a civilian institution, the United States has determined that the WIV has collaborated on publications and secret projects with Chinaâ€™s military.&quot;</i><p>These may be true or not, but the evidence is not presented.<p>All other points raised are either opinion or facts that have been known to the public for a long time.')
