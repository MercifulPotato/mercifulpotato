How many people are needed to feed a single creator into a decent life? I suspect that the answer starts at a 1000 at least. And the creator is not alone. Others will compete for that short amount of time an average person can spare. Also people have other things to do rather than watching youtube&#x2F;whatever so the chances that the creator finds that 1000 people are getting really thin. I think it is safe to assume the dilution factor is 100 at least. Then add some statistical distribution of market share each creator has, the ability of people to gravitate to already existing communities and suddenly you will discover that the world can not support too many creators at all.<p>Of course I&#x27;ve pulled the numbers out of my own ... but I think it is reasonable assumption.')
