And it can even compile to HTML5 (although that&#x27;s more limited).<p>It works with version control and unicode, it has regex, cryptography, sockets, JSON, XML, OAuth2, SVG etc. It has database libraries for interacting with sqlite, postgresql, mysql, etc.  It can incorporate a web browser and control that using Javascript and callbacks. It can be extended to integrate with Java, Objective-C, etc.  You can create your own GUI widgets. And it&#x27;s free.<p>But that&#x27;s still too much like Hypercard, which only ran on an ancient Mac and nothing else.  Hypercard could do about 10% of what Livecode can do.  And Hypercard has been dead since before you touched an IDE.')
