When the private sector crowds out basic research and takes over the function of public institutions, there are three reasonable scenarios. 1. they let the researchers do what they want and science goes on, 2. they&#x27;re regulated so they can&#x27;t compromise science, 3. they do what Google does, in which case it&#x27;s time to take the gloves off and go to 2. because the integrity of scientific research for its own sake is more important than whatever corporate dystopia Google is trying to build.')
