I understand I have a bias so help me overcome it. Can you share numbers or studies or evidence pointing at least in the direction your arguments go? What does drained mean? Of course you get tired after an hours long therapy session or a party or a social gathering while being on a stimulant.<p>The two links you posted are studies from 30 years ago, on rats and looking at a very constrained amount of variables from a very simplified model of human brain chemistry.<p>And I&#x27;m restraining myself to studies because I don&#x27;t want to sound like a drug apologist or speak about illegal drugs so openly on an account with my name. But I&#x27;m pretty sure that if you actually talk to whoever you know that has experience administering MDMA on communities for recreational or religious or whatever purposes and ask them for their numbers on &quot;drainage&quot; and &quot;depression&quot; you will be surprised. I really doubt that you actually have too much experience, and I&#x27;m 100% sure you have less experience than some actual MAPS psychs that administer this and do tell their patients that supplements are as effective as placebo and that depression happens to less than half of the patients. It&#x27;s controversial that they would do that but honestly it&#x27;s were the data points. Luckily.<p>If research evolves and we do discover that MDMA was more dangerous than we thought for mental health then that&#x27;s a pity. Of we discover a diet of supplements that reduces the I&#x27;ll effects that would be great, specially because the mechanisms by which it&#x27;s believed MDMA causes depression are also present on many conditions so you would be striking gold here.<p>Matter of fact is I&#x27;m completely sure both academic and urban shamanistic knowledge point in the opposite direction of what you are saying.')
