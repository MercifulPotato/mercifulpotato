I don’t even know what the status of it is to this day even though there are far more options than there were then.<p>I didn’t touch Java for years because it was risky to invest time and energy into a language were the owner, Sun and now Oracle, could just yank it or start charging for the JDK at any time. It only became safe when it was successful enough that it became unlikely that thy would do something like that and there started to be viable alternatives. It’s easy to forget that Java had a huge cloud over its head foe many years.')
