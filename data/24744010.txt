Trucking costs ~$.15 per short ton per mile as per Google. So shipping 270 tons over 1,000 miles works out to $40,000. And you&#x27;re using the thermal energy density of hydrogen, not the electrical energy density - as in, accounting for inefficiency of electricity generation. 1 GWh thermal is typically 500 MWh electrical for both fuel cells and turbines. The actual cost would be double that, given that most systems are 40-60% efficient. So if by &quot;without really impacting the cost vey much&quot; you mean &quot;increasing the cost by a factor of 5-9x&quot;, then sure. Moving large amounts of water is energy intensive, most infrastructure built to move water relies on gravity to move water from alpine reservoirs to lowlands. And unless you&#x27;re capturing the output of whatever you&#x27;re using to transform hydrogen back into electricity, then this is a recurring cost not a capital cost. This is easier to do for some implementations, like electrochemical cells, but much harder for gas turbines.')
