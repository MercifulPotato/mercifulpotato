I don&#x27;t think this generalizes to a large percentage of people, and it can easily go well past 2am. It&#x27;s less unreasonable to think people may still be working or responding to something at 8&#x2F;9 or even 10pm PST, but if that&#x27;s now 4&#x2F;5&#x2F;6am for someone in Europe, that&#x27;s pretty rough. You&#x27;ll also not be able to line up your meals very easily.')
