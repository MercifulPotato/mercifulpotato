The predatory behaviors seem to be focused on other companies, other competitors, not on consumers. Actually, seems they are treating consumers very well (often thru very low prices subsidized from profits elsewhere) to drive competitors out of business.<p>So from a consumer standpoint, perhaps it is good now, but we also don&#x27;t know how much better it could be if there were competition. From a competitor standpoint, it sure doesn&#x27;t sound fun. I have friends who sell things on Amazon and if they get too big, sometimes Amazon even squeezes them out of their business.<p>I wonder if antitrust law is to protect consumers or to protect other potential producers. Regardless, I imagine some of the idea behind it is that monopolies have relatively unchecked market power and while they can be good to consumers, they can also turn bad for consumers with little freedom for consumers to leave.')
