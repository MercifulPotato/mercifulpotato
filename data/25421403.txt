You claimed 370 people were PCR positive at the start of the test. Then you quoted from the paper results for seropositivity. That quote is clearly the source for your claim, since the numbers add up to 371. But seropositivity is not the same thing as PCR positivity.<p>And I don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;re pulling in the NAAT test from that quote. It is how the three people tested positive later, after being infected. It is not about the 370 people who were seropositive at the baseline.')
