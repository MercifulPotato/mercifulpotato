This is a really interesting perspectiveâ€”I think you&#x27;re saying, &quot;it&#x27;s all plain text, so there&#x27;s no advantage to using Markdown instead of docx&quot;.<p>I think others have an opposite view, but on the same grounds. The argument seems to be: it&#x27;s all plain text, so docx is overkill, so markdown is more technically efficient!<p>There&#x27;s some benefit to using the tool I know best (emacs, for me), so it&#x27;s nice to use a &quot;native&quot; format that also gives me my usual keybindings, macros, etc.<p>But there&#x27;s no doubt it just offloads the inefficiency to a different step of the process. I&#x27;m more comfortable with inputting text, but it requires post-hoc reformatting, and I&#x27;d have to use a different word processor for post-editor changes...<p>The &quot;markdown is a more efficient solution from a technical perspective&quot; argument doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of weight with me...the practical overhead of docx is minimal, so unless you prize technical purity over all else, I don&#x27;t think there _is_ a benefit.')
