Emails arrive filtered into separate folders in the same account, so I get all that whilst only paying for a single account (they&#x27;ll even host static sites for all those domains, though I currently use Netlify).<p>Always performant, excellent web UI for mail, contacts, calendar, and (optionally but included) DNS, and if they have occasional blips I have to say I&#x27;ve never noticed.<p>Far superior to GMail, which these days seems stale and slow (and possibly only gets away with it because it is ubiquitous enough to set the level of people&#x27;s expectations).')
