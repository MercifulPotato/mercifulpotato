I see that there&#x27;s a lot of excitement for it, but most excitement seems to come from data scientists who are heavier on the engineer side. For almost all of the rest of the data scientists I know, Python seems &quot;more than good enough&quot;.<p>Also to note, Julia has seen a rise over the last few years, but so has Python, its primary competitor in the data science field.')
