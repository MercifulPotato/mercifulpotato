The trade-offs of an implementation can lead to technical assets as well as technical debt. It&#x27;s just that most of the time the technical profit isn&#x27;t noticed as much as the technical debt.<p>And as with regular debt, the &quot;interest rate&quot; can also vary wildly. Some debt just sits there, doesn&#x27;t change much. The code is a mess, makes fixing bugs harder than it should be, but it doesn&#x27;t impact new work much.<p>Other debt is like a credit card, where you continue to pay a price every day, and it can severely affect your ability to implement new things.<p>Then again the same is true with technical assets. Make good choices and you can reap the benefits for a long time. Implementing new features can become 5 minute jobs rather than taking days.<p>Sometimes you&#x27;re aware that you&#x27;re about to swipe that technical credit card. Other times it can be an inadvertent decision, you went right instead of left while thinking of something else. That&#x27;s the tricky ones.')
