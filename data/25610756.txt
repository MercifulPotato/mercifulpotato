Maybe i am. Maybe i&#x27;d not really know nor understand if i was, or maybe i would see myself and think, yes, i am insane! But either way, if I&#x27;m insane or not, by your definition, or any definition, or not, I&#x27;m okay with it.<p>And i often consider if i might be deluded or psychotic. It&#x27;s definitely possible sometimes.<p>Delusions are just so compelling, and very flattering and soothing to the ego.<p>But right now, no i don&#x27;t believe myself to be, and i do believe what i say.<p>If that let&#x27;s you feel more or less credulous about my statements, i understand that, and yet neither your reaction nor interpretation is my responsibility, so i can&#x27;t help you with it, I feel sorry for you to say.<p>But if it makes it easier for you to hear my statements while believing I&#x27;m insane, i encourage you to continue to do that. I don&#x27;t want it to be hard for you. Please continue to make it easy on yourself, and have a great two zero two one.<p>Edit: your comment was downsided but i think it&#x27;s a great question and a very interesting thing to think about. It for me thinking might about other things, so I&#x27;ll add.<p>Sometimes I wonder why do I care so much about such and such a topic e.g politics or geopolitics or something like that and I have to admit sometimes I don&#x27;t really understand why I care so much about it, at first. so I think it could be useful for me to take a step back and go why do I feel so strongly about this? Cuz I don&#x27;t want to be an instrument of the will of some idea that I don&#x27;t understand, nor of someone who&#x27;s not me.')
