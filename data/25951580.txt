Roscomnadzor (same as FCC in US) was desperately trying to block Telegram by KGB (FSB) resolution, because Telegram did not obey to their orders to provide keys and it turned out into complete farce. During this endeavor as a side effect they blocked almost any service that was using AWS and&#x2F;or other cloud services, a lot many companies in Russia had been suffering from IT ifrastructure disruption including government institutions, yet Telegrams was up and running. And the most fannies thing was that almost all middle rank officials continued to use Telegram for their daily work and leasure. In the end Roscomnadzor &quot;silently&quot; quit their attempts. It was so humorous to follow the event. That was the first time in the modern history of Russia when govt completely failed while acting against their citizens. After that, Durov turned into real &quot;rock star&quot; here. :)')
