It&#x27;s not surprising that it was a pain to replicate on Linux your company&#x27;s work as a sole programmer.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean that Linux doesn&#x27;t support Kubernetes well. Linux is the primary target for k8s! It runs more efficiently and has better support than Kubernetes on Mac. Minikube has worked as a dev cluster on Linux long before Docker for Mac shipped a k8s dev cluster.<p>(I, too, have been involved with Kubernetes projects since the early days, and have built k8s tooling at fairly large companies.)')
