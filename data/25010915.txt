My children didn&#x27;t like being carried (I&#x27;m a shoulder carrying father now), but the knots at least where super easy. The knots don&#x27;t hold the weight, the cloth and the shoulders to. The knots mainly finish the excess cloth so there&#x27;s not much reason to be afraid that your child will fall due to a bad knot per se. The cloth will sag a lot before that.')
