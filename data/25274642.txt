Only a piece of DNA is copied at a time into RNA, like you would load only one program into memory and not the entire harddrive. The mechanism for where to start and stop is farily simple in simpler organisms - you look for a start and termination sequence (&quot;codon&quot;) (like ASCII control characters). In more complex organisms like multicellulars, this is more complicated.  \nThere are also other types of RNA that do other things.')
