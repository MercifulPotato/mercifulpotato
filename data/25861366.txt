Our own species probably isn&#x27;t all that far away from generating some variety of machine consciousness. I&#x27;d say give it a few hundred years at most.<p>Heck, this begs the question of why the hell would an intelligent alien species even send their meat bags into space, when they can just upload their consciousness into a machine and have it do their bidding, without any of the limitations of biological systems.')
