At a previous job, a common compliment during my quarterly review was that people thought I was very helpful and a joy to have around the office.<p>I am the type of person who is helpful to a fault though, and I sometimes end up neglecting myself and my responsibilities in order to help others and make sure they are happy. Later on in that job this tendency to always help others lead to burnout as I tried taking on too many responsibilities at once and spread myself too thin.<p>Nowadays I still try to be as helpful as possible, but I make sure to not spread myself too thin and take into account my own responsibilities and mental health when deciding to help someone. Even then the answer wont always be a solid no, but sometimes just asking if the issue can wait until I&#x27;m at a point in my current work where I can stop and help out.')
