It&#x27;s a docking station, and the whole setup works brilliantly with my 13&quot; Macbook. Productive workstation setup at home, super nimble laptop on the go.<p>Apparantly these M1 chips don&#x27;t support eGPUs and don&#x27;t even support two external monitors, let alone three. I know it&#x27;s asked a lot, but what&#x27;s &quot;Pro&quot; about that?<p>Completely negates any of the benefits of M1, which is a shame because I really wanted one.<p>edit: You know, if they don&#x27;t resolve this then the final round of Intel Macbooks with the non-butterfly keyboards are going to be the holy grail of laptops to a lot of people for a long time, just like the pre-butterfly ones with the ports still are.<p>Multiple external monitors, eGPUs and bootcamp... that&#x27;s a lot to lose, man.')
