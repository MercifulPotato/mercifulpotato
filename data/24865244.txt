The same transformations that WGSL compilers will apply. I&#x27;m unsure of what you mean by &quot;interoperability&quot;.<p>&gt; or the advantages of text formats that the web has benefitted from.<p>??? Nobody has ever enumerated these to me. Or told me why if these advantages are so great, why Apple has not advocated for a text-based formats for &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt;. Binary formats are widely becoming more standard on the web for all sorts of reasons (images, fonts, video, audio, even code in the form of WebAssembly, and Bloomberg&#x2F;Facebook&#x27;s JS AST proposal improved performance by removing parsing cost. MapBox ships its vectors in binary format. glTF is a binary format.), and even in the graphics space, the release of the new SPIR-V format over having to ingest GLSL is seen as one of the greatest advantages of Vulkan over OpenGL.<p>If you want a text format, take the text serialization of SPIR-V. It&#x27;s there, it&#x27;s standard, it exists.<p>But you won&#x27;t bother answering me, because every time you bring this up, we ask the same questions, repeat the same evidence, and you ignore us, preferring just to reply &quot;text is more webby&quot;.<p>Not to mention that you&#x27;re currently pressuring the WG to add new APIs to avoid the heavy front-end cost of Apple&#x27;s own MSL shader compiler.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gpuweb&#x2F;gpuweb&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1064" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gpuweb&#x2F;gpuweb&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1064</a>')
