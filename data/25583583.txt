I was talking about the relative danger of a vaccine. A plausible upper bound on the absolute risk is the Cutter incident. Covid is way above that. Even a shitty vaccine that occasionally kills people at a rate of 10 in 200,000, it would still be a better bet than COVID.<p>The people getting the Polio vaccine (children) were the general population of people at highest risk of death by polio. The same is true for the Covid vaccine, at least for the next few months. Both are mass vaccination campaigns.')
