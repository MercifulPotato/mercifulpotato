But I think in the real world it would break down quickly.<p>First problem: When do you credit the refund?<p>If you credit it right away, what happens if the customer subsequently loses the item?  Even assuming you can simply rebill them, you&#x27;ve still pissed off the new purchaser who was expecting that item to be available.<p>If you don&#x27;t issue the refund until the new buyer confirms receipt (which aligns some incentives of your returner) then what happens if it takes months to sell?  Defer too long and you&#x27;ve pissed off the old customer and effectively reneged on your return policy (not to mention forced them to store your item without compensation).<p>Next problem: How do you apportion blame if old customer says they sent it in good condition and new customer says it arrived damaged?  You have no way of knowing who&#x27;s right.  Do you just write it off?<p>My gut says you&#x27;ll run into more issues as you flesh this out.  e.g. The &quot;speediness&quot; of your brand will tarnish when customers drag their heels to ship things out (sorry, I&#x27;m on vacation, will have to wait until i get back).  Human nature will tempt people to &quot;borrow&quot; the item while they&#x27;re holding onto it for you.  If you thought inventory control was hard with a bunch of warehouses fully under your control, imagine what it&#x27;ll be like after you crowdsource it out to a bunch of consumers.<p>Amazon already let&#x27;s you just keep low-value items that cost more to ship back than they&#x27;re worth.  The upside of your idea to Amazon seems small, and I see so much opportunity for abuse.<p>If you think you can solve the challenges, maybe you can launch a decentralized inventory startup.  Would be worth a ton if you do manage to get it to work.')
