Who are all of these people? I&#x27;ve never heard of them. Is this a storm in a teacup, or is the implication of the article that this incident is a taste of what&#x27;s to come?<p>2. The story seems almost too conveniently negative towards Sojwal. As someone who&#x27;s well on the opposite side of radical intersectionality and radical feminism, this article feels written for people like me who will get outraged at the behaviors of the villain in the story. Makes me suspicious of actually having all of the facts and context here. Seems.. too easy?<p>3. Ironically, if the current trend continues, Sojwal will soon find herself in a lower intersectionality caste, and will herself be accused of taking space on platforms that are restricted to members of the BIPOC group. She, being an AA and a non-elite PoC, will not be invited.')
