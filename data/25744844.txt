So “still operating” is kind of pushing it (if it were really still operating, you’d see new content) <i>even though</i> major providers didn’t pull the plug.<p>As far as I can tell, The Pirate Bay is not relevant in 2020. If you want to watch Rick &amp; Morty season 1 without paying for it, go ahead and use The Pirate Bay.')
