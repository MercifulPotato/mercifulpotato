Item(by='GordonS', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608237905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25457440, text='ePrivacy document WP224 (&quot;Opinion 9&#x2F;2014 on the application of Directive 2002&#x2F;58&#x2F;EC to device fingerprinting&quot;) specifically discusses the use of fingerprinting and IP addresses for first-party analytics and states:<p>&quot;However, the Opinion also stated that currently there is no exemption to consent for cookies that are strictly limited to first party anonymised and aggregated statistical purposes. Therefore, first-party website analytics through device fingerprinting do not fall under the exemption defined in CRITERION A or B and consent of the user is required.&quot;<p>This seems quite clear that consent <i>is</i> required for any form of analytics where you can identify individual users.<p>Another commenter here mentioned that GitHub is only tracking individuals for 24 hours before the fingerprint changes. I would think that would probably qualify as being in the <i>spirit</i> of the ePrivacy directive, if not the letter of it.<p>Would be great if someone from GitHub could comment on the above? How are you handling this - do you maybe get consent as part of the terms you agree to when you signup? (which would mean not tracking anonymous users).')
