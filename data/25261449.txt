For instance, nobody is extremely sharp at tactics but severely lacking (human-understandable) strategy.<p>Engines will help you in opening and tactics, but not too much in the positional&#x2F;strategy game (they make good moves, but oftentimes it is just impossible for humans to understand them without very deep study, meaning they would never be casually played in an online game).<p>Another example, regarding cheating but only on the openings: even GM&#x27;s make mistakes during openings. If you play openings at that strength level but then you often lose won endgames it is clear to anybody who knows the game that you are cheating (because opening theory is much wider than the standard endgame theory).<p>Finally, since you are not at the level you pretend to be whilst cheating, it gets very very complicated for you to know what you can or cannot get away with.')
