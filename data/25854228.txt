What I can do is list all the services I know of which sell DRM-Free Audiobooks in the US:<p>• Libro.fm<p>• Downpour.com<p>• Audiobooksnow.com (Check for a &quot;Downloadable&quot; icon, a very small number of tiles without it have DRM).<p>• Google Play<p>I bounce between the first three of these regularly, based on price and availability. I&#x27;ve never actually used Google Play for audiobooks; they always seems to cost more.<p>Hopefully at least one of those has better offerings in the EU!')
