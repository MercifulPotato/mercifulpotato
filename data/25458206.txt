Rather than critiquing the designs, that effect seems to be the thing to look at.<p>Edit: found another article, which quoted Pais on what that effect is.<p>&gt; Mr. Tingley, do realize that my work culminates in the enablement of the Pais Effect (original physical concept). The Pais Effect comprises the generation of extremely high electromagnetic energy fluxes (and hence high local energy densities) generated by controlled motion of electrically charged matter (from solid to plasma states) subjected to accelerated vibration and&#x2F;or accelerated spin, via rapid acceleration transients.<p>&gt; Such high energy EM radiation can locally interact with the Vacuum Energy State (VES) - the VES being the Fifth State of Matter (Fifth Essence - Quintessence), in other words the fundamental structure (foundational framework), from which Everything else (Spacetime included) in our Quantum Reality, emerges.<p>&gt; The Engineering of the Pais Effect can give rise to the Enablement of Macroscopic Quantum Coherence, which if you have closely been following my work, you understand the importance of.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough to figure out if this guy is some modern Tesla or another kook.')
