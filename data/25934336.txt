Ie, if you run a startup and are bought out with an asset buyout, can you transfer the stack including the Elastic licensed software to the acquiring party (assuming in the interim elastic has ceased to offer new elastic licenses so they can&#x27;t get their own). Can you sell software built out on elastic licensed code and transfer the elastic license to the users so they can also use it? Or does everyone need to go back to elastic to get these licenses.<p>A lot of discussion about being open, but reading the details - seems far from open at first glance.')
