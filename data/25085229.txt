I based my &#x27;probably&#x27; on a few things -- it&#x27;s admittedly not strong:<p>- There was an American school about a lifetime ago that tried that strategy, and the principal claimed it worked fine.<p>- A general impression that before mass education it wasn&#x27;t uncommon for people who got schooling to start years older than our start, with no impression that they learned arithmetic any worse. E.g. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientiasocialis.lt&#x2F;pec&#x2F;files&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;vol57&#x2F;90-101.Pisano_Vol.57.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientiasocialis.lt&#x2F;pec&#x2F;files&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;vol57&#x2F;90-101.Pi...</a> &quot;In general the pupils began their arithmetical instruction at 10â€“11 and this\neducation prosecuted for two years.&quot;<p>- Piaget&#x27;s picture of stages of development (in my vague understanding) suggests that arithmetic beyond a very concrete level would be developmentally unnatural for younger kids, and more natural later. Apparently Montessori schools do better on this score?<p>- Unschoolers sometimes reach adulthood with less understanding of math than state-schoolers, but if the average is worse, I haven&#x27;t heard of it. Anecdotally they&#x27;re fine.<p>- Hate and ignorance of math is very widespread (I&#x27;ve read similar claims about average French people with their substantially different school system)<p>- This jibes with my general experience, having gone to school, etc.<p>- There&#x27;s not much reason to expect a claim this far from mainstream to have been carefully studied. Maybe it has been and refuted -- I just don&#x27;t very much respect the status quo and so I expect there are improvements that would &#x27;easy&#x27; except for the obstacle that it&#x27;s very hard to meaningfully change the system. And this strikes me as a plausible (though unambitious) one.')
