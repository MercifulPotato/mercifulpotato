If we don&#x27;t stop squabbling about native look and feel, we will get no native applications at all.<p>Well, unless you&#x27;re talking open source tools and&#x2F;or everythign within the sphere of desktop productivity . Then invariably your &quot;consumer&quot; desktop apps of choice are some mixture of GTK2&#x2F;3, Qt, Swing, WxWidgets......<p>Granted, the different GUI libraries and applications using them tend to have _slight_ inconsistencies (GNOME 3 &#x2F; GTK3 window titles versus everything else&#x27;s window titles), but for the most part they&#x27;re consistently themed, they render quickly, they behave the same way with the clipboard, mouse interactions, element focusing, keyboard shortcuts, accessibility functions......<p>So I have open right now LibreOffice Writer, Firefox, Evolution, many gnome-terminals, Transmission BT client, GNOME Files, GNOME Boxes... all of which look the same and there&#x27;s no cognitive load spent switching between them, because they behave the same and look the same.<p>I can open up Inkscape and GIMP and Evince and KeePassXC and VLC and retain that experience.<p>Meanwhile, whilst still my IDE of choice, my PyCharm (so, JetBrains) IDE windows do whatever the hell they want (STOP STEALING FOCUS!!!), glitch out rendering, look completely different.   And Spotify - gets all its points docked just for how it handles tabbing through UI elements. (&quot;No, I don&#x27;t want to tab through ALL of the Discover page, I want tab to cycle through the different UI elements, preferably not taking a painfully long time to reach &quot;search&quot;.... Ugh fine, CONTRIBUTE TO MY CARPAL TUNNEL THEN!!!)<p>&quot;Native&quot; (as in, &quot;consistent experience across the whole suite of desktop applications&quot;) toolkits still make it way easier for _developers_ to design applications consistent with the rest of the system.<p>Android and iOS UI toolkits serve same useful purpose. I tend to find that apps that are just a reactive web framework in a fullscreen frame are pretty painful to use. Like, wtf are you doing when I hit back!??? Why is this full screen splash form with two text boxes SCROLLING when I touch it???<p>tl;dr of my rant: Goddamn people stop trying to make your applications look the same on every device and let me use it how I like on MY device, for the same of a) my wrists and b) my attention deficit brain')
