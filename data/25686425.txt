Immediately afterwards the frequency reaches that threshold again, so I assume those measurements were working as planned.<p>Below 49Hz larger consumers would be cut off in steps of ~10% of the network load. AFAIK this includes large industrial consumers who are legally required to have the equipment in place to allow for that.')
