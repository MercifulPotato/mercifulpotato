I can play rapid, noodling solos on a &quot;real&quot; sized keyboard for fifteen minutes, but my MicroKorg XL+, which I only bought because I thought it was significantly larger than the Microkorg (I have since learned to recognize relative length of keys in pictures), is a physical pain to solo on in my style because the keys are closer together. I don&#x27;t know why this is; intuitively it should not be. But it is, at least for me. Would anyone care to explain?')
