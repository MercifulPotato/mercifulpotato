Basically, my ability to match my teams&#x27; productivity with corporate goals.<p>Which lines up with nradov&#x27;s comment about the smallest useful unit for measuring productivity is the typical self-contained development team.  Attempting to determine if Bob in TeamA is more productive than Cindy on TeamB doesn&#x27;t generally result in any actionable information.  What matters (from a senior leadership perspective) is can TeamA or TeamB build the things that need to be built in a timeframe that&#x27;s acceptable to stakeholders.<p>As a manager, if I feel like Bob or Cindy are unproductive, then I need to figure out why.  And LoC or number of commits isn&#x27;t going to tell me that.  Possibly the number of defects found in QA, but even that isn&#x27;t perfect.')
