Performance per watt has been increasing every year for a long time and continues to do so [1].  So temperature is really just a design choice.  One example, pick a performance get a power.  Once you have a power, pick the mechanical system, get a temperature.  It’s all just trade offs.  If performance and enclosure was held constant over time then temperatures would go down, but few want that.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1911.11313.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1911.11313.pdf</a>  See figure 5')
