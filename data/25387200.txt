The IBM-sourced G5 was a power hog that was clearly not meant to be a consumer CPU.<p>The first computer I owned was a G4 Power Mac, I ordered with the student discount the day after it was announced.  I got the middle 400MHz version.  Apple was forced to abandon the high-end 450MHz version shortly after launch.<p>If Motorola could have manufactured the G4 according to plan, Apple probably never would have switched to Intel.')
