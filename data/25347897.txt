It does go against the common sentiment here that open everything is always better. Well somebody will improve it themselves, right? So why hasn&#x27;t anybody improved the open standard Bluetooth yet to meet those same standards of quality?<p>I think lately openness is massively overrated. This stuff is hard to get right, and it takes a lot of high-end hardware and tight collaboration between full-time engineers to do it. Random people working part-time in their garages and collaborating over Github will never do it. It works sort of okay for a few particular types of projects, but fails massively for many others, particularly things involving hardware. Only big corps can manage the budget and coordination required to do it right, and they&#x27;ll only do it if it&#x27;s closed, so they know they&#x27;ll get the revenue from customers who want it done right.')
