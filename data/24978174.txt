You are judging people by their output, not by their tools, and that&#x27;s just fine.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people produce absolute miracles using fairly archaic tools showing a very deep level of understanding of both the problem and the domain. Forcing them into some kind of straightjacket to use &#x27;modern tools&#x27; would be the same as taking Itzhak Perlman&#x27;s Soil Stradivarius away to force him to play on an electric violin just to get with the times.')
