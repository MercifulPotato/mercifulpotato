And people like me are wasting most of their energy building wealth for other people.<p>So building a product or service seems like a primary way to get control of my life and stop putting all of my effort to benefit someone else.<p>The weekend is usually the only opportunity to do it.<p>If I could quit my job and have someone give me a bunch of seed money for my project then I would. That&#x27;s not going to happen.  I don&#x27;t have the connections or charisma and even if I had it, they are just research ideas right now.<p>So for me it&#x27;s very sane to spend time on the weekends working on my project and I do feel guilty when I don&#x27;t put enough time into it.  Because I just know that I need to build my own thing if I am going to have financial security.')
