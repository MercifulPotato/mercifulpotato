They&#x27;re not convenient or useful for travel because they&#x27;re too big. They&#x27;re not &quot;best audio quality&quot;, because that&#x27;s been done at lower price points. Spatial audio and ANC? Already solved, better, by AirPods Pro, at half the price. They&#x27;re not even usable for critical listening or gaming because of Bluetooth.<p>So what are they for? Fashion? (Nothing wrong with that, but I&#x27;m sure as hell not going to spend $550 for it.)<p>[1] Siri can&#x27;t understand me and it false triggers constantly.<p>[2] It wasn&#x27;t even like, &quot;hey its good but there are better speakers&quot;. They <i>sounded like a cheap plastic box</i>. They were better than my $100 Google Home. They&#x27;re worse than the $120 soundbar I put on a TV. It&#x27;s a low bar.')
