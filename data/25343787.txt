Common Lisp is a language with a lot of warts, sure, but typical Common Lisp code is way, way, way more tasteful than typical Clojure code.<p>We like our multiparadigmness, thank you very much.  That includes being able to mutate things.  We also like that the language is stable, and that means no changes to the spec, and that means it won&#x27;t cover everything.  That&#x27;s OK, because our spec covers more than enough.  We have less stable libraries and implementation-specific interfaces to cover the rest.  We are still pretty conservative with those, too.<p>Clojure doesn&#x27;t have a spec at all (it has documentation for the single implementation; it seems to have another implementation which is even more a toy since no real Clojure programs can run on it, because JVM is part of Clojure, really...) and once things are documented they either stick forever or break.  I wouldn&#x27;t say Clojure has warts; it has massive oozing injuries that keep on spreading indefinitely.<p>So yeah, we&#x27;d rather live with the warts from the 90s, the 80s, the 70s, and the 60s.  We like our tradition, and we like our programs not breaking.  We have a stable base that we can build 2020, 2030, 2040 stuff on.')
