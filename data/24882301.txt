People stayed at home and stopped traveling. The period after which you describe is actually the period in which travel restrictions was relaxed, and people became _less_ careful.<p>More formally, the decline after mid April was probably due to widespread immunity and weather effects. That’s only my conclusion, but based on the following:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se&#x2F;publicerat-material&#x2F;publikationsarkiv&#x2F;e&#x2F;estimates-of-the-peak-day-and-the-number-of-infected-individuals-during-the-covid-19-outbreak-in-the-stockholm-region-sweden-february--april-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se&#x2F;publicerat-material&#x2F;publ...</a> - A model releases mid april bases on march data which accurately placed the peak around mid april. It’s a standard SEIR model, so it predicts that it tapers off only based on population immunity.\n * <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ki.se&#x2F;immunity-to-covid-19-is-probably-higher-than-tests-have-shown" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ki.se&#x2F;immunity-to-covid-19-is-probably-higher-t...</a> - Study showing much higher incidence of T-cell immunity in Stockholm than the incidence of individuals with anti bodies, indicating that the true population immunity is much higher than what anti body studies will show\n * <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;369&#x2F;6505&#x2F;846" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;369&#x2F;6505&#x2F;846</a> - Another mathematical modeling study, based loosely on Stockholm dynamics, which demonstrates that hers immunity thresholds may be much lower when accounting for social stratification. In particular, Sweden asked ages 70+ to isolate themselves, so it’s likely the case that immunity rates are much lower in that group.\n * Finally, warm weather surely helped drive down the spread.')
