I once worked somewhere that used Sentry heavily (liked it a great deal, it was pretty important to us). We had about a hundred projects and were encountering quota problems, the worst of which were usually from misbehaving queue workers on staging or perf the would consume our entire event budget if left unchecked. If we didn&#x27;t shut it off in time we&#x27;d end up losing meaningful prod events.<p>Our solution was to switch to a YAML based config for rate limits and per project quotas. This would ensure every project was capped, central prod services were allocated more events like they deserved, etc. Sentry staff sent us a helpful starter script for utilizing their project configuration REST API. It was written in Ruby.')
