Maybe you do have friends you can go hang out with, but they&#x27;re all probably like you... powerless kids also looking for something to do.<p>Part of what is neat about computers, neat about streaming, is that the computer doesn&#x27;t care. You can stream. You can make movies. You can create, be creative, you can share. You can learn better about yourself &amp; what you can do. You can learn what isn&#x27;t working, what isn&#x27;t good. And you can decide which of those things you want to fix, adjust, change, &amp; make better. Computers, general purpose computers, will let you refine &amp; iterate &amp; alter &amp; change, as far down the rabbit hole as you dare to go.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a far cry to streaming, ok maybe, to playing games online on camera, but it&#x27;s in the same world of creativity, of creating. It starts the same way. It lets you develop yourself in similar ways. Limited only by how far &amp; weird you are willing &amp; able to take it, by your willingness to explore where you might go.')
