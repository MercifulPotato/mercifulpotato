It&#x27;s a terrible developer experience for anything but targeting Apple&#x27;s platforms in the way you want to (meaning writing Swift, using their frameworks, and their devtools, and keeping your code base small to keep their devtools functional, and never caring about that code running on a different OS).<p>Compare to Visual Studio, which also only runs on Windows, yet is a pretty damn good developer experience and not a nightmare to support for cross platform projects of late.')
