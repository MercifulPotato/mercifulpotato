People have drifted apart, there is a lot of general distrust in societies, I cannot see how this level of distrust can be mitigated.<p>Whoever is on the receiving end of the &quot;lid&quot;, will try to find another way of communication. There is a strong desire in humans not to be silenced.<p>Without a desire to compare, my anecdote: I grew up in Communist Czechoslovakia; even though the state did its best to control communications among people, using outright force, they failed and everyone knew the latest gossip about the apparatchiks. Americans are probably not as competent in muzzling their opponents, plus openly disavowing the idea of free speech will make them internally unhappy. You yourself say that you&#x27;d rather have the opposite situation.')
