I did this a couple years back, with 75 keys or so. With the diodes on each key, it was about 225 solder joints plus whatever extra to land the matrix leads on the microcontroller.<p>Good variety, too. Some were wire-to-wire joints, others were wire wrapped around post, and a few where through-hole joints.<p>If I look at the underside of that keyboard, I can tell where I started and where I finished by how clean the solder joints look :)')
