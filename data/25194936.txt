It&#x27;s <i>much</i> easier to write a Dockerfile than to write something with Nix. You can get much stronger benefits from Nix than from a Dockerfile.. but, most of which you don&#x27;t really need all the time.<p>My impression is the other solutions are quick-ish hacks to solve problems that come from (and building upon) the complexities of systems built using quick-ish hacks. Nix feels like a more elegant solution, but it&#x27;s also different enough that it&#x27;s got a steep learning curve for anything harder than &quot;install foo&quot;.')
