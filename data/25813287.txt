Item(by='brixie', descendants=None, kids=[25814173], score=None, time=1610907715, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25812395, text='I haven&#x27;t tried Kakoune, so I&#x27;m not really qualified to speak about its merits or demerits. From a place of limited knowledge, I see nothing wrong with it, and want to reiterate that it seems really interesting and worth keeping an eye on.<p>To add some nuance to my earlier comment: I don&#x27;t really worry about the existence of Kakoune (or $OPEN_SOURCE_SOFTWARE_PROJECT) in a trivial sense; we&#x27;ll always be able to find a copy somewhere and compile it from source, modify it, etc. That being said, I think one of the advantages of a large&#x2F;durable ecosystem is that it lets me worry less about problems I don&#x27;t yet have. I use (neo)vim daily, but there are certainly still lots of ways I can improve my workflow. Inevitably I&#x27;ll run into something that goes wrong or doesn&#x27;t work like I want it to, and a larger and more active community makes it more likely that someone else has already figured out how to fix it.<p>The (relatively small) differences in keybindings are also worth a mention, but I think the vims have a bit of an unfair advantage here; IMO learning vim keybindings is almost unquestionably a good investment because you&#x27;ll find them everywhere.<p>&gt; Kakoune just feels better integrated with the environment<p>Out of curiosity, is this an argument for enjoyment or productivity? :) (Either is a fine answer! I frankly can&#x27;t measure the latter so my personal usage of vim is probably motivated by the former.)')
