My wife and I did this and flew first class with two dogs. There is an element of &quot;you cant ask me why I need this animal&quot; from the ADA.<p>Then again, I had a therapist who vouched for this and actually do have mental health problems that my Shepherd without a doubt helps me with.<p>No way in hell I am putting the dogs in the cargo hold.
