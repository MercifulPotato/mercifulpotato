India did enough testing. India&#x27;s positivity rate was almost always below 10%. Now it&#x27;s even less than 1%. India has made testing fast, cheap, and easy to access.<p>Also, it doesn&#x27;t matter if india has fewer hospital beds, if those beds are empty. Hospitals beds are empty, and our morgues aren&#x27;t overflowing (like how milan or nyc in March did). It is a free country with open media. Nobody is suppressing covid cases.<p>There are many reasons it could happen like this. Cross immunity. Younger demographics. Smaller groups (most indians live in rural villages). Diet. Weather. Etc.<p>It&#x27;s not strange that delhi and bangalore have more cases. They are also denser cities with more people. It&#x27;s just like how nyc and Los Angeles have more cases than say indianapolis or santa Cruz.')
