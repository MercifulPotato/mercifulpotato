Guy insisted over and over and over. Ended up in the store opposite the mall, where Good Salesman approaches as I walk in:<p>-I want a new TV.<p>-I have this great Samsung model.<p>-I hate Samsung.<p>-I have this great LG model!<p>Funny thing, the that TV came with webOS, which after being bought and sold over a few times, ended up at LG. It works pretty well, never had an issue with it.')
