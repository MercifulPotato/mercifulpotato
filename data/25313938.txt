Only place I know where I can find other people who agree that today&#x27;s use of Javascript, 9 times out of 10, amounts to a nusiance.<p>The show&#x2F;hide design pattern is annoying, IMO.  Should be an accessibility violation; cannot tab through it.<p>I guess thats why I use a text-only browser.  Avoids all the Javscript nonsense, not to mention the next CSS trick du jour.')
