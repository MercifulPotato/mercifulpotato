We never had it so good for so long. War seems such a distant, incomprehensible thing anyone can hardly grasp. We get a little bit excited and shocked when we see reports from Ukraine or Balkans back in the day, but that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s all somewhere out there,not in my neighborhood. And long,pieceful periods bring out all sorts of cretins who, otherwise, would be put in place at the very beginning but instead being given platforms,funds,and other resources to spread division, misinformation,and drive some random agendas.<p>It is also very hard to grasp that a war can start just like that, so people tend to dismiss clues too: &#x27;Nah, they won&#x27;t do it.&#x27;')
