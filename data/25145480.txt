Item(by='oh_sigh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605752376, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25145444, text='Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a private individual who thinks the world would love a book on robot kittens. The author I want to write the book says she will do it for $1M. But I don&#x27;t have $1M to pay her. So we both agree that I will pay her some lesser amount, say $100,000, and then give her $1 for every book I sell. She&#x27;s hoping I will sell more than 900,000 books, and I&#x27;m also hoping that. What exactly is unethical about that? How is that any less ethical than an author selling their own book directly, or selling their book wholesale to some other party (who then sells the book)?')
