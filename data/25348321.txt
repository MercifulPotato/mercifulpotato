Most of those risks are interpersonal in nature. You run the risk of offending people when you tell them they can do better than they currently are. You’re essentially calling them out for not working hard enough, or having wrong assumptions, or any of the other normal human failings that everyone is subject to. If a leader doesn’t call those things or then the whole team slips and backslides until all progress stops. Doing the right thing as a leader often earns you the title of asshole and you have to be ok with that. It isn’t carte blanche to be petty and cruel for no good reason though, your actions should reflect the needs of the project not your own whims.')
