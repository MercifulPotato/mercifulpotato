Just require people to be explicit about what the burger&#x2F;sausage&#x2F;cheese-like thing is made of and that&#x27;s all, surely?<p>I suspect the cultural situation around food in other EU states might present a different picture though. France clearly has some powerful forces feeling very strongly about this, but I do think MEPs should reject any argument that comes purely from the meat industry&#x27;s commercial demands.')
