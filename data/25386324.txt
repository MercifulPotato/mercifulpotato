I was called a Systems Analyst, but what I did was write a lot of Cobol code. Many years later, I wrote a paper about a novel data structure that could be used for what is called &quot;The Balance Line Algorithm&quot;. I illustrated the use of this data structure with some Cobol. That was the last time I even thought about Cobol until I came across a citation to my paper. In excitement at being cited, I looked at the reference in the citing paper. Imagine my disappointment when I read the citation: &quot;[X]showed that this can even be done in Cobol&quot;.')
