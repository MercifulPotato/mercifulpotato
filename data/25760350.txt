You can go through all steps and they let you download all fineprint documents on the second last page.<p>The base coverage document is for all companies you can imagine. There&#x27;s lines about recycling toxic waste, which employees of your company fire brigade are covered, requirements for boat licenses when renting, subsidaries. Still good to have a read through. As with all insurances it&#x27;s page upon pages what isn&#x27;t covered.<p>Then Hiscox has multiple modules on top. Cyber insurance of two levels (if your data is taken ransom or a virus causes major destruction). Net IT which sounds like it covers computer and server outages but then the fineprint says anything outside your company (e.g. DNS down, hosting company down) isn&#x27;t covered.<p>It&#x27;s possible the second broker clicked every option in the tool and has a higher commission. By default US&amp;Canada legal costs are excluded, maybe the second broker added a module specifically to covert those, too.<p>Key taks away for me was that many mistakes are covered. Once you promise something to a customer&#x2F;client, be it a feature, deadline or SLA and you can&#x27;t keep that promise then that&#x27;s not covered.')
