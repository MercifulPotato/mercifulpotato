There are real devs with extreme TDD zealotry. It&#x27;s very possible that the author has worked with such devs, and I see no reason to doubt his experience. Your use of the word &quot;strawman&quot; above, doesn&#x27;t magically make such devs which push TDD with zealotry as some silver bullet solution not exist.<p>The only reasonable reading of your point then is that those devs are not enough to justify the phrase &quot;frail little minds&quot;. It would take some far more extreme, non-existent in the world, level of TDD zealotry (what you call a &quot;strawman TDD position&quot;) to justify sthe use of a phrase.<p>But that&#x27;s just you setting an arbitrary criterium. Which neither the author, nor I share. I&#x27;m fine with using the term &quot;frail little minds&quot; for people with real-world levels of TDD zealotry. I furthermore understand that it&#x27;s just a phrase used by the author to refer to devs that can&#x27;t get over their (real world level) TDD zealotry, that it doesn&#x27;t imply anything about them otherwise, and that it&#x27;s not a big fucking deal.<p>&gt;<i>See how that’s not dehumanizing?</i><p>No, I fail to see how the authors turn of phrase was dehumanizing. I leave such characterization to actually dehumanizing things, for example racism.')
