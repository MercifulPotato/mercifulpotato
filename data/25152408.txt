I would click on one specific ad, and it&#x27;d link to the one right above it. Also I tried highlighting text but again, a similar issue, it&#x27;d highlight like a paragraph above where I was. When I just allowed all javascript on the page though it worked fine.<p>Seems a little too javascript heavy imo.')
