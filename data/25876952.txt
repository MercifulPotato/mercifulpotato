Even though I know more people are thinking about&#x2F;struggling with stress, its good to read others assessment on it.<p>When covid came around and I started working from home I realized how much stress I had at the office. For at least the last 2 to 3 years I would get these huge headaches which would completely disable me and completely drain my energy. I was convinced that it was purely physical for the longest time. I did yoga, worked out, when to chiropractor, ... nothing really helped. I ended up at a physiotherapist with a lot of experience, who was able to look beyond the physical. After having yet another huge headache during my work week I discussed this with her, we were looking for the what could have stressed me. It was an email.<p>I was working on one project that I needed to finish to continue the work of my team when an email came in about another project I had been pushing away for a while. This email reminding me of that project stressed me so much that it completely disabled me.<p>I still regularly have these headaches, but now I can start thinking to myself, what stresses me here? And I can focus on fixing those issues. Most of these issues aren&#x27;t just an easy fix, especially now, but its helping me. I&#x27;m helping me, I&#x27;m listening to my body.<p>Also related to the topic of stress and its consequences is When The Body Says No by Dr. Gabor Mate [1]. He did a few talks on the subject, you can find them on Youtube [2].<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drgabormate.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;when-the-body-says-no&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drgabormate.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;when-the-body-says-no&#x2F;</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;results?search_query=when+the+body+says+no" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;results?search_query=when+the+body+s...</a>')
