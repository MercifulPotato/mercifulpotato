FWIW this is kind of the origin story for Mylar &quot;paper tape&quot; as well. When paper tape started being used for controlling machine tools (the NC in CNC), the paper tape would not hold up well in a shop. It could get grease or water on it which would compromise its integrity and then it would tear. So a &quot;stronger&quot; paper tape was created but it had to be compatible with older paper tape reader&#x2F;punches. It was great stuff.')
