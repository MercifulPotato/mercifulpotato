And you also have the right to call a politician corrupt if you have a reason to believe that they are.<p>For example, I know that calling our former finance minister a corrupt self-serving asshole is not going to get me into trouble because there have been multiple news reports about him taking bribes.<p>I think for Americans it&#x27;s just hard to believe that we don&#x27;t protect made up lies as &quot;free speech&quot; around here.')
