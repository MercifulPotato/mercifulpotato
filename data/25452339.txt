CentOS Stream is spiritually always the next <i>minor</i> release of RHEL.<p>Unless you&#x27;re the kind of person who pinned to a specific minor version of CentOS (which isn&#x27;t the default and not supported for very long) you can use CentOS Stream exactly the same as you currently are and it will be a strict improvement for you. Bugfixes, security updates, and new features will come to you before they&#x27;re either batched for release in the next minor version of RHEL or back-ported to the current supported releases.')
