I&#x27;m not a big fan of militant vegetarianism&#x2F;veganism. I think it creates a barrier to entry. It&#x27;s one of the reasons that a lot of products now describe themselves as &#x27;plant-based&#x27; rather than vegan.<p>As someone who grew up vegetarian, things have changed drastically in the last 30 years. I grew up eating some truly niche meat-replacement products[1][2].<p>Things like &#x27;Impossible Burgers&#x27; and &#x27;Beyond Meat&#x27; have changed the experience significantly. There is still a long way to go, and it&#x27;s not just about taste, but also nutrition.
