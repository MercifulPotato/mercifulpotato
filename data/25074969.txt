It must have been something you were considering. I&#x27;d be curious to hear why this was decided against?</i><p>I&#x27;m actually not sure. I&#x27;ll check with the team. (The timing of the survey was coincidental, though -- we&#x27;ve been working on making our Billing pricing consistent since the start of the year.)<p>&gt; <i>To be honest, none of the new Billing features are relevant to us. We&#x27;d much rather have new features gated, like customer portal is, than paying 0.5% for features we never intend to use.</i><p>We seriously considered that. It gets pretty complicated (and error prone), though, with the number of different code paths that have to be maintained. The fact that such a large fraction of customers we reached out to directly <i>were</i> willing to pay for a more full-featured Billing (mostly on the basis of competitors being significantly more expensive) made us eventually conclude that it wasn&#x27;t worth the complexity of having two adjacent versions of the product.')
