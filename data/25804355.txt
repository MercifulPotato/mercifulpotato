I’ve been doing golang and c&#x2F;c++ on it and everything is buttery smooth. Few hiccups in the beginning with Rosetta but making sure I just run terminal with it ticked on makes everything fine. Once the Firefox M1 support came, I was very pleased. Everything is snappy, quiet, and light. I’d much rather trade in my mid-2019 16” rmbp for another of these at home. Battery life is amazing. 16gb hasn’t been an issue for me ever; it makes me actually question if the OS is just better at managing memory more recently; that being said I don’t do any AV workloads which would necessitate more RAM over programming tasks.<p>I am wanting to get virtualbox running though')
