Maybe switch from ethernet to wifi and observe the kinds of popups you get.<p>Another method, though hard to associate with specific processes, would be to run tcpdump -i &lt;interface&gt;.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s more useful to run tcpdump and do a capture, then play it back later because DNS lookups by tcpdump itself make it more chatty than it should be.  You could also run it with -n but you get less information.')
