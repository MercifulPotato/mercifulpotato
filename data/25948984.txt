Assumptions like that some piece of code won&#x27;t be transformed by a macro, that reasonably looking code like `a.b` doesn&#x27;t have side effects, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s impossible, but that 1% (or 5%, 10%, ???% depending on how the project is structured and whether it uses a lot of side-effects or dynamic properties) can be enough make your program crash if the assumption turns out to be wrong.<p>Another example that you could go for, is can you determine whether a property of an object is used or not. If you have a language like JavaScript where you can do `object[propertyName]`, that turns out to be very hard. In a pure functional language, that is comparatively pretty straightforward to detect.')
