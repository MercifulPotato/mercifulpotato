The Civil War in the U.S. had almost all of its Confederate soldiers come from the U.S. Army.  The current leadership corps in the U.S. military is disproportionately Southern and conservative.  They&#x27;re not going to be going against their countrymen if it came to that, and no one is going to be nuking their own cities.')
