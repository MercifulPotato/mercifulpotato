Why go into abstraction if your project is not complex?<p>It seems developers believe that going into higher abstraction is like using analogies, they think it&#x27;s like using a new form of language so that other developers might understand what they&#x27;re doing.<p>Of course there is a minimum of code readability, reusability and maintainability, but in the end, a computer is best as looping linear data.')
