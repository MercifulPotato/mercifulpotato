Meetings after meetings, even formally selected committees. There are meetings to decide who has the authority to select the members for the committee to make a decision about which decisions need to be formally decided. I wish I was kidding.<p>The worse part of it all is that each step, superficially at least, seems so... reasonable. It&#x27;s not like they do crazy or stupid things! On the contrary, everything is decided by big groups of perfectly reasonable people.<p>Yet... the product is failure. Expensive, public, clearly avoidable, clearly wrong, and predictably faulty.<p>From the outside, it would be hilarious if it wasn&#x27;t <i>our money</i> they were wasting. From the inside it&#x27;s weirdly depressing, know that that no man has the power to right the ship, that it&#x27;s headed towards the jagged rocks, and everyone with their hand on the tiller is convinced that they&#x27;re all doing the right thing at every turn.')
