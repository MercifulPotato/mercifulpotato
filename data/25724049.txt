I wish banks would do something useful. they don&#x27;t. seems like they won&#x27;t. this guy deserves nothing but choking society by these narrow narrow deciders, these enablers of basic functions opting out... grossly imbalanced &amp; disgusting that this is such a death knell, that events like this are catastrophic. coproations should not have such a chokehold on basic society.')
