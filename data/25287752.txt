Talking about &quot;talent&quot; in this context is almost always down-playing the work that&#x27;s gone into it.<p>The number of people who genuinely have talent in this sort of thing is very, very small.  For the vast majority it&#x27;s a willingness to work on it, and a good teacher. You <i>can</i> be an auto-didact, but that&#x27;s then an additional skill.<p>Almost anyone can learn 3, can learn Mills Mess, can learn the basics of 4, and get learn a few dozen 3 ball tricks and patterns.<p>Getting to 5 requires significant dedication, but the reason most people don&#x27;t do it is because they don&#x27;t invest the time required.<p>Talent isn&#x27;t a myth, but it&#x27;s seriously over-rated, and usually just an excuse for not putting in the work. It doesn&#x27;t need an excuse -- if you don&#x27;t want to put in the work then don&#x27;t.<p>But it&#x27;s almost invariably not a lack of talent.')
