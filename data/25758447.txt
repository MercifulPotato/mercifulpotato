So people know something first hand, completely apart from &quot;journalism and social media&quot;.<p>At this point, the people I know who are on the right seem to be basically &quot;waiting for the rapture&quot;, i.e. when the global conspiracy of literally everyone in the world against Trump will be revealed. While denying that they are a fan of the President, but both sides are criminal and bad, etc.<p>Discussing current events ends up being like watching Clint Eastwood argue with a chair. It clearly isn&#x27;t fun for them, nor are they having any real dialogue. So it feels bad, and you try not to talk about politics any more.<p>I tried repeatedly with someone I know to propose that, if you don&#x27;t trust anything in the &quot;MSM&quot;, why don&#x27;t you read the documents that are making news, the primary source when it&#x27;s easily available? I rephrased it three times or so and it didn&#x27;t stop the rant.<p>And I&#x27;m talking about someone who is really not that dumb, has a decent job, and is fine to talk to on other things than politics. But I just can&#x27;t envision what a &quot;serious effort&quot; to break through would even look like.')
