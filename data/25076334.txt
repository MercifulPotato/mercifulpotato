Here&#x27;s why:<p>You&#x27;ve edited your post at least four times. Three of those times was when I <i>was</i> trying to offer a counter-argument. The problem was, you kept changing yours. I&#x27;m honestly not sure what you believe, both because you changed it so many times, but also because you haven&#x27;t defined your terms (<i>e.g.</i> <i>whose</i> freedom?). Finally, you make some bold claims, but you don&#x27;t really support those claims with anything I find credible.<p>In any case, the &#x27;security&#x27; argument (and the associated &#x27;reputation&#x27; argument you made in one your iterations) rings particularly hollow with me since Apple itself has already had—for decades—great success with a platform that is reasonably secure and relatively free compared to iOS: the Mac.')
