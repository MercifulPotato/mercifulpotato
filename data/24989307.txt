So you do have the option of paid tiers.<p>We don&#x27;t need to resort to paid services.  This is all about convenience.<p>As I&#x27;ve said, services like GitLab already provide container registry services, and we are also free to operate our own custom container registry services. Docker Hub is only used to source reference images such as Ubuntu, postgres, rabbitmq, traefik, etc etc etc.  We can simply point to a different provider to continue accessing those.  Even if these projects continue to use Docker Hub then if we stick with stable releases then we can simply point to a different container registry service, even one managed by us.<p>The main point is that Docker Hub ceased to be a reliable provider.  Thus, we plan accordingly.')
