Perhaps the difference between &quot;re-mapping&quot; the function:<p><pre><code>    f(x_1)=y_2\n</code></pre>\nand &quot;re-mapping&quot; the value:<p><pre><code>    x=42+2\n</code></pre>\nHow is the former different than the latter? And by what mechanism is the former achieved? I understand what you are saying, but <i>how</i> does one simply &quot;change this same function&quot;? Redefine it?<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not suggesting you are incorrect. I just don&#x27;t fully understand what you are getting at.')
