Item(by='pqb', descendants=None, kids=[25444632], score=None, time=1608134535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25442620, text='&gt; I have found that a lot of people _think_ Ubuntu is safe&#x2F;stable.<p>As a 10+ years long user of Ubuntu and its derivatives (currently Pop_OS!) I would say I know it is stable. Ubuntu still feels like a polished Debian for a typical computer user, which has many of pre-configuration made that non-techies and not-that-much-knowledgable persons will love. I don&#x27;t like many decision they have made, e.g. favouring snap over apt, complete lack of a proper GUI for managing installed software&#x2F;packages, sometimes missing packages that are on Debian but not on Ubuntu (though, the deb file can be downloaded and installed with a single command). After tremendous work done by GNOME users to tweak gnome-shell I have never had a freeze &#x2F; hang up since three years on Ubuntu. I am also happy having recent drivers from Nvidia that works good enough to also never see any problem in 5+ year history related to GPU card. I also didn&#x27;t have a problem to install drivers for my printer and scanner, which have a dedicated installer (deb file). I am just a happy user.<p>Calling kernel for a reason Ubuntu <i>feels stable</i> is wrong I think. I have tried many times Arch and I had many occasions to be not very convinced to its &quot;stability&quot;. The most annoying issue I had on Arch was related to sound - when I was changing volume in Spotify client it was changing the system volume. Imagine the situation when you had a headphones with a volume level set at 3-4% and you have increased it by 20-50%, a nightmare for ears and hearth. After that &quot;feature&quot; I have completely removed Arch from my disk and I am not looking back to it nor other rolling distro.<p>These days I also don&#x27;t see any unique selling point that Arch had in the past. It is still known for a best documentation and the most recent software. During last 2-3 years I don&#x27;t remember if I had been complaining on outdated software in Ubuntu. If I would do then there are awesome projects like flatpak, xbps[0] or nix[1] that can be installed without changing my OS and they provide everything what I probably can win using Arch.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voidlinux.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voidlinux.org&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nixos.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nixos.org&#x2F;</a>')
