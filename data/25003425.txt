I am arguing that krapp&#x27;s claim (that &quot;people in general have not lost trust in the system&quot;) is false.<p>You think that disbanding the police sounds semi-reasonable?  (I think that starting by disbanding the police union, so that they can&#x27;t protect neer-do-wells in uniform is where to start, but that&#x27;s a side issue.)  Then you&#x27;re (I presume) on the left, and you are losing trust in the system.  Which is my point.')
