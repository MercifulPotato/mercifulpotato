Either do something about it or quit feigning outrage by submitting blog posts.<p>It was useless then, it’s useless now. There is no “bombshell” here.

You can scream all you want about what McKinsey is doing, but one thing you won&#x27;t do is enact change by making blog posts with silly gifs inbetween bolded text proclaiming how outraged you are.<p>This is the pharma industry. It&#x27;s been this way for decades. Don&#x27;t pretend like you&#x27;re woke and moralistic in light of this &quot;bombshell&quot; now please, it comes across as trite.')
