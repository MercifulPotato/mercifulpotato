It gained an impressive number of 170 views.<p>Yesterday I have received an email that the video is now age restricted, and is not visible for not-registered users.<p>The video does not contain content not appropriate for children.<p>Appeal was rejected immediately.<p>It is interesting, that a video featuring YouTube competitors that no one really watched for years is blocked out of nowhere without a valid reason.<p>I am curious if anyone else noticed such actions.')
