Item(by='patorjk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602105360, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24712206, text='&gt; Are unions in the US really like that, or is it a one-off being used to spread fud?<p>I worked at Northrop Grumman a decade ago as a developer and a lot of the non-tech people were unionized. There were certain things I was not allowed to do because it was the job of some union person. For example, moving equipment was prohibited. When I changed desks I wasn&#x27;t allowed to move my phone, PC, or monitors, I had to let the person whose job it was to do that, do that. It only happened twice, but in both instances I was without a computer and phone for a day or two, even though my old desk wasn&#x27;t too far away. It was annoying and seemed illogical.')
