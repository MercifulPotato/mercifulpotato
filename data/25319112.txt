As soon as a subreddit becomes even mildly successful it starts being taken over by low effort content and &quot;downvote to disagree&quot; mindset. Very strict moderation helps but that&#x27;s a lot of work and few subreddits manage to pull it off.<p>Then there&#x27;s the more general problem that Reddit clearly wants to encourage the &quot;facebookization&quot; of the website to drive adoption and ad revenue, and that&#x27;s how you end up with an almost unusable web interface on mobile if you don&#x27;t know that i.reddit.com is a thing. The desktop interface at least attempts to show you the posts, but it&#x27;s still a buggy and laggy mess and you&#x27;re much better off using old.reddit.com if you know about it.<p>I just can&#x27;t be bothered to deal with all of that nonsense.')
