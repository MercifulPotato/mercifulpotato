Item(by='FreezerburnV', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608667370, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25508782, text='An interesting trend to me in the comments here is a conflation of a company like Nintendo as a whole, and the efforts to do creepy things like stalk hackers. Considering the size of companies like Nintendo, I could easily imagine there being one culture in the company of valuing the creation of beloved games and how they impact society. (e.g.: a recent article I <i>have not read</i> but the title suggests an agreement with that culture existing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gameinformer.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;21&#x2F;nintendos-shigeru-miyamoto-on-how-he-wants-to-make-the-world-a-better-place" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gameinformer.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;21&#x2F;nintendos-shigeru-mi...</a>) While on the other hand there is a highly litigious culture somewhere else in Nintendo that does creepy things. Whether or not the &quot;happy&quot; side knows about the creepy side or even has much control over it, or even if they encourage it(!), is something I do not know about. I do know that Japanese culture is extremely different from American culture, so something that might seem creepy or aggressive here might be considered effectively normal behavior there, and we could be seeing a clash between the cultures of different countries. (I remember reading something a while ago about how Nintendo of America or Sega of America was extremely mad about some aggressive litigious stuff that happened from the Japanese side of things for some stuff that was effectively harmless or even good for the company in the eyes of at least America, again suggesting at some culture stuff going on potentially) As an example, Japan effectively has a culture of overwork built into their society as a norm that goes beyond even American overtime&#x2F;overwork cultures. Sleeping under your desk isn&#x27;t going to be considered an abnormal occurrence, at least in some companies. Getting home (even when married!) at extremely late hours, possibly totally smashed drunk because of office culture valuing (read: effectively requiring) going out for drinks after work is done, is again not abnormal.<p>I&#x27;m not defending things like intimidating individuals who are finding security issues in game devices. I&#x27;m not defending crazy work hours to produce something. But I did want to at least point out some things that could give context to at least pieces of what&#x27;s going on here.')
