I can directly feel how my work converts into more business value &amp; opportunity. This is not just about me though. It&#x27;s also about being able to grow the company and provide amazing opportunities for <i>other</i> developers, project managers, executives, et. al. I view my company and team members almost as a big family. We offer all sorts of employee incentive packages, so my success also means that others on the team are reaping value.<p>For me, this is enough. I can go through life with the purpose of holding together a technology company &amp; vision. Especially, when I view it through the lens of all the opportunity and support I can provide for other humans. I feel I can do a lot more good in this world through technology &amp; business than if I were to bunker down and start my own family and pour all my energy into that bucket.<p>There is certainly a happy balance that a lot of people manage across both realms, but I have doubled-down a bunch of times on the technology paths, so I am fairly locked-in at this phase. I am truly happy with the choices I have made.  Many times, the hardest part of this is ignoring some of the more toxic perspectives regarding your choices &amp; contributions. I have to remind myself that a lot of people are really not happy with their jobs and just want to get in and out without too much drama.')
