NFSv4 has a similar concept.  It&#x27;s an old idea by now.<p>I actually don&#x27;t know of any <i>distributed</i> (multi-master, fully replicated) filesystems that are published with this property.  I only know it&#x27;s possible because I designed one that isn&#x27;t published.<p>The basic principle is similar to CPU MESI caching but with predicate-scopes suited to a filesystem rather than cache lines.  (Predicate-scopes are similar to predicate-locks in databases).  As you know, multi-core CPU systems remain fast despite sharing memory, incurring significant overhead only for the changes that need to be communicated between cores.  Same applies on a network.')
