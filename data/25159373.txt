I was very active in the Apache Incubator for several years, so I&#x27;ve seen many projects build exactly what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>Once the community exists, it doesn&#x27;t get easier.  Core maintainers now have <i>more</i> to do: reviewing contributions, steering architectural discussions, teeing up starter issues, nurturing prospects, resolving personality conflicts...<p>It&#x27;s not impossible to do that kind of work as a hobbyist, but it&#x27;s more sustainable when there is somebody getting a steady salary to do it.  But not everybody enjoys such tasks, and not every open source project needs to be able to be economically viable.<p>All of this leads to the kind of burnout described in the article.  And what makes it worse is the guilt tripping that if they <i>don&#x27;t</i> either respond to every support request (reasonable or unreasonable) or build a community that does, they are not living up to their supposed obligations as open source authors.')
