It could have been CCTV, an informant, an unfounded denunciation, something they said on WeChat, one of the main compromised Chinese apps. It really isn&#x27;t open to her claim this level of confidence.<p>If the keyboard is leaking keystrokes or word searches on a wide basis it would be difficult to hide technically. DFIR techniques for this are pretty straightforward, I&#x27;m sure plenty of people in HK could do it. Why no details?<p>But ultimately this is a much bigger Android problem, and won&#x27;t be solved by fixing the keyboard (which OWS is obviously unqualified and ill-equipped to do). A broad ranging device lockdown guide, and OPSEC training (like [1] but for protest groups), is necessary to have anything except illusory protection. I don&#x27;t think OWS should get into the business of issuing security advisories for all the platforms that they port to.<p>The pro-democracy groups seem to have this stuff figured out as well as you can and still have a visible protest movement.
