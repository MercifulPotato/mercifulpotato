You also shouldn&#x27;t limit yourself to just software. If your cousin or anyone else for that matter, that You know and trust wants to start a dog walking buisness for example. But they need funds for leashes, a pooper scooper and whatever else, You could invest in or start a partnership with them as long as they have a solid buisness plan. I just used dog walking as an example. There are tons of opportunities out there, especially if You are in a developing country. Ideally choosing ventures that will require none or very little of your time.<p>You won&#x27;t get rich off any one venture and some You may even lose on, but just as a farmers success depends on how many seeds they have in the ground, the more enterprises you invest in or stack, the greater your chances of success.<p>This strategy will make You financially resilient, which IMHO is much better than being financially independent.')
