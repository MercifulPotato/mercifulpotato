They predominately vote republican.  Most of them <i>DO NOT LIKE</i> Trump.  He&#x27;s fucked several members of my family over financially (China imports a boatload of pecans, if you weren&#x27;t aware. We grow pecans).<p>I have two diehard republican uncles - Neither voted for Trump in this election.  One because he watched his mother (my grandmother) die of covid while trump was still spouting off how small a deal it was.  The other because he doesn&#x27;t think his company will survive another 4 years of the China trade war.<p>The ground truth, and I&#x27;m on the fucking ground here, is that GA was already not inclined to favor Trump in this election.<p>Add record Black&#x2F;Minority turnout and it&#x27;s pretty clear why the state went the way it did.<p>Hell, I normally vote split ticket on local elections, but not this year.<p>Yet you come in here and spout off bullshit to try to tell me how my local state should continue to audit and audit and audit until magically the results change to what you want?  Get the fuck out of here.')
