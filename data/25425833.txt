It&#x27;s not standard C, but every compiler supports an analogue to those class and it saves so many headaches from UB-optimising passes, the tiny loss in performance is worth it. Integer overflow and pointer aliasing are way too easy to accidentally hit in a C program, the two should have never been made UB, but perhaps added as a pragma to annotate definitely safe code that can benefit from the optimisation.')
