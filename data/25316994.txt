I&#x27;ve used it, it&#x27;s <i>okay</i>, but in its current form it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d want to use long-term on a laptop or tablet.<p>The UI shown in that concept art is still just a concept. The notification center and calendar that slide in from the sides, the combined tray&#x2F;clock&#x2F;launcher bar at the bottom, the touch-friendly tiling - none of that exists yet.')
