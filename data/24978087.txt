At least where I live, the estate of a natural person pays taxes for their income like a living natural person.<p>&gt; the tax treatment of natural persons at death means that folks could greatly reduce the amount of income realized during their lifetime<p>But they&#x27;d still pay the taxes eventually. I don&#x27;t see this as a huge issue. If the society can&#x27;t wait to get their the taxes (IMHO a nation state should plan for timeframes longer than a single lifetime), they can use the same trick to get a loan from the bank with the future tax income as collateral.')
