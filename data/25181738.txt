(But not that it is as morally reprehensible.)<p>From what I have seen from huge organized crime bosses from biographies and documentaries is that people like Pablo Escobar aren&#x27;t necessarily very smart or super talented. But what sets them apart is their willingness to break all laws and moral norms. Crime leaders rise in the ranks because they are willing to kill their competitors. They are willing to do things that even other criminals are not willing to do. They act while others are hesitating with their pesky conscience.<p>I think this happens albeit to a lesser degree with people like Mark. There are many things about the founding of facebook that most would not do. Most would feel bad about stealing a client&#x27;s idea or about diluting a co-founder&#x27;s shares or any of the myriad little choices that an individual founder has to make. A lot of us just don&#x27;t have it in us to exploit workers or partners like that.<p>That&#x27;s not to say you can&#x27;t be successful without amoral behaviour. But it is more difficult if your competitor is willing to show up at your house and cap you in the back of the head (metaphorically) at a moment&#x27;s notice.')
