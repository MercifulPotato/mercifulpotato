Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609555933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25609748, text='&gt; I disagree on the effectiveness of market solutions for fighting a year-long military campaign.<p>Markets are generally smart enough not to think killing large numbers of people and overthrowing governments is a good idea. If the US government was somehow replaced with a market the Middle East would likely be a more peaceful place. Markets generally find better ways of doing things - like financial incentives - than military intervention.<p>I&#x27;m more than happy to admit defeat if you want to argue that markets are ineffective at subjugating exotic new lands. In terms of defence, I havn&#x27;t looked in to it at all. I expect market based economies to beat command and control economies at war because they can better sustain an effort.')
