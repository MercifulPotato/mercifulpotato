It can also depend where you live. I have a lot of sun where I live, and I think that a solar panel system and batteries would be a better fit for me. Yes, batteries are expensive but there are no moving parts. I adore the concept of no moving parts because my time is already limited when it comes to DIY stuff and it makes it likely to still work 5 years from now.')
