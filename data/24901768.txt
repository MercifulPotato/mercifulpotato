The answer is simple: we want the syntax to also denote a serialized data structure: a tree of atomic elements.<p>In other words, to evaluate &quot;f(a, b, c)&quot;, what you really evaluate is &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;f(a, b, c)&quot;. You never evaluate &quot;a, b, c&quot;. If you move the bracket, then &quot;what is in bracket&quot; matches &quot;what is evaluated&quot;.')
