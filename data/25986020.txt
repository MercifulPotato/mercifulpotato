LTCM was one of the first major fixed income arbitrage funds, a strategy that&#x27;s uniquely sensitive to cheap leverage.<p>They were able to exploit their prime brokers to give them tons of leverage at essentially zero costs. Since LTCM was one of the first, the banks didn&#x27;t really know how to model their counterparty risk and they were dazzled by the prestige. Since that occurred there&#x27;s been a ton more hedge funds, and banks have way better systems for managing that level of counterparty exposure. Plus the post-GFC regulations severely limit bank leverage anyway, so they couldn&#x27;t give cheap leverage to their hedge fund clients even if they wanted to.<p>Again that&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve never seen another LTCM in nearly a quarter of a century. Pointing to LTCM as an example of risk in the financial system of 2021 would be like pointing to Chernobyl as an example of risks in modern nuclear reactors.')
