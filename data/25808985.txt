(allegedly fixed in post release patches)\nUnskippable cutscenes? Check.\nReduced FoV? Check.\nAn auto save system that pauses the game to save unlike the original which did it seamlessly? Check.\nLighting ‘improvements’ that make textures look washed out? Check.\nMore ammo and health for a game that already had too much? Check.\nSignificantly increasing walk, run, and crouch speed to make an already easy game even easier? Check.\nFlashlight projected shadows missing? Check. (Only after bitching from the community did the devs reimplement it...condescendingly..)\nRemoved the flashlight and replace it with an armor mounted one that&#x27;s on the opposite side and projects light in the opposite direction that your gun faces and is super uncomfortable to use, along with setting a time limit on the flash light usage (yet regens so fast the limit might as well not exist so why??)? Check.\nOther dumb changes like changing Kelly&#x27;s armor color (but neglecting to change it in some pre rendered videos so now it&#x27;s inconsistent)? Check.\nGetting rid of the hazmat suit and completely ridding all tension from Erebus Research in RoE? Check.<p>It&#x27;s not minor. It completely ruins the game and it&#x27;s an abomination. 120 fps, vr support and lost mission do not make up for what they did to this game. Add to all this that on release they delisted the original versions of Doom 3 and Roe on steam.. I don&#x27;t know it was just timing on them leaving Activision for publishing in the wake of being bought by Bethesda or them just thinking they were &#x27;obsolete&#x27; and only put them back after back lash.. but I&#x27;ve become cynical after how they mangled this game.<p>Dhewm3 is absolutely the way to play this game now, and with a patch applied prior to compiling you can even get 120fps if you really want it.')
