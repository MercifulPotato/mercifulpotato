Instead of having a computer science building, a physics building, etc, they put every discipline in the same building. They had shared areas for eating &amp; discussing which pushed people to run into each other, and have highly cross-domain conversations.<p>2. Inside the building, the offices were a hub and spoke model. Individual researchers had quiet individual offices for deep thinking they could retreat to AFTER they&#x27;ve bumped into someone at lunch from a different field.<p>In most open offices today, we&#x27;ve forgotten about the deep work spaces and ONLY kept the collaboration spaces.')
