Grew up in SE Michigan.  I visit now and then, but have no major reason to move back.  This on its own probably wouldn&#x27;t be enough, but... having to demonstrate I work for another company vs just being self-employed seems a bit short sighted.  Is the goal to get people to move there?  Or are they trying to achieve something more?')
