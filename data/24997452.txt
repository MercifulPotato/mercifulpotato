This has huge implications to privacy, since even as you roam and change networks (and thus the upper part of the address changes), <i>the lower 64-bits stay exactly the same</i>, making it easy to “follow” a device from session to session and site to site.<p>This was addressed by an update to SLAAC: “Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6” in RFC 4941[0]... but it has to be explicitly enabled on a per-interface basis.<p>A great thing about this feature is that these random, private addresses <i>timeout</i> and become “deprecated” (and a new random address gets assigned to the interface and used for new connections), making it harder for third-parties to track connections over the long-term.<p>Unfortunately, address privacy is a SLAAC thing, so if you want the benefit of registering a device on your network (via DHCPv6, so you can actually correlate IPv6 traffic on your network to a device), you don’t get the benefits of SLAAC’s privacy extensions.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc4941" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc4941</a>')
