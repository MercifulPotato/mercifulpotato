In reality, they have it backwardâ€”prestige follows excellence.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree. I&#x27;ve been seeking out jobs at less prestigious firms for ages but I started getting interviews only once I had Goldman on my resume. I&#x27;ve never would&#x27;ve had a seat at the table where I can try to achieve excellence if it wasn&#x27;t for Goldman. I guess the author&#x27;s argument makes sense for IT where barriers for entry are low, but almost every other industry worth getting into has high barriers for entry.')
