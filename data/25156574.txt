Halderman himself confirmed it.  You&#x27;re not arguing in good faith.  Where&#x27;s the evidence that the machines used in, wherever is en vogue -- MI&#x2F;WI&#x2F;GA&#x2F;PA are actually vulnerable.  That&#x27;s what you need if you want to justifiably run a headline that the election was stolen.<p>&gt;  To me if you can affect the initial count then I don&#x27;t see why its hard to believe that you can affect the recount, especially if it was affected by adding ballots.<p>You think a software vulnerability can conjure pieces of paper out of thin air?  Now you&#x27;ve lost me entirely.<p>Seems like Occam is rolling in his grave here.  Isn&#x27;t the more obvious interpretation just that your candidate... lost the election?')
