When someone builds something in a new place, there is quite a bit of research that goes into water tables, flood zones, etc. I would assume they map that out, but honestly I can&#x27;t say for certain. I do know that it&#x27;s occurred on occasion that rules get &quot;bent&quot; to make certain things happen. It&#x27;s politics and money, and permitting is a high visibility job.')
