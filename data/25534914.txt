But this is not a nitpick you can apply to my statement. I&#x27;m not saying to assume people&#x27;s sexuality from their gender and the gender of their partner.<p>If your stance is that it&#x27;s not necessarily sexist, which honestly I respect in part, it&#x27;s nonsense to argue that the comment may not be sexist, because &quot;wife&quot; may mean &quot;husband&quot;. It&#x27;s not a competition to see who can make the fewest assumptions.')
