After several years, I have figured it out.<p>It seems to me like the west doesn&#x27;t have enough people to do key jobs and to they have decided that they&#x27;ll solve this problem by importing skilled labor from abroad. To do that, workplaces must be changed to incorporate people from various backgrounds, hence, &quot;diversity&quot;.<p>From the state perspective, there&#x27;s also a need to employ the traditionally difficult to employ: people with various disabilities, socially unaccepted sexual identities, former convicts etc. So, the state works with the industries to try to make this happen. This would mean the state has less to worry about when unemployment rates go down and the industries get more available labor.<p>The black employment thing is a bit different but in a similar vein. Blacks are socially segregated and politically disenfranchised. Not to mention, the relations between blacks and whites have been worsened for political purposes. This meant it was easier for tech companies to hire talent from abroad than hire blacks. When Obama was elected, the industries decided to use him to fix this. Turns out blacks were not even studying tech. He did some work there to encourage blacks to study &quot;coding&quot; so that America would have to import fewer tech talent.<p>So, I believe that the entire &quot;diversity&quot; thing is a scam. The industry merely wants more people to be available for work. So, they work with politicians to teach people to pretend to &quot;tolerate&quot; others. &quot;Political correctness&quot; is just lying to people by hiding what you really think is correct. So, I say this as an outsider: if you want to succeed in their environment, don&#x27;t fall for the diversity scam. There is no diversity, they simply don&#x27;t like it. It makes them very uncomfortable. If you have to be there, dress white, talk white, try to fix your accent (Elsa speak is great), tell them what they want to hear. Never challenge their cultish behavior and dogmas. Never criticize Apple or question climate change.<p>If you want to speak your mind, go to anonymous forums and hide behind a username. You&#x27;ll be heavily downvoted but that&#x27;s fine.')
