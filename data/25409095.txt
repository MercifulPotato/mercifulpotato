Quite weak passwords can look high-entropy to a system like this, e.g. it&#x27;s not going to know that &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; is a common phrase, or that the user is a security-illiterate Trumpist and therefore likely to use such a passphrase.<p>If you&#x27;re <i>generating</i> passwords for users from these statistical models, and forcing them to use the first paraphrase you give them, talking about &quot;raw entropy&quot; would make more sense. It&#x27;s still subjective, in that someone who knows the full machine state at generation time would probably see a different entropy, but at least that information is relatively hard to access.')
