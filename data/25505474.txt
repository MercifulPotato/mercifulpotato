Your hypothetical is not convincing. Btw, you mention &quot;real&quot; and then move on to &quot;hypothetical&quot; as an example.<p>Because of Clojure&#x27;s default persistent in-memory data structures which allow you to obtain a stable reference to your in-memory data even when the data is being updated live. With Java&#x27;s default mutable data structures, you&#x27;d have to use locking or copying to obtain a stable reference, not to mention the huge complexity of those solutions. I said real because I&#x27;ve built similar solutions in Clojure. Substitute &quot;hypothetical&quot; with &quot;example&quot;, sorry for the word confusion.<p>&gt; That said, fundamentally, Java affords much greater facilities to &quot;optimize&quot; and approach white hot performance than Clojure.<p>Taken to the extreme, the resulting Clojure would not be idiomatic, it would be effectively Java-in-Clojure, but Clojure has all the facilities that Java has, by definition.')
