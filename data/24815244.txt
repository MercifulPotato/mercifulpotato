Item(by='kortex', descendants=None, kids=[24815965], score=None, time=1602990631, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24813121, text='So what&#x27;s the next step? Elsewhere in this thread, picoseconds were mentioned and that seems plausibly useful, so that&#x27;s 10 bits. And it would be nice to avoid &quot;year xyz&quot; problems, so maybe we could have a coding region of say 2 bits to encode 4 overlapping epochs to allow rolling updates. That seems to imply at least a 10-byte or 12-byte time.<p>I don&#x27;t see any way in which that could easily fit with POSIX time types, unless you keep the existing 32-bit time_t and tv_nsecs fields and tack on two 16-bit fields for extending precision in either direction. But ISO C allows time_t to be a floating point number, which opens a few doors.<p>What about UTF-8 style variable length times? Would that be too messy?<p>Edit: looks like most 64-bit OSes are already or are switching to 64-bit time_t. So that solves half the problem, but no picoseconds just yet. I guess that&#x27;s what int64 or float64&#x2F;80 is for.')
