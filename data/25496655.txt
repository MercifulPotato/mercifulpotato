The use of LLVM is part of the design, and how use it is too.<p>Is like the people on the C-like languages (with the exception of Go) can&#x27;t resits the temptation of make languages slow to use (yet, spend absurd amount of time on produce good binaries).<p>Is not that I not grateful of how good Rust&#x2F;LLVM compiled binaries perform, in fact, is one of the big reasons I use Rust! but is kind of weird(?)&#x2F;funny(?) that the languages itself are so slow.<p>I think is cultural. People on that side of the fence are so used to use sub-optimal tooling that don&#x27;t mind too much to use another tool on the same feels. And if it provide &quot;10%&quot; increase on performance, get so happy, because is against the old, not agains the <i>best</i>.')
