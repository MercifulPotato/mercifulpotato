I just said that it makes no sense to make the vast majority of that processing in the headphone when your phone and computer already have specialized hardware to do it.<p>Also, DACs today are pretty much transparent.<p>For example, for positional audio and driver&#x2F;amp compensation, people already do the same as Klipsch does in software on their computer.
