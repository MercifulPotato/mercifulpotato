When I’m super bored and feeling curious about other places, I’ll pop on over to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;map.snapchat.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;map.snapchat.com</a><p>It doesn’t require an account, works on any browser (including mobile) and lets you see snaps from anywhere in the world. It didn’t fully scratch my itch like I think that periscope feature would have. I’m a little sad to have just learned about it today.<p>Btw, my favorite places to check out on the snap map are rural arctic countries. It’s so cool to see people in their cozy houses sharing pictures of their local food. It also blows my mind that their lives are not much different than mine, except they have a foreboding icy world right outside their doors lol')
