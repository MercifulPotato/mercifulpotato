They&#x27;re still maturing, but the abstraction has moved up a level.  Most people don&#x27;t care (and fewer want to) what OS or other low-level stuff is running their code.<p>Today, we&#x27;re still too focused on what&#x27;s going on inside the boxes - in the future, more people will realize that the important part that brings value is how the boxes are &quot;plumbed&quot; together.  We&#x27;re already seeing the beginnings of this with serious no-code&#x2F;low-code platforms, which are ideally suited for these kinds of services environments.  (Soon, they won&#x27;t all be cloud-based, either...)')
