Item(by='nkurz', descendants=None, kids=[24716217], score=None, time=1602128918, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24715244, text='&gt; old glass isn&#x27;t re-melted for use as new glass items<p>Are you sure this is true?  Searching now, I seem to find claims that the majority of recycled glass is often made into new containers as one would expect.  Here, for example, is a source that says &quot;Up to 90% of glass collected via multi-stream recycling programs becomes new glass products&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourhappyplanet.org&#x2F;glass-recycling&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourhappyplanet.org&#x2F;glass-recycling&#x2F;</a>.<p>Obviously, &quot;up to&quot; is weasel-speak, but I found some other sites making similar although slightly lower claims.  Also, there is a distinction between &quot;single stream&quot; and &quot;multi stream&quot; recycling, with this source claiming that the percentage for &quot;single stream&quot; is only 45%.   Do you know of better numbers?  Or economic arguments for why clean glass would not be recycled?')
