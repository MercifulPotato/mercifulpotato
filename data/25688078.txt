Quite literally 1&#x2F;2 of the USA voted for Trump, should you automatically be ashamed of that?<p>I dont have a horse in the race neither other than stock market.<p>It&#x27;s not that strange. It&#x27;s why elections are supposed to be confidential. Public opinion is always going to shift. During Clinton&#x27;s reign we had the clinton crazies who hated him. George W bush? Did anyone like him? Obama derangement was readily labelled racism. Now Trump derangement is very strong. Biden will have his haters, that&#x27;s coming.<p>However, the derangement is real and even the illusion you&#x27;re for trump will gain you hate.')
