About all I can say there is that larger extended family of their CEO and it looked like the entire social set of their C Suite was completely out of control with wealthy excess, including the CEO himself. Being the 80&#x27;s, that wealthy excess was luxury goods, travel and expensive drugs. I remember his father learning I was a developer and saying he could get me in at good spot, and my thoughts were &quot;and join your excess club? no thanks.&quot; FWIW, not a single person I knew from back then in that crowd is successful today.')
