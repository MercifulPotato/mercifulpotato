Item(by='auslegung', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604883012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25030085, text='&gt; I no longer think that end-to-end encryption is the right solution to human rights problems. If citizens are reduced to sneaking around and denying their activities to survive, their governmental system is way past due for fixing.<p>I think you and I have fundamentally different, and likely incompatible, views of government. I believe government will always spy on its citizens, on other governments, and on their citizens, to the extent its technologically able. I believe this because this has been the case since governments, monarchies, etc existed. (In the 21st century we can add that &quot;corporate entities&quot; are doing the same level of spying on their members, their competition, and everyone else they can.) I should hope Snowden would have put a fat emphasis on that point. I believe no amount of progress, voting, reform, etc will change that governments do this. Yes those things can, and do, make a difference, but governments will always find a way around or through it, while, for now, governments seem to be able to keep corporate entities in check when they want to.<p>Pre computers, &quot;technologically able&quot; required lots of footwork. Governments were necessarily limited in their ability to spy on everyone. Today that limit has been removed. This is why I am a firm believer in encryption for everyone, everywhere, always.<p>I would say not that &quot;citizens are reduced to sneaking around and denying their activities&quot;, but that citizens need encryption to check their governments&#x27; (and corporate entities&#x27;) ability to spy on them.<p>You and I could definitely agree that our &quot;governmental systems are way past due for fixing&quot;, but I believe there is no truly fixing them because they are made up of corruptible people. At best, journalism can inform the people of the corruption, and the people can be well-armed to check military might (good luck with nowadays fighting a tank with your AR).')
