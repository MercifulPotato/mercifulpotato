Its too many to count.<p>If I wrote the perfect chat app tomorrow, I&#x27;m talking universally loved by anyone who uses it. I&#x27;m not guaranteed to succeed. If someones whole family is on iMessage and they are happy they aren&#x27;t going to be able to get them to switch. So they couldn&#x27;t use my app if they wanted too.<p>Thus they stay with the &quot;inferior&quot; product. Average people aren&#x27;t interested in the latest greatest. They just want it to work and as long as it does, they don&#x27;t care about shortcomings that don&#x27;t affect them. IE app size, speed(as long as its good enough)')
