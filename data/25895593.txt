But now I think they&#x27;ve gone back to the viewpoint that there&#x27;s no safe way to do that (even a trickle of dollars from China would be a deluge elsewhere due to sheer numbers) and that being a reserve currency is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.<p>Heck, I&#x27;m sure if they could Switzerland and Japan would like to cease being a safe haven currency overnight; the role comes with a lot of things that have lots of downside and no upside domestically.<p>---<p>The other thing might be an increase in housing supply. Housing supply increases are now firmly out of the realm of wonky think-tank policy with real advocacy happening at a grassroots level. Already Minneapolis has removed exclusive single family zoning. But this would probably take the better part of a decade or two to start showing real progress.')
