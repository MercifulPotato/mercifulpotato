I was able to get SoundHound to recognize the vast majority of the tunes I hummed for it back in 2008&#x2F;2009. And I used it a lot. I did only choose popular songs though. It&#x27;s not surprising IMHO that a company 12 years later with much greater resources could extend recognition to a much larger variety of songs. So I wouldn&#x27;t call it &quot;little tech could not.&quot;')
