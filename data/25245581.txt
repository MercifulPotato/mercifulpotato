This is not disclaimed clearly.<p>If you&#x27;re referring to the nebula ad at the end, he and other youtubers have been advertising it for months, if not years now. No other video with a nebula ad has been shadow banned like this.<p>Also, trying to paint this as &quot;Youtube isn&#x27;t promoting it&quot; is disingenuous. Youtube is hiding it from people who&#x27;ve explicitly asked to be notified about his videos.')
