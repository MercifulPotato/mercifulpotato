If you ask the strata or the building managers about charging points in the carpark, they look at you like you&#x27;re speaking Klingon.<p>This is true of even very recently completed buildings in well-off areas of relatively wealthy western countries. Heck, I just walked past <i>three</i> Teslas in my building&#x27;s car park, one of which is new and wasn&#x27;t there last week!<p>Do people... not plan ahead? Do architects not read the news? Are they from another planet where electricity delivery is not a problem that architects have to deal with in building design?<p>Mind you, I got the <i>exact same</i> dumbfounded stare from people when talking to cafe managers and gym owners about the impending COVID lockdowns back in February 2020: &quot;Lock...down...? You think so? Really? Here?&quot; (Don&#x27;t think IT is spared from this, I get the same vacant expression when I talk to network engineers about IPv4 exhaustion and the need for IPv6.)<p>On a more practical note, I have business idea that might interest the YC News crowd: The main problem raised by building managers I spoke to was that it was &quot;too hard&quot; to solve charge-back and the like. Wiring is &quot;easy&quot;, that&#x27;s just a matter of calling out contractor, but organising the billing of the tenant and then splitting the revenue between the various parties involved is more work for them than it is worth, because it is complex to set up but initially there may be only a couple of electric cars generating very little revenue. An &quot;electric charging billing&quot; cloud service that manages everything with low overheads might sell well...')
