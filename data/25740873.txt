Apparently they&#x27;ve got new management, and they are intentionally hobbling functionality to lock users into their ecosystem.<p>I purchased several pieces and was planning to purchase more until I found out about their vendor lock-in aspects, and returned it all.  It&#x27;s really stupid because they don&#x27;t have to compensate for anything with lock-in considering their high quality at their price point.')
