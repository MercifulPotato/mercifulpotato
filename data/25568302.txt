Humans don&#x27;t all eat the exact same thing and they don&#x27;t all exist in the same exact climate so regulations tend to be curated to their local constituents.<p>Furthermore, in many European nations the pasta <i>is</i> enriched, mainly with fiber although plenty of other nutrients are added depending on the brand and market. European countries just don&#x27;t have regulations regarding &quot;enriched macaroni&quot; labeling like the US, which is an interesting historical quirk but irrelevant to what&#x27;s actually in the pasta. Popular brands like Barilla are almost certainly enriched with something - depending on the size of the market it might have been enriched to American standards just to minimize manufacturing fragmentation (i.e. Italy, a huge consumer of pasta and origin of many of the brands will have formulas dedicated to that market, while Norway will receive whatever other formula is closest to their requirements).')
