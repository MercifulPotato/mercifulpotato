I think the &quot;Side Journey To Titan&quot; paper makes it obvious the authors also understand how it works.<p>So if you can magically summon working attacks, you would choose the symmetric AES key yes.<p>One conclusion you could draw from this paper is the authors are idiots and didn&#x27;t realise they should attack that key or else didn&#x27;t have the relevant expertise to do so.<p>Another, I suspect far more likely conclusion is that protecting AES keys in dedicated security hardware is a problem lots of people already put effort into and these researchers wisely concluded they wouldn&#x27;t get any traction there because this is a standard component.')
