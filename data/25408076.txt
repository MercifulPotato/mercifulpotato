It&#x27;s such a useful feature for a lot of types and really cleans up code, and the only real reason it&#x27;s hard to do is because it relies on method overloading. But once you have that, why not just sugar &quot;a + b&quot; into &quot;a.__add(b)&quot; (or whatever).<p>You don&#x27;t have to go all C++ insane with it and allow overloading of everything, but just being able to do arithmetic with non-primitive types would be very nice.')
