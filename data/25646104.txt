Sure, it&#x27;s okay to add subtle new things, like window snapping on Windows (the thing where you drag it to the edge of the screen) or inertial scrolling on macOS. It&#x27;s absolutely not okay to take a perfectly functional and polished UI and &quot;refresh&quot; it with disproportional controls and huge fonts because people now carry phones in their pockets. The only good reason for a complete UI redesign is change in the way it&#x27;s interacted with, for example because some novel kind of input device came about. But then again, the mere existence of touchscreens shouldn&#x27;t be detrimental to the UX of those who use keyboard and mouse.')
