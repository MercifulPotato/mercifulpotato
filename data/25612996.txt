Item(by='CM30', descendants=None, kids=[25613007], score=None, time=1609597465, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612176, text='Yeah, it is nice to know what the actual changes are, rather than a vague &#x27;fixes were made&#x27; statement. Nintendo&#x27;s update logs for games have to be some of the most hilariously vague in that regard, with many of the updates being just:<p>&gt; Several issues have been fixed to improve gameplay experience.<p>But at the same time I guess I can see why companies and project creators don&#x27;t go into more detail. Maybe the actual bugs fixed were so weirdly technical that most users wouldn&#x27;t understand them at all, or care (if the user hovers over this button for 1&#x2F;300th for a second, there&#x27;s a 0.0001% chance their next message might not save properly). Maybe they (perhaps sadly) don&#x27;t remember what exact things they fixed, since they fixed so many bugs.<p>Either way some more detail would be nice for those that do care about this stuff.')
