Once the outer envelope is removed and destroyed, the ballot is irreversibly anonymous.  It&#x27;s impossible to tell if an anonymous ballot is fraudulent or not -- there&#x27;s no ability to audit it by contacting the voter.<p>Mail-in ballots are particularly vulnerable to fraud, something the New York Times correctly worried about back before Trump.[1]. And we just had more mail-in ballots than ever before thanks to Covid.<p>HN has long been suspicious of voting systems; we all know how often systems are hacked by bad actors.
