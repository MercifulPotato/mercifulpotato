It sounded like they were putting the blame for hazardous actions of others on the media (of an all-encompassing scope) for discussing the hazardous actions being committed.<p>Which to me seems like slinging jargon rather than registering any kind of context.

In fact, McLuhan&#x27;s point was exactly that kind of misunderstanding and misreading should be avoided by not taking the context for granted.')
