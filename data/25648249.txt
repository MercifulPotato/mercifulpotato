Item(by='rektide', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609868427, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25647464, text='&gt; Fixing these issues, whether by government, tech industry, or otherwise, will involve some level of &quot;authoritarianism&quot;.<p>This seems to be what most people expect, that someone else will solve the problem, that someone else will have to step in &amp; take responsibility for all the irresponsible people.<p>I disagree with this. I think it&#x27;s up to us. Right now we rely on platforms to communicate &amp; respond, to marshal direct responses. Which is unfortunate. These groups all have their own safe-spaces, have their own moderated environments. They have coordination &amp; dissemination &amp; protected spaces, as they exploit the Bullshit Asymmetry Principle&#x2F;Brandolini&#x27;s Law, as they poison &amp; make other spaces unsafe.<p>What&#x27;s missing, to me, is some good cross-platform ways to register dissent &amp; disagreement. The aegis, to me, is not other people. It is us. A -1 vote, that we can deploy easily, that we can reinforce each other on, anywhere. Let disagreement be known. Those who want to go further ought bring Issue Based Information Systems (IBIS)[1][2] up &amp; online to talk about the things they have seen online, to link the world of mis-information into their own structured, defined refutations, and let others amplify &amp; support those refutations. Link more, structure more. Do it on our own turf, consolidate our responses, and most of all, support each other, follow each other&#x27;s feeds, plus one the links, plus one the arguments.<p>More sunlight, use this great internet, use speech, to cleans away so many of the darker shadier rots. Society, building some aegis, some protection, to shield itself, to let good voices amplify &amp; support each other.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Issue-based_information_system" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Issue-based_information_system</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TfIZY0s1JG0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TfIZY0s1JG0</a>')
