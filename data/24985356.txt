I use Sweech as a Wifi file server on the phone, but to get pictures off... whoops, no multi select.  so if I want to grab the newest 50 photos off the wife&#x27;s phone, that&#x27;s 50 checkmarks to click (I&#x27;m not geeky enough to have Termux on the wife&#x27;s phone).  Or apps that only talk to a companion app on your (Windows or Mac) computer using a proprietary protocol.  Or simply need a crapload of taps to get the job done.<p>Whereas the rsync method is exactly this: &quot;syncphone&quot; on my main machine.  If it doesn&#x27;t connect, nudge the phone so it wakes up (it&#x27;ll connect anyway eventually; the phone seems to wake up on its own now and then).  And then it&#x27;s all automatic and scriptable from that point.  I realize that perhaps 0.1% of smartphone users have the skills to automate things at that level and therefore care.<p>The auto rsync when charging is a good idea.  I guess Termux can still get access to the battery&#x2F;charge state?<p>Another example of user hostility:  While on Android phones, at least older ones, bulk transfer of files via USB to&#x2F;from a Linux machine has always been hit and miss, it&#x27;s been rock solid on iDevices.  Just do &quot;idevicepair&quot; and after that, transfer away to your heart&#x27;s content, fast and solid.  Only now I read that the latest version of IOS may have messed that up too, in the name of security of course.')
