The dynamic changes entirely when the sample size is comprised mostly of immigrants with advanced skills.<p>If we allowed in 100,000 immigrant astronauts, I think it&#x27;s safe to say they&#x27;d impact the hiring prospects of American astronauts. And they wouldn&#x27;t consume enough goods and services to spawn new space ventures that create 100,000 new astronaut jobs.')
