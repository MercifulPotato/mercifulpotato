QM is a hugely successful theory which has proven itself to be accurate to absolutely incredible precision.<p>The black hole information paradox implies that there is no way for information to escape the black hole, breaking conservation of information.<p>The implications of this is huge: Either information can escape a black hole, which suggests general relativity is wrong. Or information cannot escape a black hole, in which case QM is wrong.<p>So the key to coming up with a solution to this problem is to explain what happens without breaking physics. One suggestion have been that the information actually never enters the black hole in the first place, it&#x27;s just spread out over the surface of the event horizon.')
