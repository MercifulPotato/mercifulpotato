I&#x27;m guessing this was bound to occur. Especially when modern business models are based on creating a casino addiction model fixated on capturing eyeballs and creating discord online rather than delivering a solid working product from day one.<p>Personally, my biggest gripe with games&#x2F;gaming is the lack of fulfillment you get for the time spent after having actually achieved things in real life. I now look it as wasted time not doing things that actually matter or improve my Life and those around me, whereas my teenage-self would have regarded such an addiction to wasting time as &#x27;fun.&#x27; Had COVID not happened I definitely would not have picked up gaming again and would have been at an arcade if I had spare time and the inclination to play.<p>It&#x27;s really the worst kind of time-sink now because I don&#x27;t enjoy it and have mainly used it to distract me or to take a break from real-life.
