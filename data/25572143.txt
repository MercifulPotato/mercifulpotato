Item(by='memetherapy', descendants=None, kids=[25574897], score=None, time=1609262595, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25569883, text='What seems to be missing from this discussion is that this agreement was negotiated mind bogglingly quickly (9 months as opposed to the multi year &#x2F; decade long process) and hasn&#x27;t undergone the usual process of scrubbing which is where such technical and legal issues would normally be fixed. \nThis process would itself normally take longer than the entire period in which this has been negotiated. Of course it&#x27;s a mess and is full of copy-pasta errors. Luckily however law isn&#x27;t code, especially not at the international agreement level, and it is implemented by humans, not computers (or software developers). \nThe big problem with the Brexit deal is that it has essentially come straight from the hands of the politicians and civil servants who have negotiated it and is then being approved without proper scrutiny, at least from the UK parliament and the council of Europe. Let us hope that the only problems with it are a few embarrassing technical errors that in reality will be dealt with by secondary legislation and side agreements between the parties. If there are serious issues then they will likely be picked up before it is approved by the European Parliament (and it&#x27;s not a shoe in that it will actually be approved by MEPs) and these will need to be dealt with, probably through a bunch of secondary legislation and agreements.')
