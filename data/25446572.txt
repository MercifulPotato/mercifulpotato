But they&#x27;re premium priced ($200 each, or $600 for three), and sacrifice comfort particularly for longer trips.<p>In general people who have never had kids don&#x27;t seem to grasp that the average (non-Radian) car-seat is BIGGER than an adult side-to-side. The Radian series has a niche because they produced a car-seat the same size as an adult (with no loss of safety), but had to sacrifice comfort to do so.')
