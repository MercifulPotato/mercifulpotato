Cisco&#x27;s system last I was aware was a hodgepodge of applications, i.e. we had to have two separate Cisco chat applications running at all times.<p>Other players, its either one or both of:\n- a solution less kludgy than Cisco but still a hodgepodge of applications\n- a system that can&#x27;t scale on one or more important axes\n- too specialized for a general use case<p>Remember, on one hand, Telcom uses erlang a lot. On the other hand THEY USE ERLANG A LOT. The sorts of stuff you see in phone systems is brilliant but archaic. And I bring that up because the voice integration in teams is really freaking nice and honestly the users are happier because its less integration hassle when moving numbers around, and that&#x27;s a win for both IT and users.<p>Would I prefer discord had a competitive solution or Teams had a competitive UI? Yes. Or that Avaya would come blow everyone away with something amazing.<p>But part of me is also asking if teams has gotten so crappy lately because this year has likely resulted in them having to scramble on bugs and scaling issues in a way they didn&#x27;t expect.')
