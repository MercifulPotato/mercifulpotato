Lots of people keep pushing to get rid of cash, for example, because it will &quot;reduce terrorism&quot; or &quot;reduce money laundering&quot; or whatever.  But I like using cash, because I don&#x27;t want my bank, or an anti-money-laundering authority, or anyone else to know what I buy, when, why, how much, or from whom.  It has nothing to do with illegal activity, or buying drugs, or whatever.<p>My parents and grandparents told me about the days before centralized documentation.  A birth certificate was sufficient documentation, and of course those could be changed.  One could lie about his birthday and not get caught.  These days, no one is a person at all unless the government says he is, and even then, he is only the person the government says he is: I knew someone who was a transgender; she couldn&#x27;t call herself a woman in many contexts until the government said so.  This idea of constantly proving that you are who you claim to be, backed by government verification, strikes me as a bad direction to go.')
