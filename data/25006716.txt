Until now that was mostly a Python prototype and PowerPoint. \nNow it&#x27;s time to set up a company and take care if financials and tax etc. \n5 days in we made progress but there is so many things  do that we just would like to outsource. \nNow in the US, stripe Atlas seems decent. Are you aware of any European or even German alternatives? It does not make sense right now to start a company in Delaware. We would rather have Berlin.')
