I&#x27;m also curious about how driverless plays out in the real world (e.g. is there an equivalent of &quot;oh shoot, I accidentally put the wrong address, can you drop me off over at X instead?&quot;, what&#x27;s going to happen with drunk passengers, etc)<p>I&#x27;m also wary because ride sharing is a customer service intensive industry, an area Alphabet isn&#x27;t exactly strong at.')
