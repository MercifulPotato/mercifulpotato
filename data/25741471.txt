My Big Brothers Jack and Mark know exactly what are doing. I will not express my opinion here, I can be &quot;deplatformed&quot;. I will put here, instead, a recipe of apple pie. Hopefully it will not be offensive to anyone.<p>Apple Pie Recipe<p>INGREDIENTS  \nAbout 5 cups thinly sliced apples (peeled and cored), 8-10 medium apples  \n3 tablespoons sugar  \n3 tablespoons all-purpose flour  \n1â€“2 teaspoons cinnamon  \n1&#x2F;4 teaspoon salt  \n2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces  \nDouble pie crust  \n1 egg white + 1 tablespoon water  \ngranulated or chubby sparkling sugar, optional<p>INSTRUCTIONS  \nIn a medium bowl add the sliced apples. Sprinkle with the sugar, flour, cinnamon, and salt and toss gently to combine well.\nRoll out and place an uncooked pie crust in the bottom of a deep 9-inch pie plate.\nPlace the apple mixture in the uncooked pie shell. Place the small pieces of butter on top of apple mixture.\nTop with second pie crust, crimp the edges, and then cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to vent.\nMix the egg white and 1 tablespoon of water together in a small bowl and then brush the top with water and sprinkle with sugar before baking.\nBake at 450 for the first 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 and continue cooking for an additional 30 to 40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.\nIf the edge of the crust starts to brown more quickly than the center, carefully cover the edge with foil for the last 15-20 minutes of baking to prevent over-browning.\nLet the pie cool for 10 minutes before serving. Can be made ahead of time and served at room temperature.')
