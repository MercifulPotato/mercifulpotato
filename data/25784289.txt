Item(by='philipkglass', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610665811, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783806, text='<i>Any time China accuses another country of some sort of misdeed, just assume they&#x27;re thinking that everyone acts the same way they themselves do.</i><p>You can fill in &quot;pretty much any country&quot; for &quot;China&quot; when it comes to trade disputes like this. The vast majority of between-nation dumping accusations seem to be unfounded or extremely thinly founded -- e.g. US accusing China of solar &quot;dumping&quot; when solar equipment manufacturers get state support by tax credits or low interest loans. US states pay to attract manufacturing too [1].<p>China can make t-shirts and tea cups cheaper than western producers. This has been known since before China joined the WTO. Objections to China <i>also</i> producing sophisticated goods cheaper seem to be mostly post-hoc regret. They weren&#x27;t supposed to climb the value chain like that. Our countries were supposed to keep the sophisticated production while they just make trinkets!<p>I actually think that it is a problem that the western world has lost so much domestic productive capacity, but countering that with hollow accusations of dumping is dishonest. Countries should formally alter trade obligations to reinvigorate domestic production instead of fabricating rationalizations to match the text of old treaties.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;14&#x2F;796344782&#x2F;wisconsin-foxconn-and-the-lure-of-state-tax-incentives" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;14&#x2F;796344782&#x2F;wisconsin-foxconn-a...</a>')
