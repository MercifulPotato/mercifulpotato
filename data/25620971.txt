Even if the customer recognises that the listing is made by a third party - they are more likely to blame the restaurant for the sub-par food.<p>Leaving the decision to the restaurant to opt-in is the best move IMO. Rather than have &quot;disrupters&quot; come in - damage the brand reputation and then leave the damage control bit to the restaurant.')
