The number might be much higher, especially given inflation theory, but those galaxies currently lay outside our observable universe due to speed of light constraints.<p>Another interesting possibility is a finite but unbounded universe which means we might see duplicate galaxies from light circumnavigating (think of an old video game where you leave the screen at the top and appear on the bottom). In that case there might be fewer actual galaxies than what we observe.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Observable_universe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Observable_universe</a>')
