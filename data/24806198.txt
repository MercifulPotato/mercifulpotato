Vim is great for quick edits, arranging text in temporary files (control x + control e in the terminal, quit without saving), moving chunks of code around, running macros. Its also great to use the keybindings in your favorite electron IDE.<p>I&#x27;m just not a &quot;plugins&quot; person. I&#x27;ve been trying to set up a python environment in emacs for a while and it hasn&#x27;t been fun. Its an iterative process of installing a few plugins, getting something buggy and slow to use, and eventually getting fed up and restarting from a minimal config file.<p>Emacs has been amazing for magit alone, I just wish I was good enough at it to use it for more things.<p>Vim?
