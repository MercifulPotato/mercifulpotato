That was a interesting high-reliability system, still worth attention. The hardware just cost too much back when it was a product.<p>HPE still sells the Tandem OS, NonStop, and they have ported it to run on x86. Unfortunately, unlike OpenVMS, theyâ€™ve never (to the best of my knowledge) run a hobbyist program for it.')
