I found the expositions I heard unconvincing (even one  in person by a famous mathematician), but it makes sense the flaws were in the abbreviation (and&#x2F;or me), not in Cantor.<p>&gt; What part of the theorem are you uncomfortable with?<p>As I&#x27;ve said, it&#x27;s not the theorem, but this proof of it. Not a particular part, but that this proof technuque could prove something that is untrue. i.e. there was no condition to prevent it being applied to integers.<p>Here&#x27;s a sketch of the argument, from my cousin comment: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25111003" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25111003</a><p>Looks like it&#x27;s prevented from being applied to integers by: a diagonal of an infinite list requiring numbers with infinite digits. Which integers don&#x27;t have.')
