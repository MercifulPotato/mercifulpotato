Item(by='hyperpallium2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605706105, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25133840, text='&gt; Note that there are a couple technical steps skipped by some expositions of Cantor&#x27;s argument.<p>That would resolve it. I found the expositions I heard unconvincing (even one  in person by a famous mathematician), but it makes sense the flaws were in the abbreviation, not in Cantor.<p>&gt; What part of the theorem are you uncomfortable with?<p>Not a particular part, but that it could prove something that is untrue. i.e. there was no condition to prevent it being applied to integers.<p>But as you suggest, this was probably just because of the abbreviated exposition.')
