The question really becomes, define &quot;fully.&quot;  What set of performance scenarios, with member connects&#x2F;disconnects and other shenanigans, do we need to consider in order to &quot;fully&quot; understand Paxos (or basic Multi-Paxos)?<p>What I really like about Paxos is that it&#x27;s pretty easy to re-invent the exact algorithm, or come up with your own Multi-Paxos definition, after you&#x27;ve forgotten what the original exactly was, once you&#x27;ve grokked the general principles of how it works.')
