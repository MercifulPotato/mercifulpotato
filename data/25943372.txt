I&#x27;ve seen no evidence yet that there is any sort of pump and dump collusion, the speculative bubble &#x2F; stick-it-to-the-market-manipulators deal on WallStreetBets seems to be fairly organically driven as many memes are. There&#x27;s no rules that I can think of against &quot;tulip mania&quot; type speculative bubbles. If there were, a huge amount of people would have been in serious trouble for the 2008 real estate bubble &#x2F; crash.<p>To be honest, I think the recent restrictions on trading specific stocks (on Robinhood etc.) is absolutely dumb. Apparently, the sort of crappy market manipulation that led to the 2008 Volkswagen &quot;short squeeze&quot; or the 2010 &quot;flash crash&quot; is absolutely fine because it was driven by traders. But an <i>amateur mob</i> performing the short squeeze must be stopped at all cost? What bullshit. Either the &quot;casino&quot; should be open to all, or rules that apply to the &quot;amateur mob&quot; should apply to the HFT and derivatives market as well.')
