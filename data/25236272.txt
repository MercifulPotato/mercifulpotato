When numbers are low, it doesn&#x27;t matter much if there is some growth. And, finally, we were under tiered area restrictions depending on local rates (though I felt the chosen restrictions were a bit odd). Finally, in some parts of the country, a full lockdown didn&#x27;t really make sense even when it was ordered (though arguably, this is lockdown-lite compared to the spring).')
