I have severe gripes with Whatsapp including a sub-standard desktop client. Signal is a pretty good replacement for Whatsapp I would say. We have recently been approved at work to start using a corporate version of Zoom but it is seldom used yet. We also heavily use Symphony at this point for group conversations that don&#x27;t involve voice calling. I think LINE and Telegram are pretty ok. IRC is still always gonna be my favorite but obviously its lacking most of the features of a modern chat client such as Discord such as video&#x2F;audio calls and screen-sharing.')
