It seems to be a response to &quot;you should be homeschooling your kid&quot;, which sequoia didn&#x27;t actually say. They suggested the problem is &quot;school taking up 100% of her time, energy, and attention&quot;, and obviously homeschooling is how they are addressing it themselves, but you can imagine other solutions. Off-hand:<p>* For starters, school doesn&#x27;t last until 6:30pm unless you let it. Extracurriculars are extra. If you need afternoon child care (and most of us do), there may be less directed, more creative options available.<p>* Schools can make changes, and you can encourage your teacher &#x2F; school &#x2F; district to do so. Less homework (an idea which has some science behind it iiuc) at least. Maybe a later start time (although this runs into tension with parents&#x27; schedules).')
