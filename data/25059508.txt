I&#x27;ve also been drawing on Domain Driven Design (DDD) principles. It took more a bit of experimentation to find how best to apply this to smaller scale software, but the results have been very pleasing.<p>I started by sketching out a plan on how I would rigorously apply DDD &amp; CQRS to a problem, but in the full-knowledge that it would likely be overkill. I then dropped out components which I felt were unnecessary for my particular situation.<p>The result has been something fairly lightweight, without too much boilerplate, and very reliable. The clients concerned have certainly found it to be a rock solid part of the core business process.<p>The need for this did not come from any performance requirement, but because I felt there had a to be sensible way to architect SME business software. Especially in a startup environment where business needs and processes were often changing. I felt that DDD allowed me to actually model businesses processes in software, rather than requiring business needs to adapt to the software I was developing.<p>This may well be old news to enterprise-scale developers, but as a freelancer coming from the smaller-company end of the spectrum this was a big deal.<p>As part of this process I developed a Python library [1] to facilitate writing evented&#x2F;RPCed systems (event sourced or otherwise), and wrote up some very rough architecture tips [2] as part of the documentation. They are pretty high level, but may be an interesting (somewhat opinionated) starting point.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lightbus.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lightbus.org</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lightbus.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;explanation&#x2F;architecture-tips&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lightbus.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;explanation&#x2F;architecture-tips&#x2F;</a><p>Edit: Link update')
