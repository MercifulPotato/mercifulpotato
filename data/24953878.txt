Certainly the anecdotes shown here would point much more to that - for example, its inability to turn sharply enough is indicative of some deep flaws.<p>&gt; If you think it&#x27;s wrong to do and are not doing either, you ought to articulate what scenario in terms of data would justify the action vs not, even if that data is unknown right now.<p>It&#x27;s wrong to do as long as you rely on CUSTOMERS to ensure safety. There is no further argument to be had: as long as the system is not PROVEN to be safer than a human driver even in the absence of human attention, it can&#x27;t be put into the hands of customers.<p>That is not to say that they shouldn&#x27;t be developing it, and paying and training people to operate it safely. That is what all other companies are in fact doing - taking a safe and responsible route, which is apparently too much to ask of the most highly valued car company in the world.')
