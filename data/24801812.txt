FFT alone is not enough, because the spectrum tends to be rather ambiguous. There&#x27;s still a pattern to it for every note played, so it should be possible to deduce a note with a neural net. But I just didn&#x27;t have time for that, maybe later.<p>PS. Give my thingy a try if you have a moment. I&#x27;m curious if it actually works with any pianos other than mine.')
