I don&#x27;t need fitness tracking, the Apple Watch&#x27;s screen was a little too hard to see outside, and the UI was too cluttered for the type of super-quick tasks I want to do on a watch. (I also really <i>really</i> disliked the lack of an always-on screen, which didn&#x27;t exist until a few months later.)<p>I like my Pebble because it&#x27;s a watch first and foremost—I&#x27;ve worn a watch since I was around ten years old—but it just so happens to also show me notifications, and glance at things like the weather and my calendar. And I can do all of that super quickly.')
