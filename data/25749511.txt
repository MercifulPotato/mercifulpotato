Before I could spend any time on designing and testing my business logic, I had to invest hours into making sure my boilerplate code was valid and provisioning infrastructure, not to mention setting up my cloud environment.<p>We built Amplication so that developers like us could focus on coding the parts that really matter, rather than get distracted by undifferentiated heavy lifting. Amplication is an open-source tool that lets you design your data schema and in return it generates for you a human-readable and editable TypeScript Node.js codebase. This server codebase includes a GraphQL API, REST API, authorization, authentication, admin UI, users management, logging utility, error handler, and much more right out of the box.<p>we generate your server code dynamically based on changes in your schema.\nYou can download the generated code or continuously push it to a GitHub repository to continue off and edit it further on your own.<p>For your convenience, we use a web UI to manage this whole operation and it is available for the community as a managed service on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.amplication.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.amplication.com</a>, or you can run your own Amplication server.\nIâ€™ll be more than happy to answer any questions you may have and get your feedback.')
