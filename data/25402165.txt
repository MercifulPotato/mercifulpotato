You make a terrific point:<p>&gt; <i>This logic makes sense, with one exception: this assumes that the standard for release quality remains unhindered pre&#x2F;post swapping the position of RHEL &#x2F; CentOS.</i><p>I don&#x27;t really have an answer for that.  It does seem like it would come down to &quot;trust&quot; and as a skeptical person I don&#x27;t like that very much.<p>As I think about it more, while we have realigned some economic incentives for the better, it does seem (in addition to your points) there might also be an &quot;incentive&quot; to break CentOS from time to time, just to remind enterprises who are using it that &quot;RHEL&quot; is the gold standard and CentOS is &quot;unsupported&quot; D-:  Knowing Red Hat and many of the volunteers that work on these projects, I would be shocked (and indeed would quit my job immediately) if such a thing were to happen, although it would be hard to prove.<p>That said such a thing would no doubt backfire.  There would be outrage of course, and it would hurt the CentOS brand (which also hurts RHEL since these days the two are inextricably linked).  We all fully expect another distro to &quot;take the place&quot; of old CentOS as a bug-for-bug rebuild (I&#x27;m excited about Rocky Linux personally) so not will there still be an option for that, but competition is great for quality of projects :-D<p>Anyway, much appreciate the comment :-)<p>I&#x27;ll keep mulling it over as well.')
