I&#x27;d been wondering if there were any good ones.<p>What does it look like?<p>There&#x27;s a video, but as usual I don&#x27;t want to watch a product video; I don&#x27;t want to disturb people by playing audio over the speakers, and it takes too long.<p>I scroll down… nope, no screenshots.<p>There&#x27;s &quot;Get Started for Free&quot;, but that&#x27;s going to lead to some complicated setup process.<p>Oh well, I&#x27;m not interested enough to investigate further.  Pass.<p>…Well, in reality I did investigate further, because I wanted to provide constructive feedback.<p>It looks like there are some screenshots on the Features page, but they should be on the front page.  Also, I didn&#x27;t initially realize there <i>was</i> a Features page, because with my browser window at 900 pixels wide (half of my MacBook Pro screen), the site dumps the navigation links at the top into a hamburger menu, which I didn&#x27;t notice and wouldn&#x27;t want to click.  Plus, even after clicking on the screenshots to zoom them, they are too small to comfortably read the text, because they&#x27;re fit to the window width minus some padding.  I&#x27;d have preferred if it just showed the screenshot at full size and let me scroll.<p>I guess this sort of narrow (but not phone-level narrow) window size is uncommon, so it&#x27;s probably not worth worrying about too much, but that is the experience I had.<p>Also... I tried clicking Get Started for Free.  It wants me to make an account.  That&#x27;s friction.  Oh, now it wants me to confirm my email.  More friction.  Where&#x27;s the email?  Oh, it went to spam, with a scary message in Gmail [1].  Yikes… you should figure out what&#x27;s going on with that.<p>I confirmed my email and now it prompts me to link my AWS account.  Well, finally.  I would have been more likely to sign up (if I were just a potential user rather than someone trying to provide feedback) if clicking the button on the homepage took me <i>directly</i> to the AWS login.<p>Well, I went ahead and connected…<p>More issues with my browser width - the Plans page is kind of broken. [2]<p>The service itself… seems fine for a launch.  I like the easy-to-understand breakdown of the monthly cost!  On the other hand, the service seems to just provide an overview rather than actually replacing the AWS console.  Maybe there would be more functionality if I got off of read-only mode, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how.<p>I proceeded to delete my account.  It did not automatically delete the CloudFormation stack that the signup process had me create, which is unfortunate.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drop.qoid.us&#x2F;fah8Eit5.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drop.qoid.us&#x2F;fah8Eit5.png</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drop.qoid.us&#x2F;Ek9ieSoh.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drop.qoid.us&#x2F;Ek9ieSoh.png</a>')
