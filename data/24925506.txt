Being the &quot;Excel expert&quot; at work is sometimes more valuable than being the Javascript expert.<p>It&#x27;s a commonplace observation that data has more value than code to companies. Lots of their data is in spreadsheets and databases (relational or otherwise). I&#x27;ve seen medium-sized companies running their operations in Filemaker, Access, and of course Excel. In big companies you&#x27;ll find departments using the same tools. Critical to the business, not technically interesting or challenging. Plenty of work&#x2F;money in that. Same for WordPress sites -- lots of them, most of them need work, not sexy or particularly challenging but you can get top dollar doing that.')
