I guess nowadays many client support web assembly, but for all practical purposes you need to use JavaScript to do any client side web programming.<p>On the server the advantage is much less clear-cut, but a lot of it boils down to “we want to use the same language for the front end and the backend“. Although in my experience this is actually a horrible idea, and tends to result in very messy code and lots of work arounds in practice.<p>Anyway for me personally I continue to use JavaScript because of a combination of wanting to build lightly-interactive webpages and because that really is what the job market demands. So many companies are dead-set on hiring someone with node, react, and whatever other JavaScript experience. I tried taking it off my resume at one point because I kind of hate it, but if you’re at all involved in full stack web development it’ll really hurt your career if you don’t do JavaScript.')
