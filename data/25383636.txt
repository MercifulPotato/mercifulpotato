As gowld points out, you can easily represent an exact 1 and an exact sqrt(2) simultaneously; all you need is compass and straightedge.<p>Interestingly, that&#x27;s as far as it goes; if you start with a line of length 1, compass and straightedge will let you construct a line with length equal to the square root of any rational number. You can do addition, multiplication, subtraction, division... and square roots, and there things come to a stop.')
