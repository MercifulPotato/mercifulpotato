Imaging the comparing the governance of large corporation vs. a small startup, it&#x27;s just different. The complexity and nuances of managing human organization will increase drastically when the headcount increases. That&#x27;s just common sense.<p>Also Ben is based in Taiwan, he should know better. The current Tsai Ing-wen&#x27;s regime actually oppressed free press and freedom of speech by terminating CTi News TV broasting license due to political reasons (since CTi New airs opposing views to her government and is generally seen as close to the mainland China).[1]<p>I don&#x27;t agree with Ben&#x27;s first rule of new default either:<p><pre><code>    First, it should be the default that free speech is a good thing, that more \n    information is better than less information, and that the solution to \n    misinformation is improving our ability to tell the difference, not futilely \n    trying to be China-lite without any of the upside.\n\n</code></pre>\nThe more information is NOT better at all. Information overload will cause great harm and push people to the extreme ideology, as we&#x27;ve seen in social media (facebook, twitter, google etc.) the self-reinforced bubble. And there are physical drawbacks to those too. The more noise and junk information the less likely you can make an informative decision.
