The short sellers are literally losing tens of billions of dollars, and I believe they are going to lose several times more within the next week.<p>The short sellers are overleveraged right now, and unless they find some bullshit way to fuck everybody (people are switching away from RobinHood in droves) then they are going to not just lose more money, but go insolvent.<p>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen, and rumors are Melvin is about to get a giant capital infusion, but it really seems like the short sellers are the ones that are fucked and believing otherwise is ignoring data and simply assuming nothing ever changes.  The fact that they&#x27;re doubling down is a sign of desperation, not strength.  It&#x27;s like saying Lehman Brothers can never lose money in 2008.')
