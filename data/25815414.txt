I find it a bit difficult to give a hard yes&#x2F;no, with the exception of the more polarized scenarios. For example, objectively-accounted (shared experience) abuse of employees is a big obvious one.<p>The concept of loyalty has a lot of understated depth to it. I think this is why you find people still working at companies that are even objectively awful. IMO consideration of one&#x27;s practice of loyalty is best as an ongoing process or even a conversation. And it&#x27;s really about relationships.<p>People who are gifted at thinking about relationships, thinking deeply, and taking their time to do so, can do pretty well at such companies in many cases. For example, while someone who expects to work for a fair company and has reasonably high ideals may get completely blown away by an awful work environment, the employees at the same org who are more nuanced in this kind of situation are thinking about the exact details of the give and take. They are mapping out the boundaries, quadrant by quadrant. They may even find their workplace a fascinating study in power dynamics. It&#x27;s stimulating for them, in a very intriguing way.<p>I observed this myself while preparing to leave a job. Long ago I worked for a company that had a lot of problems. As one example, they had monitored employee phone calls, listened in on a call wherein an employee shared with a friend that she was pregnant, and then terminated her employment. (She took them to court and won) I found this out about a month into my employment there. Then I found out a bunch of other nasty stuff about the company. The main IT guy started a private chat with me and dropped a ton of insider facts, after he found out I was leaving.<p>Personally, I had to leave. My health was more important to me than the weighing and considering factors. But I noticed that the people who stayed there had really figured out the web of intricate power factors. They knew where there were hard lines and where there was blur. They understood how to work with management so that they got what they wanted, sometimes, or usually. This relationship-puzzling factor is very much an understated stimulant for people who can do it. They feel like they are Neo in _The Matrix_. Inside their head it&#x27;s a powerful game.<p>On the outside, people like this look &quot;loyal&quot; to a lot of us who take more of a breezy, get-things-done approach to our work. We who may want to work for quality people who meet high standards, and return the same. But IMO on the inside these Matrix types are really counting on this loyal appearance as the solid foundation for their epic inner journey, in which all avenues are open. Power games, passive-aggressive behavior, I&#x27;ve even seen hacking of all varieties used in these cases. And they know the deal--I&#x27;m loyal on the outside, the company likes that. On the inside, on the deep inside, the company likes to turn a blind eye.<p>And most days are just fine, even if the company has a bad name and a bad reputation.<p>This is just one way in which loyalty gets really deep.')
