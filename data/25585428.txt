Especially if you happen to live in the eastern, more conservative part of the state, the judges here are more sympathetic to &quot;traditional&quot; family values and so are still very much aware of those guidelines. I am not a lawyer, consult a lawyer, but having been through this myself within the past few years, I know very much that even something that should be as obvious as a 50&#x2F;50 split is not obvious in the eyes of the law.<p>Or said another way - even if he has the legal right, that doesn&#x27;t mean he necessarily has the budget to fight it. Unfortunately, I found that Might Makes Right is a real thing in family law.')
