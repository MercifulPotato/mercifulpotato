Used it some, e.g. when, as a system engineer, I helped IT staff of one of our customers, a university processing exam results of tens of thousands of students from dozens of colleges affiliated to that univ.  IIRC, its UI was something like a read-only ed (google &quot;unix bfs command&quot;). You used it to scan really large (for the time) files, e.g. data files (input&#x2F;output) in large data processing environments, for purposes like checking if the input or output files anecdotally looked okay, no major noticeable garbage in them.\nHaven&#x27;t checked if it is present in modern Linuxes. Also don&#x27;t remember if it could handle large files without newlines. Likely not, if based on ed. Didn&#x27;t have such files to work on then.')
