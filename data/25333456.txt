If you are trading in something that exists in the real world (like energy savings), you already need some central authority to verify people are being honest, so a blockchain doesn&#x27;t provide any benefit over having that central authority manage the data.<p>I love the idea of having markets for more things (ex. in Ontario we have cap and trade for carbon emissions), but the blockchain idea makes no sense.')
