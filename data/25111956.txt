There are lots of people in these countries who this service would help. What you also seem to ignore is that many business in these countries would be helped by this.<p>Another thing you ignore is that if you combine Starlink with a mobile station you can potentially provide internet to a whole village.<p>Also, the prices will likely not be the same everywhere. SpaceX will want to get higher utility of the overall system and having unused sats fly over Africa is pointless. Lowering the price in some regions to get full utilization if an economic non-brainier if they would actually have issue selling the service.<p>In addition, the idea that this service wouldn&#x27;t be worth it for rural people in the first world is very questionable. Don&#x27;t rural people deserve good internet?')
