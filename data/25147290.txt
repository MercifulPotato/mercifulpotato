Until Halo came around, no one could make a FPS work because a controller was too slow and imprecise. Halo&#x27;s trick was to sloooow the action down.<p>The chunky thing was why making levels for DooM was so easy. Prodeus (early access) also has easy to use level editor, but currently the game has some design problems - such as dumb and slow monsters. Those in DooM were also dumb, but their AI was functional. They could swarm and surround you well enough. I honestly think Prodeus looks better than Doom Eternal, the art direction especially. But I don&#x27;t need as much ketchup.<p>I think games like these (Dusk, Graven, Ion Fury etc...) will sell in part because players&#x27; expectations have changed. Players have also realized that if they want action reminiscent of old FPS games, they can&#x27;t look towards AAA games because no AAA game will imitate the experience. It&#x27;s too much risk. You need to give smaller studios a chance, and the only way smaller studios can make it work is by limiting visual detail.')
