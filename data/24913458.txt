ZFC is fairly &quot;obvious&quot; when taught the right way. Unfortunately, most people do have not the privilege of a good set theory instructor.<p>2. Whether V equals Ultimate L, for example. There&#x27;s &quot;pop math&quot; coverage available [1], as well as more technical introductions by Woodin if you Google for them.<p>3. I&#x27;m not sure what reasons you&#x27;re referring to; can you enlighten me? I can guess, but the ones I&#x27;m guessing are not very good, and I&#x27;d rather not attribute weak arguments to you or them.<p>4. The Stacks Project, for one [2]. It covers most of the foundations of modern algebraic geometry, is of extremely high quality, and is regularly cited in research papers.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;to-settle-infinity-question-a-new-law-of-mathematics-20131126&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;to-settle-infinity-question-a...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stacks.math.columbia.edu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stacks.math.columbia.edu&#x2F;</a>')
