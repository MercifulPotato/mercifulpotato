Meanwhile, WTF is with the &quot;app store&quot; concept in the first place? You&#x27;re complaining that it isn&#x27;t fair that Apple and Google can block apps from their platforms, even though that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve actually done since the arrival of smartphones? Free software advocates (look me up) have been warning about this since day one of the app store. There&#x27;s nothing new here, other than the dispute of the day involves people&#x27;s ability to type whatever they want in messages to some platform rather than some other feature that Apple&#x2F;Google think doesn&#x27;t fit with their intended platform ecosystems.<p>I wasn&#x27;t quoting anyone. The double-quotes were an alternative to using hyphens to create a run-on phrase that attempted to describe how I see some people talking about these corporations.<p>If I understand your last line correctly, you believe there is some category called &quot;platform&quot; which needs to be treated differently. Are you calling for new laws to define what a platform is? If I create my own &quot;dwitter&quot;, will your new laws allow me to have to any say over what people can post to it?')
