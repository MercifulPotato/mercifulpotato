He’s terrible with computers, he single-finger types (despite all my attempts to help him improve over the years), and still loves it.<p>His college has him pre-recording lectures, which the students can watch the following day (and can rewatch them). He doesn’t have to travel, doesn’t have to be “on” that day to teach, and doesn’t have to deal with managing students. He just sits down in front of his laptop and gives his presentation.<p>He interacts with his students more, it’s way easier to field questions from people over the course of a day, as they all watch the lecture, than it is to try to force out some questions with the leftover time at the end of a lecture.<p>He was definitely looking to retire before covid, but I sense a renewed passion as he’s finally discovered the digital frontier.')
