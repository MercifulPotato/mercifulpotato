It&#x27;s becoming a standard practice for many organizations to involve UX designers and researchers from the very initial phase of designing a product or feature. They use existing data, user-research, user-testing, and popular best practices before pushing changes to production.<p>So more UX focus is happening before release phases instead of after release, which means there will be much less opportunities for UX improvements after the release of each feature.<p>Also analyzing and tracking is a default everywhere now. So many feature requests are already backed with data related to user-behavior. Which means many of them kind of include UX improvements.<p>I think UX impact is bigger than before. But, it&#x27;s becoming part of the process and it&#x27;s more mature now.')
