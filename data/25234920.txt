The article makes it clear that the Sackler family felt this was true for the services provided by McKinsey.<p>You&#x27;ll note that those are similar metrics that are associated with sex workers.  The primary difference between consultants and prostitutes is that being the former is <i>usually</i> (but not always) less degrading.<p>None of the above should be all that surprising to anyone.  The question then becomes: &quot;What, if anything, should we do about it?&quot;<p>I posit that we should make the <i>costs</i> of ethical lapses higher than the potential profit of same.<p>We certainly don&#x27;t have that now.  Perhaps we should work to change that?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hainesandlagerquist.com&#x2F;understanding-utilization-realization-profitability-professional-services-firm&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hainesandlagerquist.com&#x2F;understanding-utilizatio...</a><p>[1] &#x27;Quality&#x27; in this context is generally defined as &quot;achieving whatever result the client desires.&quot;')
