In my review I specifically used the term &quot;complexity fetishist&quot; to describe the kind of player who might enjoy the game <i>too much</i>.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say there&#x27;s anything wrong with the game. It actually felt kind of weird to not recommend it since it was a pretty darned good execution of what it set out to be, I just couldn&#x27;t ever actually suggest to someone that they play it. Either they wouldn&#x27;t like dealing with the needlessly ever increasing in complexity goldbergian monstrosity, or worse they actually would.<p>I think the game&#x27;s popularity among developers highlights a core problem with our industry. Look at Factorio, then look at all of the over engineering, the layers upon layers of abstraction, the obsessive need to keep making software larger and more complicated only to eventually tear it down and rebuild the exact same thing with the new-hotness widgets...')
