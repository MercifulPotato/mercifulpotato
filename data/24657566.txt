Similarly for attempts to bring programming syntax closer to math syntax. In college I found myself translating equations of medium complexity such as the Fourier transform into pseudocode to understand.<p>Obviously however, my familiarity with programming notation colours my perspective as much as their experience with math notation colours theirs')
