The demand was huge, but due to side-effects of the corona pandemic, bike production in Asia was running on at most 80% capacity. Some assembly lines were stopped for several weeks, and distancing rules means reduced throughput. The problem: all orders with the big manufacturers are placed a year in advance. This means that if you were too late to place your orders in 2020, you will not get any inventory for 2021. Any by &quot;too late&quot; I mean &quot;the same time as in 2019&quot;.<p>People want to buy, but stock is depleted and production reduced, and many small dealers won&#x27;t survive 2021 for lack of inventory.')
