In that universe that appears to be what’s going on, but it’s the evidence that leads them in that direction.<p>I don’t buy that the “creator” cared about her feelings. In the book, the aliens she meets are just a more advanced inhabitant of the universe, they don’t know its origin either.<p>Religion usually does away with evidence to rely on faith based reasoning (which is basically what the movie does). The reason I don’t like the movie is it distorts the book’s point to be the opposite of what it was.')
