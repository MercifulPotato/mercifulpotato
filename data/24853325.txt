Whether to charge you with reckless is up to the cop, but without evidence—especially since cop cars have dash cams—it’s not likely to stick; especially for a first offense. (And OP asked what misdemeanor he <i>committed</i> anyway). And it’s very very easy to not drive above the legal limit for alcohol or to not drive recklessly.<p>I’m not disagreeing with your overall point (although usually it’s expressed as people committing felonies every day) but these examples just aren’t making your point.<p>Interestingly, violating the public health orders here has been a misdemeanor, and it’s pretty easy to have accidentally violated one for a moment.')
