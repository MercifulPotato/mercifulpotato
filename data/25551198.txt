That&#x27;s the least I can do for someone that will try to help me.<p>While I&#x27;m adding this context, my assumptions, what went wrong, what I&#x27;ve tried and so forth, I often notice I solve the issue on my own!<p>I&#x27;d say more than half of the times I act to open an issue or ask a question, I figure out the issue myself midway.<p>I guess talking to oneself out loud and writing question-reports are a variation of the rubber duck method.')
