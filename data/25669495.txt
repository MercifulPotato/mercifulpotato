Item(by='IkmoIkmo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610015752, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25664768, text='&gt; My point is more like, 10x the number of people could be dying of COVID per day than are dying right now, and I would care about 10x more than I care about all those people who are dying of heart disease, which would still be an indescribably small amount of care, even with the multiplier. I am not making the argument that it&#x27;s &quot;just a flu&quot;, but I will make the argument that it&#x27;s &quot;just death&quot;. Death is. Only a sheltered person is emotionally distraught because of this; and in turn, only a person who cannot handle this perspective would deem it logical to permanently damage society in order to reduce this number.<p>What are you talking about? 3500 died in a single day, that&#x27;s a 9&#x2F;11. Multiply it by tenfold like you said, and do it for a year, you&#x27;re looking at 12.7 million Americans dying alone. Is that a death rate you don&#x27;t care about? For comparison, the 1st world war, second world war, vietnam war, korean war, war in afghanistan, war in iraq, combined, gets you to about 0.45m casualties.<p>And that&#x27;s in one year and one country. On a global scale it&#x27;d be insane, and again, just one year. A year in which a vaccine is rolled-out and can end the lockdown. Ending that lockdown now without having rolled-out the vaccine makes no sense.')
