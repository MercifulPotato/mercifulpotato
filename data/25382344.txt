The business types disagree strongly.<p>The religious types have had complaints about LGBT. Again, the business types disagree strongly.<p>So there you have the business types being almost libertarian, fighting against the rest of the party. They won&#x27;t get tossed out because they bring most of the money.<p>Sometimes the religious and pro-America types are at odds over immigration. Mormons and Catholics are particularly fond of immigration.<p>Supporting Trump or not is partly a matter of priority. The business types more concerned with regulations will support Trump. The ones trying to run factories in America will support Trump, but the ones trying to outsource production won&#x27;t. Mormons see that Trump made the first openly gay appointment (ambassador to Germany) and built over 500 miles of wall, so they aren&#x27;t too happy despite liking the supreme court appointments.<p>And yes, there is style. Some people like the smooth-talking political dishonesty that we&#x27;ve had for decades. There is the idea that that is somehow proper. Trump fans hate that stuff.')
