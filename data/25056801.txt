Even if you disagree with the point being made it&#x27;s always insightful to hear another point of view. Whether the insight is regarding the point itself or why others hold this different point of view. Discourse is one of our best tools for understanding the world around us and we should always appreciate it.<p>For some reason we have almost completely lost the ability to disagree with each other civilly. I&#x27;m not going to bother opening the can of worms as to why I think we have but I think something that can help is a reminder that: if someone&#x27;s opinion is at odds with yours it does not invalidate yours or you in anyway, and we should never treat it as an attack on us even when we think it is meant as one. There&#x27;s no winner in that game.')
