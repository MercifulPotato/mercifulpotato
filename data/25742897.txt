And why do journalists so rarely call left wing denialism (e.g., blank slatism) or even something a little murkier like the propensity to impute discrimination on every disparity? No one is asking you to argue that the Trump position is equally meritorious to the left wing position, but if you want to bring Trump supporters back into the fold or at least reduce the rate that youâ€™re creating them, then giving them some courtesy representation here and there in the media <i>if only to explain why their points of view are misinformed</i> might not be a bad approach. In general, respect consistently and earnestly applied can be a pretty potent thing.')
