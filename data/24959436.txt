Two days after he tested positive, the following happened:<p>* The school was closed and deep cleaned<p>* Close contacts and close contacts of those contacts went into quarantine. This ended up being approximately 800 people.<p>* All of them were tested within 48 hours and even further contacts (not &quot;close&quot;) were also tested to the point that approximately 5000 tests were done and no additional cases were found.<p>You can&#x27;t do that tracing and isolation if there is wide community transmission.')
