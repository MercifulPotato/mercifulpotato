Item(by='jerf', descendants=None, kids=[24758984], score=None, time=1602532302, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756758, text='I think it&#x27;s important to break the conversation clearly into two parts: Here&#x27;s what could be true about aliens if we&#x27;re largely correct about physics, and here&#x27;s what could be true ignoring that constraint.<p>The problem is people want to have really muddled conversations about that. The people having the second kind of conversation yelling at the people having the first kind of conversation is probably the most frustrating element of all, especially when they strike a morally superior pose which is, IMHO, entirely unjustified.<p>If you want to ignore all current science and astrophysics when you discuss aliens... fine. Be my guest. No sarcasm. I have some beliefs on that front myself. BUT... you need to <i>be aware</i> that you&#x27;re basically engaging in groundless speculation, and in particular, you have no grounds to be yelling at people about <i>their</i> groundless speculation.<p>We can have a much more grounded discussion about what aliens could look like if we are largely correct about science. And there&#x27;s no need to accuse people about being &quot;arrogant&quot; if they choose to have that discussion, because frankly, of the two, it&#x27;s the more <i>interesting</i> one. The &quot;well, what if we&#x27;re wrong about everything?&quot; may seem like fun for a moment, but there&#x27;s no <i>there</i> there, really. What if we&#x27;re wrong about everything? Well, what if we are? What if we&#x27;re all just in an ancestor simulation... but the descendants running it are super-advanced <i>honey bees</i> running <i>their</i> ancestors and we just happen to be around? Well... what if? There&#x27;s nowhere to go, or if you prefer, there&#x27;s nowhere you <i>can&#x27;t</i> go, which is actually the exact same thing.<p>On the other hand, if we stick to biology and cosmology and relativity and science in general, we can have all sorts of interesting discussions. What about that result on Venus? That&#x27;s a question rich enough to build a concrete career on. What <i>would</i> aliens look like in our real universe? How much more advanced could they be? <i>Would</i> they, in fact, build rather human-sized spaceships that are apparently capable of crossing the interstellar void, but not flying around in our atmosphere without crashing into things? Would they in fact need to keep kidnapping humans over and over for decades on end? Sensible discussions can be had on these matters if we start from a concrete base. The whole &quot;But what if we&#x27;re, like, wrong about everything and we&#x27;re, like, actually soap bubbles floating in the wind?&quot; discussion has nowhere interesting to go, because it creates just one big undifferentiated and indistiguishable mismash of what ifs.')
