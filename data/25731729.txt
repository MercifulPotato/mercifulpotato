The blame for Myanmar violence should be placed squarely on the people that are spreading misinformation that incites violence.  Even if Facebook does a better job policing content, don&#x27;t you think these perpetrators will find an equally effective technology to spread their propaganda?  If not now, then in the future surely they will?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do think Facebook should police clear misinformation that can lead to human suffering, but it seems like the media want to convince me to hate Facebook.  I hate the people behind this misinformation.  And, I would love Facebook to get involved, but I don&#x27;t hate them.')
