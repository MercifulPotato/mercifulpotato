After you take a few days off (I do one weekend a month and one week a year) try taking a smaller dose.<p>Everyone&#x27;s tolerance and needs can change drastically over time. If you stay at the same dose forever without breaks you&#x27;ll have no concept of if the medication is still working for you - much like your 3rd point. I took 40mg&#x2F;day in my 20s, down to 30mg a year ago, and now up to 35mg&#x2F;day in covid times.')
