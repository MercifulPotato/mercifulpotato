They don&#x27;t HAVE to pay for those calls, but if Yelp&#x27;s system decides an order took place then they get charged for the call. Based on some experimenting done recently by a podcast I listen to (can&#x27;t remember which one right now), that decision boils down to &quot;if the call was longer than 45 seconds and food was discussed, then an order took place&quot;. It&#x27;s then up to the restaurant owner to reconcile and dispute any charged calls that didn&#x27;t end in a sale. That means listening to the recording of every call that was charged and requesting a refund for each one that didn&#x27;t end in an order.')
