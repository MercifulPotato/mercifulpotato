It&#x27;s just like any other Java&#x2F;Groovy application. You set a breakpoint in the build file or some Gradle source file and you attach a debugger. In this respect, it&#x27;s probably more debug-friendly than, say Makefiles where all you can do is add some print statements or go through megabytes of debug output.')
