Item(by='reissbaker', descendants=None, kids=[25935546, 25935141], score=None, time=1611785925, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25930969, text='&quot;Melvin and Citadel can BUY GME themselves to mitigate the risk.&quot;<p>Melvin buying GME is not &quot;mitigating,&quot; it&#x27;s closing the short position. If you close your short position high, you got screwed and you lost money. They did close it recently... At a massive loss.<p>&quot;I firmly believe that the hedge funds that held GME short positions have bought into GME to mitigate their exposure. They likely bought in algorithmically using robinhood data and are making money off of retail right now.&quot;<p>How... Would &quot;making money off of retail&quot; in a pernicious sense be possible right now? If a retail trader on WSB bought in at $20, and sold at $200, they got 1000% ROI on their trades. Do you think that a bank secretly snuck in greater than 1000% ROI? The WSB trader got 1000% ROI, but the bank got 2000% ROI on the set of trades? The stock would have to be trading at $600 and the bank secretly pocketed $400 for that to happen.<p>Sure, the HFT front-run orders. But they are constantly buying <i>and selling</i> the shares they trade, they&#x27;re not just buying. They don&#x27;t get the buy-and-hold wins that the slow retail traders got off of a rally like this. HFT make money by providing liquidity, not by buying and holding GME.<p>Also, just as a technicality, Melvin is not a high frequency trader. They are not the same people front-running Robinhood orders. Melvin lost big time.<p>&quot;My message to the people here: ... you are still losing&quot;<p>My message to the people here: if you got &gt;1000% ROI, you won. Don&#x27;t let randos on HN make you feel bad.<p>(Close your position though.)')
