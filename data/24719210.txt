I&#x27;m fairly conservatarian, I wouldn&#x27;t mind if pot was legal. But pro-legalization groups often talk about it as if legalized pot was completely void of negative externalities. And that is wrong. It is fair to argue that the negative effects of criminalization take a larger toll on the public than legalization. But chronic marijuana use makes you <i>stupid</i>. Like, really, really fucking stupid. And that isn&#x27;t good either. I think the legalization movement would serve itself best in convincing red states to legalize pot as well if it was open about the fact that there are bad things about pot, and making an argument of societal harm reduction. Not harm elimination.')
