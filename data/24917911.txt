Item(by='ChrisMarshallNY', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603888106, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24917487, text='Thanks for sharing that. I am most interested in working with folks where I can make a difference; not just be a coding cog.<p>I&#x27;m spoiled. In my open-source work, I&#x27;ve done some fairly significant (but still below-the-radar) stuff, and got used to basic, simple, respect; without people trying to wrestle me into some kind of subservient role. That&#x27;s not to say that we didn&#x27;t have disagreements. Quite the opposite, in fact. I&#x27;ve done Service for some of the most disagreeable people that you can imagine, and left them happy and enthused.<p>So I actually looked at a few startups. I have a fairly unique conflux of skills and experience that could make an <i>enormous</i> difference in small teams. What I found, is that they imagine themselves to be &quot;mini-FAANGs,&quot; and treat their prospects pretty badly. I know that startups tend to have rather chaotic, personality-laced workplaces (see &quot;working with difficult people,&quot; above), but if they can&#x27;t keep that crap out of their triage interview, then the place, itself, must be a nightmare.<p>I&#x27;m working for free, for a friend. I stepped in, because I watched him being set up by contract houses that were obviously going to do very bad work, for lots of money (they barely hid it; I guess because he&#x27;s non-technical, and doesn&#x27;t know better). Since he&#x27;s doing an NPO, and looking at grants for funding, he can&#x27;t afford that kind of object lesson.<p>Instead, he&#x27;s getting a platform that would make a lot of &quot;big houses&quot; green with envy. For free. This is something that I have a lot of prior art in. It&#x27;s already pretty awesome, and I&#x27;ve only been working on it for a month.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to be said (and gained) by simply treating people with basic respect, and motivating them. The workplace is not the military. If we treat our employees and co-workers badly, they won&#x27;t stick around. If we treat them well, they could do some pretty amazing stuff.')
