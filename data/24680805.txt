The issue here is not the act of pre-registration, but the friction it imposes.  I know most of the experiments and research I have done could have been summarized at the time in 10 minutes - to the effect of &quot;I will manipulate variable X over time ranges Y, this is supported by &lt;source or professional explanation&gt; and I expect Z&quot;, or even &quot;We performed a gradient over variables X and Y expecting to modulate Z and looked for phenotypes not previously described for further characterization&quot;.<p>My experience in research is that there is very little pre-commitment on this level of granularity.  Grant applications should be at the level of &quot;We hope to study X because it is known to be correlated with Y and are hoping to elucidate a mechanistic relationship between these two&quot;. The experiments which go into proving such should more closely resemble mathematical proofs, is a viewpoint I currently hold.')
