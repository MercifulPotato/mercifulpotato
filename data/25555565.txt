The author is hugely engrossed with classic literature even as a teenager on walkabout -- the passage where he frightens a passerby because he&#x27;s solo-reenacting scenes from epic poetry rather too enthusiastically, to keep himself entertained while on the trudge, is very memorable -- and it wasn&#x27;t long after that journey concluded that he volunteered to go fight Fascism in the most literal sense possible.')
