For most organizations, trusting a major videoconferencing vendor is going to be within their risk tolerance. For some organizations (or for some use-cases within organizations) this wouldn&#x27;t be acceptable (or perhaps trusting Zoom wouldn&#x27;t be acceptable, where a different vendor might be), but at this point you&#x27;re starting to stray outside of Zoom&#x27;s target market and into a set of more specialized requirements.<p>Defending against sophisticated state-level actors goes even further beyond the requirements of most businesses. Unless you had a specific reason to believe that you were a target of such actors (dealing with national security, or matters of significant national strategic importance), you couldn&#x27;t justify investing much resource into such defensive measures.')
