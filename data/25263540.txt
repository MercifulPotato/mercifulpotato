Spammers just bake bit.ly links into the image which I doubt have a much lower hit rate than usual spam.<p>Meanwhile, every time I find a new account I like and want to see what they&#x27;re all about, I have to use a search engine because all of their posts just say &quot;link in bio&quot; for the context and additional content, but their bio link has long since changed. This is a clear dark pattern to keep people in their walled garden and I really can&#x27;t see any other explanation.<p>(they do allow links for ads though, which are usually just spam anyways, so that reinforces this even further)')
