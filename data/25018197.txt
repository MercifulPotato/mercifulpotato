Where does your knowledge of AI come from?<p>Edit: I&#x27;m asking because there is evident in your comment a confusion that is all too common on the internets today, of thinking of &quot;GOFAI&quot; (symbolic AI) and &quot;ML&quot; (machine learning) as two somehow incompatible and perhaps exclusive sub-fields of AI. This is as far from the truth as it could be, for instance machine learning really took off as a subject of research in the 1980&#x27;s with the work of Ryszard Michalski and others, who considered machine learning approaches for the purpose of overcoming the &quot;knowledge acquisition bottleneck&quot;, i.e. the difficulty of hand-crafting production rules for expert systems. Indeed, most of the early machine learning systems were propositional-logic based, i.e. symbolic. And of course, one of the most widely used and well-known type of machine learning approach used to this day, decision trees, hail from that time and also learn propositional logic, symbolic models.<p>Of course, most people today know &quot;ML&quot; as a byword for deep learning, or at best statistical pattern recognition (if that). It&#x27;s just another aberration brought on by the sudden explosion of interest in a once small field.<p>I refer you to Michalski&#x27;s textbook, &quot;Machine Learning: An Artificial Intelligence Approach&quot; and Tom Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Machine Learning&quot; for more information on the early days of the field, i.e. until ca. 2000.')
