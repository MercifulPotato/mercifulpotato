Even just one stop would ruin my sleep. Beds are awful. Regular (ie not high speed) train tracks are awfully noisy. Nothing enjoyable about it, just get into a &quot;container&quot; cabin, wake up in a new town with a beat up body from continuous 12hr motion and noise that is 1000x worse than most modern jetliners (A380, 787, A350...)<p>During my long 13 yr stride as a consultant in Europe I&#x27;ve tried every possible combination of hotel, flight and trains (and car rental, ships...). The night train is a tourist trap. But also probably good fun for the adventurous at heart. The night train <i>cabin</i> may be a tourist attraction even, an experience you should live once in your life... If you are into that kind of thing. Because to me it is really not worth the trouble. Get a flight or a high speed train and a decent hotel or airbnb. Wake up to a great breakfast cooked in a real kitchen with fresh produce and hit the streets all set and good to go.')
