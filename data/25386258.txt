Item(by='Macha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607697491, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25380107, text='&quot;trackingEnabled: 0&quot; does not require consent and lets you acknowledge<p>&quot;consentId: abc134&quot; then looking that up in or even &quot;consentDenied: exact timestamp&quot; could be used to identify a user so would require consent. I suspect lots of companies want to use the second so they can choose to bug you for [more] consent at a later date, or choose to interpret the first as not allowed in case bugging the user again enough times does get consent.')
