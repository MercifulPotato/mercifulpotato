I would add one caveat: The culture of your work environment has a huge bearing on these decisions.<p>Reminds me of something I read, like an illegal life tip; Don&#x27;t fix an unknown problem because if it goes wrong people often won&#x27;t understand or care about your good intentions and you will end up with blame (blame culture).<p>Whereas if a problem where to occur on production, and you were to fix it, well then you would be &quot;hero&quot;.<p>Not trying to advocate for any particular way but just trying to reframe the question in more of a political&#x2F;human way as opposed to an engineering one.')
