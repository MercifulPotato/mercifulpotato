Do EU companies simply not sue against that in US courts? I tried looking for cases like that, but I couldn&#x27;t really find any examples.<p><i>&gt; Everyone agreed to the same laws, and agreed to allow foreigners to sue domestic businesses, so it doesn&#x27;t matter who has jurisdiction over what.</i><p>China is also member of TRIPS, don&#x27;t have Americans the right to sue in China? Why is that not good enough when it&#x27;s apparently good enough for EU PDO being violated in the US?')
