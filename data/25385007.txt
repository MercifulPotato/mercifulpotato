Create a gamified tool for a specific niche. To make a high-quality one, do something related to a domain&#x2F;hobby your are passionate about. For example, if you enjoy cooking, create a gamified educational cooking app, where you actually learn how to hook. Do you like playing the drums? Create a Music School simulator (eg. you are the teacher, get students, you teach them, something like Game Dev Tycoon).<p>That being said, actually earning money with a game is REALLY hard UNLESS you go for a specific niche, which makes it a lot easier to market your game or ask money for the game.')
