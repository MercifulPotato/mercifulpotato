Thanks for mentioning the bit about the forge&#x2F;kiln, as I haven’t seen that part either.<p>The major pain point in his workflow is working with scans from older scanners and their file format quirks. He usually opens those scans in a less-capable but more compatible software, then exports to the format his main software uses, which is made by the vendor of his milling machine. Definitely risks of vendor lock-in, but he is aware of the trade-offs and is always looking for better technology. The pricing of the hardware and software seems pretty steep and maybe ripe for disruption, but for his workflow, he’s still pretty happy with how much he makes for how hard he works.')
