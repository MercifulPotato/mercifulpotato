Even if you leave your heaters on unnecessarily, you&#x27;re just letting the same heat out from your living room instead of letting the same amount of heat escape directly from a fumarole. The heat will have been released either way, and whether you leave your heater on or not only changes where the heat gets released from.<p>Whereas if you were using, say, nuclear power, leaving your heaters on means that you are wasting nuclear fuel and generating heat that wouldn&#x27;t have been released had you turned your heaters off.')
