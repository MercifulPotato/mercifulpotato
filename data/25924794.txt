Item(by='gorgoiler', descendants=None, kids=[25924972], score=None, time=1611726873, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25924269, text='<i>Circuit Playground</i> is the hardware product that goes hand in hand with <i>CircuitPython</i>, but you’ll probably want to program it using <i>makecode</i> instead.<p>Version 2 called “Circuit Playground Express” is currently very popular.  V1 is obsolete, and there’s a version 3 with Bluetooth.  All of them are pre-built with sensors, RGB LEDs, and buttons.  This removes a huge hurdle: no soldering required.  (Soldering is a fun skill but so is baking bread and cross country hiking — most kids are usually 100% focused on making blinking lights and don’t want to do anything tangential.)<p>Right now, only version 2 is supported by <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;makecode.adafruit.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;makecode.adafruit.com</a>.  <i>makecode</i> is different to <i>CircuitPython</i>: you write your code in JavaScript either using a visual block language or directly in the online JS IDE — both of which are very high quality dev environments with excellent discoverability — and compile everything into a new .UF2 firmware for the device to load each time.  The site <i>provides an emulator</i> which is another killer feature.  You can go there right now and start programming a board.<p><i>CircuitPython</i> on the other hand is itself a pre baked UF2 firmware with a Python interpreter built in.  Because your dev tools (runtime, debugger) are now on the device you have less memory to play with and it’s less stable, in my experience.  It’s also not immediately obvious how to get things done, compared with the makecode IDE.<p>With my teenage pupils it was only the makecode JS &#x2F; block programming that lit up their eyes.  The Python tools were too weird.  Devices like this are about playfulness and doing weird stuff, and only tangentially about programming, I’ve found.<p>The killer feature of <i>Circuit Playground</i> was the v2&#x2F;“Express” (CPE) board with its infrared transmit and receive functionality.  Connectivity turns these things from toys into real hacking platforms.  I spent the holidays making IR “WiFi” for a pool of 8 CPEs.<p>The v3 Bluetooth-enabled board sounds great but it won’t be as popular with my classes if it doesn’t support <i>makecode</i> (which it currently does not.)')
