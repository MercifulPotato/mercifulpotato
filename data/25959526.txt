I know there are ongoing efforts to do exactly that, but it&#x27;s a hard problem and obviously hasn&#x27;t had 100% success so far.<p>I think the next best way to reduce poaching, though, is to meet the demand with a legal supply. License and regulate farms for the black rhino and any other animal that is a frequent victim of poaching. Obviously this is also hard, but it better aligns incentives. The farmers are, of course, going to care more about their animals than the wild ones, but they would also have a profit motive to reduce poaching of wild ones (because it will reduce their competition).')
