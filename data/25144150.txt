I don&#x27;t get on with vim and have the very basic editor &#x2F; navigation commands down in emacs, but finding well written learning resources past that point seems really difficult. Should I learn a package manager before Emacs lisp? Or start learning some of the built in more advanced functionality past opening and editing files?<p>I&#x27;m struggling to find resources as well as understanding what to learn next and it&#x27;s proving quite a blocker.')
