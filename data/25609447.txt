I think we just need more awareness, first?<p>Social life in prison involves having &quot;friends&quot; who can any day decide to try and rob or fight you (both happened to me with my closest &quot;friend&quot;). Nobody has real friends. It&#x27;s dog eat dog, you lose the ability to trust, and don&#x27;t have any trusting social connections. That&#x27;s extremely painful. When you talk to people on the outside, every prisoner just tries to deceive them into thinking things are just dandy: I&#x27;m not sure why that happens, but it means those connections aren&#x27;t real either. It&#x27;s all so much worse psychologically than is conveyed in popular media. We don&#x27;t know how to quantify psychological suffering though; as a society we rather put people through huge amounts of that than some visible physical suffering (which, again, is probably strongly preferable to the criminal).<p>Unfortunately most of the people suffering in the prison system are poor, so we don&#x27;t hear what they have to say. If you&#x27;re rich, you can afford your own lawyer and get a much better plea deal, and get out quickly. It&#x27;s also very racist: you will really understand Black Lives Matter when you meet a black father who was sentenced to 30 years in prison for a nonviolent drug offense, and realize there are 100,000s - millions of people in the exact same situation: it&#x27;s destroying entire communities. I&#x27;ve seen the way black people who a judge has never seen before are villified from their appearance: go to a courtroom near you if you don&#x27;t believe me, it&#x27;s shocking. I&#x27;m talking about in San Francisco, not even a rural area.<p>Anyways, thank you for your empathy. I wish more people understood that criminals will commit less crime if they&#x27;re forgiven and accepted by society, instead of villified. And it&#x27;s also the decent thing to do. Prisons are bad cultures because the small number of actual bad actors push everything to this shitty equilibrium: most prisoners individually have a lot of shame about their crimes, and as strong a moral code as the average person. Some definitely do not: and it&#x27;s hard for the justice system to make the distinction.<p>All things which are hard to believe until you have some real world experience with these things...')
