Item(by='fastball', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607367468, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25330040, text='&gt; white people own 80% of small businesses<p>But white people are 73% of the US population. Obviously it&#x27;d be nice if everything was proportional, but all things considered (how recently black people got fully equal rights, for example), I think 7% over-representation is pretty damn good, not &quot;real bad&quot;, and the trend is heading in the right direction. Seems like a gap that is very doable to close with purely &quot;encourage everyone to start a business&quot; policies, and egalitarian policies like those should be the preference when possible. With respect to men vs. women, I think a similar argument should be made. Women were &lt; 30% of the workforce ~70 years ago, and still haven&#x27;t even made it to 50%. Given the importance and biological realities around childbirth, I&#x27;m not sure women ever will be 50% (until we grow babies ex-vivo, that is). But as long as trends are positive, it is better not to use regulation as an attempt to overcompensate for perceived inequalities, as that can (and does) frequently backfire. Even if the number of women-led businesses is not going up, you can&#x27;t just assume this is because women are actively being prevented&#x2F;discouraged from doing so, you need to <i>demonstrate</i> that. Because an alternate explanation is that women (for whatever reason, maybe they like healthy work&#x2F;life balances?) are choosing, very much of their own free will and without undue pressure from society, to not start businesses at a higher rate than men.<p>&gt; Maybe it&#x27;s 5x, maybe even 10x, but not 270x<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem to be a particularly rational stance. If you don&#x27;t have a good reason behind why it should be one multiple and not another, I don&#x27;t think its your place to decide that multiple. This sounds a lot like the oft-repeated &quot;nobody should be a <i>billionaire</i>&quot;. Um, why not? A billion dollars is an arbitrary amount of value. For example, a billion Zimbabwean dollars in 2008 wouldn&#x27;t buy a coke[1]. Obviously in the case of USD <i>right now</i>, $1B is a lot of value. But if I make some useful piece of software (entirely on my own) that I sell to 100,000,000 people for $10 each, why should I not be a billionaire? Again, if you don&#x27;t have a rational (rather than emotional) underlying argument for why X amount of value is &quot;too much&quot;, it is not your place to decide that number.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe</a>')
