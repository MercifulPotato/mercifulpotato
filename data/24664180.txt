Item(by='falcolas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601655710, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24662523, text='&gt; To believe that borders are conducive to peace sounds like a bad case of internet-brain.<p>There&#x27;s an old saying about this: &quot;Good Fences make Good Neighbors&quot;. A fence (border) make it easy to say &quot;you can&#x27;t plant that tree there.&quot;<p>Borders (largely) define where one government can affect resources claimed by another government. For example, it would suck if it was easy for the US to send loggers into Canada&#x27;s forests because the US claims that those forests belong to them. A border makes it clear that &quot;forest X is within Canada&#x27;s borders, and thus belongs to Canada&quot;.<p>The location of the border may still be disputed, but it simplifies a lot of other interactions.<p>On the flip side, borders also make it easier to create accountability for a resource (like who maintains roads near&#x2F;between countries).')
