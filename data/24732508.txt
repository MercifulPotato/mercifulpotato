That&#x27;s definitely NOT something you can say generally of Christians. The ones saying crazy stuff get all the attention, but it&#x27;s not as mainstream as you might have been led to believe.<p>For example, current (I think) Catholic doctrine is similar to the Islamic position you describe:<p>Though faith is above reason, there can never be any real discrepancy between faith and reason. Since the same God who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason on the human mind, God cannot deny himself, nor can truth ever contradict truth. ... Consequently, methodical research in all branches of knowledge provided it is carried out in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can never conflict with the faith, because the things of the world and the things of faith derive from the same God. The humble and persevering investigator of the secrets of nature is being led, as it were, by the hand of God despite himself, for it is God, the conserver of all things, who made them what they are.<p>So that&#x27;s a rather large fraction of Christians. (I was raised Catholic, and, &quot;truth cannot contradict truth&quot; -- obviously a reference to the same thing as this catechism -- was what I was told on this question. So from my perspective, this wasn&#x27;t just an obscure position, but something actively taught.)<p>If you&#x27;re interested, here&#x27;s a link to the wikipedia article, which has links to other sources: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Science_and_the_Catholic_Church#cite_note-3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Science_and_the_Catholic_Churc...</a>')
