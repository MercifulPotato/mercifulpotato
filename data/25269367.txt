It&#x27;s just a nightmare to manage reliability. With AWS or any other IaaS provider you&#x27;re paying to outsource shifts of people around the clock that will work to keep servers and network connections up and running.<p>Colocation isn&#x27;t that much better either because there are still situations (like corrupt filesystems or malfunctioning power supplies) that would require physical access to the machine.<p>With an IaaS provider you&#x27;re free to go live wherever you want and focus on your business and not need to schedule shifts of people within driving distance of the colocation facility on-call.<p>Ultimately you&#x27;re paying to reclaim time, which in almost all cases for startups is a worthwhile trade. Outsource everything that isn&#x27;t your core business.')
