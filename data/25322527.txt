The European system is based on their regulatory framework. If you have a complaint that is clearly managed within that framework (my laundry machine spontaneously broke down within the statutory warranty period) they&#x27;ll comply, else, yeah, good luck. I moved in the other direction (to the US) and I&#x27;m amazed when my wife gets a $50 little blender replaced at Macy&#x27;s after we worked it to its limits for three or four years. For all the complaining about how things aren&#x27;t how they used to be anymore, the US is great on customer service.')
