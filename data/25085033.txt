This has made it possible to target their testing and tracking in a way that is highly effective.<p>The not wearing shoes inside really needs to be called out as bunk on two levels.  First of all, coronavirus is extremely weak and does not live at all outside of droplets.  This means that fomites, that is the spread of infection through residues on surfaces is negligible.  You need droplets or aerosol for an infection.  Second, as a housecleaner I have found that the no shoes indoors rules leads to less floor cleaning and dirtier floors since the reality is still that gravity takes every crumb and speck down and walking around spreads all that.  It is unpopular to say, but in my experience shoes allowed in the house results in cleaner floors because people understand that crud is always accumulating there rather than being in denial.')
