Any crippling weakness must be met head-on and fixed, or growth is out of reach.<p>Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Michael Dell were all adaptable enough and good enough at marketing, engineering, management, delegating and everything else that their unique strengths <i>counted</i>.<p>A business cannot dodge failure to understand a market, buy the right equipment, do the right maintenance, ship on time, advertise effectively, change course 180 degrees at the right moment, hire the right people, and so much else.<p>You can sell software that you write and things that you make. With App Stores, Etsy, Amazon, and social networks, customers are accessible and word-of-mouth can blow up your exposure. Software development suites and CNC machines have never been cheaper. Yet, there must be a center to your organization. Arguments must end and the focus must be directed at weaknesses until they are remedied. If it’s just you, then you must figure out what you suck at and stop sucking at it. There will always be a change that will result in more improvement than any other change. If lesser changes are required in order to make the necessary change, then those changes are also critical.<p>People do not normally think this way. Only in a crisis, do some people think this way.<p>I noticed that success has molded me into a person that people I would like to like me, hate me, if I’m not careful. I find that I have to keep kind-hearted sociable people away from my core reasoning - reasoning that is ever-ready to cast a long term labor into boiling lava in order to save the greater organization, if absolutely necessary. It’s not a question of identity, anymore. I have tried hard enough and failed long enough at doing what I love that I figured out what I need to succeed at it. The road to realizing the most ambitious dreams goes through, “I was wrong; I’ll find another way to that destination; I’ll never stop trying; nothing can possibly stop me; what next?”, in a loop, until you cross the mark to success, sometime in the night, without even noticing.<p>I lost 20 years of retirement savings and the same amount in debt before I got my shit sorted. So many epiphanies, realizations, self-corrections, desperate attempts, and unlikely successes that became building blocks. I’m a glutton for punishment. I knew I needed it. By God, starting my own business and keeping at it was the only way.<p>Some have better instincts than others. It doesn’t matter. Have a goal. As you work towards it, constantly identify the biggest problem and fix it. If you have a huge goal, then some years later, yours will be remembered amongst the greatest names in history.')
