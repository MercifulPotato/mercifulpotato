But, I&#x27;ve heard there are multiple implementations out there that are very nicely embeddable.  They might well be good competition for Lua.  I guess I&#x27;d ask a few different questions.<p>Who is your target audience?  Are they professional coders or semi-technical users?  Are they in-house or are the customers in the wild?<p>If you have in-house coders who can&#x27;t agree on what language to use, I guess WASM could allow them to agree to disagree.  I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a better path than using the languages&#x27; native tools and focusing on improving the compile-debug iteration time.<p>If you have external coder customers who will demand differing languages, WASM sounds great!<p>If you have external, semi-technical users who don&#x27;t flat-out demand JavaScript-or-Die, standardizing on either Lua or Python is probably better for them both in terms of complexity and consistency of documentation and community help.<p>If you have internal, semi-technical users, see my above post on power levels.')
