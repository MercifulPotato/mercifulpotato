Those things should be lasting 50 to 100 years with maintenance and equipment replacement not 20.  My comparison was assuming roughly half the interest rate, twice the upfront cost, but twice the lifespan.<p>In comparison to a septic system for a family of 4 running ~12k, but only lasting 15-40 years.')
