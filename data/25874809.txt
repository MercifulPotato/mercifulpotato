The refrain is always: forget that solid blue states do a miserable job with things like education, transit, and housing, which are almost completely within state jurisdiction. Look over there some redneck in South Carolina wants to keep confederate statues! Accountability of government is something we’ll get around to once we’ve purged society of all “isms” and “phobias.”<p>Democrats are so resistant to the idea of holding Democratic administrations accountable that the police killing of George Floyd in a city that had zero Republicans on the city council, but two socialists, in a state that hasn’t voted Republican for President in half a century, somehow became a referendum on the evils of a Republican President that has almost zero power over the operation of police departments.<p>I understand why party leadership operates this way. I don’t understand why rank and file voters put up with it. There is nothing that poisons the pro-government agenda more than the fact that Democrats don’t have a single place they can point to where they can say: “see, big government works great and the higher taxes you’ll pay will be worth it.” They’re reduced to pointing to places like Sweden and Denmark. Meanwhile, Republicans can point to New York City, etc., and say “see, big\ngovernment doesn’t work.” And that’s not an unfair criticism!')
