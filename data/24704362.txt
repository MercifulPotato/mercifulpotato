The crime stats says &quot;violent crime is more prevalent in black communities...&quot;, but no AI&#x2F;ML  will produce the conclusion &quot;...and therefore black people should get longer criminal sentences for the same crime&quot;. They are completely irrelevant. The AI model will simply conclude that race would be a factor when you are looking at crime rate, or posterior probability when a violent crime happens. And that is exactly accurate. What&#x27;s wrong with that? That&#x27;s a fact. Math doesn&#x27;t lie nor does it have any agenda. There is nothing the AI is making up or adding up to. It is pure statistics and probability. It is the human beings that can&#x27;t take the truth and the consequences.')
