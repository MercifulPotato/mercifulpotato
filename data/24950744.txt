The opposite: it&#x27;s clear to me Greenwald did not clearly communicate the intended narrative of his piece, so the editors thought the article lacked focus.<p>It&#x27;s like telling Greenwald, hey you added functionality that was not originally part of the design doc. That&#x27;s fine and all but now test coverage is diminished. Heres a few tests to consider so you could strengthen the robustness of the code. To say editors were overstepping their bounds is silly.<p>Greenwald went on a morning show yesterday morning. He admits his journalistic philosophy is unconventional; he started off as a blog and was recruited into media. That&#x27;s fine. I build a few side projects in my free time and I love it because there&#x27;s so much freedom on how to structure your code. Greenwald feels the same way about writing his pieces, so he will feel right at home in the blogger universe.')
