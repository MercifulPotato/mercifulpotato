Last class I remember they were talking about what a GET and POST request were. I had been a professional web developer for years at that point. I felt it was a waste of time.<p>In WGU I had a similar easy class, stuff that was &quot;way below me&quot;. Not to worry, I passed the class in a day and stopped worrying about wasted time.<p>I recently did a C++ assignment that was filled with artificial requirements making it artificially difficult, yet I learned some things about pointers and figured out the basics of CMake for the first time. Useful stuff. Now I&#x27;m doing a similar assignment with Java. I knew I would have to set aside my distaste for things like Java (gross!), and with that mindset things aren&#x27;t so bad. I&#x27;m actually enjoying JavaFX.<p>WGU&#x27;s calculus class was harder than calc 1 at my brick and mortar university, but easier than calc 2. Once again, I knew most of the material and passed after only a few weeks of casual review. I also found a calculus text book I personally like (and will happily refer to again in the future), rather that just using whatever the department chose.<p>I do agree that a CS degree doesn&#x27;t teach as much as it sometimes gets credit for. I do believe WGU&#x27;s CS degree is as good as many brick and mortar CS degrees, but with minimal &quot;bullshit&quot;, though there is still some.')
