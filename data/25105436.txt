States have 30 days to certify their results. It always been this way. Many trump supporters believe that results will magically change in December. The reason it took longer this time is because:<p>1. Majority of people voted by mail<p>2. Many states were not allowed to count as the votes were arriving<p>3. Many states weren&#x27;t even allowed to check signature and remove voted from envelopes in advance<p>4. Dismantling sorting machines in USPS before election causing delays (it took 10 days for my friend&#x27;s ballot to be delivered within the same county) because of that many states extended wait time for incoming ballots.')
