I explicitly mentioned to them that I&#x27;m not looking for a salary. I have a stable job and free time to help upskill children who cannot afford a fee. A little background : I used to teach in India (for about 8 years along with my core job) but having moved to a new country, commuting became a little difficult and I gave it up. With an online platform such as white hat jr., I thought this would be really convenient for me and helpful for children.<p>And here is how they responded : only if you commit to 30 hours a week, can we onboard you because other teachers are competing.. This was obviously not possible for me, as I already have a job. My argument was - I am an experienced teacher, with 9+ years in the IT industry. And I don&#x27;t even want money for my services, just be flexible to maybe 15-20 hours a week. This kept going on for a while, and then I realized that their cause is not to educate but make money. So I gave up.')
