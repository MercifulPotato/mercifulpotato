If you expose access to it over the Internet, I could clone that repo <i>from you</i>, work on it, and send patches <i>to you</i>. Etc.<p>Git was designed to facilitate a network of repos. For better or worse, most use cases naturally gravitate towards a single clone as the &quot;canonical version&quot;, and unfortunately we&#x27;ve all got too comfortable in having that version be owned by a third party service provider.')
