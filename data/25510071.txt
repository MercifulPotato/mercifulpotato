Most issues are not simple binary decisions and there are many more sides than just two. Even if a binary decision is forced (e.g. yes-or-no vote on legislation), both supporters and detractors will be heterogeneous groups, with everyone having their own reasons for their stance. So if you get representatives from &quot;both sides&quot; to debate, they might both share the same incorrect view, just disagreeing on whether that&#x27;s a good thing or a bad one.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a problem journalism can easily solve.')
