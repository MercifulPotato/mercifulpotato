Yes, they truly are clueless fools. But 99% of people won&#x27;t notice.<p>Makes me wonder: if I&#x27;m underbanked today how am I going to get right-banked with digi-euros? Don&#x27;t I need a bank account? Is the ECB going to create a no-questions-asked bank account for anyone with a phone, no KYC and similar crap meant for regular customers of private banks? Such innovation! Screw the sclerotic private banks - I only need to deal with the One Bank, the ECB!!!<p>It&#x27;s for the children!')
