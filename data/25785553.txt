They start at $25. Granted, they don&#x27;t have Super Mario Bros on them, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s lots of great software that has been written or could be written for it. You can add a battery and a 3D printed case.<p>This is just one example. I&#x27;m sure there are many more. I don&#x27;t work for them but I like their products.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adafruit.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;3939" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adafruit.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;3939</a>')
