Item(by='GCA10', descendants=None, kids=[24822064, 24821297], score=None, time=1603048715, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24818407, text='Presumably DOTB and DBNT should be pitched to investors -- and funded -- in very different ways.<p>Doing old things better is very amenable to metrics, lifetime value of customer, market-adoption forecasts, cost of customer acquisition, etc. This is the land of venture money with milestones and ever-growing rounds as success unfolds. (Or asphyxiation if success doesn&#x27;t happen.)<p>Doing brand new things probably is far more likely to start via bootstrapping, passion projects, university research and other areas where open-ended curious inquiry is tolerated better. Dixon (OP) loosely acknowledges this when he writes that entrepreneurs &quot;usually spend many years deeply immersed in the underlying technology before they have their key insights.&quot;<p>Eventually the path forward will be clear enough that the VC&#x2F;metrics folks can show up for later financing rounds and do their thing. But I&#x27;ll argue that venture&#x27;s metrics-driven feed-or-starve system is more likely to mess up this early exploration than to help it.<p>Even though VCs will insist that they are equally good at both.')
