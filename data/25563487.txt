Employers have no interest in what your take-home pay is, they only are interested in what it <i>costs</i> to hire you.<p>Those costs are compared with what <i>value</i> you provide to the company. The (value - cost)&#x2F;cost is the &quot;opportunity cost&quot;, and market forces tend to push this to be around 1.15, or 15%.<p>The cut paid to the recruiter, as well as benefits, so-called &quot;employer contributions&quot; to social security, etc., <i>all</i> come out of your take-home pay one way or another.')
