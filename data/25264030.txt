So from a business perspective the Mac might win out, but as a cultural phenomenon arguably the iPad has a much bigger impact.<p>Already at work iPads with keyboard cases often outnumber laptops in meetings. That shouldn&#x27;t be surprising as people already have a full computer at their desks. My eldest is in 6th form (highschool) and is a gamer, so she has a decently powerful laptop in her room and her daily carry at school is an iPad and Pencil. When she goes to university we&#x27;ll consider a keyboard case to go with it.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a use for a powerful laptop, a skinny M1 Macbook Air is certainly very tempting and together with a powerful phone could cover some people&#x27;s needs fine. I think the takeaway is that we now have a very granular, highly flexible set of devices available, covering a huge range of different combinations of use cases. It&#x27;s not just about the individual tool anymore, it&#x27;s about the right toolkit to meet our specific set of needs.')
