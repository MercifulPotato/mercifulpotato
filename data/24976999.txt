And languages and friendships made in the process. Been everything not-marketing-related, in many domains, usually with many hats at the same time, always hands-on (last few years - CTO +architect +coder +methodologist +mentor, in startup.. Mostly because of the mentorshop). Made quite a few domain&#x2F;task languages. Taught 60-70 people python. Mentored a few teams (one in Ericsson). Turned a few people into very good programmers-and-persons. Consulted a few companies on agile and cultural-health..<p>So, CTO-ing and consulting and generally making sotware is possible, but i&#x27;m mostly interested in mentoring people, a team or more, about programming and life. Max 20-25h&#x2F;week. Something like playing trainer, within the team and the project.. coding is only the ink of software, made by people, for people.<p>have fun')
