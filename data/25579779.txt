There is no Federal government registration system in the US.<p>I&#x27;m in Australia and we are slow walking the process instead of using the equivalent of &quot;emergency authorization&quot;. That&#x27;s a risk that our Federal government is taking based on our very low case counts and infection rates.<p>Whether they roll it out efficiently between themselves and the individual state health authorities is yet to be seen.<p>Our Federal government has badly failed in its aged care response, which is its responsibility, while complaining loudly about states implementing border controls and other measures based on the economic impact.<p>Basically, governments that are run by inheritors of the Reaganite&#x2F;Thatcherite &quot;small government&quot;, &quot;states rights&quot; mindset are ignoring the fact that public health does not respect internal borders. This has occurred in the US, the UK, and, to a certain extent, in CA and AU.')
