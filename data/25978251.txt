Every. Single. Time. And it&#x27;s not by accident.<p>Finland, on the other hand, is playing things stupid.<p>We&#x27;ve had cases where a city&#x27;s laundry services was won by an Estonian company(!) because they were the cheapest. They actually shipped all laundry 300km+ south, over the bay and to Estonia. Wash it and send it back. For some reason the people handling the bid were all suprised_pikachu.png when it turned out the arrangement didn&#x27;t work AT ALL.<p>That&#x27;s all down to knowing how to write the bid so that the winner will also be the best.')
