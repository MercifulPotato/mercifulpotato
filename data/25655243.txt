This is pretty much how I justified rewriting it from scratch. It makes very little business sense, because I already had a finished product which I could try to sell right then and there, however, I just wanted to learn some proper software development. The project was a front-end app built in jQuery (I started it in 2015) and had terrible code quality in general.\nIf I rebuild it, and fail to sell it, at least I will have some base knowledge on how to build a front-end app properly which I could re-use in a future product.')
