I agree with everything you&#x27;ve said.<p>I own an apartment building and the rent on a 1BR close to downtown is $875&#x2F;month. Mind you, this is 2 blocks from a commuter rail station in a reasonable building that includes water and parking, in a city with a great park district, good schools, and plenty to do.<p>I didn&#x27;t say you&#x27;re living high on the hog--you&#x27;re getting by. The household median income in Homewood is 57k. It&#x27;s no Palo Alto, just a relatively modest town with reasonable local government and people who seem to care a lot. I like this.<p>Illinois is clearly on a fiscal crash course. I have no doubt about that and now that the fair tax was defeated at the ballot box, it&#x27;s going to accelerate the insolvency. The state needs to get its pension obligations in line with its funding levels. Obviously that&#x27;s going to take a decade. But I&#x27;m pretty convinced that this state&#x27;s strengths (Chicago, great universities, lots of competent local governments) could make it bounce back. Especially seeing the direction a lot of other states like California are going, or San Francisco, a city that can&#x27;t seem to balance its $13 billion annual budget after it increase 50% in the last 5-10 years. Any idiot can run Palo Alto, where the median household income is $140k. It takes a lot more to make a city with about 60% less income function.')
