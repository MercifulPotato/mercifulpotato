For a lot of people, nohello is exactly what our social instincts are pushing for.  For us, a bare &quot;hello&quot; without any context or information is uncomfortable, and feels rather rude.<p>A big part of politeness, courtesy, and etiquette is helping people feel comfortable, meeting them where they are.<p>For me personally, and I think a lot of others who agree with nohello, a bare &quot;Hello&quot; with no content or context gives me nothing to work with, nothing to say, nothing to grab on to to understand what kind of conversation I&#x27;m having.  You mention a &quot;feeling of connection&quot; while waiting for someone to type the rest of their question, but to me it only feels like disrespect.<p>When people talk about things you summarize as &quot;lost productivity&quot;, it&#x27;s not about a desire to advocate the interests of the company, but instead it&#x27;s expressing that for people like us, these kinds of content-free social rituals feel disruptive to the flow of work, and that these disruptions feel irritating, uncomfortable, and disrespectful.  It feels like a violation of our culture&#x27;s etiquette.<p>Feel free to say hello, include as many social pleasantries as you like in your messages, but please <i>also</i> include at least some meaningful content about your goals or intentions.')
