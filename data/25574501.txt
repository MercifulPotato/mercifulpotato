An industrial robot by ABB with a clear use case in a manufacturing process costs like $80k. An impressive toy robot with no clear use case like Boston Dynamics’ Spot also costs $80k.<p>If these robots had a clear use case besides carrying heavy stuff, BD valuation would be 5X or 10X their current valuation.<p>Of course the real value would be to use their research and know-how on these type of high-mobility&#x2F;low foot-footprint robotics into actual industrial settings and use cases.<p>Google didn’t have any internal use case for this tech and commercializing the technology as a vendor is way out of their competence and probably not enough value there to justify extra investment in sales, supply chain, etc.<p>SoftBank was just doing what it has been doing for the last decade which is investing in shiny things.<p>Hyundai may be the first owner to actually have a clear use case for this tech.')
