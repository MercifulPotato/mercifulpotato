Coming home after a long day, sinking into your couch, and able to say &quot;play some relaxing music&quot; to soothe your mind.<p>Not saying that the privacy aspects aren&#x27;t valid concerns or that convenience should outweigh them, but quite a few people here seem to not be able to see any upsides.')
