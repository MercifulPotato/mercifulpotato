I tried multiple times to switch to C++. But tooling is turn off. May be I am spoiled by Java.<p>What I want is easy build and dependency management system like maven.<p>I wish few professional C++ dev unite and build an open source tool like maven (assuming it will not take lot of time) which allow me to:<p>1. Create a project from skeleton project\n2. compile\n3. test\n4. build&#x2F;run\n5. Key=value=version type system to download and auto build dependency.<p>That&#x27;s it. :)<p>I tried building myself, but I think it is too much for a beginner project. I named the project &#x27;goat&#x27;.')
