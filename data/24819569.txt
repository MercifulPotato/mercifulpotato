You have external libraries that can do it, but from my experience, they are painful to use. String manipulation in general is painful in C and probably not the best language for this demo.<p>However, if you really want high performance, you can go ahead and write it in C with a custom matching code and a custom data structure for keeping your word count. This will most likely result in hundreds of lines of code, and enough performance to max out a PCIe SSD. However that would be an different exercise.')
