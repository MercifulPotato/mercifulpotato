Item(by='crocodiletears', descendants=None, kids=[25019869], score=None, time=1604784589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25017489, text='My Facebook account was recently restricted from &#x27;complex entities interactions&#x27; a week before the election until November 28, with no explanation as to why, and an error thrown whenever I click a link to contest the restrictions (for lack of a better term).<p>Thus far, it seems to mean that I can&#x27;t follow, comment, post, or dm on&#x2F;with groups or facebook pages. I cannot create events, pages, or new groups.<p>I can only post to my timeline, dm my friends, or comment on my friend&#x27;s posts.<p>I do not post, or comment on Facebook, though I am a member of a number of politically engaged and activist facebook groups on the fringes for the purposes of having access to on the ground primary sources.<p>I have a number of friends active on the right who received a similar set of restrictions, ending on the same day. They&#x27;re used to these kinds of restrictions, comment often, and thought nothing of it. This is typical of facebook to them.<p>More unexpectedly, and in my opinion a disturbing development in an already unsettling moderation regime, a number of second-order contacts (friends of friends and coworkers) who work as left and progressive organizers&#x2F;activists (not liberals, progressives and leftists) also received the same levels of restriction.<p>This was accompanied by the removal of quite a few fringe activist and political pages, the most infamous which comes to my mind being &#x27;God Emperor Trump&#x27;, a large meme page that had significant reach during the 2016 election.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is circumstantially unique. This is a preview. Assuming recounts and court challenges go Biden&#x27;s way, I believe we&#x27;re looking at a future where social media uses the tools they&#x27;ve developed over the past four years to enforce a bipartisan moderate consensus over their user-bases, restricting any populist, revolutionary, or potentially dangers speech or users that might produce it.<p>The activist left has largely been shielded by its circumstantial alliance with the DNC establishment and its allied institutions, given their mutual opposition to the Trump administration.<p>The populist right has partially been shielded by the implicit threat of Trump&#x27;s executive authority.<p>Libertarians (I&#x27;m including the Boogaloo movement, and many lockdown protests under this umbrella) have had no such cover, and in my limited experience I&#x27;ve seen entire networks of users and pages been scrubbed off the platform over the past two years with little fanfare, and largely as a product of their affiliations. I believe their experience will be mirrored on the left and the right going forward.')
