It gives me a certain joy to make it all neat and tidy, just in case someone ever comes across it (which might or might not ever happen, but if it does, it&#x27;ll be nice!).</i><p>I&#x27;ve been doing that for so long, that it is completely habitual.<p>My stuff is generally not popular. I&#x27;m my own best customer, but I write (and document) everything I do (even the one-offs), as if they will be a corporate legacy.<p>One of my projects (a fairly massive one, actually) became something a lot bigger. It is now being maintained by a skilled and energetic team. They don&#x27;t always do things the way that I would have, and that&#x27;s a good thing. The project is thriving.<p>The best thing I did for it, was step away, after developing it -alone- for ten years.')
