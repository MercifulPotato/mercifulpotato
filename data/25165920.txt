We were well-off enough that I was able to come to Canada for school, where I went to UBC.<p>These are the things I&#x27;ve experienced:<p>- You are required, as an international student, to sign up for the provincial healthcare program, MSP. I believe I paid $75 a month for health insurance.<p>- I was able to see a doctor very early on (mood disorder) and treatment was very satisfactory. I liked my doctor, I liked how the system works. Is it perfect? Of course not.<p>- I had an episode which put me in the hospital for over a month (would have been the start of 2016). At the time, I had not notified MSP of the change in my address, so I had stopped receiving bills and paying for them. When I was hospitalized, they told me that I owed about 3 years of MSP payments (around $3k). In essence, I paid 3k for a hospital stay that lasted close to 40 days.<p>- After being discharged from the hospital, I was assigned to a mental health team. It wasn&#x27;t near where I lived, so I was able to transfer to a closer one. The team consisted of a psychiatrist and, in essence, a social worker who monitored my mental health and encouraged me to do things like group activities to make friends who were also dealing with mental health issues.<p>- As part of my hospitalization, I tried art therapy, which I continued to engage in after being discharged. Therapy was a bit expensive (think around $150 for an hour and a half, which was a bit much for someone who was just getting started working), but it was effective and helpful.<p>- I left the mental health team and began seeing a psychiatrist through UBC&#x27;s student health services. I still see them even though I&#x27;ve graduated. I pay nothing for these appointments.<p>- I work full time and have private health insurance through my job. This insurance covers my current CBT costs for the most part, as well as providing an HSA plan which I use to pay for medication that isn&#x27;t covered by MSP.<p>I&#x27;ve also done things like participated in a university study on perfectionism (12 weeks, group therapy situation).<p>I think the biggest takeaway from my experience is that, as a result of my mental health disabilities, I would not move back to the United States. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable with the idea that healthcare would be tied to my employment. If I lost my job and was unable to adequately care for myself as a result, it would likely be close to impossible to find a new job!<p>To me, it feels like Canadian healthcare is not necessarily a perfect system, but it is a system which works well for most people. People aren&#x27;t afraid of being sick, they&#x27;re not afraid of medical bills causing bankruptcy, and they are more able to freely live their lives because the government is actually in a position to take care of its citizens.')
