However, those things are, at most, a subset of the problems with Parler and at worst disjoint problems from Parler&#x27;s problems. I stand by the argument of &quot;a static, private data archive is not the same as a live, public web service.&quot; I did not make the argument of &quot;there are no problems with the static, private data archive.&quot;')
