They can be cheering him for saying A and then cheering him five minutes later for saying ~A. I suspect that if Trump loses his platform for some number of months, the shine may wear off.<p>And Parler is being kicked from AWS, so <i>their</i> entire service is going down too--and they may get the full treatment of being kicked from other servers and payment services if they don&#x27;t agree to police their content. And without easy access to his marks, it will be harder for Don the Con to stay relevant.<p>Not predicting that it <i>will</i> happen. I&#x27;m not that optimistic, TBH. But positing a mechanism that it <i>could</i> happen.')
