When you begin coding an application, you&#x27;re usually adding features and that&#x27;s fun, but as time passes and the software reaches its goal, you&#x27;re left with finding and fixing bugs. That&#x27;s no fun. Microsoft manages to do so because there&#x27;s a money incentive for its employees, while free software has no such equivalent. That&#x27;s why we see things like completely dropping X and writing Wayland from scratch: it&#x27;s more fun and quicker for developer. Sucks to be us on the receiving end, though.<p>I believe until this kind of thinking shifts, there&#x27;s not gonna be mass adoption of GNU&#x2F;Linux systems. People expect software to work and keep working 10 years down the road. The current state of the FOSS ecosystem is full of bitrot and rewrites, with zero incentive for developers to maintain code. Beats the hell out of me why there isn&#x27;t a distro that allows you to give money to patrons of the packages you use. It&#x27;s a real no-brainer.')
