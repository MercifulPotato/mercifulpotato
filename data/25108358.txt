It&#x27;s almost like they&#x27;re just doing that to check a feature box in some advertiser list of features they&#x27;re selling to someone but it&#x27;s not actually even useful. If I&#x27;m about to buy an intex raft I&#x27;m going to do it when I was looking at them, not 3 weeks later.<p>Further, there&#x27;s really no intelligence in ads yet. If I&#x27;m looking at intex rafts it probably makes sense to sell me fishing gear, yet none of that happens. Also I hate fishing. I just like floating on a raft.')
