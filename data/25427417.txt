That&#x27;s irrelevant here for two reasons: firstly, the pointers <i>might</i> compare equal (which is all that matters for this argument), and secondly, once again, the comparison isn&#x27;t being made between pointers, the comparison is being made between integers.<p>You know what, I think you&#x27;re right, at least on the second point. I guess the code isn&#x27;t UB after all then. Somehow I kept reading it as if it&#x27;s comparing pointers.<p>Regarding the other point about following something in memory:<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t consider those guys a reputable source [...] they claim that making equality comparisons is undefined behaviour but their only basis for that is a quote from the section on relational operators which is obviously only talking about relational operators.<p>There are multiple entities here, in agreement with each other. The author links to bug #61502 in GCC, where you&#x27;ll see the compiler devs agree with the author of that page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org&#x2F;bugzilla&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=61502#c15" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org&#x2F;bugzilla&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=61502#c15</a><p>You might disagree with their stances for whatever reasons you might have, but firing reputational shots at them when there are clearly other experts disagreeing with them isn&#x27;t really helping make your position more convincing.<p>&gt; Read the actual standard quotations in context and there is no confusion.<p>There was no &quot;confusion&quot; on this point to begin with (on my end anyway). Again, as I explained: they might not be intuitive if you&#x27;re assuming a linear address space, but they&#x27;re quite fine to interpret. You just need to avoid bringing your own extra assumptions into the table. The notion of &quot;following&quot; in memory hinges on your assumption that the address space is linear. This is pretty similar to how to be able to say your house &quot;follows&quot; another house, you need to first make nontrivial assumptions (e.g., that they&#x27;re on the same street). To my knowledge C does not make such assumptions globally; all it does is lets you satisfy that criterion by putting them in the same aggregate structure (&quot;street&quot;) to begin with, but if you can&#x27;t do that, you can&#x27;t satisfy that assumption.')
