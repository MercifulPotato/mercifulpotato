The saas will be subscription based.<p><pre><code>  - Do you create a dedicated Gitlab&#x2F;Github account?\n  - Do you create a decicated AWS&#x2F;Firebase account?\n  - Do you create a dedicated email account?\n  - Do I have to create a company in order to run the saas?\n  - Do I have to register the product?\n</code></pre>\nWhen I mean dedicated, I&#x27;m refering at no using personal accounts whatsoever.<p>Do you now any articles&#x2F;books on this kind of subject? How to prepare the more technical aspects considering the product can be sold.<p>Deeply appreciated.')
