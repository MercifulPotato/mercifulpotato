Here you do not make money from the individual scrapes but being able to have everything for everyone, and thus you cannot afford to spend much extra development effort for a site because scraping that site in itself probably isn&#x27;t worth much money for you.<p>Bespoke scraping, here you care about being able to extract data at a very atomic level and you need string manipulation and everything else. Probably you make money on each individual site scraped because the sites have been strategically chosen to enhance a product - for example you have a product serving the legal needs of everyone in the EU but you want to expand into all EEA &#x2F; EFTA countries, each legal info site you adopt your scraper for is worth lots of money and you put developer effort into getting things at a granular data level matching your data model of legal information.<p>on edit: changed minimal to atomic')
