Item(by='yashap', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604627436, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25001173, text='This is quite a small tax, even in the “worst” case (maxes out at 0.6%, if your top exec makes 600x the average employee). And it only impacts companies with massively overpaid executives - there’s no change for most companies, who have nowhere remotely close to a 100x discrepancy between top paid and average employees.<p>In reality, this will create a bit of extra tax revenue, and push down SF exec salaries ever so slightly. Both good things. No company is moving out of SF, replacing their staff with contractors, etc. over such a tiny tax. It’s a very small step in the right direction IMO.')
