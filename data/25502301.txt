Item(by='eyelidlessness', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608605127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502220, text='I used Clojure (and ClojureScript) in production for several years, and more or less share your sentiments on this. The only strong objection I have is that the lack of types made even simple data structures an occasional nightmare. Especially when most of the composite types can easily be substituted for many functions, it’s trivial to accidentally recurse a string or a keyword where a data structure should be. And the runtime errors (especially in cljs) can be utterly baffling.<p>I’ve taken what I learned in clojure (and I can just say the article, even just its title, adequately sum it up) and use the same approach in TypeScript. And it’s a breath of fresh air.')
