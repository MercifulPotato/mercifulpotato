There is no &quot;both sides&quot; this time. All the GOP fears (Biden is senile, a socialist, or a puppet) are based on lies. Everyone else&#x27;s fears are based on Trump&#x27;s actual policies: separating children from parents; ignoring and lying about Covid; attacking climate science; and tearing down democratic norms.<p>&gt; <i>Trumpeting gun control at stupid moments is the biggest mistake - one which Clinton also made</i><p>Gun control is very popular, even among gun owners[1].<p>Biden spent very, very little time talking about it. He mostly talked about expanding health-care access, managing Covid, and bringing back jobs. If you look at this talking points in the debates, he barely mentioned guns at all.<p>This fear, again, is false fear-mongering by GOP allies, just as it was when they claimed Obama would take away all the guns[2].<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;16&#x2F;share-of-americans-who-favor-stricter-gun-laws-has-increased-since-2017&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;16&#x2F;share-of-am...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;ben-smith&#x2F;2008&#x2F;08&#x2F;nra-obama-most-anti-gun-candidate-ever-will-ban-guns-010821" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;ben-smith&#x2F;2008&#x2F;08&#x2F;nra-obama-m...</a>')
