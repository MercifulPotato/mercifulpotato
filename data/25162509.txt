One of the first things that happen when you start using Anki and realize the superpower that it is being in charge of your memory is that you want to include EVERYTHING in it.<p>You start creating cards with obscure bash one-liners, little-used git commands, or Javascript functions you read about in a random article. You add all of it to Anki. After all, you might use them in the future right? And it doesn&#x27;t cost you anything to create a card with them so why not.<p>What happens is that because you don&#x27;t have a clear picture of why those cards are valuable to you - you just added them because they might be useful, one of these days - you will have trouble retaining their knowledge, meaning that you will keep failing to successfully review those cards.<p>And because of the way spaced repetition algorithms work, those cards will be constantly appearing in your reviews, and you will keep failing them. And they will keep appearing. And so on and so forth until you lose all motivation to use Anki because it&#x27;s becoming a frustrating experience to do your reviews.<p>The most important thing about using Anki is to keep using it. That&#x27;s how you get the benefits of it, so be more selective about what you add to Anki instead of profligately adding cards that you gain nothing from.')
