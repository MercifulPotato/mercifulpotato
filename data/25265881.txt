I feel a bit bad in that I don&#x27;t have a tough 12hr schedule like some but still exhibit this behavior. I think its partially due to the fact that a lot of other things I do outside of work, my mind doesn&#x27;t perceive as restful&#x2F;me-time. Ex. I enjoy running, but exercise still feels like an obligation more than a privilege. Combine that with other social&#x2F;communal obligations and certain errands and a lot of my non-work time ends up being for fulfilling the demands of some other authority concept.<p>Then, I&#x27;ve let my hobbies wane over the years (especially in terms of what I can do inside during Covid) so the easiest thing I go to is just scrolling on my phone. Which feels like its for me but is ultimately really draining.<p>Trying a couple approaches to this.\n1.) Anything BUT mindless browsing. Seriously, no guilt even if it&#x27;s just a show on Netflix, buying one item at the store even though I &quot;should&quot; just batch shop, whatever as long as its self directed.\n2.) Eek out that time and make it a priority, while still prioritizing sleep. Allow certain tasks that I &quot;should&quot; get done today to push out.')
