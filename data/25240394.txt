Pinion gearbox has an option of 18 gears with a 600%+ ratio while something like SRAM Eagle 1x12 has 500% ratio. I don&#x27;t know about the efficiency but i think something like this should be the future - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pinkbike.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;allen-millyard-part-1-2008.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pinkbike.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;allen-millyard-part-1-2008.htm...</a> or maybe there is proper reason why nothing like this has come into the market - shifting without pedalling or under load, closed system (don&#x27;t care about dirt&#x2F;water) and no noise.')
