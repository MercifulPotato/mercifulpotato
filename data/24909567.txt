We actually release a 1.x version that won&#x27;t upgrade you if you want to stay local:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;PolarBookshelf&#x2F;comments&#x2F;j9yfbx&#x2F;polar_110014_last_1x_version_with_autoupdates&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;PolarBookshelf&#x2F;comments&#x2F;j9yfbx&#x2F;pola...</a><p>The 2.0 upgrade won&#x27;t and can&#x27;t auto-upgrade because 2.0 is far far far more secure and we wanted to keep it that way.<p>2.0 is very locked up in a sandbox so it can&#x27;t actually access your disk. 1.x should be secure but 2.0 radically reduces the chance of breaking out of a jail and to do automatic upgrade would have required us to relax this significantly.<p>You can just drag  and drop your .polar directory into 2.0 and it will migrate all your 1.x data for you or you can just stick to the 1.x version I linked to above.<p>I would have loved to make it auto-upgrade but we just couldn&#x27;t do it..')
