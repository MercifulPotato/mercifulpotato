But it seems that companies aren&#x27;t even trying to use this wiggle room, just ignoring it or plastering the damned cookie banners, so I think that it&#x27;s a good thing for future privacy-oriented lawsâ€”when given even the most generous possible leeway, businesses would still rather track their users than attempt to colour within the lines.')
