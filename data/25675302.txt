I&#x27;ve bought pieces from galleries, storage containers, and artists direct and had this idea too. What art you buy says something about you. One thing is that art is a little bit like clothing- the brand matters. Something that is recognizable or has meaning outside of the visual work. Not sure if this is &quot;legal&quot; but if you can do art in the style of previous masters but custom to something that I like, I would buy that for sure. Or collaborate with living artists to create prints. Like a black swan portrait in the style of Juan Travieso.')
