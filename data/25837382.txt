Parler was created as a protest against the moderation that happens on other platforms, to be a place where the people who are too extreme for Facebook etc. can communicate, recruit, and so forth.  Likewise with Gab, which was created in response to Twitter&#x27;s own efforts at moderation.<p>Nothing unequeal about the treatment, because Parler&#x27;s efforts at moderation were never equal (in either commitment or scope) to the other platforms you mentioned.')
