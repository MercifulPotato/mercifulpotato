It lets them position the AirPods Max as having (sound and build) Quality over (quiet) Comfort. It creates a market position for them without having to try very hard, and allows them years of incremental (yet revolutionary) weight saving improvements for future generations of the product.<p>(note that I&#x27;m not implying the QCs have poor build quality, just that a heavier product implies better BQ. I am implying that the QCs aren&#x27;t difficult to beat on sound quality though)')
