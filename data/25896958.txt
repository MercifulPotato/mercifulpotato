I had everything stolen by my ex-gf and her friends. It was all liquid, in the form of gemstones and collectibles in Las Vegas. The cops there are useless. I&#x27;d just clawed my way out of poverty over the course of three years and was about to sell everything, fund a 529 for my five year old daughter and start a small business. I&#x27;d managed to buy and resell until I had a little over $100,000 in merchandise to sell. I had everything put away and secured in containers and didn&#x27;t check on it for months while working when she wasn&#x27;t due to health issues. Our dumbass neighbor got her hooked on fentanyl and that was it. Everything gone.')
