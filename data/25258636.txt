There was a link today about &quot;how many registers an x86 processor has&quot; and it really reminded me of how many issues and legacy the processors have to deal with<p>I think the solution would be to move the x86 cruft to an SW emulation layer, and focus on base performance. Something like this (though I&#x27;m skeptical of taking things like rings and memory protection out of hw <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emulators.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;nx03_10fixes.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emulators.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;nx03_10fixes.htm</a> )<p>Your latest Intel chip boots like an 8086 from the 70s and it has to do several steps before it goes to protected mode. It has to deal with x87, MMX, SSE, SSE2, AVX etc (ARM has NEON and that&#x27;s it.). Every register has several ways of being accessed: AH&#x2F;AL, AX, EAX, RAX.
