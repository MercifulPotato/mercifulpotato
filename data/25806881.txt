Everything will fail at some point, even your chosen decentralized service.<p>I do agree that decentralized is the way forward, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d ever ask my grandma to install Matrix.<p>Matrix is a Discord&#x2F;IRC replacement - a significantly better alternative! But let&#x27;s not delude ourselves into thinking it&#x27;s going to replace text&#x2F;SMS, which is the primary use case for WhatsApp&#x2F;Signal.<p>I can send my grandma a link to Signal, and she would be able to get it working, and I&#x27;m already in her contacts! There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d attempt the same with Matrix&#x2F;Riot&#x2F;Element&#x2F;Fluffy chat.')
