Basically Chrome Developer Tool&#x27;s Sources tab but as files and folders on your computer.<p>This would be great for scraping with headless browsers. It&#x27;d let you use shell scripts or your favorite programming language&#x27;s filesystem library to read&#x2F;copy assets, rather than writing code with Puppeteer to copy files&#x2F;data.<p>It would have to copy from Chrome directly though, rather than re-fetch the content')
