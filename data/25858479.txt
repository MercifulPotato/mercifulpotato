Item(by='rich_sasha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611235028, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25858395, text='You can eat neither Bitcoin nor equities, but equities at least make things you can sell for food, even if they are overvalued. Yes, trading equities or bitcoin can both be speculation, but at least equities have an intrinsic use, that exists even if no one wants to buy them. Bitcoin without buyers is just a waste of energy.<p>Whether Bitcoin as investment makes more sense than gold is unclear to me (though gold does have some real-world needs; probably not sufficient to justify its value), but comparing to productive assets makes no sense to me.')
