I originally used gzip but the compression speed was pretty slow. B-tree pages tend compress well because they tend to be 50-75% full because they need space to insert new records and because pages split when they get full.<p>I&#x27;m seeing files shrink down to 14% of their size (1.7MB WAL compressed to 264KB).
