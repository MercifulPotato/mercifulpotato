I bought a charging cable for my phone once that supports fast charging. The connectors all fit but no fast charging? Shipped it back and bought another one - what a waste of resources.<p>They really need to use semantic versioning and be forced to clearly display that version number on the cable or connector in a legally defined, readable size. In fact every cable type should have that. I recently bought a 2K 144Hz screen and could get the display manager to set 144Hz. Then I looked up the standard and found out HDMI 1 doesn&#x27;t support 144Hz but HDMI 2 does. Not a single cable in my house has the version number written anywhere and I had to try them out until I got the right one.<p>What I would really appreciate is:<p>Cable X not compatible with Cable Y --&gt; different major versions and completely improved specs, power requirements, AND different shape<p>Cable X.X is compatible with Cable X.Y but has different functionalities --&gt; same major version, different minor version, same shape. Easily understandable by users &quot;First thing I see is a big X, it fits with whatever I&#x27;m trying to connect with, it should work&quot;. If it doesn&#x27;t then they can look closer and go &quot;ooh.. the small Y is different. I should get Y or Y+n&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s it.')
