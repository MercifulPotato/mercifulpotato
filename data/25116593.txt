The vaccines are a couple billion dollars each, including manufacturing at scale. A lot of drugs now cost that to bring to market and don&#x27;t have a small fraction of the positive impact on humanity.<p>If all that existed were market forces, Moderna and Pfizer could charge ten times what they are. They obviously knew the extreme blowback they&#x27;d suffer if they did that (including likely nationalization of their vaccines).<p>$20-$30 per dose in affluent nations is absurdly cheap to end this nightmare. That&#x27;s a couple order-out pizzas.')
