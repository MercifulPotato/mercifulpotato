They showed how it could be done, although due to planning failures, they were BADLY under-staffed, and it got perilously close to the VP and other leaders. Deadly force was only employed as a last resort.<p>And I fully support snitching on violent criminals.<p>There are many consistent positions a large number of people hold. Trying to make this an &quot;us versus them&quot; by proclaiming in your comment that the entirety of &quot;red vs blue&quot; are only out for their own interests is only feeding into a narrative of complete polarization where there is actually a ton of common ground.')
