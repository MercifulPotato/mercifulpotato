Using a big corps walled garden just for a tiny bit of convenience. With just a tiny amount of effort you can find reputable places to download software. But most people have your attitude and now pc&#x27;s have become like consoles, where a big corp monitors all your activity and decides what you can and cant do with <i>your</i> machine, and the idea of the pc as a personal universal computing machine is dying.<p>Reminds me of the Benjamin Franklins qoute<p>&quot;Those who desire to give up freedom in order to gain security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one.&quot;<p>Just replace security with convenience.\nAlso, yeah thats super melodramatic, but it is qualitatively the same imo.')
