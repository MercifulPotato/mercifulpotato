Which day do you propose to be the &quot;correct&quot; one and what gives you the right to make that decision?  Sometimes Christmas falls during Hanukkah; would it be okay to say Happy Hanukkah on Christmas?<p>I don&#x27;t celebrate holidays.  I play along for friend &amp; family gatherings.  I&#x27;m frequently told &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; several days in advance, and several days following, December 25.  I hear Christmas music for an entire month leading up to the day, and frequently for weeks afterwards.  Why should &quot;happy Hanukkah&quot; be limited to a single day?')
