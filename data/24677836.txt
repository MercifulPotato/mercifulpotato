This way they can reuse GPL pieces without open sourcing their derived works.<p>Developers are probably OK with that, they can charge monthly fee for a SAAS, also it’s easier to develop software for just 1 hardware configuration + one web browser (or a few browsers if you support mobile).<p>However, as an end user, I prefer native apps. They don’t require internet connection. I’m in full control over my data. Native apps are often faster, even smartphones have rather high count of these GFLOPs in both CPUs and GPUs, even when the servers are fast and over-provisioned, network latency often kills the performance.')
