Item(by='vidarh', descendants=None, kids=[25863414], score=None, time=1611256517, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25862411, text='You&#x27;re still thinking of this as a chain of events unfolding, rather than as a playback of a set of immutable, self-consistent events.<p>&gt; The whole premise seems to be that this is allowed:<p>No. That was not the premise. The premise was an immutable representation of self-consistent state transitions, so what occurs in step 2 will <i>always</i> have occurred at that point in time, because otherwise the system isn&#x27;t immutable. Step 1. just links step two into the causal chain of events in a way necessary to make the existence of 2. consistent.<p>Again: Think of a graph. An immutable graph. The flow of time in this model simply follows the graph. It doesn&#x27;t <i>do anything at all</i>, it just replays the events.<p>The problem here is thinking about this as if there are choices being made as time passes.<p>&gt; Just stating that “the past is fixed” doesn’t solve the paradox, it restates one of the premises.<p>It&#x27;s not stating the past is fixed. It&#x27;s stating <i>everything</i> is fixed.')
