Nearly all the research is inconclusive and anything which is conclusive isn’t reliable. I don’t think that is enough to act upon myself. The communications agencies around the world have provided us with well researched safe exposure limits and compliance.<p>If you have a few hundred dollars to burn and want to feel better, do it but that’s just bankrolling the idiots selling magic unicorns. The real solutions used in laboratories and industry run well into five figures.<p>Perhaps interestingly I spent a few hours the other day chasing down a prominent signal working its way into my spectrum analyser. What was it? Well it turned out to be a clock PLL harmonic off my Ryzen PC. That was far above the relative power of the WiFi router about 6 feet away from it. My interest in that signal? Purely academic as I thought my SA was broken again :)')
