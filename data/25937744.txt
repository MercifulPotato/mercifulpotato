In <i>many</i> companies, these dividend amounts and schedules are extremely predictable.<p>You can then use that money to buy food, or build a house, if you wanted.<p>The fundamental value of <i>many</i> stocks is tied to the dividend that it will pay you for owning it. Obviously &quot;growth&quot; stocks (stocks that as designed to increase in value, rather than pay a dividend, because funds are used to buy-back stock instead, thus raising the price) is valued differently, but there is still a fundamental value based on the financial situation of the underlying company.')
