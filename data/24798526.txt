They register to read other people.<p>So if I follow an influencer that retweets a libelous news story from CNN, who&#x27;s the liable publisher?  Twitter, CNN, or the influencer?  What if I retweet it?  Am I a publisher now that I piped that into my feed?<p>The only way Twitter would be able to cope IMO is with a _massive_ increase in censorship and a _massive_ reduction in the ability for the average person to publish opinions.  And I think the biggest beneficiaries of that are large media companies that already have their own platforms.<p>And what I meant when I asked how making Twitter the publisher is any different is how would having the ability to sue Twitter for libel be any different than suing CNN or Fox right now?  The only way it&#x27;s different is if the law treats them differently and makes Twitter beholden to government so the government can sanction them.  Who decides what&#x27;s true then?  That sounds like a dictatorship to me.<p>I completely agree with your sentiment though.  The misinformation is out of control and it needs to be reigned in.  I just think it&#x27;s much harder than pointing the finger at someone new and calling them the publisher.  I haven&#x27;t seen any really good solutions either.  It&#x27;s a really hard problem to solve.')
