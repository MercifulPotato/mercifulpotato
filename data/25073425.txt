They are not “good”. But all the big guys are bad to some extent. (And since you brought them up - Apple’s cloud push is bad, though not remotely as bad as Microsoft’s cloud push)<p>I am not saying Microsoft is exceptionally bad in any way. I am just saying the “new, good Microsoft” is a mirage. They are as bad as they had ever been, except they have been beaten into submission in some sectors, so they behave in those.')
