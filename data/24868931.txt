But perhaps we do not agree on what constitutes a &quot;(rather) formal point&quot;? I made a point in informal language and in a casual manner and as part of an informal discussion ... on Hacker News. We are not going to prove or disprove any theorems here.<p>But, to be sure, as is common when this kind of informal conversation suddendly sprouts semi-formal language, like &quot;argument&quot;, &quot;claim&quot;, &quot;proof&quot;, &quot;necessarily follows&quot; etc, I am not even sure what exactly it is we are arguing about, anymore. What exactly is your disagreement with my comment? Could you please explain?')
