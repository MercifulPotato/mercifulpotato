They just get preached the Gospel, so people can say &quot;hah, now it&#x27;s your fault for not believing it&quot;.<p>Image you owe someone else money. An anonymous stranger pays your debt. Why would <i>you</i> have to acknowledge that, for that someone else to receive said payment?<p>God in the form of Jesus paid your debts you have with God, but unless you believe that, God won&#x27;t recognize that, will still kill you at best, torture you forever at worst, depending on who you ask.
