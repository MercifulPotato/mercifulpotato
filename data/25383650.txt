To request this entitlement, contact your Apple representative.<p>I can understand the desire, for convenience&#x27;s sake of testing stuff quickly, to directly virtualize a guest linux OS on a developer&#x27;s workstation laptop or desktop running MacOS.<p>But that&#x27;s an absolute non-starter for me. Contact your sales representative for an entitlement? Forget that, I&#x27;ll keep on using Linux kernel based virtualization with either xen or kvm, and the equivalent of xen domU PV or HVM on a normal x86-64 server platform, controlled remotely from my laptop, thanks.<p>The whole language in that sounds like they hired some MBAs away from Oracle.')
