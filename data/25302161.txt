It&#x27;s been this way for 25+ years.  This is just a new form.  There were the &quot;brain teaser&quot; questions in the late 90&#x27;s (How Would You Move Mount Fuji), and then there was the whiteboard coding (reverse a linked list).  It&#x27;s always been this way, and IMO it&#x27;s stupid, but there will always be companies that do this.  I&#x27;ve been discounted, because even though I did what they asked I didn&#x27;t go above and beyond on the &quot;test assignment.&quot;  You know what, I don&#x27;t want to work for those companies anyway, so I consider it a boon they asked it in the first place.  There will always be people are that are gatekeeping and trying to show they are the smartest person in the room.  If you and I can&#x27;t sit down and have a conversation and determine whether or not I can help your team without some silly test about writing a loop, you&#x27;re wasting my time.')
