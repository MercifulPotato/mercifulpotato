The lawsuits were rejected at the time, on the basis on not being able to prove injury&#x2F;damage, because no damage has occurred yet, only hypothetically.<p>Now that the damage has occurred, they are told that they should have sued before.<p>Thats a very sneaky&#x2F;dishonest way of being treated by the courts.<p>The fact check does not prove a lie. At most it proves that Trump is not making the statement based on publicly available data. Since the final rejection rate for 2020 have not yet been released.<p>From the fact check:<p>&quot;Georgia rejected 6.42% of mail-in ballots in total in the 2016 general election &quot;<p>&quot;The higher percentage he mentions for past years is likely based off the total rejected ballots (here) which can not be compared with 2020, as this information is not available.&quot;')
