Most of the time it just adds unit testing busy work, for no clear benefit. This becomes more clear if you imagine you wanted to test every possible input. Splitting the function in 8ths introduces roughly 8x the work, if each new function has the same number of possible input states. The math is more complicated in the general case, so you have to evaluate it on a case-by-case basis. Also, if you&#x27;re trying to isolate a known bug, it might be beneficial to split the function and test each part in isolation.')
