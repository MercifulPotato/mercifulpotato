No exchanges or mainstream projects use that term to refer to BCH. As far as I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s primarily used as a pejorative, so it seems strange that you&#x27;d use it here.<p>As far as BCH&#x27;s additional value: I&#x27;d suggest researching the block size debate. This debate is BCH&#x27;s entire reason for existing. This article [1] from 2016 by Mike Hearn contains a good primer on the block size debate itself. He ended up quitting development of Bitcoin, but others decided to raise the blocksize limit - with or without the majority, thus creating BCH. Succinctly, BCH is the continuation of big-blocker&#x27;s vision of the Bitcoin experiment.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.plan99.net&#x2F;the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.plan99.net&#x2F;the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experi...</a>')
