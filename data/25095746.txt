The argument that its all about &#x27;culture&#x27;, like in so many other fields is a very questionable approach. Similar arguments are often made about Political Scicne that we must study &#x27;political culture&#x27; and that this will give us information about why things happen.<p>In both cases I think this is very questionable assumption being made. Individual choice in one battle or one political move can and does change things, and if you want to understanding what happens is absolutely relevant.<p>Also, things like doctrine that has been studied for a long time, are very related to culture so I don&#x27;t even fully agree that military historians have ignored culture.')
