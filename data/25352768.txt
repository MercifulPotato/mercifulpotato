It&#x27;s mostly a social thing, but we release music fairly regularly, and have done for about 9 years.    When sales were a thing, we used to make some money.  Not a lot, but every year or so, we&#x27;d break the payout boundary, and get £60 or so.  Always a running joke between us about &#x27;phoning Sunseeker&#x27; or whatever.<p>Since streaming became the thing, we make almost no money, and it&#x27;s a tiny fraction of what we used to make.<p>In 2013 Q2, we made £29.49<p>In 2020 Q2, we made £3.00<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I know we&#x27;re nobody, but I&#x27;m sure it scales in the same way for a lot of people who are taking this more seriously.  Unless you&#x27;re doing a <i>lot</i> of streams, then you make no money, and certainly not the money you did from sales.<p>Another bit of info, looking in a recent statement.<p>723 streams of a track earned us £0.0236.<p>1 sale of a track earned us £0.4297<p>Looking at the data, I&#x27;m pretty sure that people who listen to our tracks do so multiple times (if you filter by area, demographic, etc., you can pretty much tell that the same person in the same area likes a track and listen to it a lot - say 20 or 30 times) - exactly what you would do if you bought it.  But now even if someone listens to a track 100 times (which, let&#x27;s face it, you probably would in a lifetime), it will earn a tiny fraction of what a sale would for you.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;artist&#x2F;6mCvg6sz3K2WfFLaVYvHGl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;artist&#x2F;6mCvg6sz3K2WfFLaVYvHGl</a>')
