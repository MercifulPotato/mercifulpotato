In fact, no password itself has any guaranteed entropy and hence strength- only a distribution has this property. Since humans provide such poor randomness, we should never pick passwords at all, but generate them.<p>Research should go to making more memorable generated passwords, looking for the best tradeoff between that and entropy.')
