So along these lines, Iâ€™d be more interested in following experiments like these on say sea slugs. Give them a proto-amygdala&#x2F;hippocampus or limbic system and test them for increased memory, adaptive behavior etc. This choice of monkey experiment seems to be more sensation and less investigation, on the spectrum.')
