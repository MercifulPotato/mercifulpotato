School doctors, Hodson says, had diagnosed her foot pain as inflammation and told her that she wasn’t risking further injury by playing. Medical records show that an independent doctor subsequently reviewed MRI scans taken by Stanford and determined she had a stress fracture.<p>Just despicable people. Competitive athletes are already under an intense amount of pressure to play while injured - lying to them about their health (when they aren’t even getting paid!) is horrendous exploitation.')
