Because I doubt the average WordPress blogger is familiar with all possible laws the submissions could violate.  Or can make correct judgements based on precedent for things like copyright works.<p>Honestly though, the blogger would probably only need to pay for one hour of a lawyer&#x27;s time.  That lawyer would say &quot;Turning off the comments is your best bet&quot; and then round up to an hour for billing.')
