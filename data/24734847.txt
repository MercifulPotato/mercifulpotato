Instead, merely one of these companies doing it, alone, could have a huge effect.<p>For example, a power company, or water company doing this, all on its own, not conspiring with anyone at all, would be very bad for society, if it were legal (fortunately, it is not legal for a power company to do that).<p>This is because it would be extremely expensive, and difficult to get another power line, or water pipe, to your house.  There are huge barriers to entry.<p>If only a singular power company did this (after the law was changed), if would be very difficult for any of their customers to resist such changes.  They&#x27;d have to take extreme actions, such as moving, or paying for whole new pipes to be dug in the ground to their house.')
