Either you&#x27;re sick or your not, the immune system doesn&#x27;t &quot;prevent symptoms&quot; (strictly: it&#x27;s the cause of them).   This isn&#x27;t how things work.<p>As far as &quot;long term side effects&quot;... that&#x27;s also an extremely rare kind of interaction.  Vaccine delivery is extraordinarily safe.  I worry that your phrasing is invoking anti-vax paranoia.')
