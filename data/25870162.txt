Now, even a newscast looks crap in SDTV.<p>I think if webcams look absolutely fine to you for online meetings it&#x27;s probably because you have become used to the crappiness. People don&#x27;t typically show notebooks or pieces of paper in online meetings, because the cameras are crap, and they know they will create an awkward moment trying to focus on the notes and probably failing. For the same reason, people often won&#x27;t use a whiteboard in an online meeting, etc. These would be totally normal things to do if we had decent webcams.')
