There is no way I&#x27;d &#x27;let it ride&#x27;. At some point you rebalance your portfolio and you &#x27;miss out&#x27; on some of the upside by hedging your bets against an isolated downside.<p>I bought my first AAPL stock at ~$40 a share the first time, which I believe was about a year before their previous stock split. If I&#x27;d held it continuously I&#x27;d have 8x as many shares and a basis of $5 a share, which would mean I&#x27;d have 25x as much money as I started with.<p>But my portfolio would be unbalanced as hell, and I would have missed out on a lot of run-ups for WWDC and such. So I sold some, did profit taking on the rest, and occasionally bought back in, not always at the best times. So instead I have about 5x as many shares, and my basis is more like $45 a share, but now with some dividends on top, which is nice. If anything, my portfolio <i>still</i> has too much AAPL in it (I sold about 10% a few weeks ago)')
