Have a few ideas but want to build a solid product first and worry about money later.<p>Tech stack:\n - Strapi for the api&#x2F;cms\n - Nextjs for frontend\n - Tailwind\n - Meilisearch\n - willnorris&#x2F;imageproxy<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencoaster.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencoaster.com</a>')
