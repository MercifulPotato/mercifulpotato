Item(by='purplecats', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605103110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25027228, text='&gt; but I was greeted with a login wall after I filled all the details.<p>and? that sort of user-hostility is the signature of the modern web. for example: posting on imgur.com does the same thing with the added bonus that you lose your context and your comment after logging&#x2F;signing in.<p>reddit does the same thing so that you spent time crafting the perfect comment only to get told you have to wait an arbitrary amount of minutes before you can post.<p>the whole point is to get the user to invest as much as possible and then make them pay the price as a mechanism to force them to reconcile with the sunk cost fallacy. the web is built upon such an outwardly hostile environment, and it will only get worse.<p>and i hate it.')
