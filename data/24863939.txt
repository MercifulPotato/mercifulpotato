They keep trying to push the closed stuff, but that&#x27;s not what people want. We don&#x27;t mind paying, but we do mind not having public sources.<p>Ironically, this is practically stillborn unless people are already nginx-plus customers, as everyone else is using Istio (with Envoy) or bare Envoy or Traefik or Consul Connect or HAProxy or Linkerd or any of the other billion options out there. And when you are an nginx-plus customer you are unlikely to have a model where a mesh fits in. For a mesh to make sense you need to have more than just a need for service discovery; i.e. you have to have dynamic locations and counts of sources and destinations (or as people say: Kubernetes with automatic rollout waves and lots of changes and deploys all day long). The scenario where you have &#x27;all the cool toys&#x27; but also &#x27;need&#x27; nginx-plus (and NSM) seems unlikely to me.')
