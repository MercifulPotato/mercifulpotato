They&#x27;ve taken the most frequently-used audio tool and found a way to really let you fly with it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fabfilter.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;pro-q-3-equalizer-plug-in" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fabfilter.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;pro-q-3-equalizer-plug-in</a><p>Upon opening, it displays an empty field with a live frequency readout of the sound on the channel. You can click anywhere in the frequency range and it generates an EQ&#x2F;filter node underneath your mouse. It&#x27;s as easy as thinking about the aspect of the sound that you want to alter, and immediately having your tone-shaping underneath your fingers. You reach out and grab it.<p>It&#x27;s most-used features (gain, frequency, Q) are all changed by dragging the node or a modifier key (Cmd). These can all be done simultaneously in what feels like a unified gesture. The default filter type is context-dependent, based on where I grab on the spectrum. So if I grab a new node in the sub-bass frequencies it will automatically provide me a high-pass filter to start filtering all unwanted low-end. Ditto for the top-end, shelving filters, etc.<p>The fine-controls all appear in a secondary window just beneath your mouse that follows the filter node with you as you drag it, so you won&#x27;t find yourself moving back and forth across the entire screen to tweak controls. When you click on another node the fine-controls appear nearby and the controls for the first node disappear, keeping the GUI empty and very easy to read.<p>These features may seem simple and obvious now that I&#x27;ve explained them, but an EQ is easily the most-used tool in my toolbox, and FabFilter&#x27;s design choices have made the process quicker, easier, and far more intuitive than any other interface out there. It really puts a lot of pleasure back into the process that would be reduced fighting with inferior interfaces.<p>For comparison, most software EQs are either skeumorphic to resemble classic hardware EQs like this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uaudio.com&#x2F;uad-plugins&#x2F;equalizers&#x2F;pultec-passive-eq-collection.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uaudio.com&#x2F;uad-plugins&#x2F;equalizers&#x2F;pultec-passive...</a><p>or a hopelessly cramped and slow panel with every available parameter on display:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.waves.com&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;h-eq-hybrid-equalizer#h-eq-hybrid-equalizer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.waves.com&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;h-eq-hybrid-equalizer#h-eq-hyb...</a><p>I cannot praise FabFilter enough for the elegance, flexibility, and musicality of their products.')
