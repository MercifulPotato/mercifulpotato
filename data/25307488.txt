Politicians and people sometimes act like billionaires are hoarding a big slice of pie selfishly for themselves, but the reality is they made the pie bigger by adding value to the world. By the definition of how markets work they had to have added more value then they got compensated.<p>This is how it works with idealized new products. With highly competitive fields it is more zero sum, in that you take some pie from your competitors. But that&#x27;s still good overall as it&#x27;s adding value and making the market more efficient.<p>The only true zero sum game is the market for attention and why I despise social media companies. Everybody has a fixed amount of time, you can only grow that pie by adding more people.')
