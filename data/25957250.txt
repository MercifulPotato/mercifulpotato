As mentioned in many threads there was no inherent reason to think that GME would bankrupt any time soon.<p>I agree that GME don&#x27;t really benefit by the current stock price. However the benefit from the publicity for sure. What would they lose by sitting this out? It for sure be better for their image than creating &quot;a way out&quot; for the traders sitting on their shorts. You say the will still pay a price.. sure but what price they will pay if GME does nothing is still open.<p>TLDR I am not convinced that this would be their best play. It at least would have a massive loss of image for their customers(many of which currently are invested).')
