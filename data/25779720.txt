From that perspective I&#x27;m just happy that they will survive.<p>&gt; so I don&#x27;t see what Google could add other than lots of money and SWE hours<p>That matters.<p>&gt; IMO letting Fitbit die would have been better for users privacy-wise.<p>Have you seen what some companies do when they are on the brink of insolvency?  They start firing engineers, best practices lapse, and they start monetizing everything.<p>And have you seen the EU data privacy conditions?<p>And finally, of the companies that could have bought them, which has a better record of keeping their users&#x27; data private then Google?<p>But also, as a Fitbit user, if I wanted all my data deleted I could do that, but I absolutely do not. I want it kept private, supported, and crunched by a company like Google to our mutual advantage.')
