Item(by='bboygravity', descendants=None, kids=[25112159], score=None, time=1605537207, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25111774, text='&gt; There would be no reasonable mechanism for a vaccine that prevents infection but somehow still allows &quot;spreading&quot;.<p>Sure. I agree.<p>But there are mechanisms for a vaccine to prevent symptoms and still allow for some infection and spreading.<p>&gt; Either you&#x27;re sick or your not, the immune system doesn&#x27;t &quot;prevent symptoms&quot; (strictly: it&#x27;s the cause of them).<p>You seem to be contradicting yourself here. Being sick = having symptoms = the immune system being (overly) active. The main goal of all the vaccines under development is to prevent the immune system becoming overly active (AKA: fight the symptoms). Not necessarily to prevent any virus from being made in the body and being spread. Although we all hope that it also prevents spreading, it&#x27;s not a given and it&#x27;s not proven to do so (yet).<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible to be infected and infectious without &quot;being sick&quot; (no symptoms). Children do it all the time with SARS-CoV2.<p>&gt; As far as &quot;long term side effects&quot;... that&#x27;s also an extremely rare kind of interaction.<p>We&#x27;re about to vaccinate some 5 Billion people. That means we have to take into consideration &quot;extremely rare&quot; kind of interactions. Especially if you don&#x27;t want to feed the anti-vax conspiracy theories.<p>&gt; I worry that your phrasing is invoking anti-vax paranoia.<p>I worry that releasing the vaccine too soon could invoke irreparable anti-vax paranoia.<p>I&#x27;m all for the vaccine and I would be willing to participate in the trials (if they had space available). But I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s a good idea to just rush this vaccine and start immunizing the herd en-masse with the risk of serious disease in 1 in 100k people (for example). Now <i>that</i> would really feed the anti-vax paranoia.')
