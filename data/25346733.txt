And it is simply, unavoidably incorrect. It has nothing to do with the music itself - it has to do with his musical process and how it jives with the basic musical environment of his time.<p>If the whole musical world were like John Cage, Philip Glass&#x27;s works would definitely be avant-garde. But because the musical world is a lot more like Philip Glass, using the word &quot;avant-garde&quot; to describe his contributions is simply untrue.')
