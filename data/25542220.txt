Monopolies tend to be dangerous because they aren&#x27;t self regulating and they can easily extort consumers. But monopolies can also be very useful to consumers if they are acting in their interests, particularly in goods that have network effects (where the number of participants directly increases the product&#x27;s utility or makes it cheaper. As opposed to a S curve). Bell labs existed because the government gave Bell a monopoly over telephone networks so there wouldn&#x27;t be hundreds of wires everywhere (literal network), but the lab was part of the deal.')
