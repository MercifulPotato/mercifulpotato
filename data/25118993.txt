After my first stay in an Airbnb five years ago I learned I needed to be more careful about reading the reviews and the descriptions. Since then I’ve only had positive experiences. The places I stay in are usual run by an individual, not a manager (and when it is a manager it’s clear up front). The service has been fantastic and the places have been beautiful. My last stay was amazing. With my family at a house in San Juan Bautista, with a private lake, the last week before my kids went back to school.')
