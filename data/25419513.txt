I&#x27;ve found some really insightful comments in &#x2F;r&#x2F;javascript from the creators of selenium for example; but the noise to signal is very low as you mentioned. &#x2F;r&#x2F;reactjs is another decent community as the maintainers do post in the comments.<p>I like &#x2F;r&#x2F;coding but it&#x27;s pretty dead and sometimes &#x2F;r&#x2F;scala will have decent blog posts. Also &#x2F;r&#x2F;hnblogs is very decent, but extremely slow, for insightful posts as well.')
