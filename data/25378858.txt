So how did we get a $5000 bill? <i>Google&#x27;s</i> alert was 6 hours late (according to them, this was root-caused to us, because we were submitting jobs continuously). They pointed to their TOS and said they don&#x27;t guarantee on-time delivery of the alert.<p>I had to write up a blog post with fancy graphs and prepare it for social media before they finally agreed to eat the bill.')
