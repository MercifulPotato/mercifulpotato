And when you do, you get the “Congratulations!” message. But you also get a counter in the UI, showing how many rockets you’ve launched (Just 001?). And you get 1000 white science, which up until this point had never been seen in the game...<p>...and after a few minutes, a new goal comes to mind: Launch one rocket every minute. And that’s when the deep game begins. You’ll need massive power production and manufacturing infrastructure, you’ll start using the online calculators to figure out ratios of this to that, and when you get to 1 rocket per minute, you’ll want to see if you can design a system that does that while running completely untouched for 24 hours.')
