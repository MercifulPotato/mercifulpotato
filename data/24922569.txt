Item(by='totalZero', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603910701, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24920538, text='The full heading is &quot;Cadillac&#x27;s Super Cruise Outperforms Other Driving Assistance Systems: Other automakers close in on Tesla&#x27;s Autopilot, now a distant second, in Consumer Reports&#x27; new ratings of 17 systems,&quot; but that seemed long and wordy. CR used the phrase &quot;distant second&quot; for Tesla&#x27;s DAS, calling Autopilot out by name, so it seemed fair to consolidate the headline as submitted.')
