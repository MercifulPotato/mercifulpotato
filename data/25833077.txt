Item(by='claudiawerner', descendants=None, kids=[25835466], score=None, time=1611061668, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25832664, text='&gt;are euphemisms for a politically powerful group to harness the productive output of the governed for its own purposes, without regard to if the perceived problems or the perceived solutions are real or not<p>This is unsubstantiated in that it posits the &quot;politically powerful&quot; as having nothing but their own interests in mind. Ignoring the possible retort I could make that then interests of the politically powerful can not only <i>coincide</i> with the will of the people but also <i>be</i> the will of the people - reformation would remove a significant monetary interest which is exposed time and time again behind the politically powerful. The drive to be politically powerful is thereby lessened, or at least changed.<p>&gt;The real difference between capitalism and socialism is that capitalism requires voluntary action whereas socialism embraces compelled action.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of scholarly work both from libertarian socialism, anarchism and defences of socialism from liberal principles; I&#x27;d recommend G.A. Cohen on this point.<p>&gt; Socialism doesn&#x27;t remove fundamental human desires for prestige and power, it only redirects the energy into the mechanisms of state<p>It&#x27;s worth questioning to what extent fundamental human desires really are so fundamental, isn&#x27;t it? I&#x27;m also not convinced prestige and power are bad things; arguably, that drive is how we have democracy in the first place, never mind the American revolution.<p>&gt;and no that&#x27;s not necessarily a benefit to the poor, or the underprivileged, or any other banner of victimization that you might fly to justify that state<p>There&#x27;s a whole area of philosophical and economic research dedicated to what extent this is a good question - distributive justice and the theory of exploitation. If the only argument is that it&#x27;s &quot;not necessarily&quot; the case, we&#x27;d have just as much of a case against some forms of markets in that they may satisfy consumer preferences <i>as they create those preferences</i>, not to other advantages.<p>&gt; In capitalism, the voluntary aspect allows for failure<p>Democracy also allows for failure if the people do not see their will adequately reflected.')
