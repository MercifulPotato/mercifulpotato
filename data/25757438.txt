Item(by='jd3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610506576, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25743441, text='&gt; Maybe we have some difference in configuration, but I don&#x27;t have any perceivable difference between the two - still on urxvt since way back.<p>I think the entirety of my ~&#x2F;.xresources xterm config is<p><pre><code>  #include &quot;.Xresources.colors&quot;\n\n  !! xterm\n  ! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;invisible-island.net&#x2F;xterm&#x2F;\n  ! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux.die.net&#x2F;man&#x2F;1&#x2F;xterm\n  !XTerm.vt100.faceName: Monaco:pixelsize=11\n  XTerm.scrollTtyKeypress: true\n  XTerm.scrollTtyOutput: false\n  XTerm.utf8:    true\n\n  XTerm.vt100.boldMode: false\n  XTerm.vt100.locale: false\n  XTerm.vt100.scrollbar.width: 8\n  XTerm.vt100.scrollBar: true\n  XTerm.vt100.utf8: true\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ll try to take a video of the difference at some point — I use xorg 1.20.8 on macOS 11.1 and it definitely feels noticeable when I type quickly with vsync disabled (through Quartz Debug.app).<p>&gt; Background transparency is the one feature keeping me from considering xterm.<p>That&#x27;s fair. The macOS xorg server has never supported the COMPOSITE extension&#x2F;xcompmgr&#x2F;compiz, so transparency&#x2F;compositing have always been out of the question for me.<p>&gt; I like the URL handling hack in OP, but I&#x27;m also a bit married to some urxvt plugins (URL handler, trimming whitespace when copying)<p>I sympathize with this — I used urxvt for years and grew to like how it could easily extend itself using perl. Thankfully, I have been able to mirror all of my urxvt functionality in xterm since I switched back. It also helped me simplify my ~&#x2F;.xresources, which shrank from ~300 lines 10 years ago to 50 (for both my xterm and urxvt configs excluding color definitions, which live in ~&#x2F;.Xresources.colors).')
