Right after he said what you quoted in that speech, he said: &quot;I speak to border guards and they tell us what we&#x27;re getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They&#x27;re sending us not the right people.&quot;<p>He&#x27;s constantly repeating how good the Mexicans and Japanese and everyone else is... (as opposed to the American leaders back then)... but the best ones among the Mexicans are not the ones coming in to the U.S. by crossing the border illegally. If you look at the context, he is clearly saying that Mexico has great people in general, the leaders are smarter and they have some terrible people who they&#x27;re sending across the border illegally.<p>His opponents, which were all of the media back then, because he was neither liked by either party, attacked him for it. It was even a part of the attack strategy by Jeb Bush&#x27;s campaign because he has a Mexican wife. They did it by taking the quote out of context, as anybody would do. If I was a political strategist, I would happily do the same. It was a easy hand to play and would potentially sway voters away from him.<p>Since the election is over, I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re not one of Media Matters bots and I think, like a lot of people, you genuinely believe that those remarks were what the media told you they were... which is why I&#x27;m having this conversation.<p>Have a nice day!')
