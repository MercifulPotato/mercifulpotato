I&#x27;m Markus, the author of this blog post and the related USENIX paper. It&#x27;s great to see the interest in this line of research. I would like to address some of the points brought up in the comments and provide additional information:<p>- Path-aware Internet architectures and SCION in particular are <i></i>not<i></i> source-routing architectures. End hosts neither have&#x2F;need a full view of the network topology, nor can they unilaterally choose paths. Instead, network operators explore and distribute candidate paths. End hosts get a set of such pre-selected paths from which they can then choose the one they want to use. This is one of the main points of the paper: How can autonomous systems in the Internet efficiently restrict the choices of end hosts.\n- SCION does not help with censorship. On the contrary: compared to the BGP&#x2F;IP Internet, some power is shifted from network operators to end hosts. It is these <i>end hosts</i>, who can implement &quot;geo-fencing&quot; <i>not the network operators</i>. While these still retain a significant amount of control over paths (see above) it is easier for end hosts to circumvent networks that employ censorship.\n- One important point about SCION and other path-aware architectures is that the path control of end hosts is at an autonomous-system level. Thus, most problems with LSRR&#x2F;SSRR are not present in SCION. For example:\n  - End hosts cannot choose paths at a router level and thus not evade firewalls (unless they are very poorly deployed).\n  - End hosts do not learn any information about the intra-domain topology, only about the <i>inter-domain</i> topology. This information can already be inferred today and is available in public datasets such as the CAIDA AS-relationship dataset [1]\n- There is a Tor-like anonymous-communication network designed to use with SCION: HORNET [2].<p>Of course, path control by itself cannot solve all problems. This is why SCION includes several additional innovations such as a public-key infrastructure (PKI) that does not depend on global trust anchors and single points of failure, a secure routing mechanism, highly efficient mechanisms for packet authentication, etc.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caida.org&#x2F;data&#x2F;as-relationships&#x2F;index.xml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caida.org&#x2F;data&#x2F;as-relationships&#x2F;index.xml</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netsec.ethz.ch&#x2F;research&#x2F;anonymity.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netsec.ethz.ch&#x2F;research&#x2F;anonymity.php</a>')
