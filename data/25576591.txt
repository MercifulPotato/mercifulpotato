So it is easy for them to give loans by &quot;printing money&quot;, since a loan from the central bank is just as good as cash.<p>You could still layer a system like that on top of Bitcoin. However, you might have trouble getting people to accept your bitcoin IOUs as equivalent to real coins.<p>That said, why would you want that? Why not just use fiat currencies where they are appropriate, and leave Bitcoin for the use cases in which it&#x27;s appropriate? It doesn&#x27;t need to replace the whole economy to be useful as a technology.')
