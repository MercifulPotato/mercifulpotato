A license is not a contract because the licensee is not required to do anything. A license can have conditions (restriction), but not covenants (promises to do something). A license basically functions as a defense against a claim of infringement.<p>Note: For purchased software there is a contract for the sale of the software subject to the license, but that shouldn’t be confused with the license itself.')
