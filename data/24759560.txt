For example, I might say &quot;Christianity is causing a lot of suffering and death&quot;. I think that statements like that are &quot;free speech&quot; and not &quot;harassment&quot;, but a fundamental Christian person who hears this statement may think that expressing this opinion constitutes harassment. So you have a statement, and two people disagree whether it is free speech. You think there&#x27;s a contradiction somewhere in there. Well, where is it?')
