Today, as we come out of the second lockdown, there are still 15,000 patients in hospital.<p>The UK has not demonstrated that schools can safely be kept open.<p>Unfortunately, as the geniuses in government decided to reopen schools <i>and</i> universities <i>and</i> offices all at the same time, it&#x27;s difficult to directly attribute the second wave to any single policy decision.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;news&#x2F;schools-and-colleges-to-reopen-in-full-in-september" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;news&#x2F;schools-and-colleges-to-r...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-53942542" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-53942542</a>')
