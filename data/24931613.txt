You&#x27;ve definitely got a better mental model of Emacs than I did when I first started using it. Welcome to the Emacs party! I hope you like it here. :)<p>I like thinking of Emacs as a running Lisp REPL that fires off different functions depending on what key I press. If you haven&#x27;t seen this already yet, run `C-h k` (describe-key) which will tell you the Emacs Lisp function behind a particular keystroke. You can then call that function directly with `M-: (emacs-function-here) RET`.')
