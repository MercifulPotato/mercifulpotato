You need experience first. Fresh out of college, I was making $25k&#x2F;yr in 2005. Within 4 years I was in the $40k~$50k range, but I also valued ... life, and living. I applied and got a holiday work visa (if you&#x27;re under 30, they&#x27;re ~$300 and you can live an work in another country for a year. Different countries have different agreements and age limits) and lived in Australia for a year and NZ for three.<p>I also took a year off once and lived off of savings (and out of two bags and hostels). It wasn&#x27;t until I lived in Seattle I was making six figures. It took a lot of experience and research and work to build up that level of expertise. It also took being in the right market (the west coast). If I had stayed in my home town, it wouldn&#x27;t have been possible. (I wrote a post about tech markets for those who are interested: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tech-culture-shock-from-america-to-the-south-pacific-and-seattle-to-chicago&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tech-culture-shock-from-ameri...</a>)<p>What you&#x27;re describing is a tale that may be true for you, but it&#x27;s the tale of someone who is determined to work at all odds to be at the top. If you want to live and do other things and have real adventures, you&#x27;re not going to be in the same spot.')
