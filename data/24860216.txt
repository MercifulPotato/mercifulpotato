I got lucky with the real estate, and I got out because I didn&#x27;t think my luck would last forever.  Now my portfolio is made up entirely of fixed income securities and blue-chip stocks that pay dividends.  The dividends and interest payments are laddered such that I recieve at least 2 payments a month.  I didn&#x27;t choose securities based on payout dates, so the amount does fluctuate from month-to-month.  However, the portfolio generates enough monthly income that the &quot;leanest&quot; month is greater than my paycheck&#x27;s monthly gross income.<p>Being a software engineer myself, I don&#x27;t qualify for the Roth accounts so most of my investments are done in a standard taxable account.  I don&#x27;t buy any particular funds -- just a variety of boring bonds and stocks.<p>I did try the RE (retire early) part a while back.  It lasted about 6 months before I got too bored out of my mind.    I still continue to work because of the mental stimulation and the social connections.')
