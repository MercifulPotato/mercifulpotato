AFAIK the U.S. is still the only nation on earth to ever use this weapon of mass destruction.<p>Claiming that the own nuclear arsenal is defensive while the empirical evidence suggests otherwise is a pretty strange notion. If the going gets tough, the U.S. is probably going to use nukes again. Hopefully it won&#x27;t get that tough. I&#x27;m not even sure how you can use a nuke defensively. Kill them all first because they kill us...I guess it could be argued to be defensive technically.')
