The ingest configuration is just Python, so one could conceivably write a module to assign accounts based on the incoming data. I know there was a module that would try to use ML to do that based on your account history.<p>If you don’t want to do that, another option is hledger. I used that for a while before deciding to switch back to beancount for its ingest process. However, considering I have made no progress on that over the last year, I might just go back to using hledger.<p>hledger’s ingest process is not as sophisticated as beancount’s. You can’t write arbitrary plugins like with beancount, but you can pattern match on the incoming text and assign accounts that way. You can also define automatic transactions in your books, which I found incredibly helpful for managing my budget.')
