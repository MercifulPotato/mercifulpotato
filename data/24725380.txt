Itâ€™s nice to see this go all the way from poking at hardware to decompiling binaries and then some signal processing. Kudos.<p>You mentioned you were getting distortion&#x2F;noise when downsampling below 928kHz. Are you lowpass-filtering before you decimate (but after you demodulate)? Otherwise you will get all kinds of aliasing.<p>Looks like FM radio stations have a bandwidth of 200kHz so you should be able to lowpass with a cutoff of around 50kHz then decimate to 232kHz.')
