Code that is well designed makes mistakes look obvious and the logic feel natural. It&#x27;s very hard to write code like that, but I&#x27;ve seen it and I&#x27;ve been able to write it myself, so when I see a bunch of complicated code that only tests can tell whether or not it works, I know that the problem is really that the best design simply has not been found yet. If I find code that looks like shit and I realize there&#x27;s a better design for it that will make the code clear and natural, I won&#x27;t think twice to refactor it ruthlessly if such code has been a source of problems and time wasted (and fixing difficult to read code is huge costly to morale as well, which when taken into consideration, increases the cost of technical debt by a lot).')
