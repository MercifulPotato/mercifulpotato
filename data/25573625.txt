Just that if you have an attacker in your house who is intent of killing you (&quot;beating you to death&quot;) and an average police response of 5 minutes or more, they can get into any room in a typical house. You can barricade the door, but anyone who knows about construction knows drywall is easy enough to get through. Most interior doors are lightweight wood and newer ones are practically cardboard. So usually it&#x27;s much harder to get into a house from outside than to get to other internal parts of the house due to material differences.<p>I think most people have no idea how insecure their homes are. Mostly because these types of scenarios are statistically rare and people always think it will happen to others. Plus, it could be hard to sleep at night knowing just how easy it is to pick locks if someone actually wanted to.')
