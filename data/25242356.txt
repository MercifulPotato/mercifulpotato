I expect it marginally improves initial acceleration but I also expect top speed is unchanged. Heavier wheels would allow you to coast for longer without needing to pedal (conservation of momentum) but besides the initial acceleration performance is mostly unchanged. Unless you’re constantly stopping and starting idk if it makes much difference. Similarly, I’d expect the chain’s weight to have a minuscule impact on acceleration but the increased efficiency sounds like it is several orders of magnitude beyond whatever trade off there is to a slightly heavier chain.')
