I think a big part of the problem, that I feel Cyberpunk actually highlights really well, is the degree to which problems are ultimately defined by and related to the individual. And, unfortunately, constrained.<p>Take the hippie movement. It&#x27;s often associated with &#x27;the left&#x27; but I&#x27;d argue that the navel-gazing focus on individual enlightenment caused immense damage to the ability of those without power to collectively have enough of it to see some changes.<p>Cyberpunk, intentionally or not, highlights this. The typical Cyberpunk scene is a person alone, getting by. Any kind of &#x27;collective&#x27; behavior is nipped in the bud by surveillance and whatnot. Any solutions involve that lone person forming valuable relationships with other lone persons (or robits, I guess).<p>The dystopia, I feel, is usually not experientially the marketing, the massive corporate powers, and so on. It&#x27;s the stifling isolation, and the only solution that&#x27;s remotely viable is finding another single soul to share it with.<p>What I&#x27;ve found interesting about a show&#x2F;book series like The Expanse, is that it dips into the Cyberpunk themes with the detective dude (I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence that Cyberpunk and film noir often overlap, the latter just an earlier iteration of the former). But eventually that guy, in the expanse of multiple planets, has <i>options</i> to find something bigger, more collective, to be part of.')
