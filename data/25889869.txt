It would be a great war story to read (if a Microsoft employee was allowed to write it up).<p>I love the idea of starting a new modern OS written from the ground up with security and safety in mind sound.<p>However, it looks like Microsoft took a different direction with WindowsX. Instead, it looks like they have taken a bold leap and hacked out all of the Win32 guts from Windows to make it a Chromebook competitor. And the talk on the town is, further down the line, they will re-add Win32 back in as a virtualised service (i guess kinda like WSL2) so its completely sandboxed from the rest of the OS.')
