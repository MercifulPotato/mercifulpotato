Any planet with life undergoing evolution may also develop millions of species, with &quot;intelligence&quot; being an important trait for some of them. Problem is, that tells us nothing about how many planets could sprout life in the first place.<p>Even right now on Earth, we have multiple tool-using species spanning mammals, birds, and cephalopods, separated by hundreds of millions of years of evolution. They all seem like good candidates for developing technology at some point over a few million years.')
