Choose the language relative to the audience is my moto.<p>&gt;I have in my day job some code we got from Korea. I&#x27;m told by those who have spent the time to understand it that it is good code.

It really doesn&#x27;t matter how good the code is.... the understandability of your naming is by far more important.<p>Totally agreed.')
