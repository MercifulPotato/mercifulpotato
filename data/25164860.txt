I expect it&#x27;s a lot of Linux people vs. Apple people.  And maybe it&#x27;s appropriate.  I would say Linux people should use Linux and Apple people should use Apple.  No problem either way.  If you&#x27;re a Linux-curious Apple person, then perhaps you&#x27;ll find some good information here.  I think most of us are probably very, very specific about our technological tools, so this is a very personal decision, yes?<p>Personally I&#x27;m a Linux person that used a Macbook Pro as a daily driver for about 8 years.  I still use the Macbook (2013) as a carry-home, but I started using a Linux desktop in the office about a year ago.  <i>For what I do</i> (Linux sysadmin with developer tendencies), I like it much better, and this machine has 12 cores and 64GB of RAM and still cost about half of the top-end Macbook Pro of today.  I chose Manjaro KDE for this, and I really like it a lot.')
