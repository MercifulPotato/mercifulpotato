As a money-making scheme, this was pretty lousy: a year’s work and all they had to show for it was a binder full of maxed-out credit cards. [It was] because of the experience they’d had as the first hosts.<p>While I agree that grit and persistence eventually lead to success for most smart founders, I think PG&#x27;s explanation for why the founders didn&#x27;t give up is misguided.  If the explanation for their persistence was the great experience they stumbled upon, why didn&#x27;t they quit in the preceding 3 years?<p>My guess is that Brian, Nate, and Joe are naturally stubborn (read: persistent) and have a high degree of self-belief.  They eventually hit the lottery with their idea for Airbnb.  Had they not founded Airbnb, I bet they would&#x27;ve kept trekking along and stumbled upon another (less) successful idea.<p>Persistence is a double-edged sword.  It&#x27;ll eventually lead you to success but at what opportunity cost?  I&#x27;d be interested in seeing studies that help quantify the downside of grit by studying founder failures.')
