His main argument was the Linux kernel. But when you look at this project now, it seems quite far from the bazaar style. There are many bazaar-style projects that failed and many cathedral-style projects that do very well. So his main argument is moot.<p>We can treat this essay as a historical document, not something anyone should refer to as to how the open source development should be done  (even though he has some good points about leadership style for example).')
