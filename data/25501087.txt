I suspect today he&#x27;d change that idea given the better data available.<p>Personally I think adding lighting to cities makes personal safety far better. I get what the studies are doing but I think they are relying on novelty to get published over boring.<p>But certainly you have to watch putting someone down a well-lit underpass over crossing a not so well-lit busy road.<p>I think the value to the data is for councils to find where lighting should be improved. Plus there&#x27;s also more to safety than just crime.')
