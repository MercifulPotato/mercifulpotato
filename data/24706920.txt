This article is merely one example, there were enough to make Chrome give up and turn off their XSS filter. So main defence should be CSP and sanitization is just a nice-to-have.<p>* Because sanitized input is often saner than the nonsense users can insert when they are allowed to put in tags. Basically use sanitization as an HTML Tidy with extra filtering. Also for very old browsers.')
