I thought I&#x27;d share my experience because Reincubate is a small company - you could count us with your fingers when I joined.<p>It was a fun place to work with nerf guns and rubber balls to throw at each other. You learnt to keep your computer locked the &quot;fun&quot; way. We always went for a team lunch on Fridays - something that I&#x27;ve missed ever since. I enjoyed coming into work every day because of the people.<p>The favourite highlight of my entire career was there, back in 2015. The whole team of engineers (~6ish) worked together to figure out how to decrypt iOS 9 beta backups as Apple had changed the encryption system. Everyone contributed in some way and I delved into using a disassembler, IDA Pro, from zero prior experience armed with a textbook. It took a whole week from the beta being released, and I believe we were the first (public) company to do it.<p>The values of the company, as described on the website, have changed, but what they say now still matches up with my time there.<p>Switching to something more relevant to this article. I was looking for a webcam a couple of months ago for quite a while before it also hit me that my iPhone camera was actually damn good. Since then I&#x27;ve been connecting to Zoom twice (from my phone for the video, and my computer for the audio). It&#x27;s not a great experience but I never really looked into the &quot;random&quot; apps that could create a virtual camera. Well Reincubate is not random to me and it looks like there&#x27;s a beta version of Camo for Windows, so I don&#x27;t really have an excuse :)')
