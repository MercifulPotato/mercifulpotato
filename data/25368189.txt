Almost no one announces they are building a nuclear weapon, it is usually done in secret. So this argument does not really hold.<p>What I think most people do is they see from a practical standpoint that having unrestricted access to nuclear weapons is extremely dangerous and work backwards to justify why it fits their ideological framework.')
