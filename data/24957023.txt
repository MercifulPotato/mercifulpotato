Stop raising money from investors that demand hockey stick growth. Find investors that expect reasonable growth and returns. If an investor encourages every single one of their investments to be a 1000x return, expecting only 1 in 100 to be so, and kills any company the moment they realize they wonâ€™t fulfill the investment thesis, many companies do nothing but pivot until they run out of capital. Very few companies can accomplish such a high level of growth and most only do so through gray means (regulatory violations of UBER and Airbnb).')
