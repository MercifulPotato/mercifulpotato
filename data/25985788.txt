If we wish to be unkind, we can say that Myanmar is a subsistence agricultural economy, relying on a few commodities, with a pre-industrial economic structure, which has no shock absorbers to cushion the impact of events originating within and outside the country. Natural and human-made disasters, therefore, windfalls from the bounty of nature and commodity booms that resulted from such events as the Korean War largely determined the state of the economy, rather than factors such as the GDI&#x2F;GDP ratio.</i><p><i>Such unkind views can, however, no longer hold with the official data for Myanmar’s economic performance coming into the new millennium. In biblical times, it was possible for a country’s economy to enjoy seven fat years in a row and then to suffer seven lean years in a row. Not anymore! Global warming, a growing menace, has brought with it climate change that has made weather volatile and erratic. There is no way a country can expect to have seven consecutive years of good harvests in the twenty-first century.</i><p>That was written back in 2005 and it looks like their GDP predictions have turned out to be correct with a big drop in their GDP since 2005.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;myanmar&#x2F;gdp-growth-annual" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;myanmar&#x2F;gdp-growth-annual</a>')
