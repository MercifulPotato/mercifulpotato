If you go into a coffee shop and start smashing windows and beating people up and rallying for people to murder each other the coffee shop doesn’t need “due process” to kick you out and ban you.<p>Then, the leader of that riot should go to jail for 25 years for murder, not simply &quot;banned from coffee shop&quot;.<p>Also, in a real situation, employees would first keep themselves safe and call police to handle the matter.<p>In your imaginary situation, would you ask your minimum-wage employees to handle violence in the store?<p>This is my point exactly. Twitter should just follow the law. If Trump breaks the law, then get a court order to remove him or call the police.<p>Dorsey and Zuck shouldn&#x27;t play police.<p>Also, who&#x27;s screaming? Just search on twitter. Dorsey and Zuck has been called Nazis, white supremacists, racists for not banning Trump.')
