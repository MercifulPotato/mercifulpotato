Item(by='dpc_pw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602000918, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24694811, text='Editing in Vim feels like a bit like editing in `ed` if you ever tried it. It&#x27;s a bit like &quot;type in a command, and see the result&quot;. You type d3w and you will get 3 word deleted. In Kakoune every keypress results in visual response. You type 3w, you see that 3 words were selected, then you hit d and they get deleted. It makes editing much more interactive, smooth and less error prone.<p>Unlike the other responder, I am actually not big fan of multiple selections and prefer search and replace. But once in a while multiple selections come handy even for me, so I don&#x27;t mind them being there.')
