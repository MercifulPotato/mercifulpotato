Zen1 performance on real software (i.e. not SPEC) was tragic, similar to Barcelona on a per-clock comparison. They learned this lesson and dramatically increased BTB entries on Zen2 and again for Zen3. But the question in my mind is why would you save a few pennies per million units by shaving off half the BTB entries? Doesn&#x27;t make sense. They must have been guided by the wrong benchmark software.')
