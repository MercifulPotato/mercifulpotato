Words like &quot;insurrection&quot; and &quot;coup&quot; are being thrown around, even though there was clearly no path from &quot;protesters enter capital&quot; to &quot;protesters seize government power&quot;. Using the word&quot;insurrection&quot; also primes people for activating the &quot;Insurrection Act&quot; and using military for policing. We already see Twitter and Facebook moving on censorship and people generally supporting it because of outrage at capitol being breached. Trump supporters had absolutely nothing to gain from storming the capitol, but the politicians had a huge amount to gain by winning this their easy, which opens lots of doors. I&#x27;m of the opinion that with the actions already being taken, more will follow shortly. Instead of calming everyone down, they are whipping up public opinion, for what? Probably new laws and restrictions.')
