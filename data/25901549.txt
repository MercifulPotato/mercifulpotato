And I see this in all modern cars. I don&#x27;t remember feeling the same way about cars from 20-30 years ago. I&#x27;m quite confident that if the V40 would roll over, even at somewhat high speed, my chances of getting out relatively unscathed would be better than even those in a sports car from, say, 30 years ago.')
