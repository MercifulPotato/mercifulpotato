By censoring users&#x27; posts that don&#x27;t violate the law they are acting as a publisher and not a platform, ergo eliminating Section 230 protections.<p>To my understanding, Trump didn&#x27;t authorize the publishing of his tax info, so surely that would count as &quot;hacked&quot; or &quot;illegally obtained&quot;, right? From what I&#x27;ve read about Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop, the information was legally obtained because he left the computer at the repair shop long enough that it legally became the property of the shop owner. I could be wrong (and if I am, please let me know) but that, to me, seems like clear bias on the part of Twitter and Facebook.<p>If they had treated both articles in the same manner I would likely agree with you about a lack of bias, but it seems to me that this was done to prevent damage being done to one campaign.')
