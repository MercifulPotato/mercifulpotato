But if you could ask them if they think restaurants deserve a chance at fair negotiations they would probably also say yes.<p>All the bill is asking for is cooperation up front, not afterwards if at all. It&#x27;s not criminalizing the business model of DoorDash and friends, it&#x27;s just forcing them to treat their business partners like business partners.<p>I think it&#x27;s fair to say I have some bias here though. I am a little bit too cynical toward these companies to believe they&#x27;re just out here trying to better the world. They&#x27;re doing their best to spin a buck before going public and peacing out. Case in point, DoorDash just IPOd with no profit and no projection for profitability, even in it&#x27;s best case scenario (massive increase in online ordering).<p>So obviously the service is extremely useful, people find it useful while it&#x27;s subsidized but no one has yet bared the full cost of these platforms.<p>In my opinion we need to protect existing businesses who are profitable and thus have a proven place in the economy, while these disruptive companies flail about free from the shackles of actually fitting into the economy, just in case it turns out they wouldn&#x27;t.')
