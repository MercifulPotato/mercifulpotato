Some problems are just so much simpler in an imperative style that it&#x27;s worth the lack of confidence you get with the functional solution in its correctness and robustness.<p>That&#x27;s why I love languages that have fairly powerful functional features but have an imperative escape hatch. I think more and more languages are becoming that. Rust does it very well, but the lisps, probably Scala, and a few others I&#x27;m not thinking of may be better, don&#x27;t have much experience with those though.')
