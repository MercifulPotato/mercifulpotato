I found some in Fremont. There&#x27;s plenty in San Gabriel, Alhambra, and other places on the north east side of LA but SF, nothing. No authentic Japanese, no authentic Chinese, no authentic Vietnamese, no authentic Korean, no authentic Taiwanese, no authentic Malay&#x2F;Singapore&#x2F;Indonesian.')
