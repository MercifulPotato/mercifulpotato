It’s likely that these decisions are made by epidemiologists with not only specific training, but also access to much more data than the person who builds the dashboards.<p>Making a decision to include data in a visualization without understanding why is not a good idea because it’s common that people think they know what numbers mean, but only because they have limited visibility.<p>Having a degree in data science doesn’t mean that I’m a data scientist. If I’m hired in a web dev role, then I hope my input is received well and considered by epidemiologists in charge. And I hope they’d be able to spend time explaining the rationale behind their decisions.<p>This seems like a similar analogy where the build engineer decides to change the git repo because they know better than the dev team. Then someone reading the article says “well they have a PhD in computer science so they should know what they’re doing, it’s simple.”')
