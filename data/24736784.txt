It had no battery backup (optional) and we were not using the serial output at all...so we lost any programs we made on power off.  It was very interesting to learn and I feel fortunate that I understand computers on that level.<p>That being said...I don&#x27;t really do code at all :)  Most of what I do is on the hardware side of things.<p>Edit: Emac...not emacs')
