Where&#x27;s the conflict?<p>The best I could summarize it is that &quot;reflexivity&quot; postulates that economic equilibria are usually not stable, but metastable. That is, they can be easily pushed out of their stability regime, at which point the feedback loops will no longer balance, and the equilibrium will get re-established elsewhere (if at all).<p>That&#x27;s the only thing I can see that requires some empirical justification. Other than that, the postulates seem to be basically &quot;feedback loops 101&quot;, and the &quot;mainstream economics&quot; concepts, as I understand them, are built on the same principles too.')
