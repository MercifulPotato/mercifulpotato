Freud spoke of the narcissism of small differences, saying that “it is precisely communities with adjoining territories, and related to each other in other ways as well, who are engaged in constant feuds and ridiculing each other”. Nazis and German Jews. Northern Irish Protestants and Northern Irish Catholics. Hutus and Tutsis. South African whites and South African blacks. Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs. Anyone in the former Yugoslavia and anyone else in the former Yugoslavia.<p>I’m not going to pick through every example here, but it’s plain as day there are examples where no reasonable person in this audience would characterize as “engaged in constant feuds and ridiculing each other”.<p>Imploring people to find grace in fault is one thing, but imploring people to find forgiveness for those who would murder them for who they are is another. And imploring people who don’t find themselves particularly in the middle of such violence to see them as “feuding” is despicable.<p>I’m sure there’s more nuance in the article but I honestly couldn’t get past this passage. And I’m comfortable with the fact that my tolerance has limits, including not treating nazis and German Jews as somehow morally equivalent in conflict, even rhetorically.')
