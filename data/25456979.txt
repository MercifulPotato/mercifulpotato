There are tons of entitled assholes in this world and &quot;Karens&quot; are just one type. As another commenter mentioned, &quot;Karen&quot; is used for entitled, soccer-mom-types, especially for treating front-line workers like crap and attempting to get a manager for their demands. As for the right-wing association, I don&#x27;t think being right-wing is inherent to being a &quot;Karen&quot;. I think that association was borne from the current political climate and viral videos.<p>It&#x27;s like how in elementary English class they teach that all words ending in -ly are adverbs, but not all adverbs end in -ly: All &quot;Karens&quot; are entitled assholes, but not all entitled assholes are &quot;Karens&quot;.')
