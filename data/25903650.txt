I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s incorrect to describe this as hateful, because it&#x27;s very clearly informed by a bias against homeless people rather than any real evidence.<p>This is the equivalent of jumping into a discussion to say that Black people are poor because they &quot;keep buying cellphones&quot;. It&#x27;s not a serious intellectual comment, it&#x27;s cloaked hatred.')
