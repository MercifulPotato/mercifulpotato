Part of my rationale for this is that I assume that I&#x27;m dealing with the thin end of the wedge - if there&#x27;s enough complexity in the task to warrant conditionals, there&#x27;s likely a whole bunch more (or there will be in future) that I haven&#x27;t encountered or grasped yet.<p>I&#x27;m thus willing to take the time-hit on rewriting in Python, because I&#x27;m betting that resulting code will be easier to adapt and easier to troubleshoot as this extra complexity gradually comes into view.')
