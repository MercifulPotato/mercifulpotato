California has approximately  40 million people living in it and yet it still has only 2 senators which means that in California 1 senator represents 20 million people. Wyoming has approximately 600,000 people and still gets two senators meaning that 1 senator represents 300,000 people. Given that senators are needed to pass laws, your vote has significantly more weight if you live in Wyoming than if you live in California. What this means is that even though republicans have a majority in the senate they represent a minority of the American population.  I mean even the president was voted into office with fewer votes than their opponent.<p>Contrast this with countries that use proportional representation which means everyone&#x27;s vote basically means more or less the same as anyone else&#x27;s vote.<p>The US is currently ranked 25th in the world by &quot;democracy ranking&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Democracy_Index" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Democracy_Index</a>')
