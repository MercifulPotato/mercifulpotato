Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=[24658714], score=None, time=1601609837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24658418, text='The problem in discussions like this is that hordes of gullible&#x2F;uninformed commenters filled with cynicism and essentially colonial senses of superiority are willing to make gross generalizations about other cultures like India without knowing any of the history, culture, precolonial way of living, etc. They eat up skin deep coverage of complicated topics like the article linked here, with stories pushed by certain groups and largely written by white American, anti-India&#x2F;Hindu activists, and pro-Pakistan&#x2F;Islam activists.<p>“Caste” is an English pejorative used to describe a system in India that was largely in place for economic division of labor, stable passage of knowledge&#x2F;skills generationally, and other cultural reasons. It wasn’t made for discrimination or classist reasons, but ignorant casual racists (many of whom are posting here) are painting that picture based on very recent history. It’s important to remember that India was the victim of divide and conquer colonialism. “Caste” as a discriminatory concept is a very modern issue, against a background of thousands of years of history.<p>Understanding this topic in depth and with clarity, rather than in typical Western tones, is exactly what is demanded when people fight for “decolonization” in Western academia. And yet no one here seems to want to decolonize their own perceptions and comments.')
