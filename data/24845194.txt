You only get the packages that Meson (or the community?) has written build scripts for. By my count that&#x27;s ~144 packages [1]. That&#x27;s nowhere near as pervasive as Cargo given that basically any Rust project published will use Cargo vs C&#x2F;C++ that has a mix of CMake &amp; autoconf (largely standard for OSS) &amp; BUCK&#x2F;Bazel for Facebook&#x2F;Google-influenced (potentially multi-language) codebases. That&#x27;s also not including all the IDE-specific or platform-specific workspaces (Visual Studio, Xcode, gradle NDK builds, etc).<p>It&#x27;s a nice thought but you have to be confident every 3rd party project you use is one whose parallel build you&#x27;ll maintain as it updates. That&#x27;s the strength of Cargo - it&#x27;s <i>the</i> way to write Rust code &amp; the maintenance is done by upstream for everyone.<p>Additionally Cargo&#x27;s strength isn&#x27;t just it&#x27;s packaging &amp; publishing system. Having a single Rust compiler that everyone uses on all platforms is powerful. C++ might get there eventually with clang but the ecosystem of libraries will need to support that as a baseline. Currently there&#x27;s too many compiler or platform-specific hacks that are done to regularize the environment a bit whereas Rust generally does all of that under the hood for you (i.e. try writing any cross-platform BSD socket code - it&#x27;s a total shitshow that basically results in Winsock &amp; all other POSIX OSes basically different net stacks). Rust also comes with a very deep standard library for I&#x2F;O, path manipulation etc whereas the C++ equivalents for all of this are still surprisingly lacking even in C++20 (especially on the network side).<p>[1] Based on manually counting the packages listed here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wrapdb.mesonbuild.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wrapdb.mesonbuild.com&#x2F;</a>')
