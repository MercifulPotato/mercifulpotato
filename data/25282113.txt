Particularly by the macOS X and iOS days, Jobs was fundamentally driving the product design towards what he wanted with the implicit idea being that if he liked it and used it, others would too.<p>This has its own pitfalls, but he was fundamentally &quot;talking to users&quot;, he had just narrowed his focus group to a user of one. He used his own products as far as we know as well.<p>The thing is that most tech doesn&#x27;t dogfood quite so easily. Most founders can&#x27;t replicate that as they are generally selling outside of the consumer market that they can just adopt themselves.<p>So, maybe cast another way, every product must have a target demographic and you need to interact with that demographic to get feedback on what you&#x27;re building. Jobs just happened to have a shortcut that isn&#x27;t generally applicable.')
