Item(by='pmarreck', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609957366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25660338, text='&gt; One is that people shouldn&#x27;t own pets. Least of all sapient creatures like dogs. I&#x27;d wager that will become a common point of view a century or two after I&#x27;m gone.<p>Considering that cats 1) have been human companions since the ancient Egyptian days, when the penalty of killing a cat was death, 2) ONLY became human companions of their own volition after their utility in eradicating mice and rats was recognized (note that until a few decades ago, pets were kept outdoors most of the time)... I really, REALLY doubt this prediction tremendously LOL.<p>Also, you have <i>entirely obviously</i> never had a cat. (I&#x27;ve had both dogs and cats. Cats are more interesting. Dogs are like permanent 3 year old boys.)')
