In this line of thinking, they may have to move back to a microservice if they had a bigger team for the exact same application! This is fine by me, but rather than what other benefits they enjoyed by migrating the second time, a clear analysis of motivations behind moving to microservice and then back to monolith without compromising the benefits attained by doing the first migration would be a lot more enlightening. Because I don&#x27;t imagine the first migration to microservices happened just because they had too big a team. I suppose this thread will naturally attract people who hate microservices in principle.<p>Logic:<p>Because of microservices, we had bugs (okay, what kind of bugs?). \nTherefore we moved back to a monolith again (why did they use a microservice architecture in the first place). \nThen the bugs disappeared (how?) and we got a whole bunch of other benefits as a bonus (any trade offs?).<p>Cool, so the initial migration to microservices must have been done by complete idiots then. It seems that even to question that is too much here.')
