This is because the WDDM shell doesn&#x27;t do any kind of colour management, it leaves that up to the application developers.<p>The sad thing is that Vista introduced an extremely wide scRGB gamut and WDDM had a number of internal features built around it. Unfortunately, it was only ever enabled for full-screen games, video overlays, and for internal use by apps that do colour management. They should have converted the entire desktop manager to use it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ScRGB" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ScRGB</a>')
