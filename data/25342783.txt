Item(by='phobosanomaly', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607412277, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25322176, text='I split my work into different &#x27;tasks.&#x27; It&#x27;s like a to-do list. One task might be to write an email, another task is to read a paper, another is to write some code, etc.<p>I put the tasks into a text file.<p>I run a python script that keeps track of which task I should be working on, displays it to me, and shifts from one task to the next every two minutes with audio cues for 30-minute sprints.<p>So, I work on the email for 2 minutes, then I hear &#x27;SWITCH TASKS&#x27; in my headphones and I read like two paragraphs of the paper and I hear &#x27;SWITCH TASKS&#x27; and I spend two minutes on the code, then I hear &#x27;SWITCH TASKS&#x27; and it&#x27;s back to the email. It cycles through the task list in 2-minute bursts.<p>I know it sounds insane and incredibly inefficient, but it&#x27;s the only way I can keep my brain on track. I have to keep it <i>moving</i> at a million miles per second. When my brain is racing as fast as it can to keep up it seems to be happy and my aggregate productivity goes up (even with the inefficiencies at a micro-scale).<p>Sometimes I&#x27;m lucky and I get through a few 30-minute sprints my brain will fixate on one of the tasks and I can do just that for the next two hours uninterrupted, but that&#x27;s not something I expect every day. It&#x27;s nice when it happens.<p>My brain wants to be doing ten things, so I just feed it ten things and keep cycling though them in 2-minute intervals so it doesn&#x27;t have a chance to get bored with any one thing.<p>This is how I stay off of meds.')
