Each new pixel group starts without any compounded error.<p>[1] Last time I checked, they didn&#x27;t scale entire framebuffer as Apple does it, with output scaler. It looked like they were scaling surfaces individually with GPU and then composed the  scaled surfaces into framebuffer with the same dimensions as the display resolution.')
