Mostly read-only stuff (the fully interactive use is possible), even then nothing really sensitive (mostly status information), and local access only (I wouldn&#x27;t trust something like this on a public network, no matter how careful I thought I was being with the setup), but that is useful enough. For a quick dashboard view, throw together a quick page that links a couple of instances in iframes.')
