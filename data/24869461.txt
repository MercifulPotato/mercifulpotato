If you really are dependent on that (though I don&#x27;t think the author made the case that they <i>were</i>, convincingly), you need to <i>ensure</i> it (by, for instance, weighing the craft); it&#x27;s ridiculously optimistic to think that someone never accidentally leaves a piece of equipment lying around, say.<p>And even if you accept the absurd premise, it still doesn&#x27;t work; the stowaway would presumably have used consumables (oxygen, if nothing else), and if you&#x27;re that weight constrained you won&#x27;t be carrying excess consumables anyway, so you&#x27;re still doomed even if you lose the stowaway.')
