Item(by='rsynnott', descendants=None, kids=[24872433], score=None, time=1603461064, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24868898, text='&gt; The Cold Equations<p>I never liked this very much, because the whole &quot;we can only take exactly this mass, and an extra 60kg or whatever will doom us&quot; thing is such an obvious design and&#x2F;or process flaw. If you really are dependent on that (though I don&#x27;t think the author made the case that they <i>were</i>, convincingly), you need to <i>ensure</i> it (by, for instance, weighing the craft); it&#x27;s ridiculously optimistic to think that someone never accidentally leaves a piece of equipment lying around, say.<p>And even if you accept the absurd premise, it still doesn&#x27;t work; the stowaway would presumably have used consumables (oxygen, if nothing else), and if you&#x27;re that weight constrained you won&#x27;t be carrying excess consumables anyway, so you&#x27;re still doomed even if you lose the stowaway.<p>If anything, it&#x27;s the same thing that bothers me about some &#x27;softer&#x27; sci-fi; take a story you want to tell, and construct some completely implausible rules to make it work. To add insult to injury here, it&#x27;s... not a very good story, IMO. Also, I believe Clarke hinted at a similar scenario in Islands in the Sky, published two years previously, though it didn&#x27;t actually _happen_ there.')
