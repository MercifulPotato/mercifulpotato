But my take is that there are a bunch of ways to answer a &quot;why&quot; question, some more useful than others.<p>One very common mode is to take a complex causal web, trace until you find a person of low status, and then yell at and&#x2F;or punish said scapegoat. That desire to blame is a very human approach, but it a) isn&#x27;t very effective in preventing the next problem, and b) prevents real systemic understanding by providing a false feeling of resolution.<p>So if we really want to figure out why the failure occurred and reduce the odds of it happening again, we need to give up blame and look at how systems create incentives and behaviors in the people caught up in them. Only if everybody feels a sense of personal safety do we have much chance of getting at what happened and discussing it calmly enough that we can come to real understandings and real solutions.')
