For example, if you think some event has a constant chance of happening of 5%, you should bet for durations &gt;13 years (for p&gt;0.5). If your counter-party thinks the rate is instead 3%, then the duration is &gt;22 years (for p&gt;0.5). This means that two people with these two beliefs have a zone of possible agreement for making a bet in the time period of 13 to 22 years, where exactly it lands depends on the negotiation.')
