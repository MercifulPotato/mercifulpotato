Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609239809, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25566310, text='Since I had to look up more info to understand this explanation, I&#x27;ll try to give my own, using the numbers for LTO-8.<p>The drive has 32 heads, and reads&#x2F;writes 32 tracks at a time.  It goes from the start of the tape to the end, then aligns with the next 32 tracks and reverses direction.<p>Each group of 32 tracks is called a wrap.  There are 208 wraps, so 6656 total data tracks.  Even wraps go one direction, and odd wraps go the other direction.<p>That&#x27;s the important part.<p>But also the tape is divided into 4 &quot;bands&quot;, each one holding a quarter of the wraps&#x2F;tracks.  Between the bands, and at the edges of the tape, are special servo tracks that are used for alignment.<p>So when a source talks about &quot;wraps per band&quot;, it&#x27;s pointless abstraction.  Unless you&#x27;re really in the weeds, the only thing you want to know is the total number of wraps.')
