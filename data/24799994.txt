They don&#x27;t have to be but it&#x27;s a combination of immature, rude, and unprofessional to not be like that if your core business is packaging up and integrating other people&#x27;s OSS software.<p>They are of course well within their rights as per the license to behave like this but there&#x27;s a notion of being courteous, grateful, and constructive in the OSS world that comes with being a responsible OSS citizen and that goes a long way to ensure people volunteer to help you out with bugs, support, change requests, etc. It doesn&#x27;t cost anything to just reach out and give this person some kudos. It&#x27;s the right thing to do.<p>Amazon is being a bit insensitive here and this sounds to me like somebody up high ought to do a bit of yelling internally about acting professionally and not needlessly burning bridges with the OSS people that they depend on for their core business. At least I&#x27;d be all over this if I were confronted with this kind of behavior by one of my colleagues. Not cool. A public apology would go a long way to fixing this; maybe a couple of lines in the readme. Doesn&#x27;t cost a thing.')
