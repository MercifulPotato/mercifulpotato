In the US, public places aren&#x27;t generally afforded any privacy protections and thus video can be recorded and shared. Police go many places that aren&#x27;t public, so a significant portion of body cam footage is likely illegal to share.<p>Of course in this particular case (Ring live streaming) there&#x27;s a question about whether it&#x27;s legal or acceptable for police to engage in such practices on a wide scale. An end user doing something once simply isn&#x27;t the same as a large government agency doing it many times over.')
