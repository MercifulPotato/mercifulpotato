I got a few questions though which I could not find in your docs:<p>(1) Over at the Apache Arrow FAQ I read that the overhead of serialization in analytical frameworks can be around 80 to 90 % of total compute costs (r_1). While having no concrete numbers on this, from using Kafka together with Kafka Streams I can at least confirm that the overhead of serialization is (very) significant. My question therefore is: Does your WASM engine avoid (de-)serialization between your storage&#x2F;stream layer and the engine and if not are there plans for this?<p>(2) Are supported WASM transformations stateless (i.e. single message) only or can they be stateful (i.e. window-ing and stream-stream&#x2F;table join functionality)<p>(3) I could not find any reference to the WASM inline lambdas at all in the docs actually, am I missing something?<p>r_1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arrow.apache.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arrow.apache.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;</a>')
