Item(by='Gwypaas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611517883, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25894882, text='The main issue is that the largest cost of a nuclear power plant is the capital investment to build it and staff to run it, which is fixed. In comparison fuel costs seem to hover at about 25%.\nTherefore you need to run your plant at about full power all day to have a chance to recoup the investment. With renewable, although intermittent, sources vastly undercutting nuclear energy on price many hours of the day this becomes an almost impossible calculation.<p>Based on this nuclear is an uniquely bad pairing together with renewables, and it will only get worse. Say you can make massive profits on average one hour per day, but that means all other methods of energy generation or storage can make the same, and still undercut you.<p>This isn&#x27;t even factoring in that it is impossible to get insurance for a nuclear power plant.')
