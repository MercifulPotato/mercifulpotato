I remember traveling through Germany and seeing tons of alternative medicine physician offices, and was surprised to learn in a lot of European countries you can actually use the socialized&#x2F;public health systems to pay these &quot;physicians&quot;, which I would find infuriating if it were my tax dollars going to that. But that&#x27;s a bit of a digression. What&#x27;s important to me is the scale and impact of the delusion moreso than the fact there are at least some deluded people.')
