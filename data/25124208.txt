None of my playbooks needed module names updated and this is not a syntax change.  A fully qualified module name is simply being more explicit about where your desired module comes from in the infinitely extensible library of modules.  If you use builtins or have only one of that module name installed you don&#x27;t have to update anything.  At least that has been my experience, although I  primarily use builtin modules for a majority of my work.')
