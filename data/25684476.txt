A few years ago my group made an interface to visualise contextual word representations [2] that looked like a primordial soup ancestor to your most recent article (no screenshots though, sadly). I hope putting these together brings you as much joy as it does to your fans in academia and education like myself reading it. Despite Chris Ohla’s effort with Distill, I still think we lack a good way to give the amount of credit efforts like yours deserve.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jalammar.github.io&#x2F;illustrated-transformer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jalammar.github.io&#x2F;illustrated-transformer</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uclnlp&#x2F;muppetshow" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uclnlp&#x2F;muppetshow</a>')
