I&#x27;ve edited to reflect data from September provided by the CDC. The 20% -&gt; ICU figure comes from the NYC experience in May, but seems roughly correct from other global hotspots ]<p>Roughly 0.4% of those who catch COVID19 will require hospitalization. Of those, 20% will require ICU treatment.<p>In the end, the entire human race will be exposed to SARS-COV-2. If that happens all on the same day, or week, or month or probably even year, no health care system in the world can possibly deal with the case load.<p>Some of those who might have survived COVID19 with hospital care will die.<p>But (and this is the important part) those with other medical conditions that timely and effective health care could have treated will also die. Trauma (e.g. car or tool accidents). Infectious disease. Cancer. Chronic health conditions.<p>And in killing all these people, you&#x27;ve made nothing better for those who survive, because if you think the economy has gone to hell under current attempts to deal with it, you clearly cannot imagine it as the entire health care system melts down.<p>COVID19 is <i>not</i> a personal health crisis. Most people will not die of it (even though hundreds of thousands will, which is not going to be much comfort to their families, friends, colleagues and neighbors. It is a <i>public</i> health crisis that threatens to overwhelm our health care systems and thus have far worse effects than just the disease itself.')
