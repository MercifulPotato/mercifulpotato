It&#x27;s not that we can&#x27;t protect the most vulnerable, it&#x27;s that we can&#x27;t protect them particularly well IF community spread is high.<p>We are partially effective in protecting the most vulnerable, e.g. through restrictions on nursing homes. But, infections in these communities still correlate with the level of community spread - e.g. if you halve the new case rate in nursing homes with restrictions, but you double the new case rate in the community, you may be back to where you started.<p>The point being, as you allow significantly more spread in lower risk populations, you&#x27;ll have a really hard time keeping higher risk groups at their current level of transmission risk (which, in the US, is already a fairly high level of transmission risk).')
