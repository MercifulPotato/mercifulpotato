It has flexible group based video chat that naturally extends voice chat. It has broadcasting support so you can stream your gameplay to each other, as well as player-in-player, pop out support, and side-by-side view. Almost all of these features work on mobile as well, including PIP&#x2F;broadcasting (e.g. I streamed Genshin Impact directly off my phone.)<p>These may seem like gimmicks, but I use all these features extensively in a server of ~8 regulars to the point we reflexively broadcast to each other and regularly watch each others gameplay, comment, or just use it to hang out. I think this stuff will probably significantly solidify Discord&#x27;s lead, especially considering the technical infrastructure necessary for features like this.<p>Before all that though, the slack-like features, and definitely the moderation features for bigger channels, were - still are! - major attractions.')
