Instead, they treat an exchange as a refund followed by a new purchase (at the then-current price). When something is on sale, the discount may no longer apply by the time you go to exchange itâ€”so if you&#x27;re at all uncertain about the size you&#x27;re better off ordering one of each up front, and then returning the ones that don&#x27;t fit.')
