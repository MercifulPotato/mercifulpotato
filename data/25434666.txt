Some cheeses seem difficult to reinvent as vegan options, but the rest that you mention definitely have great alternatives. Those alternatives were a lot worse 5 years ago. The dairy industry will probably not vanish completely or directly, but when the vegan alternatives are good enough for the majority, combined with a generational shift the dairy industry will start decreasing rapidly.<p>So the notion that &quot;it would never happen&quot; is a bit silly imo. I predict that the global dairy industry will be cut by half in 10 years.')
