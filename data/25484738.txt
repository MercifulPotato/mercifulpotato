The reaction to the A7 was similar to what we&#x27;re seeing now with the M1—not possible, there&#x27;s some trickery going on, etc.<p>Apple is pretty good at this processor transition thing, going from 68k to PowerPC to Intel to ARM.<p><i>And it more than makes up for some pretty spectacular tactical mis-steps (I’m looking at you, puck mouse, cube mac, butterfly keyboard).</i><p>Except for the recent keyboard issues, you&#x27;re literally talking about another era. I wouldn&#x27;t put the shape of the mouse for the 1998 iMac in the same category as transitioning a $9 billion revenue product line to a radically different processor architecture.')
