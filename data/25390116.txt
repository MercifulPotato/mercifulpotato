Far-Right? Alt-right? Full on Notsee? Transphoooooobe? Paid Russian?<p>As far as group thinker goes, lol. I&#x27;m in the 5% side, against he 95% braying mob who dox and torment people all the time. This used to just be common sense, for instance that you can&#x27;t medicate children to be the other sex, and now people insist that up is down. I&#x27;m saying what I said ten years ago, and barring an actual change in human biology, what I&#x27;ll be saying in another ten years.<p>But since you brought up immigration issues, do you expect to see an alt-right person (such as you seem to believe I am) saying that race is <i>not</i> an issue? That immigration shouldn&#x27;t be stopped? Where does that fit in your categorization? Could you describe what a moderate, liberal, Parisian view would be, such that you could judge mine against it?')
