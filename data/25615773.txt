They&#x27;re very Euro-centric- even in comparison to how a North American uses the same services.<p>But as long as map apps aren&#x27;t good, then users will be forced to use proprietary maps, which feeds back into itself.<p>We have some amazing opportunities- more now than ever, but the OSMF needs to put conscious effort into direction, making (ie funding and overseeing development) over mechanisms to allow for regular people to have OSM as easily  <i>and as well</i> as Google Maps.<p>This is no small feat, but I think that such a design could be designed- especially if it combined not only the existing mapping technologies for data (ie vector maps across the wire) but also localization of geolocation in a manner that mimiced the way geolocation data itself is crowdsourced- making it easy to build more relevant results from search and display the information people want quickly and easily.<p>But like the author, I am disheartened and have my doubts that the OSMF would take on such an ambitious task. I wish very much that they would!')
