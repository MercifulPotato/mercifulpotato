Item(by='aasasd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602014553, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24701329, text='At least some attempts at AIs colorizing photos, that were previously posted on Reddit or HN, tend to break into sepia on many things—and for some reason, also blue on clothes. Even when it clearly looked unnatural. So it seems to be an artifact of current approaches in general, and not of this particular case. (However it might be that this post and those ones were made by the same people.)<p>Personally, from my completely-uneducated viewpoint, I wonder if this shows the current boundary of what&#x27;s possible, with the AI not having the <i>knowledge</i> of what it sees. Presumably you need to first teach the AI about all of the things in the old photos&#x2F;videos, and then somehow show what color each of them should be. Particularly, I&#x27;m rather skeptical about the latter part because e.g. clothes have plenty of variability in color, and properly you&#x27;d need to guess the kind of clothes, the material and the period to take a stab at the color. Like, no blue in the middle ages, except for rich people.<p>Conversely, I&#x27;d imagine that if the AI is trained on ten different examples of pants of various colors but about the same darkness, it can&#x27;t pick any particularly saturated color because the choice would be mostly random. But ‘drab’ is always safe.')
