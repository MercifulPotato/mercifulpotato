Don&#x27;t give me some one sentence response with no evidence.<p>&gt;The cold hard truth is that there isn&#x27;t a single study identifying any kind of racial component to IQ (and please supply one if you know different).<p>I literally stated that the cold hard truth makes this controversial not definitive. There is no single study that race as a causative factor for IQ but there is also no single study that definitively separates IQ and race. This is something hard to measure, but it is highly highly unrealistic to assume that there is zero correlation with IQ and race when all genes control both physical attributes and mental attributes. What we do know is that IQ is correlated with race. This much is true. Correlation doesn&#x27;t imply causation but it doesn&#x27;t terminate any possibility of causation either. In fact correlation is a prerequisite to causation.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worlddata.info&#x2F;iq-by-country.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worlddata.info&#x2F;iq-by-country.php</a><p>Note that for the above Asian countries have vastly different cultures between countries. Also note that despite vastly different cultures the top countries are mostly Asian.

What causes these differences is controversial but the difference and correlations exist (even when accounting for Asians and white people living in the same culture.) There are even studies where the authors conclude that IQ is indeed caused by race. However there are conflicting conclusions that say otherwise. The causation is controversial but the correlation is definitive.<p>&gt;If we can agree that individual differences in IQ massively outweigh all other factors (in that there are low-IQ asians, and high-IQ white folks) then any kind of racial profiling around this is just racism. You cannot conclude anything about an individual from their race.<p>I am not arguing for racial profiling. Please do not imply this and turn this into a racist witch hunt. I am arguing for observable facts.<p>There are low IQ asians and high IQ white people this much is true. But statistics talks in terms of bell curves and generalities. The IQ bell curve for a population of Asians is higher then the IQ bell curve for a population of white people. This fact cannot be denied.<p>&gt;And you&#x27;re not controlling for cultural differences. I&#x27;ve spent time in Asia, and the cultural differences are enormous. Massively outweighing any genetic differences.<p>I am aware of the cultural differences. Show me some studies relating IQ to culture and you have an argument here. However it proves nothing. IQ differences can be influenced by either culture or race or both. There is nothing that definitively proves either factor yet here you are specifically stating that your view is based on science. It is not.')
