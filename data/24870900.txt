The largest number of states that can be blue and red still wins is 4. There isn&#x27;t any combination of any combinations where 5 of selected states are blue and red can still win.<p>To calculate actual probability don&#x27;t look at just the number of read leaves to number of blue leaves. You need to take into account probability of each of the state being blue or red. I am too lazy to calculate it but at first sight red outcome seems extremely unlikely.')
