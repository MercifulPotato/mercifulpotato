Rather than constructing definitive statements like &#x27;X is greater than Y&#x27;, I tend to soften it to &#x27;We have evidence that X is greater than Y&#x27;. I see it as a move analogous to the move from verificationism to falsification. Though someone with a better grasp on the philosophy of science may have better perspective.<p>If I want to be a good scientific reader, I have to add in &#x27;We have evidence of&#x27; to nearly all pop science articles. Article writers either tend to omit this or it ends up being edited out for either obvious or obscure reasons depending on what you believe.')
