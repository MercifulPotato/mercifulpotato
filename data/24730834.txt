On a random repo homepage the word &#x27;master&#x27; appears 31 times in the HTML content, so switching to &#x27;main&#x27; would reduce the bandwidth on <i>every single page load</i> by 62 characters[1].<p>Any repo that opts out must be run by a climate change denier.<p>[1] Compression has been ignored to protect the argument.')
