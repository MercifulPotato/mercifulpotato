The preferred format has shifted to a general clock auction (round-by-round for generic blocks) with a supplement round where the actual blocks are assigned in a Vickrey algorithm.  Additionally, as computing power has increased, the &quot;combinatorial&quot; format has become popular in many countries (Canada, UK) where bidders can submit different package bids which are all taken into account with the winner determined by a SAT solver.')
