You still can’t import just class A out of A, B, and C that are all defined in the same file. And even if you require_once file x.php, you don’t have any guarantees that that file won’t require&#x2F;include file y.php that you also intend to include. PHP files are treated as files, not modules and that’s fundamentally broken.')
