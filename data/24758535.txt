Tone has more nuance and is a different medium of communication than the literal words you&#x27;re saying. There are two channels of delivery there: the tone used to signify sarcasm, and the words you&#x27;re saying. Tone is more subtle and you can modulate it to be more or less obvious. For example, you could opt for a dry delivery using little to no sarcastic tone (which is what typing sarcasm without &#x2F;s is closest to, in my opinion).<p>When you use &#x2F;s, you&#x27;re disclaiming the sarcasm immediately and in the same delivery as the words. It doesn&#x27;t resemble tone at all, because you can&#x27;t choose to be subtle. You don&#x27;t get a beat in which the other person is initially surprised and then &quot;gets it.&quot;')
