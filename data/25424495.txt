No restrictions on liquids&#x2F;gels, and you aren&#x27;t restricted to expensive crappy airport fast food.<p>Restrooms on Amtrak don&#x27;t make you deaf. No stupid food carts blocking the way to the restroom. Even on parts of the world that have food service on trains, the carts don&#x27;t block people from walking past them.<p>You can walk the entire length of the train whenever you feel like for exercise.<p>Turbulence is not a thing on trains, and there&#x27;s much more space to get from the window seat to the aisle without needing to crawl over a stranger&#x27;s lap.<p>Also, there&#x27;s scenery almost the whole way.')
