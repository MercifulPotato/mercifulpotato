Basically anything that has a url where the content includes input from the user will be spammed.<p>I&#x27;m fine with, say, the spammers hammering the main repo&#x27;s merge requests and issue tracker. Those are things any healthy project will check regularly-- I&#x27;m even fine just pruning the spam there by hand (and historically I haven&#x27;t gotten a lot there anyway).<p>But I don&#x27;t regularly look at the global view of snippets, and I don&#x27;t want to regularly prune the global user list for SEO spam in the user profiles. There&#x27;s no good reason most FOSS projects need those things to be publicly viewable, anyway. But AFAICT Gitlab&#x27;s admin settings only have a single setting that affects all these things across the board. So if you make snippets viewable only to logged in users, then nobody can clone from the main repo without logging in.<p>It&#x27;s quite frustrating, and Gitlab shows no interest in disabling or hiding features like snippets and user profiles.')
