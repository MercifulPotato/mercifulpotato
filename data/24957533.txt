Or are you making an assumption about their quality and long term stability?<p>To me, they have the same functional design as Rams has promoted since the 1950s which has had a lasting effect on the world of design in both technology and other areas.<p>Note that the shelves form a <i>system</i> of shelving, so you can adjust them in many different ways to suit different storage needs. They are usable in numerous different environments and mounting configurations.<p>That&#x27;s <i>design</i>. Eames said &quot;Design is about constraints&quot;. The constraints here are things like wall types (and the requirements for mounting), using compression to support free standing shelving where it forms both storage and area separation.<p>The sizing supports standard wall stud spacing and both plasterboard&#x2F;solid construction as well as semi-freestanding and entirely freestanding configurations.')
