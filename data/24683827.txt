I was referred to a surgeon who wanted to re-route tendons or ligaments in my hips. It made no sense to me. I realized, with a little reflection, that I had been wearing heeled dress shoes far more than I normally did. I started wearing zero-drop shoes and the pain went away in a few days. Neither the GP nor the surgeon did any digging about possible causes.')
