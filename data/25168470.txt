With Graviton, AWS targets medium range EC2 instances that can now be had 30% cheaper with either with the same performance range or surpassing it at a lower power consumption - a win for the customer and a cheaper power bill for AWS. Graviton might also be already used to power serverless and fully managed product AWS offerings (Lambda, Aurora, MKS etc etc) – something we might never even know about unless AWS tells us. Any cloud product that does not require direct shell access can be transparently migrated to run on any ISA, not just ARM. I think we will also start seeing more AMD cloud offerings in the top performance tier soon due to the AMD CPU’s being so good.<p>In terms of a viable contender to Intel and ARM incumbents, I can only realistically think of the POWER architecture. Google was experimenting with POWER8 designs a few years back with a view to use POWER based blades for GCP – similar to what AWS has done with Graviton. There have not been any further news since then, so it is unknown whether (or when) we can have POWER powered compute instances in GCP. POWER is the only other mature architecture with plenty of experience and expertise available out there (compilers, toolchains, virtual machines etc etc).<p>Whether RISC-V will become the next big thing is yet to be seen, with the ISA fragmentation being the culprit. The 64 bit RISC-V ISA is yet to hit the v1.0 milestone, so we won’t know it for another few years. Unless a new string force appears on stage to push the RISC-V architecture.')
