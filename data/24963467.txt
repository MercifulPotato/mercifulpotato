When some of those jobs were replaced by jobs that were easier physically but more challenging intellectually, we got different opportunities for different people.<p>Today would be analogical if we had a population of people with average IQ 150, locked in jobs that require IQ 100. By automating those jobs away, we would open new opportunities that would fit people better.<p>But instead, we have a world where the average IQ is 100, and the standard advice for people who lose their jobs is &quot;learn to code&quot;. So we get the situation where some people are unable to find a job, and other people are pushed to work overtime... and we cannot balance it by hiring the former into job positions of the latter.<p>(Also, historically speaking, many people starved to death when their farms were taken away. The new jobs appeared later, but it took some time.)')
