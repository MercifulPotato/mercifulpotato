You feel like it&#x27;s protection because you&#x27;re not getting prosecuted for admitting something you know is at least in the ballpark of law-breaking, but in reality you&#x27;re just small-fry that nobody cares about. The moment a big-time dealer is under the spotlight, no amount of SWIM is protection.<p>I don&#x27;t expect anyone from WSB to receive repercussions for this, but afaik this is dangerous legal territory and their defensive phrasing is a facade.')
