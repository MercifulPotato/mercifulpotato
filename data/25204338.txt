Is not very intuitive, but once you start looking in to it you realize that almost nothing in a computer is deterministic. Task switching, cashes, file system buffers, disk fragmentation, variable clock frequencies, and loads of other factors, make the speed of a computer very hard to estimate.<p>I do favor progress bars that say things like &quot;you have downloaded 47% of file X&quot;, because its a statement of fact, not an estimation of future performance.')
