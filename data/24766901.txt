In order to make an observation, you must interact with whatever is being observed, so that information about the interaction can come back to you.<p>In the bag example above, we can observe the Australian ball and know the color of the American ball, and we cannot use this interaction in Australia to send information to America. But we cannot avoid sending information to the Australian ball when we observe it.<p>&gt;&gt;  You cannot send information by merely observing something.<p>This is, at the least, very poorly phrased. As explained above, not only can you send information by observing something, it&#x27;s impossible not to do so. The question here is where the information goes.')
