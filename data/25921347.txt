I try to justify it to myself by noting it’s on their business Metro-E network so it’s completely reliable and has amazing support. Also an entire &#x2F;48 of static IPv6. It was $150&#x2F;month for the first two years, which was much more palatable.<p>Their model is expensive because they don’t wire while neighborhoods. For me they had to run fiber a quarter mile, down my street, and trench under my driveway. I imagine all these one-offs make the per house investment quite high.')
