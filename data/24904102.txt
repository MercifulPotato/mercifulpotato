(Probably a valid concern.) The data they&#x27;re trying to get is super simple and actually helps drive sales to that site, so I don&#x27;t see an ethical problem, per se. I suggested that maybe it would be possible to put the scraping logic in JS code that runs on the user&#x27;s browser, so that the scraping operations, when they happen, just happen from different places in the world.<p>Anyone know if this is feasible? Apologies in advance if this is a stupid question, but I&#x27;m finding it impossible to Google.<p>EDIT: Okay maybe not so impossible to Google once I realized the challenge is primarily with CORS. Leaving this up just in case anyone has additional insight.')
