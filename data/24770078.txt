But there are already enough Open Source options, and its important enough to my firm, that we&#x27;d probably only use an OS option now.<p>For the userTrack pricing plan, consider an Open Core strategy, or unlocking larger volume capacity for a fee, like Countly do (even self hosted, you can only store a fixed limit of events under their licenses)?<p>Disclaimer: in general I&#x27;m against artificial limitations on Open Source apps, but given the existing business situation of userTrack, these feel like the most viable options.')
