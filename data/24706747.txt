I think it&#x27;s more clear to say &quot;the radius of a black hole increases sub-linearly with its mass&quot; (specifically, the square root of mass).<p>Sagittarius A*, the closest black hole, is 4.1 million solar masses, so its Schwarzchild radius is 12.1 million km, so its density is 0.25 kg&#x2F;m^3, which is about 1&#x2F;5 as dense as air at sea level--much less than water.<p>A black hole made from Jupiter would have a Schwarzchild radius of 2.8 meters, so its density would be... denser than a neutron star.')
