Seasonal flu is kind of an interesting case as each year is arguably a different disease with the old one having been eradicated.  Thatâ€™s hopefully a model which will work for covid-19.<p>Polio is very close to being eliminated, with only 125 known cases in 2019, which was a spike.  Rubella dropped from 670 thousand in 2000 to under 15 thousand in 2018.<p>Ovine rinderpest elimination is considered a reasonable goal, but still 15+ years off.')
