The GPL certainly allows this, as opposed to a tarball and patches which you&#x27;re right is inadequate.<p>Interesting wrinkle in the GPL&#x27;s written offer option: the offer must be valid for &quot;any third party&quot;, not only direct customers. But, it&#x27;s certainly possible for the included written offer to reference an email address or website that is unique to each paying customer, such that valid request coming from a third party would be traceable to the intermediate paying customer whose support contract would then be canceled by Red Hat.<p>Does anyone know if Red Hat does this kind of watermarking of the GPL written offers, or if a licensee could share the offer anonymously, leak-style, and not get caught by the support contract people?')
