Theoretically. He says that b is not changed, and does not &quot;escape&quot; (the scope of the code in question). In that case b is useless, and thus it doesn&#x27;t really even exist. A compiler can &quot;collapse&quot; a lot of code into a fraction of it. That&#x27;s a part of the &quot;optimizing&quot; part of &quot;optimizing compiler&quot;. A compiler can put a value in a register. A compiler can do whatever it wants as long as the results are always the same as if it didn&#x27;t do anything other then just translate to machine code.<p>Pointer aliasing in C can be bad for the compiler as it can&#x27;t be sure that it can optimize away something. That&#x27;s why Fortran is faster, and why the restrict keyword was added to the C standard.<p>And yea, i agree with him completely that a context should be made clear. Personally i&#x27;d like less voodoo in programming topics, but, on the other hand, this is still a young science and a lot of terminology is all around the place. ..Actually, scratch that, i found what i was interested in and don&#x27;t really care about everything else.')
