In fact you have to do that to make a pull request. I even specifically lay out scenarios where I absolutely agree it&#x27;s not a good return on time invested for the maintainers to bother. But if I forked an open-source project every time I had a bug fix that required time from the maintainer that&#x27;s worse for everyone. My point is that even though I fully understand and support where the litestream policy is coming from, for anything beyond a personal project I think some flexibility in accepting outside contributions is a win for everyone. I&#x27;ll do all the work I can without having rights on the project. I&#x27;ll sign over all my rights. Have tests? I&#x27;ll run them and post the results. But a rigid &quot;love it or fork it&quot; attitude is a lose-lose.')
