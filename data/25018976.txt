No good moves whichever way to go. Imposing quarantine measures would be going against the very much support base, who not only oppose it, they subverted this into a principle point of distinction synonymous to freedom.<p>Approving a more substantial aid to people and businesses would go along the lines of &quot;entitlements&quot;.<p>Both of such choices would also align Trump&#x27;s administration, and by extension the Republicans, with the opposition - something made unthinkable in the current climate.<p>If anything, COVID-19 underscored more the perhaps cliche saying that &quot;Divided we fall&quot;. The strategies that play into devisiveness can only provide a situational advantage; for lasting changes there needs to be unity.<p>It&#x27;s a herculean task to unite a nation in the current state of polarisation.<p>Perhaps people could stand back for a moment and ask themselves what or who is it there that makes people so intolerably polarised; is there a vision that could move the nation forward, define challenges that call for such a united power to overcome them?')
