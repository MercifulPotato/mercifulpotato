Most brands have certain attributes associated with them, for Boeing safety was one of those attributes. Just like reliability is an attribute you would associate with Toyota, but perhaps not with Renault..<p>I&#x27;m guessing that Boeing&#x27;s good safety reputation had some root in reality, just like Toyota probably is a more reliable car than many other brands. Renault could be a very reliable brand now for all I know, but their reputation has already been shot, and that can be hard to recover from. Some brands really never recover, and just change their name; like LG did, GoldStar (their former name) was not associated with quality. The reason Boeing is changing the name of the MAX to 8 is similar, but a name change alone will not resurrect their image.<p>I&#x27;m sure at one point Boeing was a very safe plane, since I associate that brand with safety, but today perhaps Airbus is as safe (or even safer), but it&#x27;s hard to shake off a reputation.')
