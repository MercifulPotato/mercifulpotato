I think it&#x27;s actually relatively easy for a smart poor kid in the US to learn ~whatever they want; that was certainly my experience, and I think the structures that were available to me are available to basically any American kid today.<p>One thing to keep in mind is that poverty is strongly anticorrelated with intelligence - this is not PC, but the evidence is overwhelmingly clear - so it&#x27;s easy to see that there aren&#x27;t many poor kids doing stuff like this and (mistakenly) conclude that it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t have the extrinsic opportunity, rather than that they lack the intrinsic means.')
