The old app where it used a spinner to set an alerm time and where I had N alarms that I could edit was simple and easy to use.<p>The new app where hour and minutes are separate text fields and where you can&#x27;t edit an alarm you can only delete old ones and create new ones is utterly unintuitive to me and much slower and more error prone than the old one. Clicking in the hour or minute section is a much smaller target. Editing sucks. I want to set an alarm for 10:00 and it defaults to showing the current time 09:33 so I click the 09 and type 1000 but it only edits the 09 to 10. The 33 stays and I have to click the other side and enter 00.<p>To be snarky it&#x27;s like some UX designer from Google went to Apple. This is not a UX I&#x27;d expect from Apple.')
