This way, you combine the power of the rocket thruster and the gravitational pull. However, the bit of multitasking (maneuvering into orbit and taking care of saucers) at the beginning is definitely the tricky part, esp. in higher levels. (But it&#x27;s still better as in Computer Space, where the saucers may pound you mercilessly while you&#x27;re still a sitting duck.) Mind that you&#x27;ll have to do just a bit better than the saucers over the course of an entire level, so the loss of a single ship shouldn&#x27;t be that bad.')
