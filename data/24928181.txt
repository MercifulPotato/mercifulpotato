There is one big trade off to consider though: point of presence and global availability. We’re ok, as we’re a UK based website and hosted in GCP europe-west2, but we had devs in NZ for a while, and they said that, understandably, the site was really slow for them due to the latency. Beam has the ability to link instances and have them cluster, so you could do something like that across multiple regions globally, but there is a trade off to consider if you run a global service: you’re trading an over engineering and sync problem, for a potential distributed systems problem if you try and make the same liveview site available performantly in multiple global regions.')
