And also, if the transmitter was 200 meters away, it would have to be dozens of meters big, assuming you got some lending system. Otherwise, it would still be huge, but it would also spew radiation at a truncated cone with a radius in the meters.<p>Also, building walls would certainly deflect a lot of the radiation and cause decoherence but also heating and destruction of electronics.<p>In any case, if it was any kind of EM weapon at a suitable frequency, it would be incredibly detectable and we wouldn&#x27;t have this discussion.')
