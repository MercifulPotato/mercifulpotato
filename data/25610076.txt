Whatever happened to social reinforcement and shaming? If the friends posted videos of themselves drunk driving or hurting animals, people would have no problem replying &quot;Dude, what the hell?? That&#x27;s fucked up and you&#x27;re not my friend anymore.&quot; But they post themselves horsing around partying, putting themselves and others at risk during a worldwide deadly pandemic? All of a sudden it&#x27;s not cool to shame people. WTF is that about?<p>My friends know our household is pretty strict about gatherings. We&#x27;ve maybe had a handful of people over, mostly one at at time, and only when it was totally necessary. My parents knew better than to even mention whatever their crazy Thanksgiving and Christmas plans were--they knew they could count us out because I was very clear with them throughout the year.<p>Honestly I&#x27;m not that torn and none of this weighs heavily on me because I&#x27;m not on Facebook or any other social media. I don&#x27;t get bombarded with pictures of loved ones acting irresponsibly and taking risks with their lives every day, so out of sight, out of mind. My wife on the other hand is on facebook and insta all day and took 2020 much worse. Another example of social media&#x27;s wonderful redeeming qualities.')
