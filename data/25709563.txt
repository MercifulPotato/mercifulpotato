Although they punch far above their weight in publicity, they are a mere afterthought compared with Twitter when viewed in financial terms.<p>The AWS ban will most likely end this company. Anyone who pops up to replace Parler will eventually face the same scrutiny and fate. Ultimately, my personal opinion is that the Parler ban is a tremendously good thing for the world. The people who are subject to being radicalized by social media are less likely to become radicalized if they are not exposed to content. Removing Parler removes the content; this will reduce the radicalization.<p>If you think that the typical conspiracy theorist on Parler is capable of critical thinking, you&#x27;re mistaken.')
