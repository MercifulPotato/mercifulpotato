It does nominally have voice recognition to allow setting it eyes free, and disables most of the physical buttons when the car is in motion to &quot;comply&quot; with anti-distraction laws.<p>However, the voice recognition system is so shitty, it would literally be safer to lock it out when moving, and enable all touchscreen features instead. Think have to spell the destination out one letter at at time, with an 80% chance it even understands the letter right in the first place.<p>Using google map&#x27;s voice recognition system is orders of magnitude better and less distracting.<p>Plus user&#x27;s can access their preferred non-radio music sources like Spotify.')
