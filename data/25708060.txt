In fact, it was the Alibaba integration that facilitated this. Secondly, as far as I know it&#x27;s not drop shipping but they&#x27;re actual Alibaba sellers that&#x27;ve been onboarded to Lazada.<p>&gt; There is great profit incentive&#x2F;arbitrage<p>Not sure what you mean by this exactly but there&#x27;s little incentive for arbitrage because because they were Alibaba sellers but also because Alibaba delivers directly as well. So it was more of a marketing move rather than arbitrage. The integration did speed up shipping times however.<p>&gt; High Tariffs. High Customs&#x2F;Customs issues. Physical customs inspection. High shipping times.<p>I have only limited experience with import and that&#x27;s with tobacco which was time consuming but orderly. For Alibaba goods however, the only one that applies is the high shipping times.<p>Furthermore for the vast majority of goods below a certain value none of these apply.<p>&gt; last mile of fulfillment is the issue<p>Overall true, but there are other issues rather than just being spread out. Specifically traffic, bad infrastructure and operational inefficiencies that impact last mile delivery efficiency even in urban centers.<p>&gt; consumer base being very spread out<p>Of course heavily depends on the country with Singapore and Malaysia being far ahead, but Indonesia and Thailand being ~50-60% in urban areas.<p>&gt; bike courier is still most common way of delivery<p>If you mean bicycle, that&#x27;s definitely not the case. If you mean motorcycle, again heavily dependent on the country as well as the use-case.<p>For instance in Vietnam and Indonesia motorcycles are used frequently, but in Malaysia and Singapore less so. Bicycles are only a gimmick.<p>Motorcycles are also frequently used for more ad-hoc fulfillment.<p>&gt; Postal Mail does not work&#x2F;will not deliver.<p>1. This might have been true ~5+ years ago but isn&#x27;t any longer.<p>2. Even if it was, the post wasn&#x27;t as developed here as in other parts of the world so a lot of third party logistics providers sprung up to fill the gap and they&#x27;ve better service.')
