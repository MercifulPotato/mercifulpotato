The effort you need to put in will not be appreciated by you.<p>If you have a strong opinion on how things must be done, Pony is not for you, because it won&#x27;t allow you to follow your opinion all the time, because the opinion is not safe.<p>Pony is not for everyone, but for those that can think in the Pony model, then it is an incredible tool to ensure your code is correct, safe and performant.')
