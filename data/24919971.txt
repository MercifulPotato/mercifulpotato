Black hats have done things on this scale for as long as this scale has existed.<p>RATs, malware, spam, ransomware, scareware, worms, all this existed in the largest scale possible before the advent of crypto currency.<p>Doxing, messing with people, leaking sensitive files, pictures and other media, has existed on massive scale before crypto currencies.<p>It&#x27;s the scale of the internet itself, and the amount of money involved, and the fragility of connected systems, that has lead to the increase.<p>I&#x27;ll grant that cryptocurrency adds even more of this badness. It&#x27;s definitively increased the number of bad actors. But this is not the driving cause.<p>Their &#x27;obvious role&#x27; is only a role for some actors. Not everyone is financially motivated.<p>It&#x27;s also easily measurable, the revenue of a ransomware-as-a-service group (this exists) is an easy jaw-dropping number to display.<p>But that number does not capture the damage done by actors not financially motivated. Hell _the_ largest and _most_ devastating attack ever was not financially motivated at all. I&#x27;m of course talking about NotPetya. Whose damage and impact easily dwarfs that of the financially motivated ransomware groups.')
