Do these things really need to be separated? Outside of uniquely implemented animations, I&#x27;m now of the opinion that... no, they really don&#x27;t, and I&#x27;ve started adopting Tailwind into my projects to great success, less maintenance toil, and faster iterations.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindcss.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;utility-first" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindcss.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;utility-first</a>')
