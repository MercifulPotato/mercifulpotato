Batman Arkham Asylum, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Unity and No Man&#x27;s Sky come to mind. Some even required full reboots, such as Final Fantasy XIV and the current work on Artifact and Anthem.<p>What&#x27;s different here is that this is the first that that a major release is getting delisted or refunded by all the major retailers. CD Project Red did not have a track record of thrashing, or shipping something half-baked. The Witcher 3&#x27;s main game and DLC are among the most polished AAA releases ever, and great value for their price. This drove lots of people to be excited by Cyberpunk, since 2013.<p>It&#x27;s not just a story about crunch and unmet hype. It&#x27;s a studio that simply let a lot of people down.')
