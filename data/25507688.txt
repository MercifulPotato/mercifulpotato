Item(by='dak1', descendants=None, kids=[25508183], score=None, time=1608653396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25506933, text='I went to West Point almost two decades ago.<p>It&#x27;s important to remember that almost every cadet here was a plebe (1st year student). Plebes are under enormous pressure, and they are only just beginning the inculcation of the honor code (they&#x27;ve all only been there about 6 months now).<p>Traditionally, they are given by far the most leeway. The expectation is that going through this process will only hasten and harden their understanding of the importance of the honor code.<p>I recall reading stories in the news about happenings when I was cadet, and there&#x27;s always invariably some nuances and details that are either incorrect, missing, or misunderstood by people not familiar with West Point.<p>Some cadets are also still going to go before an honor board, which may very well lead to their separation.<p>Without knowing more details, I trust the administration (including cadet-led) to take actions in the best interest of our country, the institution, and the Corps.')
