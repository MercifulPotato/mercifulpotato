Even that small inference brings some depth to understanding what someone is saying, and the character of the person saying it.<p>As for “butterflies in my stomach”, that’s even more important as it’s a <i>tactile</i> expression, describing the feeling of nerves as though there were literal butterflies fluttering lightly in one’s stomach. The fact that at some point an english speaker decided to express the internal feeling as though it was something tangible that other people around them were familiar with, that’s (imo) some pretty fascinating cultural context and something that I see repeated throughout english. I also suspect that it happens in many (but importantly not <i>all</i>) other languages&#x2F;cultures, which is also pretty fascinating.')
