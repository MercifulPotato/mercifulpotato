It&#x27;s definitely not about ads. On principle, we don&#x27;t host ads on Damn Interesting, and we never have.<p>We aim for narrative non-fiction, to tell a true story that keeps the reader intrigued throughout. We&#x27;ve found over the years that stories with a good &quot;hook&quot; or &quot;teaser&quot; seem to be best received by readers. We&#x27;ve also found that people want some background on the people&#x2F;places they are reading about, and this often requires us to jump back in time after the teaser to fill in the relevant information.<p>If your goal is just to extract the basic bones of the story rather than to be entertained for a while, you probably won&#x27;t like this article, nor the others in our catalog. Our approach to storytelling is not for everybody. And that&#x27;s okay with us--trying to please everyone is the short road to clickbait town.')
