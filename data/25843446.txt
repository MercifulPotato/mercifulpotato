Item(by='chandra381', descendants=None, kids=[25843827], score=None, time=1611126878, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25841354, text='I&#x27;ve never understood this &quot;what-about-ism&quot;. I see it as a bad faith tactic of deflecting attention from one issue to another, when the person doing it knows exactly how bad and indefensible their chosen stance is, and is trying to downplay it. I think it would be vocal to see why this OP is so instinctively fixated on BLM, Seattle and Portland and not on the Capitol attack. What does this reveal about the OP&#x27;s own biases and what and whom they consider important?')
