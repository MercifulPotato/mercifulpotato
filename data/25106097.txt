Back when Intel was shipping on time you’d see regular updates every year but then they stalled and that meant that there wasn’t a better part with the right thermal characteristics or other requirements. Remember when the MBPs had a lengthy delay before the maximum RAM limit went up? That was due to Intel not delivering CPUs using the next generation  low-power DDR4 for, IIRC, multiple years. People would point to PCs which used DDR4 but miss that they were substantially larger and had much shorter battery life, massive batteries, or both.')
