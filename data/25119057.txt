Pilots still use them to calculate airspeeds, distances, and fuel burn; and the reverse side can be used to calculate course corrections in the face of wind. Actually a lot of pilots probably use the iPad they keep all their air charts on for this, but it&#x27;s great to have as a backup. All those flight parameters can be found with a simple mechanism that&#x27;s made of card stock and uses no electricity! Sometimes the most marvelous tech is not high tech.')
