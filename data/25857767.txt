The Chrome debugger is excellent for example. Most Lua game engines provide basically zero debugging beyond runtime errors and console output. Which makes exploring tedious.<p>Then learning a platform and the ins and outs of a language is much quicker in a statically typed language. Not only because the editor is much more empowered so you can explore the codebase statically but with a compilation step you also get a quicker feedback cycle for a lot of common errors. I found JS extremely tedious dealing with runtime errors with typos. TS basically makes that impossible.<p>I think that&#x27;s why PICO-8 feels like a sweet spot for Lua because the platform is so small it&#x27;s quick and easy to learn. And the code size restriction stop you from making anything complex enough to benefit too much from static typing. I still hate runtime errors for silly mistakes that would have been trivially caught.')
