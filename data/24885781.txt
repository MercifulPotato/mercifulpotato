I was on Linux Mint (windows PC with dual boot) for a few years, then I bought a Dell XPS13 with Ubuntu installed from the factory. I really wanted to like the XPS13, but both the hardware and the OS were just so poor compared to my Mac (that I used at work) that after a few broken things (power source plug broke, the fan was very noisy when I was coding on an IDE, the trackpad was not nearly as advanced as the Macs&#x27;, shortcuts broke when I upgraded to Ubuntu 19, then to 20, language switching suddenly started taking 2 seconds for no reason, etc etc etc I hope you get the point) that I decided to finally hit the bank and get a little MacBook Air... what a life changing experience: even though the specs of the MacBook Air are a lot lower than the XPS13, it&#x27;s just a incredibly superior UX. No fan noise even when using the most out of my IDE... trackpad is awesome... even the keyboard is excellent (after the fiasco of the previous Macs, they did get it right), quite superior to the XPS13. The OS itself is just much prettier in all aspects. I feel a small amount of delay sometimes when putting some pressure on the processor, but that&#x27;s still not something I would call remotely annoying (as opposed to the incredibly annoying Linux UX).<p>As much as I don&#x27;t like using Apple stuff due to price and their closed-garden policies, I just can&#x27;t pass on the superior UX.<p>Even though my Windows and Linux machines are still available in my closet, I just never had the desire to touch them again since I got the Mac. Unfortunately!')
