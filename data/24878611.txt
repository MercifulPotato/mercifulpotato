I have bough many albums on the google play music store with the promise to be able to stream whenever I wan&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t want to fall on the subscription hype, and used to bough an album each month instead of paying for a subscription. Of course I can download them and se them offline, but for a company like google to be unable to maintain a basic promised service and instead closing it seems like an insult.<p>I was experimenting on having all my music on my nas and streaming directly from there instead of relying on another subscription service, so I think I will try to move everything to that (currently the only thing I lack is streaming directly to my tv, because i don&#x27;t have that use case often).')
