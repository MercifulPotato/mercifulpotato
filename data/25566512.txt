All of the groups you mention that I&#x27;m familiar with I associate with people&#x27;s grandfathers, or at youngest their slightly odd uncles. Also only with men, although maybe that&#x27;s a bit of selection bias on the ones I know.<p>If something exists but people aren&#x27;t using it, it isn&#x27;t the right solution. It might be hard to say why it isn&#x27;t, it could even just be a marketing problem, but nevertheless the problem isn&#x27;t solved by its existence.')
