The latter is something that&#x27;s to a large extent problem-independent, and yet we&#x27;re still spinning in circles about it for some reason.<p>(By internal code bureaucracy I mean the art of structuring and connecting all the abstractions in your code, the coding of pathways the data travels and transformations it undergoes, etc. Ever had a situation where a seemingly simple feature required you to touch half of your system, as you routed and transformed a piece of information from a place that produced it to the place that consumed it? That&#x27;s code bureaucracy.)')
