(And OpenGL is quite cross-platform if you stick with older versions.) And since browsers these days also have all sorts of incompatibility issues, the merit of “write JS once” seems to be dwindling a bit... (although that’s becoming less of a problem when Chrome is becoming the de-facto browser)')
