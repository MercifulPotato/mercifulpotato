FB can argue by saying &quot;that&#x27;s not applicable because our product is free for users&quot;.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not at all obvious why FB cannot instantly die like all social media companies before.<p>About 35% of global population use facebook at least once a month. Global population counts newborn babies, and 10-15% of adults who can&#x27;t read or write.<p>None of the prior social media companies achieved that size of their network.')
