I don&#x27;t have to ask Coke if I can sell their product. I can even drive and deliver them to people if I want.<p>&gt; Why do they feel the need to impersonate restaurants, steal their menu, their trademark while never disclosing to the client that the restaurant has absolutely no part in that deal?<p>Steal is a misleading term, as it implies that the restaurant is not able to use that menu. Delivery services are extracting and copying the information in the menu. They don&#x27;t even show photos of the menu as far as I&#x27;m aware.<p>I don&#x27;t see anything unethical here. They offer delivery of goods. You pay them, they pay their supplier (the restaurant), and they deliver you the goods. It&#x27;s not any different than a restaurant, except their service is delivering food instead of converting raw ingredients into food.<p>If this is really unethical, why aren&#x27;t we targeting drop shippers? They&#x27;re even worse, they actually rebrand the goods so you can&#x27;t tell who actually manufactured it. They play the exact same role; their only service is providing delivery for goods someone else manufactured.')
