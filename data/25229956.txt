It&#x27;s just a function of political will and funding for local internet... Or just hoping starlink brings internet to everybody. But I also think the government needs to give people&#x2F;companies straight up money to move there or give them some other incentive. It&#x27;s not enough just to have schools and remote workers in houses. We need to incentivize artists, entertainers, service workers, chefs, etc. to want to work in these places.
