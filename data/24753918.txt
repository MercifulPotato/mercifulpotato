Something no Americans wants close to them.\nLast I heard the The Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository will not happen.<p>Presently the US does not have secure facilities to store highly radioactive waste.   That still has to be built and that will cost\ngigantic sums of money.    If it has to be sized to accommodate an increase in the production of said waste, then it has to be even bigger.<p>Presently highly radioactive waste is stored on site where it is being produced. That far from an ideal situation.<p>At the end we have to pay for the decommissioning.<p>It is a huge sinkhole of tax money.')
