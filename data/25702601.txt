If it gets entrapped by tight tissue anywhere on the way down (look up “thoracic outlet syndrome” for example), it can cause issues below, e.g. in elbow and those two fingers.  For the neck and dizziness I forget how things work, e.g. if it means the the problem is rooted in your neck &#x2F; spine area or if the neck symptoms could also be rooted lower further along the nerve.  It could all be due to mobility problems along the same nerve, or if you’ve been hunching at a computer for a while, there could be additional issues in the neck with other nerves or circulation.<p>This is the kind of thing physical therapists and chiropractors work on, but at least when I went through it a decade ago, it was really hard to find one who could troubleshoot the problem and reason about the body vs. going by a lookup table of symptoms and approved treatments.<p>The things that helped me were tissue-loosening massage in the neck, shoulder, and upper rib area.  It finally went away one day when the therapist loosened my top rib enough to stop impinging on the nerve.  Just to give you an example of how counterintuitive it can be.<p>As a general cheat sheet, be thinking about places nerves could get impinged from vertebrae through wrist.  Tight muscles, tissue locking you into certain postures, vertebral misalignment.<p>I bet there’s more info on reddit and places like that now, but one book that used to be good for modeling the whole system was called “It’s not carpal tunnel syndrome”.  Also look up trigger point therapy.  During pandemic you may be more on your own so be aware of self-massage tools like Theracane.  Posture work may also help, and walking &#x2F; general cardio fitness.')
