In my anecdotal experience, immediately after stripping&#x2F;seasoning is not the best time; it gets better after a few weeks of use as more oil&#x2F;fat bonds to the surface after repeated use.<p>If you find your pan is too sticky: use lots of oil&#x2F;fat, cook at medium temperature (not too cool nor too hot), and be patient for a couple weeks; the problem will sort itself out, and eventually you&#x27;ll be able to cook eggs with just a little oil.')
