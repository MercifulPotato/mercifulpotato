But I will say that it&#x27;s a Greek startup, birthed in my English dorm room (Comp Sci grad; taught myself programming at age 11 by reverse engineering GORILLA.BAS; shout-out to all you DOS 6.22 babies #486dx2 #duneiichani #zerocool #snowcrash #bbs #qbasic #mode13h #nehe #0x5f3759df #lamp #vi).<p>&gt; What were your challenges early on?<p>From a life standpoint, it would have to be student loans. But in crisis lies opportunity, because by working to pay these off, I programmed database integration layers between a bunch of local companies that ultimately led to a sweet SaaS system.<p>From a technical standpoint, there were many fun challenges, such as 2,000+ days of uptime with multi-master replication. But the biggest challenge was probably getting an early version of Quixote and a cranky SOAP protocol to talk to a bunch of SAP EDRs; that&#x27;s when I learnt people skills.<p>&gt; What were your hardships?<p>The usual stuff... paying the rent, feeding myself, no free time. It was all systems go back in the day, and dating wasn&#x27;t really an option; but I&#x27;m thankful for lots of genuine friends, who welcomed my intermittent visits.<p>From a business standpoint, the biggest hardship was my constantly wrestling with the idea that I could do anything but I couldn&#x27;t do everything. Once I concluded that exercise I found peace, and then everything else just clicked into place.<p>&gt; And what were your lessons learned?<p>1. There are multiple SaaS strategies. One such strategy is to go super niche. Emphasis on super.\n2. Going super niche doesn&#x27;t scale, but it will allow you to prioritise free time - whilst living a steady, balanced lifestyle.\n3. To go super niche, build your SaaS in such a way that you can run it from your mobile phone. \n4. Always keep an eye on your phone, so that when the need for customer comms arises, it flows with elegant efficiency.\n5. The quality of your communication with your customers is your competitive edge. Excel at this to justify your pricing.\n6. Optimise all your business processes around minimising your phone&#x27;s notifications - the goal is to maximise your free time.\n7. At your leisure, routinely check in on your customers for a friendly catch-up. This enhances your competitive edge and bargaining power.\n8. Always add value to your customers, and if you can&#x27;t add value, walk away. You&#x27;d be surprised how much you can earn and still add value.\n9. Enjoy time. Discover who you are. Explore life with your family and friends. Exercise your body and mind outdoors.\n0. Help others. Volunteer your skills and resources. I advise several entities and it brings me great joy.<p>&gt; What would you do differently?<p>Perhaps I&#x27;d have picked a name that was easier to recall, and easier to spell.<p>But when you go super niche, it doesn&#x27;t really matter what name you pick.')
