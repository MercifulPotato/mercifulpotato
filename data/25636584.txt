I need to be able to have low latency voice and video communication, but I also need control over the audio codec and bit rate. Zoom and other video conferencing solutions use codecs optimized for voice, which makes music and sound effects sound like a Himalayan AM radio broadcast. Twitch and Youtube give me control over the video and audio quality, but the latency is 5+ seconds even on low latency mode. I tried running voice over zoom and video and music over youtube, but then drawing on the map is 5+ seconds out of sync with me saying &quot;look here&quot;.')
