And despite some very loud protestations of horse owners, people who try to garden with horse manure have to contend with herbicides.<p>Mechanical pest&#x2F;weed management is still a very powerful tool. And maybe some day we can have robots do that for us, but we don&#x27;t have to wait that long to get much of the benefit.<p>In order to kill a weed, you first have to see the weed. Rather than putting all of this onto a drone, there&#x27;s plenty of utility to be gained by having a system that looks for these plants and geotags them.  Then a centralized identification system (possible, the farmer&#x27;s eyeballs) can filter down the false positives and they can send someone out to dispatch the weeds by hand, and&#x2F;or adjust their graze rotation patterns to reduce exposure.<p>And something organic gardeners learn intimately is that every weed has intervals where they are most expensive to deal with. Seedlings may be too labor intensive. Blooming weeds are priority 1. But depending on soil profile, some weeds are easier to kill once their stalks and roots have become more robust - strong enough that you can grab the stalk and pull.<p>So on any given day you may be aware of a hundred weeds, but only twenty of them are on the priority queue.')
