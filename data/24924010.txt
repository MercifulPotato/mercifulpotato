Just because a Democrat does something doesn&#x27;t make it liberal -- and in fact, they&#x27;ve been moving away from liberalism for quite some time.<p>It&#x27;s funny how in continental Europe, if you tell people you&#x27;re a liberal they&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re a free-market, small-government, pro-civil-liberties type.  That&#x27;s because our definitions in America have changed as the parties have changed.  We&#x27;ve entangled ideology (liberalism) with a party (Democratic) to the point where people will call anti-liberal positions liberal simply because the Democratic Party has espoused it.  The same is true of &quot;conservatism&quot; and &quot;Republican&quot; of course.')
