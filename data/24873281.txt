That is fine. Having a clean code helps you then quickly polishing it and evolving it based on the customer needs. I prefer that to an over designed system, that is 80% clean and 20% crap, because that is hard to change as time goes by, and that 80% will stay the same, but will become 50% and then 10% of the total codebase.')
