My friend and I back in the 1990&#x27;s started working on a STEM website that would have made use of Java applets.  The idea was to present algebra concepts with graphing applets where you could modify a formula for a parabola, and then see the results on-screen in real time.  Like what you could do with a graphing calculator, but with a more explanatory text surrounding it.<p>I just took a look at the first page of google results for &quot;learn algebra parabola&quot; and found plenty of learning resources... but not a single one was interactive?<p>With all the fancy Javascript-heavy pages these days, has noone has done this sort of thing? I also took a look at Khan Academy, and they have some interactive stuff, a lot of it is just videos.')
