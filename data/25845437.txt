Of course Parler didn’t have the same moderation tools, they weren’t a multi billion dollar company with a supranational sized user base and decades of growth. They were a small platform attempting to scale. What did Facebook moderation look like a few years after their launch? Or Reddit? They were just as cavalier as Parler.')
