So I felt like I missed out on developing proper technique. I&#x27;ve been looking for free running gait analysis but I haven&#x27;t found anything meeting my needs (free, privacy friendly, convenient).<p>It&#x27;s still pretty rough, but I&#x27;m hoping to release an Android prototype in the next few months. If you have time, I&#x27;d love some community feedback&#x2F;suggestions on my anonymous Google form.
