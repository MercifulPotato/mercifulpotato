All you need is a computer with some kind of language that is easy to run installed and a tutorial for hello world for it.<p>But what about programming a program that does some math calculations? Seem like it would be good to know those math calculations that you need to implement...<p>Or lets take accounting software for example? You need basic math most of the time but it turns out it is quite valuable to know about accounting. Yes, you can write an accounting software without knowing any accounting and just depend on what product manager tells you. But it is much easier to understand what he is saying if you know a lot about accounting... It is also much easier and faster to make decisions without going to product for each tiny detail.<p>You can expand this to the problem of building teams. You can read few tutorials on agile development and what not, however knowing psychology and having enough empathy to understand people you work with in depth will bring much better results then any so called management book that is taken literally.<p>And so it goes... The more you know about how world works the better decisions you can make that eventually might lead you to better solutions to the problem at hand.<p>This is a general thing in life in my experience, but also one that seems to be looked over quite often... The more you know about problem domain the better you will be at problem solving inside that domain. Coding that solution into a computer program at that point is just a matter of knowing how to use that tool (which is a specific problem domain in of it self.)')
