Ive certainly had some experiences similar to many reported on this thread. However, one more recently was different in an interesting way:<p>I was talking to a friend of mines who recently had gotten into trading on robinhood and he was just explaining his investing strategy, as it were, to me as we walked through a park we frequent. I had my iphone on me as usual. Anways later that evening I would get one of these spam follow requests on instagram from some investing related personality account; keep in my mind I have essentially never searched for investing&#x2F;market related info or content ever on my machine and definitely not on instagram, most of whom I follow are celebrities or artists.')
