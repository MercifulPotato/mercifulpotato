Item(by='ganashaw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609774221, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25631709, text='For me, the value in attending a &quot;top&quot; university is much more about the networking and &quot;name recognition&quot; on resumes, and the enormous boost that those factors offer you over the course of one&#x27;s career, than it is about the actual coursework. Unfortunately (imo) if a recruiter is given two identical resumes but ones says MIT and one says State School, the MIT resume will almost always get preference for interviews, salary negotion, etc.<p>I went into massive debt attending CMU, when I could have probably gone to a perfectly good university for free, but I&#x27;ve seen first hand (and been told by recruiters) how much just having THAT university on my resume has affected my prospects, and so I still think it was worth it. That&#x27;s not to mention the other experiences afforded by attending a world class university like research opportunities, internships, etc. which all sort of serve as a positive feedback loop for improving the prestige of the university and it&#x27;s alumni.')
