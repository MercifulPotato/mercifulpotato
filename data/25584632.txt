I know some people pushing hard for police reform but not dismantling or defunding of police. Actually none of those ideas strike me as very controversial. The more controversial &quot;real-world&quot; woke ideas I&#x27;ve seen are around affirmative action, forced pay equality, etc. And yes, I understand the arguments against those things.')
