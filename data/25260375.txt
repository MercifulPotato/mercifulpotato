Neither of those can be done anywhere with an Internet connection; they&#x27;re going to require close collaboration between software developers, data scientists, electrical&#x2F;mechanical&#x2F;biomedical engineers, and actual scientists (physicists, chemists, biologists, and material scientists). The Bay Area is excellently situated to take advantage of this, having 2 world-class universities, a number of smaller colleges, thriving industries in all of these, and lots of capital. Much of the rest of the country, not so much.<p>This comment is a great example of the SV bubble mindset.  The Midwest, Northeast and gulf coast have far better existing infrastructure and workforces if your goal is to create products that have a physical existence in excess of what it takes to represent ones and zeros.<p>I&#x27;ll be the first to tell you that I&#x27;ll vote for any despot who promises to screw the people of Boston but even I have to admit that if your goal is to do some BioMed thing the existing industry there is far better poised to take advantage of it than SV is.  The Gulf coast is where you go if you want to do things with chemicals.  The eastern midwest is where you go for heavy industry type manufacturing.  Specialty composites, aerospace, electronics manufacturing capability is sprinkled throughout the area east of the Mississippi (though sprinkled less densely in the more agricultural parts of the south and midwest).<p>It&#x27;s just laughable that you think that SV, a place that&#x27;s spent decades driving out anything that doesn&#x27;t have tech-size margins, has the existing workforce and infrastructure to compete against the places that already have these industries.')
