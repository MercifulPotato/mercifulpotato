Wheels can have continuous angular velocity which cashes out the continuous speed of a car. I don&#x27;t preclude collections of parts from correlated behavior, which is what a rotating tire is.  A road in contact with a tire is interacting with the complex of correlated parts and so the road&#x27;s perspective of the tire is that of a unified whole. Similarly, our perspective of a table is that of a unified whole due to electromagnetic forces that keeps the dynamics of the constituent molecules highly correlated and our inability to perceive the seams between the parts (without the aid of tools). But when it comes to consciousness, there is no perceiver distinct from the perception, and so you cannot rely on such a distinction to cash out the apparent unified whole of consciousness.')
