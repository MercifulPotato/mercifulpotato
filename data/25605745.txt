Cities like Los Angeles that require moving vast amounts of fresh water long distances to be viable are a recent phenomenon - appearing only in the last century or so. So a big reason for the lack of desalination is a lack of demand. Yes, some places are experiencing a lack of water but those are the exception to the norm.<p>And even if a population center does need more fresh water, desalination is competing against traditional options: digging wells, building aqueducts, and expanding reservoirs. And have lots of experience - again, literally millennia of experience - implementing these pieces of infrastructure.<p>So in summary, desalination isn&#x27;t seeing widespread adoption because it&#x27;s not necessary for most places and we have much more experience with the alternatives. That said, it&#x27;s great we&#x27;re still improving desalination and it puts the world in a better place if water scarcity gets to the point that traditional water infrastructure is not sufficient.')
