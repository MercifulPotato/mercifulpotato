I like to keep my main branch up to date with the main branch of the remote repo. I find it&#x27;s helpful to have that consistency across contexts.<p>I think diffs are faster if it&#x27;s to the local repo vs the remote repo.<p>I always make branches off local-main, as opposed to remote main as in your example.<p>I think it&#x27;s also helpful to have the main branch replicated across as many machines as possible. There have been one or two times where a dev has deleted remote main at my company where some (very VERY CALM) git push solved the problem. I probably could have checked out a tracking branch and fixed it that way, but having a local copy of main made it a one-step process (I think the resolution was just to git push the main branch?).')
