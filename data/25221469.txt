Or for Java: step 1, install Spring.<p>But Node is just a JavaScript runtime, like Python or Java. Of course, you don&#x27;t need Node to run JavaScript in browser as it is built-in in the browser, but the built-in JavaScript engine doesn&#x27;t allow you to easily use it externally.<p>&gt; A simple browser extension doesn&#x27;t need Node. It just doesn&#x27;t. The browser itself already packs everything the extension needs.<p>You don&#x27;t need to use it, as web-ext is just a extra tool to make it do some automation. You can just create some files and use Firefox to load it manually.<p>&gt; And I could go on - why would a JS runtime&#x2F;framework need Visual Studio, at all?<p>Because it uses native addon which is not written in JavaScript, so it need to be compiled when installing. Since Windows doesn&#x27;t come with a compiler by default, you need to install it. It is more simpler to install it in Linux.<p>BTW, if you don&#x27;t want a full visual studio to use native addon in Node.js, you can use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;windows-build-tools" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;windows-build-tools</a> instead, which provides tools you needed to compile things on Windows.')
