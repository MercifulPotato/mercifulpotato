I&#x27;m not sure what the trading volume is but I doubt that you could fill the entire IPO at the high IPO price.<p>From what I understand, supply is constrained as employees typically can&#x27;t sell shares, and retail investors who were lucky enough to get in on the action are typically locked up for 60 days. Institutional investors are happy to hold on to alot of their shares because they can mark them to market and make their returns look great.')
