He bought up a bunch of distilleries, and he had booze stored under bond, but the notion that he was a bootlegger is wrong.<p>Was he more scrupulous than the next businessman? Maybe not.\nWas he in bed with the mob? I doubt it.<p>Mobs have attempted to rig elections, but not I think The Mob. The most conspicuously rigged election in US history must have been Hayes over Tilden, at a time when organized crime was pretty small beans in the US.')
