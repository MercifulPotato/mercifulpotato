Item(by='zaarn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608553371, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25487200, text='There is several endings to the game that require you to complete side missions in certain ways. The &quot;secret ending&quot; is only achievable if a certain NPC is a lot in the positive area, even more than is necessary to unlock that NPCs normal ending. If you don&#x27;t follow up on two NPC&#x27;s side missions, those endings are respectively locked out too, or if you don&#x27;t side with them at the end. If you simply go through the main mission, there is only two endings available to you, if you go through everything in a decent manner you have 8 endings available to you.<p>Side missions also affect eachother and some have hidden timers, if you don&#x27;t complete an objective in time or don&#x27;t check in with the NPC, things will happen out of your control.<p>Hell, if you manage to play the nomad side missions well and a particular NPC likes how you do things, you can get their gun. But if they don&#x27;t like you, that doesn&#x27;t lock you from the rest of the nomad options, you just don&#x27;t get that gun.<p>For all the bugs that the game has, side missions and choices do affect things and the game makes a good effort on making you feel like it has more impact than it has (after all, a lot of it is simply a like&#x2F;dislike score, but a lot of games operate on that scale), like some meaningless inquiry option (ie, blue dialog option) can lead you to a completely new dialog tree that can open up a small side mission in a different way.')
