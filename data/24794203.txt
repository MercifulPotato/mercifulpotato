Apparently the massive consumer demand for phones with low Z-heights has made replaceable batteries an impossibility and that&#x27;s that. Same story for laptops. It&#x27;s a only a matter of time before Tesla and other electric car OEMs realize they can force customers to buy new cars by making their batteries irreplaceable. All they need to do is build the batteries into the frame in such a way as to slim the cars profile and consumers will be fine with it. Something like a disposable low-profile Tesla Fiero with a 3-4 year maximum lifespan will quickly become the unavoidable reality car makers have always wanted to impose on the consumer.')
