Further do you have evidence of this?<p>Do you know there’s gaming and other non political content on Parler? It was born out of politics so the majority of content is still focused around it.<p>Why don’t you see it for yourself instead of letting your imagination run wild?<p>I have been on Parler, briefly to validate all the claims of constant, unabated, hate speech and found nothing of the sort.
