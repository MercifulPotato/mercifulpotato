They can track your footsteps and know which room and which floor you are on. They have been quietly building indoor maps of millions of buildings.<p>If you use Android, turn off &quot;high accuracy location&quot; and do not agree to any setting that prompts for sharing &quot;anonymized&quot; data. If you can, just uninstall Google Play Services.<p>If you work for Google, read the GLS privacy design doc and lobby them to improve anonymization and&#x2F;or shut down this completely dystopian data collection.')
