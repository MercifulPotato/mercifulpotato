Call that a &quot;full&quot; tank.  A gas pump can do the same in about 5 minutes (probably less).  So to charge&#x2F;fill the same number of cars <i>per hour</i> as one gas pump you need 8 superchargers.  That&#x27;s a significant increase in real estate area needed.<p>Another approach: A top-end Tesla supercharger delivers around 250kW.  So eight of those would be 2000kW or 2 Megawatt, or around 20,000 amps, to give the equivalent number of fills&#x2F;charges per hour as ONE gas pump.<p>I filled my tank at a medium-sized station this morning that had 8 pumps (4 islands, double-sided).  So the drop-in electric replacement would be 8x the numbers above.')
