Quiting wasn&#x27;t really that great a decision. A lot of the problems that I had attributed to caffiene or caffiene withdrawl such as migraines and periodic brain fog didn&#x27;t go away without caffiene. Some of the more accute issues did, but I used to get regular insomnia (and still do) and I&#x27;d have no crutch to get me through those days after a sleepless night had thown me off balance.<p>What&#x27;s worse is that I couldn&#x27;t really get away from caffiene altogether, things like chocolate contain caffiene as well as a surprising number of drinks which aren&#x27;t required to advertise their caffine quantity. So I&#x27;d occasionally end up getting some caffiene by accident and because I had been avoiding it, I wouldn&#x27;t have enough of a tolerance to deal with it. I&#x27;d have a drink that I didn&#x27;t know contained caffiene and would suddenly find myself wired with my hands shaking uncontrollably. That hasn&#x27;t happened since I starting drinking coffee on weekdays again. Having more caffiene than I meant to is still a problem, but not nearly as big a problem as it used to be.')
