I generally buy Asus&#x27;s higher end boards which is a safe bet, but my current Asus X470-i pretty much presents me with the choice between clocking higher or more cores. I&#x27;d have to get a newer board and don&#x27;t want to.<p>I&#x27;m probably sticking to the combo you&#x27;re looking at, AMD+NV. I generally prefer Intel for overall QA reasons, and I can attest that Ryzen was buggy up until today, but I still can&#x27;t imagine going with an Intel system right now. My Ryzen 1800X, 1700, and 2700X systems were stable but I wouldn&#x27;t call them plug and play.<p>I&#x27;m making my changes in January so supply should no longer be a problem. You might find it&#x27;s worth waiting it out till then too, Nvidia may have a response to the 6800 series by then too. Rumor was they were increasing VRAM but cancelled the cards.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linustechtips.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;1137619-motherboard-vrm-tier-list-v2-currently-amd-only&#x2F;?fbclid=IwAR1Aq_VJeyXs1ak2YDc5dRY0YLN63ig1qc1T9r7FnHRhHvTHHrQ5PPNveRY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linustechtips.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;1137619-motherboard-vrm-tier...</a>')
