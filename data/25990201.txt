Creative teams love our product because it helps them capture and organize the photos and videos that drive their business.<p>Team - Our team includes strategic investors from the media world (Lerer Hippeau Ventures, WndrCo, Advancit Capital, Redsea Ventures) and engineers who have built products for some of the largest tech companies (Facebook, Snapchat, Microsoft, Amazon).<p>Stack - Air prefers to adopt the latest technologies across our stack whenever possible. Our mobile app is built in React Native, with specific modules written in Swift or Java for performance. Our web app shares much of the mobile app&#x27;s networking code. Our API runs entirely on AWS Lambda using the Serverless framework, allowing us to scale on demand in response to traffic without managing infrastructure. We transcode all our videos in house with ffmpeg on Elastic Beanstalk, and we serve video with HLS to our client applications.<p>Open roles: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.air.inc&#x2F;jobs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.air.inc&#x2F;jobs</a> or shoot me an email (carmi@air.inc)')
