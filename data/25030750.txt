The log of one is zero. There&#x27;s a big difference between one bit of information and zero.<p>You can interpret a &quot;yo&quot; message as conveying one bit of information, and the <i>only</i> way to do that is to draw it from the contrast between &quot;sending a yo&quot; and &quot;not sending a yo&quot;. If you do that, &quot;sending a yo&quot; sends one bit of information, and &quot;not sending a yo&quot; <i>also</i> sends one bit of information.<p>Thought experiment: with three bits of information, you can disambiguate between eight possibilities. Try to design a protocol in which, by sending up to three &quot;yo&quot;s, you achieve 8 distinct messages.')
