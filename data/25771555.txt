Much of its features have been replaced by broadly-available APIs like Document.querySelector and Element.classList. Loading the entirety of jQuery just to access some of the remaining features just means you&#x27;re loading JavaScript that you aren&#x27;t going to use. I miss relying on jQuery because it&#x27;s familiar and consistent, but it also makes it easy to forget how much better browsers have gotten in the time since it was introduced.')
