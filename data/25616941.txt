Don&#x27;t remember where I read it, but he said he lights his stuff primarily with flat overhead lighting these days because he doesn&#x27;t want the DP&#x2F;lighting to &quot;waste time&quot; getting lights just right for a shot.<p>While I immensely enjoy his films, it seems that he has great distain for the fact that filmmaking is a community effort, and simultaneously doesn&#x27;t have it in himself to fight for his choices, so he just eliminates choice where he can.<p>Watching his progression over the years, I feel like the penultimate David Fincher film would be sans-actors and camera movement, followed by a film of raw script text pages with his red marker notes scribbled on them.')
