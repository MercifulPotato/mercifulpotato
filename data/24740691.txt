I wonder how different their work is from this. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neuraldsp.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;quad-cortex" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neuraldsp.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;quad-cortex</a><p>I’m personally kind of over lugging an amp around and if live music ever comes back, I’m likely to sell mine and go with a modeler + power amp. The technology has just come so far and the convenience can’t be beat, especially if you do a lot of studio work or need to travel with your gear. A lot of demanding metal bands have switched away from tube amps and I’m already using plugins for recording as much as possible, so this seems like the next step.')
