So, this also doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with Rust.<p>Is that it doesn&#x27;t benefit, or is it that the benefits are too hard to achieve given the nature of memory issues with games that like to have global state and are written in C++? A lot of games do a bunch of things every frame and then increment state. Those can all be parallelized as they only depend on the previous frame&#x27;s state.')
