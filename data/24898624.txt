I just wanted to point out the difference. It may or may not matter in this case because the thread is very limited.\nThere are still very valid reasons to use a DL for example the XRPL had a uptime of 100% in the last year. GitHub certainly does not have that. Also using a public DL means zero maintenance. Again I use the XRPL as example it runs stable and public since over 8 years.\nTo use it you need nothing but an address of a node or better a few for backup because a single nodes obviously can have downtime.\nNo server, no domain register, no cloud computing provider, no backup plans, nothing. The only thing you pay is the Tx &quot;fee&quot; which is only there to prevent spam Tx. Its like 0.00001 XRP so thousands of transactions will cost you cents at most.<p>&gt;And you think the actual implementation of the blockchain will be more secure and tamper pro of?<p>Yes, absolutely. Again XRPL as example because I know it best. There has never been a single byte tampered with in the last 8 years and its several TB of Tx data by now.')
