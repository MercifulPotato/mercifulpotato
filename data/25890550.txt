To truly work from home 100% of the time you have to be a master at controlling yourself and your ability to be distracted.<p>You have obviously gathered a lot of remote experience. As someone who has always worked in some form of research lab and is now working from home, I am still achieving my objectives and deliverables but definitely feel a lot less productive without the &#x27;positive&#x27; pressure of being with my peers. I am also fortunate that I work with very hands-off and mature managers even in this remote scenario.<p>What strategies can we create for better self-accountability and discipline when working on long running projects on our own? What worked for you?')
