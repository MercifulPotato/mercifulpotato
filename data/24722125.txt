True, some <i>aspects</i> (such as risk of surface transmission) were overestimated; but other aspects (airborn transmission risk) were also underestimated at the time.<p>At the same time, <i>countermeasures</i> have definitely improved.  And in some areas, the virus has partially attained is saturation limit (and so its spread has slowed somewhat).<p>But roughly stated, the overall assessment of risk&#x2F;severity back in early Spring remains spot-on (perhaps even understated - given what we know know about the phenomenon of &quot;long-haulers&quot;).')
