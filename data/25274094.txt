This will be my second compiler; first one emitted x86 directly. Should I consider switching to QBE? I’m more focused on compiler passes that <i>I</i> want to write; register allocation, etc. is not my thing. I’m going to be working with CPS-conversion ans stuff like that. Does anyone have any good tutorials for using either system?')
