Increases in technology can also increase supply while decreasing prices.<p>Oil sands were long considered unusable, but when oil prices got high enough, it was profitable to start mining them turning Venezuela into an oil rich country. Once they started working, they found more efficient ways to extract the oil, so they could complete up to a point as prices stabilized and later dropped.<p>We see the same thing with fracking. As oil prices increase, it becomes profitable. As they get better at it, the minimum profitable price decreases.<p>Today, subsidized or not, you&#x27;ll see fracking continue as it&#x27;s much more efficient than it once was.')
