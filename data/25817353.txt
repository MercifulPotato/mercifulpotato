Item(by='mtlynch', descendants=None, kids=[25817375], score=None, time=1610935075, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25815091, text='I&#x27;m in my town&#x27;s local Buy Nothing group on Facebook, and it works alright, but if I ever get rich enough to go full-time on a money-losing business, I&#x27;d <i>love</i> to build a dedicated app to replace the facebook groups and make the process easier for everyone.<p>The current system is incredibly clunky and ripe for abuse. Here&#x27;s what it looks like for me:<p>1. Post the item I want to give away<p>2. Check back in a few hours to see if anyone has commented to say they want it (I&#x27;d do first-come, first serve, but it gets abused by people who watch all day and claim everything)<p>3. Go through the replies to see which are actual requests and not &quot;my friend Steve would probably be interested!&quot;<p>4. Generate a random number generator and take the result mod number of legitimate requests<p>5. Notify the winner and give them pickup instructions<p>6. Put the item out for them<p>About half the time, there are issues. They don&#x27;t see the PM I sent them, they forget to pick it up, they realize they have no means to pick it up because they have no car, etc.<p>Issues with this system:<p>* Many parts to the process where I have to do something, wait, then come back and do the next step hours later.<p>* No reputation system. Recipients who are flakey or unreliable can continue being flakey to lots of people, wasting the time of givers, making the whole process less appealing.<p>* The gift givers are expected to choose a winner at their own discretion, but people are likely choosing recipients based on unfair biases.<p>Here&#x27;s how I want it to work:<p>1. I put the item on my porch<p>2. I post an item I want to give away. At the time I post, I specify the parameters of how to pick the winner automatically (e.g., they have a rating &gt;= X, they have a verified address within Y miles, randomly select after Z hours).<p>3. The system automatically notifies the winner and sends them pickup instructions.<p>4. The winner comes and picks up the item.<p>5. We both leave feedback to say the transaction went smoothly.')
