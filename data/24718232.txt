Where does the car go if no one gets it?<p>And if they switch both have probability 2&#x2F;3 of getting the car? Is this some form of car sharing?<p>Maybe you should try to play with three cards and one ace. Pick one card (you are the first contestant). Pick a second card (you are also the second contestant). Flip the remaining card. If was the ace start again.<p>Now, do you prefer card #2 to card #1 and simultaneously prefer card #1 to card #2?')
