Item(by='chriswarbo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605006888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25043728, text='&gt; - it&#x27;s so very implicit that you end up having to hold a lot of state in your head to understand what&#x27;s going on.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t use the word &quot;state&quot;, since that has connotations that implicits are somehow changing at runtime. It&#x27;s certainly true that <i>scope</i> is much more important and non-obvious than explicit variable names.<p>Type aliases can also get in the way when thinking about implicits (e.g. we might want an implicit &#x27;Foo[Bar]&#x27;, but if those are aliases then the compiler might start chaining Maps of Lists of Strings of whatever to resolve it).<p>Implicit conversions definitely seem like they could cause headaches (e.g. performing &#x27;String&#x27; operations on a &#x27;List[Char]&#x27; and having it implicitly and silently converted). I&#x27;ve only been using Scala for the last year, and thankfully implicit conversions seem to be avoided these days!')
