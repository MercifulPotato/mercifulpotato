She stood out because she read the job description and highlighted relevant experience. Yeah, that&#x27;s the bar.<p>I know about different bar - not in customer service business, in software engineering. You&#x27;re given a task to write a parser in 15 minutes - literally, you solve it, it mostly works - for some simple inputs at least, you don&#x27;t have time to test it thoroughly. You don&#x27;t pass - the bar is different.<p>Your experience tells that the startup is too early to think about scalability problems. They can keep things simple for a solid another iteration of the product. You explain that to them, they listen, but they are doubtful - they&#x27;ve heard that scaling is crucial, and even though they have like a hundred of customers, they want that - so your advice is considered wrong. You don&#x27;t pass that bar.<p>They tell you they need somebody senior to coach and mentor a bunch of more junior engineers, somebody who&#x27;d steer the whole technical stack. In remaining minutes of the engineering interview they ask you to write Rabin-Karp implementation, or AVL balancing. You don&#x27;t pass the bar if algorithms don&#x27;t work first time.')
