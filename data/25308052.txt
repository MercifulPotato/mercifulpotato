Also OCaml and sometimes Haskell. Even Rust has started popping up recently.<p>I find this a bit intriguing because the library support for linear algebra, probability and statistics is pretty slim both in .NET and OCaml. The latter has OWL, which is very cool, but it&#x27;s mostly a 1-person project.<p>Do they develop all this support in house? For example, in insurance you may need things like Gumbel or Fr√©chet maximum likelihood estimators. That&#x27;s not so easy to implement on your own, especially not without some linear algebra and optimization primitives available.<p>On the other hand, I love these languages, and I wish there was a strongly typed contender to Python, R or Julia. Whenever I develop a data-oriented application, it feels like I need to prototype in one language and in order to scale or develop the whole infrastructure, I need to switch to another language.<p>Julia has solved some of these problems, but I don&#x27;t see a team implementing tons of business logic in a medium sized application using Julia.')
