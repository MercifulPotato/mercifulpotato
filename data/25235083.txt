My dad&#x27;s smart. He worked in pharma for many years and knows tons about a lot of the science (and business) related to that.<p>He just never had any interest in learning about things like file systems and so forth. A tablet for him was my best gift to myself ever. (And he now just uses a large smartphone. He doesn&#x27;t use the vast majority of its capabilities because he&#x27;s just not interested in them; he uses what&#x27;s of interest to him.)')
