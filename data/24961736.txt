I&#x27;m investigating two routes right now, one is to see if I can get support through patreon, youtube ads and things like that and then eventually release it as open source. The other is to release it as a game on steam, maybe get funding first, but not necessarily. I&#x27;m leaning more towards the second one at the moment, people have pointed out that the project would have a wider impact that way.')
