Like you think you need 32gb for snappy performance and it is rational idea that all your processes absolutely need sequential memory blocks, but it isnt that true.<p>I honestly think you would just be smarter about your use of resources again.<p>With these benchmarks I am starting to lean more towards 32gb itself being the compromise. Simply because it doesnt cause you to budget resources, a luxury, but at the expense of these other benchmarks? And in the worst case we just have to wait a year or two before 32gb is offered in the M series package?')
