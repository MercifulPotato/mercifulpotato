Myself included. But norms change over time and I find the prospect of a sea change like the author seems to suggest, that leaves most (hetero) men simultaneously and suddenly lost, unlikely.<p>Taking it a step further, too often I&#x27;ve seen hand-wringing arguments that look awfully similar to this author&#x27;s used as an excuse to minimize some of the worst behavior of men. It is, in fact, possible for the average man to understand things like boundaries and consent. I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s what this author is doing, but it sound similar enough that it sets off my BS meter.')
