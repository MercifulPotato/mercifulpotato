However, many teams do that.  Perhaps they view it as an efficiency.  In many cases people check-in generated code in order to perform their own risk reduction, removing a dependency and the possiblity of the generated code changing outside of their control.<p>&gt; I believe you might be referring to stuff like boilerplate code, the whole purpose of which is to be generated for further development. In which case I agree with you, but then boilerplate codes don&#x27;t balloon the way AMDGPU header files did.<p>No.  I&#x27;m definitely not referring to boilerplate code.')
