I have no shame about the act, merely hate having to hold it in during a long meeting because there was a line for the bathrooms before hand.<p>Oddly enough, I think the shift to open offices deserves at least some credit here. I think most office spaces were designed with a median estimate of occupancy in mind. Before open offices, it was a mix of offices and cubicles, with much less density. When I worked in a cube farm, we had 4 stalls and 2 urinals for about 60-70 men on two floors. My most recent office had 2 single occupancy bathrooms for about 40 people. If we count the urinal as 0.5 toilet, we get almost double the per-bathroom density in the open office.<p>And the other confounding factor is when you combine open offices with cell phones, the bathroom turns into the &#x27;Candy Crush break&#x27;. I imagine median occupancy times were lower back in the day, as lugging a newspaper or magazine to the bathroom was a little too obvious.')
