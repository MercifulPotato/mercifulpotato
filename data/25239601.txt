I pragmatically use my computer with packages my distro offers me. When I download something from untrusted sources, I do take a quick look at what it is before executing it. It still is dangerous since I&#x27;m not able to spend time on verifying every single line of it, but it&#x27;s up to me to decide whether that&#x27;s an acceptable risk or not. All perfectly pragmatic.<p>I&#x27;m not a kind of person who&#x27;s on a crusade against curling into bash, but I never do that myself because it feels dirty.
