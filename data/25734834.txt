But say for instance you lived in nazi Germany, would you have the right to protest? Would you have the right to say things that are outside of the overton window? You would not have the right, and your opinions would be spat upon. And yet they would be true and right for you. In your mind you would have every right to express yourself and undermine the government outside of democratic means.<p>The point is we can never know how far outside of what is &quot;good&quot; we currently circle. It is right that people with a belief strong enough to force them to action are forced to action. It is right that a state that believes itself true defends itself. It is all part of the process, all of it. Who the hell are you to know with certainty that you, specifically you, have the the eagle eyed vision to discern right from wrong? To somehow miraculously step outside of the tiny little context in which you live and know with 100% certainty that you are right.<p>You are the product of your surroundings, a container for thoughts passing through, a ghost in the machine. Don&#x27;t be so God damned arrogant. You cannot know truth, you cannot know right. The world is unfolding as it should.')
