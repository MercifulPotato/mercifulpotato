I even want to add a few things:<p>&gt; Clever code isn&#x27;t usually good code. Clarity trumps all other concerns.<p>My measurement is &quot;simple and clean&quot; code. Is it simple and clean? No? make it so!<p>&gt; After performing over 100 interviews: interviewing is thoroughly broken. I also have no idea how to actually make it better.<p>If a good developer you know, recommends someone they worked with: It&#x27;s almost an instant hire. But for the rest, yeah, it&#x27;s incredibly tough.<p>One last thing I like to remind myself: &quot;Good enough is always good enough&quot;. Sometimes &quot;good enough&quot; has a low bar, sometimes high. You always need to reach it, but never want to go too far above it.')
