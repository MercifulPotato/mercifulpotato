They need to be acted upon within 2ms or they vanish.<p>You don&#x27;t have the time budget to run a NNet every time the state of the market changes.  You can, however, train a NNet to output a very small decision tree that can run in under 1ms.  The NNet can then decide which &quot;micro-strategy&quot; in the form of a much faster and more reactive decision tree is more appropriate for the current market context.')
