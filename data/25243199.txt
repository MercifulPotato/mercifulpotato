So your million will go a lot further.<p>If things cool off a bit and go back to a historical marketplace of 6% to 8% ROI, I think You have a way to go yet if You really want to not work at all. Of course if You are planning on checking out in the next 20 years You probably have enough.<p>It is a neat feeling when You see all that money in the bank though isn&#x27;t it?')
