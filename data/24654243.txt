We take all of the security critical information and then alert on what&#x27;s important, generate reports, show cool dashboards, and simplify demonstrating compliance to their regulators and auditors.<p>I got my job here through an HN Who&#x27;s Hiring post 5 years ago, and I love working here. Strong engineering culture - weekly hour &#x27;topic sync&#x27; to share knowledge, minimal meetings, flexible hours&#x2F;wfh, happy customers that give good feedback, and interesting problems to solve. Sales have been strong through quarantine, and we recently moved into a new office near the ferry terminal with waterfront views. Currently our engineering team is fully remote for COVID and are conducting interviews remotely.<p>We use AngularJS&#x2F;Angular (upgrade in progress), Typescript, Java 11, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and we&#x27;re built on AWS. Our interview loop is one or two ~1-hour phone screenings, followed by a ~4 hours video call - and we&#x27;ve designed it to approximate realistic day-to-day coding and code review (no algorithm riddles).<p>Email jobs [at] defensestorm [dot] com or apply here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;company&#x2F;defensestorm&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;company&#x2F;defensestorm&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a>')
