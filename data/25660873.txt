I don&#x27;t use facebook but I use Youtube which also has a much ballyhooed algorithm. I&#x27;ve tried skipping their homepage (and thus skipping the algorithm) and just going to the list of videos posted by my subscribtions in what I presume is chronological order, and let&#x27;s just say I usually find what I want more quickly the former way than the latter. I can only imagine it would be the same with a social network.<p>It turns out that even for channels I subscribe to the percentage of stuff they post that I want to see is pretty damn low, even lower than the &quot;hit rate&quot; of the algorithm which also isn&#x27;t great. Now imagine a social network where you connect with people for reasons other than that you think you&#x27;d like what they post (you met them IRL and they asked you to add them, you want to talk, etc). An algorithm of some sort would be absolutely mandatory.')
