But if you use it at scale with multiple developers you can see it&#x27;s layers of leaky abstraction laid down since the 80s that can never really be cleaned because too much is built on this foundation.<p>This slightly over 100 page book on move semantics <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leanpub.com&#x2F;cppmove" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leanpub.com&#x2F;cppmove</a> shows some of the iceberg like complexities dotted all over the place. Some developers probably never use and have never even heard of move semantics.<p>I&#x27;ve been programming in C++ pretty much my entire career. Personal projects or small projects I&#x27;d use Ruby or Python first. I&#x27;d only ever use C++ (or a very specific subset of it) if I want to make something extremely performant.<p>C++ will eventually peak and die off but the timeframe is probably measured in decades and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;ll places where it holds on even then, like Fortran today.  I certainly would&#x27;t recommend it to a programmer starting out today, instead C or Rust would be better places to get an idea of system level programming.')
