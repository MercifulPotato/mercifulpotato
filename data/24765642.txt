It happens by using a different reading of &quot;proportional&quot; than the one that was intended.<p>The results and outcomes alluded to in each comment, mine and the one you&#x27;re responding to, are consequences of essentially begging the question.  It&#x27;s that part where the flaw liesâ€”because it leads, as in your comment, to justifying things as rational and fit even when they are not equitable.')
