Alice cedes control over the shares in return of a fee. Therefore, when Bob borrows 100 shares from Alice and sells them to Chuck, there are <i>still only</i> 100 on the market, not 200.<p>&gt; When a security is sold, the seller is contractually obliged to deliver it to the buyer. If a seller sells a security short without owning it first, the seller must borrow the security from a third party to fulfill its obligation.<p>To actually answer your question, is worth noting that Bob has to provide a collateral to Alice at 100% + some margin (from wiki) the value of the borrowed stock. So, in short (ha!), Alice sells Bob a bunch of shares with the idea that they will revert the transaction at a later date.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Short_(finance)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Short_(finance)</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Securities_lending" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Securities_lending</a>')
