Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608853597, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25531604, text='Well, UK citizens are no longer EU citizens.<p>But surely, BMW also simply knows when they sold that specific car thanks to their own records, no?<p>Like, imagine you were selling cameras, you sold someone a camera and then they come in to your store 5 years later with the same device - is it ok for you to ask &quot;hey, this device has an expired warranty, would you like to extend it?&quot; - you know this because as a seller, you have to keep a record of every device sold. You don&#x27;t even need to know the owner or any personal information about them - you just know that the camera in front of you has an expired warranty.<p>&gt;&gt;\nAnd the fact that you (the driver) have an expired warranty is private data.<p>Well I think that&#x27;s where the problem lies. It&#x27;s not the driver who has an expired warranty - it&#x27;s the car that does, and there&#x27;s nothing you can do, EU or not, to prevent BMW from simply knowing that a car they sold at point X only had a warranty for 3 years. They don&#x27;t need to know anything about the owner at all.')
