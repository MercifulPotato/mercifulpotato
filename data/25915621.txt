I was merely replying to this:<p>&gt; sharing users&#x27; personal data, something that influences only them<p>It does not influence only them, and I gave you an example.  Also, I don&#x27;t care what&#x27;s FB&#x27;s business model, I advocate that nobody should have an automatic right to build user profiles. I explicitly advocate that you should not have the right to demand payment in &quot;data&quot; because privacy should not be considered currency. Is that a strawman? I thought that was your entire argument &quot;people should be free to decide to pay with their data!&quot;. NO THEY SHOULD NOT. Data is not currency, just like votes are not currency. You ask for currency, if you need payment - you don&#x27;t ask for profile data.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s akin to &quot;women must vote&quot;.<p>Well, it&#x27;s an analogy, if you don&#x27;t find it useful, let&#x27;s drop it. The gist of it is, I feel very strongly that we should legislate that privacy is not currency, you seem to feel otherwise. It is fine to disagree, but it doesn&#x27;t make my position irrational or absurd in any way. Yes, I feel that allowing people to pay with privacy _is_ exactly &quot;taking their rights away&quot;, in the same way that allowing them to pay with their voting rights would be.')
