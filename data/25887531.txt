The VM subsystem is constantly modifying page table entries (PTEs). This PTE churn results in frequent translation lookaside buffer (TLB) flushes and many inter-processor interrupts (IPIs) to do so. These TLB flushes have a very negative performance hit.<p>Interesting. I was aware of various mmap limitations, but I didnâ€™t think about the TLB changes&#x2F;flushes, which obviously come with an important overhead.')
