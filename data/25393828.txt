Generally people expect some content to go with a link.<p>I also doubt most people on HN have the patience to wait for that site to load.  It took like a minute.<p>And of course it&#x27;s pro-Trump, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s only a small reason why it was flagged.<p>(Odd thing, I posted a comment to you earlier and it&#x27;s not visible except when I am logged in.  Hopefully at least you saw it.)')
