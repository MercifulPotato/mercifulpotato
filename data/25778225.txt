I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to compare the Taycan to anything Tesla offers except the new unreleased Roadster.<p>I haven&#x27;t personally driven it either, but that&#x27;s what I gathered from the reviews and spec sheet. Maybe after driving it I would change my mind, that&#x27;s certainly possible..<p>It&#x27;s also interesting that Bill Gates chose the Taycan as his first EV when he could have afforded anything he wanted.')
