Takeover of the power in the US? B-u-l-l-s-h-i-t.<p>&gt; People were chanting &quot;hang Mike Pence&quot;,<p>People chant a lot of shit. People were chanting &quot;hang Trump&quot; for four years, nobody ever called it an insurrection. Before that, they were chanting against Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc. Nobody ever has been hanged. Pretending not to understand the difference between chanting slogans and actually hanging somebody is silly.<p>&gt; And they did this, let&#x27;s reiterate, in an attempt to overturn the election.<p>There&#x27;s no possible way of overturning any election this way. It&#x27;s like I point a finger at you and say &quot;bang!&quot; and you&#x27;d claim I tried to murder you with a gun. It is literally impossible to change result of the election by jumping on a desk in a Congress. It was an act of protest, that went out of the way and grew violent, but it is no more insurrection than pointing a finger is gun violence. Let&#x27;s not mimic an idiot school principal that calls the police on a elementary schooler that shows the other kid a finger gun and complain about &quot;gun violence&quot;. There were no attempt to overthrow anything because it&#x27;s not possible to overthrow anything this way.<p>&gt; But words have meaning, and the word &quot;insurrection&quot; means precisely this.<p>Nope, the word &quot;insurrection&quot; means armed violent action in order to overtake the government, and this is no more insurrection than finger gun is a mass shooting.')
