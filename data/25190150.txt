The study definitely suggest a best-case scenario is viable. I do however think that the sample population of 183 subjects is too small to support the conclusion in the paper. The study only got a single sample from the majority of the participants andI couldn&#x27;t find any indication of how many subjects from each location participated (or which locations were included outside of California), which makes me think it might not be a representative population used<p>I also noted that 40 of the participants were excluded because they had no PCR test done to confirm covid and no antibodies were found in the assay. This is in my opinion a major flaw, as the subjects could have been infected, but had no antibodies left, when the blood sample was taken<p>Finally seven of the 18 authors declare competing interests, which might have affected the research<p>Getting back to your post itself, I agree that you can&#x27;t measure immunity for a longer period than the virus has been around, but that also means you can&#x27;t say that there will only be a need for one round of vaccines, which was what I was disagreeing with<p>It might very well turn out, that you gain permanent immunity for a specific strain off the virus, but unfortunately that immunity also introduces selective pressure. Whether the virus is able to mutate in a way that bypass existing antibodies in a subject is obviously still an unknown, but we have seen that it&#x27;s able to jump to other species like mink, which caused the emergence of the Cluster-5 variant<p>Since the virus is able to use other species as a reservoir and selective pressure is being introduced, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to prepare for a scenario, where a vaccine won&#x27;t be a permanent fix')
