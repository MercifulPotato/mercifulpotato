I&#x27;d love to fully separate work from personal notes for instance. It&#x27;s not that I can&#x27;t organize it in a way that makes sense. But if I am not at work, I really don&#x27;t want to see work. Clear separation of work and home matter a lot when you work from home. The more they blur together the worse it can get.<p>So, I&#x27;m stuck using Bear for personal use only because I don&#x27;t want to contaminate my personal time.')
