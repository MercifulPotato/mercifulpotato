From Wikipedia:<p>&gt; <i>A derivation of Dr Woo&#x27;s stochastic terrorism model was proffered by an anonymous blogger posting on Daily Kos in 2011 to describe public speech that can be expected to incite terrorism without a direct organizational link between the inciter and the perpetrator.[31][32] The term &quot;stochastic&quot; is used in this instance to describe the random, probabilistic nature of its effect: whether or not an attack actually takes place. And, although the actual perpetrator of a planned attack and its timing is not under the control of the stochastic terrorist, their actions nevertheless serve to increase the probability that a terrorist attack will occur.[33] The stochastic terrorist in this context does not direct the actions of any particular individual or members of a group. Rather, the stochastic terrorist gives voice to a specific ideology via mass media with the aim of optimizing its dissemination.[33]</i><p>So if &#x27;stochastic terrorism&#x27; is speech that will probabilistically inspire acts of violence when it reaches a large number of people, why can&#x27;t this be generalized to crimes other than terrorism?  If the (now banned) subreddit r&#x2F;shoplifting publishes messages glorifying shoplifting to a large number of people, it will likely inspire some portion of those exposed to commit these crimes themselves.  Does that make the subreddit a form of &#x27;stochastic theft&#x27;?')
