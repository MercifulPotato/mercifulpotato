The correct solution, according to our support contact, is that we wait a second after uploading to S3 to make sure at least the metadata has replicated to the EU before we post the image url. That, or pay for Redshift to tell us how long to wait more precisely.<p>Because contrary to what everyone expects, S3 requests to US buckets might be served by delayed replicas in other countries if the request comes from outside the US.')
