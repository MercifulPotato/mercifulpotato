I can&#x27;t move to a different cell, it just makes the whole sheet move around.&quot;<p>I scratched my head and thought to myself, &quot;Naw, it couldn&#x27;t be Scroll Lock. Could it? That keyboard doesn&#x27;t even have it.&quot;<p>After a quick search I suggested hitting the Windows key and typing &quot;keyboard&quot; to bring up the onscreen keyboard. Sure enough, ScrLk was lit up, and a quick tap on it brought things back to normal.<p>Turns out that Fn+K is the Scroll Lock toggle on recent ThinkPad keyboards, and Excel actually responds to Scroll Lock mode to scroll the sheet instead of moving the cursor to a new cell.<p>It&#x27;s a mystery how it got toggled in the first place, but my guess is that she meant to hit Ctrl+K and hit Fn+K by mistake.<p>And of course there is no indicator light or anything to let you know that the keyboard is in Scroll Lock mode. Thank you modern keyboards!')
