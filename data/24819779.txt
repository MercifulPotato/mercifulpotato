That is to say, it&#x27;s not true in any coherent sense.<p>Yes, the ad blocker needs to be trustworthy, and there are a variety of approaches for furthering that goal.<p>&gt; <i>Adblocker extensions need full access to all network traffic and all it takes is a single person&#x27;s account or machine to be compromised to get access to millions of browsers.</i><p>Again, you could say the same about the browser itself. Even if it were infeasible for extension developers to implement more security safeguards, that would be a flaw in the Chrome Web Store, not in the concept of web extensions.')
