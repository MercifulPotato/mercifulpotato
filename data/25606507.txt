So it&#x27;s headphones on most of the time. Now with all communications online through slack it&#x27;s been so much better. I now know what&#x27;s going on in my larger team and we have a much better &#x27;synergy&#x27;.<p>Unfortunately we will be going back and I&#x27;ll be back to the 90 minute commute, open layout and my headphones on. I really think a hybrid is the what to go. They already own the buildings and they are tight on space. So it works for them and for us it let&#x27;s us get together and plan things out and then go do the work remotely without the distractions.')
