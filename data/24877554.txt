Instead, its position is a distribution best thought of as a wave, or as a function of an underlying wave. You can interpret this as &quot;many worlds&quot; or you can interpret it as &quot;measurement matters&quot;, you get the same results either way. The speed of the particle is also not a single value, but rather a different function of the same underlying wave.')
