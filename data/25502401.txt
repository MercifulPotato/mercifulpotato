I have a kind of serial number, and different systems expect slightly different formats. One system likes dashes, one doesn&#x27;t, one system likes an extra two digits, while another system likes an extra four numbers. Should I write around n(n-1)&#x2F;2 pure function converters between n systems? Or one class with n methods? (If you&#x27;re curious, I&#x27;m talking about oil well API numbers. It&#x27;s not rocket science, I&#x27;m just curious what y&#x27;all think.)')
