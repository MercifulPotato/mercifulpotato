To put this straight, I am all in on free speech (which is one of our basic rights). Entirely independent on whether I agree with the content or not. However, at some point most countries realized that it is not okay to speak some things. Most of these things essentially revolve around planning to kill people, or violently fighting results of fair elections.<p>Yes, both is happening on the Internet for ages, and yes, it will always happen, no matter what. But the radicalization of the past years culminated in the events of the last days. We can either tolerate that and wait until these actions destroy our democracies (this effect is called the &quot;Paradox of Tolerance&quot;; if you don&#x27;t know it, look it up), or carefully act against it.<p>Asking Parler to moderate content to not call for violence and putting an end to spreading lies about the election result is legitimate and in the interest of all of us, it is such a careful act. Now Parler has the choice to become a platform for conservative thinkers and opionions - or a platform of hate fueling violence against &quot;others&quot;. Blocking the former would be grave mistake, as you say yourself. As for blocking the later, I think I made my point clear.<p>Over &amp; out, unless you make a really good counter argument.')
