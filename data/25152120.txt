I never jumped on the bandwagon and I feel increasingly miserable as the years go by.<p>You&#x27;d have heard 9 year old me saying he wanted to be a programmer. I went to university to study Computer Science because I love computing and computers and solving problems with them. I like writing programs that solve problems for people, and I like making existing programs better by fixing bugs, refactoring them to make them easier to work on, etc. That&#x27;s what I signed up for when I started my career.<p>The shift to the cloud sent everything to hell. Like I&#x27;ve said, I&#x27;ve been miserable for years now. I&#x27;ve spent the past week struggling to plumb shit on AWS and Kubernetes. Actual programming was maybe 10% of the task I&#x27;m working on, and it was just connecting library A to library B, basically.')
