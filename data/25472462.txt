Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[25473728], score=None, time=1608328028, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25471229, text='&gt; I think OP was trying to make a point that the entire investigative journalism industry can&#x27;t be replaced by freelance bloggers, not that freelance bloggers don&#x27;t add value.<p>That&#x27;s exactly it.  I elided some thoughts about sustainability from my comment, but I basically think reporting is so much more labor intensive than opinionating that no configuration of amateur or part-time bloggers can substitute for all the vital civic functions of a newspaper.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that bloggers can&#x27;t to real reporting, but when they do, by necessity it will have a far narrower topical focus and will either burn out an amateur blogger or force that blogger to professionalize and evolve their blog into something a lot like a traditional media organization.<p>Given how much easier opinionating is, I&#x27;d wager 99%+ of bloggers will stick to it (and other easy things like link aggregation) 99%+ of the time.  If you skim the cream, you could probably come up with something more-or-less comparable to a newspaper opinion page.')
