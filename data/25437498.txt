Sharing inside info on an ongoing incident is a great way to get fired. Big tech companies are way different than startups where everyone can do a bit of anything. There are people whose job it is to handle that communication. You make their job a lot harder if you disclose information. The company is so big that as an engineer you may not know all the factors involved in what would hurt the company long term - undisclosed relevant litigation, compliance commitments, partner obligations, etc.<p>How much do you hate it as an engineer when sales people make tech promises to customers without asking you? For comms people, engineers leaking info publicly feels the same way.')
