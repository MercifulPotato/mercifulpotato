NTF is probably on similar vesting schedule, but won&#x27;t fire himself. The fact they&#x27;re having these conversations means that NTF has probably made up his mind, and decided this is not going to end on mutually amicable terms.<p>It&#x27;s possible that TCF can hang on until the cliff, but I doubt that&#x27;ll happen, and it&#x27;s not going to be pretty if they do. There are all kinds of ways NTF can reduce&#x2F;destroy TCF&#x27;s equity; I&#x27;d take 3% and move on with my life.')
