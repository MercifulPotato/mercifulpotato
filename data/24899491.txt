All of those provoke an immune response. Whether it&#x27;s enough of the right immune response is found out in phase III testing.<p>Something is probably going to work. The big question is how well. A 50% effective vaccine might be an overall lose - only half are protected but more than that abandon masks and social distancing.<p>The Johnson and Johnson vaccine, if it works, is the easiest to use of the early leaders. One dose, and it doesn&#x27;t need to be refrigerated to dry-ice temperatures like some of the others. The Merck&#x2F;IAVI vaccine is only in phase I, but it&#x27;s a pill. If that works and is highly effective, it will be possible to wipe the virus out worldwide in a second round of immunizations.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;science&#x2F;coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;science&#x2F;coronavirus...</a> (or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;D6C68" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;D6C68</a>)')
