The trick is that this algorithm is in some sense &quot;generic&quot; over arbitrary data structures, so we were able to claim victory by tackling the simplest possible case. It was still a challenge in practice, since it required a lot of sneaky tricks and record (to our knowledge) two-qubit gate fidelities.<p>We&#x27;re also working with larger devices, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m supposed to comment on those right now :)')
