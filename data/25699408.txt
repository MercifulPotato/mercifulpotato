It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s very common elsewhere either.<p>No one had ever heard of WhatsApp once. But now billions of people use it, why?<p>I mentioned the new WhatsApp TOS to my tech and non-tech friends and I&#x27;ve managed to move all of those I&#x27;ve talked about it, or at least have them install it and get it set up. I still have to find a convincing argument for the least tech oriented people I know, but moving a billion people over to another app is done like that, one friend at a  time.')
