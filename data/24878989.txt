Eventually had to stop.<p>This happened gradually as I just couldn&#x27;t keep up the work.  Employer was annoyed with me for not doing more work.  I kept telling them I had to do other work because their pay didn&#x27;t cover my essential bills.  They kept telling me if only I would finish X, Y and Z we&#x27;d have more money coming in.<p>I took a risky bet and lost - as an employee.  I don&#x27;t resent it, they really couldn&#x27;t pay more.  But it was definitely a gamble.<p>That financial cost still has lingering effects years later.<p>Don&#x27;t assume employee #1 or #2 is not taking on a risk.<p>I&#x27;d still like to work at a startup!  But I&#x27;ll automatically turn down offers with low pay now, as well as offers of &quot;no pay at the moment until we get investment&quot; which I had some of this summer.')
