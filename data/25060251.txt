My ex and I did not have an acrimonious &quot;divorce&quot; and money was never an issue between us, but the mess and expense of divorce don&#x27;t seem worth it to us as long as we both trust each other (which we do).<p>I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll eventually get divorced once one of us gets a long term partner, but  I do think the trend for avoiding the legal system as long as possible is here to stay. I know one couple (or ex-couple, rather) that has been separated for over 5 years now.')
