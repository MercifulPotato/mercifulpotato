I just noticed that my ancient iPhone (5 or 6?) started adding digital artifacts to photos it takes.  These are tiny and easily ignored, as they just look like dust on the screen.  Upon zooming in, it is clearly a purple cartoonish figure, kinda like a genie.  I had a huge wtf moment today.  Where can I find out more what is going on?  I intend on replacing the phone right away.')
