I have always been much more willing to discuss openly those positions that I would describe as progressive.<p>This is despite the fact that over the years I have been living in more than a handful of different countries, each one with different cultural norms. So I think there must be some sort of general tendency, where conservative opinions tend to be disclosed less frequently. I don&#x27;t know why that is the case, and I would like to hear if anyone has an answer.')
