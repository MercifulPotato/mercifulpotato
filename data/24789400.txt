I&#x27;ve always brought my own tools - my Aeron, my preferred high-refresh monitors, a Linux dev machine where possible, my monitor arms, my IDE.<p>I have a good setup. I know it works.<p>It&#x27;s not as feasible to get my own standing desk in each time so I let that go. But they always give me everything and I just set them aside and use my (superior) tooling.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s paying the company. That&#x27;s just me buying tools that are optimal for me. I don&#x27;t really need each employer to do that for me. These things are mostly buy it for life (except for the desktop and IDE license).')
