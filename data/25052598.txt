If anything that&#x27;s an even better time to use Nix, because it means I only need to know one package manager instead of two. The setup I currently use on macOS could be dropped onto a Linux machine and I expect it would work with zero changes there, or I could switch over to home-manager (probably a good idea, I just haven&#x27;t done it for historical reasons). And if I don&#x27;t have a setup yet I could just use `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.pkgname` to install stuff the way people usually get started with Nix.')
