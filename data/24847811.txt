Item(by='HenryBemis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603287932, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24847604, text='It is like saying: &quot;I robbed a bank ang got away with $1m, all in $20 bills. The bank has the numbers of the bills I stole. I can no longer use these notes as they will be flagged&#x2F;raise an alarm if I try to deposit them in another bank.&quot;<p>Absolutely plausible scenario. If one stole $1m from a bank, the value of those bill are no longer $1m. But if that someone can use mules, distribute the money across the city (assuming a big city), ask the mules to spend this on the same day, in various locations, then the value of that $1m will drop to $500k. The reason: mules need a cut, mediators need a cut, value of items purchased, etc.<p>In that sense, I expect that those &quot;decentralized exchanges&quot; should have large fees, large spreads, etc, practically mimicking the cost of running a &#x27;mules&#x27; network.')
