If you start legislating which apps are allowed, you&#x27;re putting yourself even more at mercy of gov regulation.<p>And the regulation would be blanket, with little to no way of sorting things out through unofficial channels as it can be done with Google. It&#x27;d be &quot;backdoor or jail&quot;, not even sideloading apps to help you.')
