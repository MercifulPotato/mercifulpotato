The raw data (weekly mortality) is published by government on a weekly basis and I just explained to my sister how to download it into Calc or Excel or whatever and see for herself.<p>One of the recurring things with conspiracy theorists is that they aren&#x27;t in the least interested in fact checking. They&#x27;re engaged in a search only for reassurance that they&#x27;re correct, if you give conflicting data they keep searching but if any source will agree with them it must be right.<p>You probably shouldn&#x27;t add only 5% based on the remaining days. Deaths stats are frequently preliminary for weeks or even a few months as reporting itself may be delayed (in particular right now if you&#x27;re quarantined and a sick person passes peacefully regardless of cause what&#x27;s the point of breaking quarantine to do paperwork more quickly? They aren&#x27;t any more or less dead if you do the December 1st death paperwork on December 15th)')
