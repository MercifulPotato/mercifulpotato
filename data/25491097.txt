Essentially everyone would have some degree associated with them of how racist they are.<p>I propose the following question: are people who eat at Chik-fil-A anti-LGBT (specifically gay) rights because they financially support a business through continued purchases that support anti-LGBTQ activities? Probably not (some are, a lot of people... just like their chicken sandwiches). I&#x27;m LGBTQ and I occasionally eat one of their chicken sandwiches. Customers may be indirectly supporting systemic opposition of LGBTQ rights, but I think most average people aren&#x27;t looking at these n-th degree removed effects, nor could anyone be asked to all the time (I think consumers are being a bit too negligent on this front but that&#x27;s another story).<p>From a few studies I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s actually harmful to give small sums of money to homeless panhandlers because it perpetuates their situation where higher volumes of money and support services are needed to actually help them. Does that mean people who donate money to homeless people are trying to keep them homeless or cause harm, if that&#x27;s exactly what handing a panhandler a $20 bill does? Probably not.<p>We don&#x27;t have words for these types of biases (systemic or not), but if we did, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to claim anyone who has any n-th order contribution that sways a bias one way or another happens to be anti-whatever to the degree racists are against the basically fictional concept of &quot;race.&quot; Every action you take likely helps someone and hurts someone else and the same could be said about inaction.<p>Motive and intent are quite important IMHO. Both are incredibly difficult (if not impossible) to prove undeniably but the advantage of many racists is that they&#x27;re actually proud to be racist and tell you their intent.')
