Not only does it provide the people behind the projects better guidance, it also gives me a better idea how my own usage and opinions relate to the wider community.<p>Having said that, one thing I found remarkable from the results of this survey is the proficiency in ELISP. A sizable fraction of the respondents feel proficient enough to write their own packages, a trait which I have yet to find someone in real life for (and I know more than a dozen emacs users). I canâ€™t help but think there must be quite some selection bias going on in the respondents of this survey. :)')
