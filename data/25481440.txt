Item(by='inopinatus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608413754, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25474222, text='&gt; I think you should wear a helmet AND ride safely.<p>There&#x27;s a difference here; helmets are personal safety equipment, which is the proper approach: monitor and manage yourself, don&#x27;t rely on external barriers.  But did-you-know that a statistically significant proportion of drivers change their behaviour around riders wearing helmets? [1]  (That&#x27;s not a reason to not wear helmets, everyone should ATGATT; it&#x27;s a reason to change driver behaviour through other incentives).<p>We cannot deny the existence of moral hazards. If you want to nullify a well-understand, thoroughly documented, and strongly correlated statistical behaviour, something has to replace it.  Google would, apparently, prefer to cover a hard barrier with soft padding.  That might help ... until the padding catches fire.<p>To your example, writing to disk until the OS reports &quot;there are no more sectors to allocate&quot; just means no-one was monitoring the disk consumption, which would be embarrassing, since that is systems administration 101.  Or projecting demand rate for more storage, which is covered in 201, plus an elective of haggling with vendors, and teaching developers about log rotation, sharding, and tiered archive storage.<p>Actionable monitoring and active management of infrastructure beats automatic limits, every time, and I&#x27;ve always seen it as a sign of organisational maturity.  It&#x27;s the corporate equivalent of taking personal responsibility for your own safety.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drianwalker.com&#x2F;overtaking&#x2F;overtakingprobrief.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drianwalker.com&#x2F;overtaking&#x2F;overtakingprobrief.pdf</a>')
