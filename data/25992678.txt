When I want to get a new project of the ground, I use Django.<p>This partially due to the batteries included, partially  because I am very familiar with it.<p>On more mature projects, at the stage where I really start splitting services into their own hosts, I switch to something else. Django&#x27;s batteries are no longer useful at this stage, since e.g. auth is it&#x27;s own service now.')
