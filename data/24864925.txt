For example, the Google Assistant confirmation noise is ear-shatteringly loud and unpleasant.  Facing a similar problem twenty years ago I could&#x27;ve just found the noise&#x27;s audio file and deleted it, replaced it with something better, or even replaced it with a smaller-amplitude version of itself. In 2020 I can do absolutely nothing about this problem other than making my media volume so quiet I can&#x27;t hear the things I actually want.<p>My phone is mounted in the center of my dashboard but faces me in the driver seat. The phone&#x27;s compass senses this.  Google Maps senses this as well, and on a good day shows my arrow sliding sideways down the highway.  On a bad day it becomes convinced I am either driving down the highway in reverse or am actually in the opposite lane, and falls all over itself trying to recalculate my route.  I often fantasize about the compass being a plug-in unit that I could rip out and smash into powder with a hammer.')
