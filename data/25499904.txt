Having one display off to the side, without buttons, that does everything is an awful experience in a car.<p>This is both the most functional and most beautiful design choice I&#x27;ve ever experienced. My favorite part of my Model 3. You quickly come to realize that voice control does everything and that you should never have to reach for a button or fiddle with climate controls, etc.<p>Tesla realized what all other car manufacturers failed to see, you don&#x27;t need physical buttons because you don&#x27;t need buttons of any kind. I&#x27;m never buying another antiquated car with physical buttons again.')
