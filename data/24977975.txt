There&#x27;s no way to automate this. There&#x27;s also no way I know of to directly upload a takeout zip to another service and continue. There&#x27;s also a (generally long enough, except when you forget) time limit on downloads, as well as a download limit (have a crappy internet connection, and lost access to a file? Start a new takeout, wait for it to be available, and try again)<p>If takeouts could be configured to download automatically through Google drive, that would be amazing.')
