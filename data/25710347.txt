They need to be providing much more practical leadership guidance.<p>The ideological goals don&#x27;t need compromise -- but the practical reality is that our society _needs_ an organization like EFF to be at the forefront on these topics -- advocating for better abstractions to help shape how we as a society should think and deal with these complex issues.  EFF shouldn&#x27;t be effectively silencing itself by becoming a voice that just repeats platitudes.  This article to me felt like the right wing response to gun violence events &quot;we send our thoughts and prayers but let&#x27;s not politicize this tragedy&quot;.<p>In particular -- there are simple ways to avoid worry over the &quot;slippery slope&quot; associated with defining policies that apply different rules to different users -- you can espouse policy frameworks that are explicitly parameterized by impact (impact is a bit fuzzy to capture in truth but conceptually clear -- and simple proxies suffice to communicate the concept -- in most cases the number of followers is a reasonably close conceptual proxy for a social network).<p>If you have 70 million followers and you say &quot;let&#x27;s punish immigrants&quot; it&#x27;s just simply a different thing than if you say the same thing and you have 10 followers -- pretending there &quot;must not exist&quot; a different framework for responding to events that occur on such vastly different scales is not practical and it&#x27;s actually a failure to provide good advice here on an ideological level -- because we _know_ that these events are different and project meaningfully different risk profiles onto the world.<p>There is not a clear ideological reason to falsely pretend that &quot;the same thing&quot; is happening when two users with such vastly different impact publish the  exact same sequence of words ...  The threat model for &quot;danger of communication&quot; is based on impact and so should be the policy frameworks aimed at managing these risks.')
