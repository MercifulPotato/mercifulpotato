Item(by='hef19898', descendants=None, kids=[25538630], score=None, time=1608923840, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25536799, text='I had both, Amazon and as a defense contractor. Nothing ever would have prohibited me from talking about <i>how</i> work was, what I worked on was for obvious reasons easier at Amazon. But even in the contractor job it was no problem saying I worked on Integrated Logistics Support on aircraft. This was a far cry from being CIA, so.<p>That being said, I told people the comment thing more than once. Always to people I know and people that know me well enough to get the meaning. In other cases I just said I won&#x27;t answer certain questions. Much different than the bo comment trope.')
