This requirement seems to have been bypassed for potential covid19 vaccines, allowing the vaccine to be released faster, at the expense of not having time to test for the absence of any long-term side effects (e.g. if a side effect takes 2-3 years to manifest, it&#x27;s impossible to detect this with a trial that only lasts 6-12 months).')
