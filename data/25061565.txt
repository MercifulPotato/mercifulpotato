I&#x27;ve tried, through casual conversation, to get them to understand that you want to build a community around you for mutual benefit. From what I&#x27;ve seen it comes down to a few different things.<p>1. Some people have trust issues, possibly to a clinical level. They don&#x27;t trust their neighbors to not be zombies etc knocking at the door to take their stuff. Ironically, when you spread awareness of preparatory issues through community building, you reduce the chance of that happening.<p>2. Some people are overly focused on one or two particular scenarios and &#x27;optimize&#x27; their and preparations on those scenarios. E.g. A real-life neighbor has CBRN gear, firearms, and food but doesn&#x27;t have a chainsaw or basic hand tools.<p>Like most stereotypes, the lone preppper has some truth associated with it. It really comes down to definitions. I&#x27;m not prepared for TEOTWAWKI by any means, but if I lose my job, or we get hit with a hurricane, or my car dies, or my house burns down, I&#x27;ve got reasonable contingency plans for those. Am I a prepper?')
