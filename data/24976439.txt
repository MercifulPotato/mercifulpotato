Item(by='ralph87', descendants=None, kids=[24976491], score=None, time=1604379262, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24976378, text='&gt;  This entire post is just unnecessary fear-mongering.<p>You perhaps missed the bottom 30% suggesting there may be better options.<p>Docker&#x27;s registry protocol treats layers essentially as opaque slabs, as any user will no doubt be aware, where update of a single timestamp or byte of a file could mean the reupload (and download) of a potentially unlimited amount of data. While that architecture has its perks (simplicity, sequential IO patterns suited to the magnetic disks of 2013), there are obvious downsides.<p>We have plenty of systems just like Docker capable of managing Docker-like file counts without the obscene bandwidth abuse, we just don&#x27;t call them registries. They have names like Perforce, Subversion and even (some Microsoft variant) of Git. Eliminating the data gravity angle is impossible, but reducing its potency by several orders of magnitude is not only possible but has already been done repeatedly in many popularly deployed systems.<p>This is not to suggest replacing registry with Git, but perhaps some graph-like manifest format combined with some new &quot;fetch-multiple-objects&quot; protocol verb would be all required to bring the cost of running a registry down to essentially a non-issue.')
