Their loneliness makes them unique masters of their subjects, thereby nurturing their self-esteem. Knowledge remains in their heads and their presence becomes necessary for every decision.<p>In my experience, these are more often a pretender that comes from being the &quot;big fish in the small pond&quot; with self-esteem closely tied to the performance, and often nothing more than a facade to hide a underlying self-esteem problem.<p>Almost every person I&#x27;ve met that have showed &quot;genius&quot; qualities, (and 10 years later, shows in their track record) have been incredibly humble and spend a lot of effort explaining their thoughts, solutions and products to great length. At least at one point in their life they understood that behaving like mentioned &quot;genius&quot; by the author, leads to nothing and is a unproductive (pseudo-intellectual) behaviour. Even in academia.<p>So the authors point of &quot;Professional &gt; Genius&quot; is not really a university issue. If anything should be something one experience in a university, through peer interactions.  Maybe the top1% might go out without this insight, but sooner or later this will hit you. Not something one needs to focus in college, though.')
