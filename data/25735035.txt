The following tier-list is a sketch, but I think illustrates the idea:<p>Tier 1 (most intolerant): Suppress the out-group vigorously, including executions, torture, secret police, interrogations, etc.<p>Tier 2: Suppress the out-group violently (executions) any time they&#x27;re noisy, but don&#x27;t seek them out.<p>Tier 3: Disfavour the out-group, without permitting conversion.<p>Tier 4: Disfavour the out-group, permitting them to convert.<p>Tier 5: Disfavour the out-group socially and informally, but not in matters of enforced law.<p>Tier 6 (most tolerant): It&#x27;s illegal to disfavour the out-group.<p>The reason I mention this is that modern notions of religious tolerance target maximum tolerance (Tier 6 or whatever), but there&#x27;s a lot of variety through history.  For example, I think that persecution of Jews under the Romans was, in some cases, only because the Jews were unwilling to also in-form-only obey the dictates of Roman religion (2nd Commandment makes that tricky).  Contrast that with Nazi persecution of Jews, which was much more aggressive about seeking them out.  It&#x27;s worth it to identify that one of those is more tolerant than the other, even if we wish for our society to be more tolerant than either of those.<p>In that context, my understanding is that the Muslim law of the medieval period is pretty clear about tolerance, and that both Al-Andalus and Baghdad followed these rules.  &quot;People of the Book&quot;, i.e. non-Muslim monotheists, were granted a large set of very specific protections, while still being treated less well than Muslims.  (Note that non-monotheists were not granted protections; I imagine that this did not result in much religious tolerance towards those people, but that&#x27;s just a cynical guess.)  These specific protections were strong enough that it made sense for non-conformist scholars (Christian or Jew, as long as they were monotheist) to migrate from Christendom to Dar al-Islam.  Compared to modern west-coast notions of religious tolerance, this isn&#x27;t great.  But it&#x27;s still remarkable and praiseworthy, especially in contrast with modern Sharia, and in contrast with then-contemporary Christian kingdoms.<p>In summary: it&#x27;s not that medieval Muslim states were tolerant by modern humanist standards.  It&#x27;s that they were more tolerant than modern Sharia Muslim states, and more tolerant than medieval Christian states.')
