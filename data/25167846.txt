Their web app sucked. It literally took like 10 seconds just to show up! So many missing features and recommendation was worse than someone coded it up in weekend. I still stuck with them, keep paying them and keep suffering. Then they decided to migrate the damn thing to YouTube Music and everything became 10X worse overnight. Now somehow YouTube vides is same as my music! Simple features like proper playlist management were entirely missing. Obviously, lot of empire building is going on here.<p>So that was final nail in the coffin for Google Music. I moved everything to Spotify (thanks Soundiiz!) and realized what I was missing. I thought I would now unsubscribe and stop paying Google Music so someone up there will noice. Guess what? They had no way to unsubscribe for Google Music anymore because they rolled the whole thing to YouTube Premium. So upper management will never know that customer left in droves. The empire builders who are working in this part of Google are super smart but they only use their smartness in building empires.')
