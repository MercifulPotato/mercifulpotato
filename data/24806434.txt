I currently work as an engineer for a company like that, where engineering and product work very closely together. As engineers we&#x27;re expected to understand the business context behind everything we&#x27;re asked to build and we&#x27;ll often make suggestions or optimizations beyond what product suggested because we know the tech and the software well.<p>My point isn&#x27;t to try to force you to be an engineer or something - I have no skin in this game. Just saying that you may be able to find what you&#x27;re looking for before putting the software industry as a whole aside.')
