Item(by='908B64B197', descendants=None, kids=[25521987], score=None, time=1608755939, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25521760, text='Homework are great if you:<p>Are extremely prestigious or have compensation clearly above market rates.<p>Candidates only have so much time to dedicate to homework so they will sort companies and work on homework assignments from top to bottom.<p>Homework are easy to grade (some of that can be automated!) and low commitment from the employer side. But that low commitment sends a signal that the candidate isn&#x27;t really valued.<p>Having an on-site with engineers sends a much better signal as it tells the candidate he&#x27;s worthy of discussing with a real engineer on company time rather than some gradings software.<p>Of course, if your recruiting pipeline is very poor (low signal to noise ratio, majority of applicants can&#x27;t code) then sure, weed out with a homework assignment.')
