Item(by='save_ferris', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608215320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25450002, text='&gt; Having said that there might be some marginal benefit for FDA to have some data for which the FDA should incentivize users by asking them to give consent, offer discounts and promise anonymisation.<p>If the executive branch (which the FDA falls under) is so far beyond reigning in that we have to resort to disabling an important functionality of government instead of improving the check on power (which is where I believe the focus should be), then why would you assume that they&#x27;re being honest when they promise you that they&#x27;re anonymizing your data? You&#x27;re arguing that the executive branch is out of control but you&#x27;re willing to trust them if they promise to anonymize the data they collect? That makes no sense to me.<p>If you&#x27;re going to use the &quot;rogue administration&quot; argument, then how exactly does FDA, which falls under the executive branch, not fall into the same rogue behavior category?')
