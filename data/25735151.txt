This is the basic debate about government. This is why any technologist who hopes to influence the world should read deeply of history and the prior debates along these same lines.<p>The clearest guideline that I have seen is the Paradox of Tolerance, where we must stop some speech in order to make room for as many as possible. Fascists hate this, because fascists are the ones who demand total and perfect freedom to act and speak as the wish, up to the point of being allowed to perform violence on those whose speech they don&#x27;t like. Which is why the fascists were chanting &quot;Hang Pence&quot; as they stormed the capitol.<p>Don&#x27;t you dare try to accuse me of being arrogant for judging fascists, and don&#x27;t you dare accuse me of trying to be the ultimate arbiter of good and evil. I can name fascists as unacceptable to society without being an ultimate arbiter.<p>We are in dangerous waters in the US, and all our words mean something right now. Will we fall for the lies of the fascists who say &quot;let us violate all social norms with our speech, and we promise we woke take over with violence than force you to follow our norms with violence,&quot; or will we stand up to them and enable as open a society as we can?')
