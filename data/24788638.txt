You either have it or you don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s completely obvious to me that it&#x27;s ok for a product company like Apple to have industry &#x2F; journalism ties that they provide information ahead of time for a bigger launch day.<p>I could go essentially any situation with marketing and that&#x27;s what the ethics boil down to for me. It&#x27;s simply not good faith to rig voting on a social network. I hate it when my friends ask me to upvote their HN post just because they&#x27;ve asked and they know I&#x27;ve been around here a long time. But if they write a cool post and say &quot;hey if you like this spread it around a bit&quot; then that is fair and I&#x27;m happy to submit it to others here.<p>So to answer your original question: Yes, it really is less ethical and the continuum does not range from spammy to sophisticated. Spam can be quite sophisticated. They&#x27;re correlated, but they&#x27;re different measures and, really, a true master doesn&#x27;t employ these techniques because they&#x27;re playing a different, better game.')
