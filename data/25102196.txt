I find this article obtuse. Does McKinsey feel prestigious to me? Sure. That has nothing to do with James McKinsey inventing managerial accounting (in fact, internally, James McKinsey is rarely mentioned in discussions of company history). It&#x27;s because as a 20-something guy I can have discussions with fortune 100 CEOs about what I think they need to do. I think that&#x27;s pretty cool. A smaller boutique firm probably wouldn&#x27;t allow that. It&#x27;s not a huge deal at the end of the day though. Prestige is a loaded word that sounds snobby. If there&#x27;s any reason to seek prestige, its because having a prestigious experience tends to qualify you for more lucrative opportunities down the line via automatic respect and helpful connections.<p>Reasons why I think I made a good choice:<p>* Comp was pretty good. Consulting isn&#x27;t like ridiculous $200k+ salaries for new grads like FAANG, but its more than I need.<p>* Growth is very fast. In most companies, you need someone above you to leave or a new need to open up to get promoted. Consulting, as well as rapidly growing companies, don&#x27;t have this. You can advance as quickly as you are capable. I don&#x27;t know if that holds for finance (I think not?), but it probably holds for a decent while for big tech.<p>* The company has a vested interest in you doing well long term. When one wants to leave, they get a few weeks of paid time to do no work and find a new job, often with the help and support of senior colleagues with good connections. That is a wonderful benefit. If I want to leave, I have far more options available to me than if I had worked at most other orgs.<p>* I don&#x27;t do any work I perceive to be unethical, and am encouraged to decline serving clients I don&#x27;t want to serve without needing to justify it or fill out a form.<p>I&#x27;m happy with my job. I really don&#x27;t need people applying values judgments over why I would have made these choices. Job culture, especially in America IMO, is generally unhealthy. If you can legit say you&#x27;re happy with your job and it pays your bills, just stop the dialogue there, you&#x27;ve won, that&#x27;s great; pay no heed to those competing possible pasts that may have been better.')
