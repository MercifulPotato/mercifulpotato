They also don&#x27;t use macOS which has problems running at resolutions other than native or pixel-doubled. The suggested scalings are 1680 by 1050, 1440 by 900, and 1024 by 640. None of those are even fractions of the native resolution so the interface looks blurry and shimmers. Also, all the suggested scalings are very small so there isn&#x27;t much screen real-estate.')
