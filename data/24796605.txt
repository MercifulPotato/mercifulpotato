You can&#x27;t have it both ways or switch positions just because you ended your paragraph.<p>Did you ever consider that all of this shit is free and you&#x27;re just an entitled idiot spouting contradicting rhetorics backed by cherry picked examples&#x2F;data and strawman arguments?<p>You can&#x27;t sue the news stand that sold you a news paper that turned out to contain liablous statements about you because they didn&#x27;t write. You also can&#x27;t expect a company providing free services to hire enough support staff to cater to the individual problems of 2 billion people. And finally, the fact that you like the average consumer only used one or two major online communities is why you don&#x27;t have alternatives when it comes to accessing original content. In short, people have behaved like people and your oxymoronic tiraid is neither insightful or helpful.')
