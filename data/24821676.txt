The curvature of spacetime means the thing I&#x27;m measuring position against is moving relative to me (c.f. the example of two people walking in parallel across the Earth, nevertheless eventually meeting: the curvature means that even though neither of them is measuring an acceleration, nevertheless they are accelerating towards each other), so I need to have some internal (&quot;proper&quot;) acceleration of my own to counteract the fact that our geodesics are moving away from each other.')
