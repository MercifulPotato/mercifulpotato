How do you even know 100% of Nazis were there?<p>I work in tech and have been trained to use appropriate languages and avoid generalization.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt there are people who support nazis there. But how do you know all of them support nazis?<p>This person who said &quot;nazis are about&quot; is absolutely being inappropriate. Is it a fireable offense? I have no idea.<p>If someone said &quot;looters are about&quot; during BLM, they would be canceled so hard. (yes, many BLMs support looting, well, it&#x27;s just property not people. Some even supports looting the shops who support BLM because protest must cause inconvenience! the worst strategy I&#x27;ve ever heard of)<p>At the current state, it would be better to forbid talking about politics at work because one side is given so much free pass to exaggerate and generalize.')
