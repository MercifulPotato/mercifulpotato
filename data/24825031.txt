Because in the meantime, theater has become &quot;televised performance&quot;, concern has become &quot;album or stream&quot;, etc.<p>So they get a better performance but not exactly the same thing as before...<p>And lots of the magic is in the moment and the interaction with the live audience and in the volatility of the experience...<p>I think that the end result is not that it&#x27;s &quot;awesome for everyone who enjoys art&quot; but that people consume art more conveniently and disposably, and (most of it) enjoy it less.')
