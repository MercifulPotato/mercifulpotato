Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606333149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25212718, text='&gt; I wonder where anti-abortion people come down on this.<p>I don&#x27;t think it matter whether you are pro-abortion or anti-abortion since it&#x27;s a chicken we are talking about. The abortion debate is about human life. Why post such flamebait?<p>&gt; In their view, isnâ€™t destroying the male egg the same as culling the male chick?<p>Fundamentally, a male chick dies&#x2F;ceases to exist&#x2F;etc.<p>I&#x27;m &quot;pro-abortion&quot; but the problem with fundamentalists like you is that you give everybody a bad name. Stop trying to turn everything to push your agenda.<p>Would you be okay with someone stepping on an egg with a male chick inside it? Probably not. Does it make pro-abortion view hypocritical? Not really. Because at the extremes, things get uncomfortable for both sides of the argument.')
