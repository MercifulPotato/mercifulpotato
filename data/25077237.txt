Nonetheless, being obese or unattractive is a surmountable obstacle. One may have to take more interviews, but will ultimately find work. Moreover, those who are neither obese nor unattractive almost certainly have their own disadvantages they had to overcome. It&#x27;s rare to find people who are successful and literally had no obstacles in life. Obstacles are an opportunity to learn persistence, diligence, and what we are and aren&#x27;t suited for. Having zero obstacles might simply mean that a person simply has few ambitions.<p>For me, the discussion ultimately leads to two points:<p>First, do we believe that the playing field must be leveled for all from birth. If the answer to that is Yes, then you&#x27;re probably in favor of socialism to some degree, such that opportunity is provided in equal measure to all citizens, regardless of the circumstances they are born into. Personally, I don&#x27;t find this realistic, but I accept that there are people who do and that&#x27;s fine.<p>Second, if you don&#x27;t feel the playing field should be leveled from birth, but rather that every citizen is born with a set of advantages and disadvantages, then the question is, do we need to afford special attention to those whose disadvantages are insurmountable? Regardless of whether you&#x27;re born dull or smart, attractive or unattractive, African or Asian American, most Americans can find success in life by making more good decisions than bad and persistently working towards the life they&#x27;d like. We have had a 2 term black president, have a black woman vice president, an openly gay presidential candidate, an openly gay cabinet member, multiple black Fortune 500 CEOs, openly gay entertainers, and many wealthy black athletes and entertainers. Achieving success is possible for all, some have to work harder at it than others.<p>But is such success possible for all? It&#x27;s obvious to me that the answer is no. I am not referring to those with disabilities, but rather those whose life circumstances guarantee they have zero chance at success as defined in the US today. A kind of worst case situation might be a child born into a one parent household, parent is addicted, and neglects them. They live in the worst school district in the city, and in an area ruled by street gangs. What forces would enable an 8 year old in such circumstances to somehow push through all of that adversity and actually wind up in a college earning a degree that enables him to get a steady professional job? Or expose him to an opportunity to learn a trade, such as electrician or plumber? Or work up the ladder in food service or retail companies? In many cases, he&#x27;s exposed to drugs, persistent gang violence, likely frightened for his life most of the time and learning that survival means physically subduing others or being subdued by them. Many life lessons about discipline, team work, &#x27;social skills&#x27;, and earning what you want are not modeled to such a child, and I&#x27;d not be surprised to learn there are 100s of thousands of them in America right now.<p>My view is that if we are going to maintain the approach that hey, we all have advantages and disadvantages, we must recognize that groups faced with insurmountable obstacles to success need an effective accommodation or we are failing overall as a society.')
