And it makes sense. It&#x27;s not anyone reviewing the app, it&#x27;s people mass 1-starring the app because they decided to do so as a hive-mind. It&#x27;s essentially fake reviews and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s automated.<p>Also, as far as I gather, people who wrote a human-like text review to go with their rating didn&#x27;t get their review removed.')
