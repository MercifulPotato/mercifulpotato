Item(by='iaw', descendants=None, kids=[25134101], score=None, time=1605681173, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25133465, text='&gt; &quot;Iran says its nuclear programme is entirely for civil nuclear purposes.&quot; There has been no evidence that they&#x27;ve had a nuclear weapons program post 2009.<p>Iran had a 2-3 month breakout period in 2013 [0]. Stockpiling enriched uranium after stating a desire to wipe a particular country &quot;off the map&quot; seems to imply that there was more going on than civilian nuclear weapons.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s pretty rich to criticize Iran for foreign meddling when describing a US assassination taking place in a country on the other side of the globe.<p>US, Russia, and to a lesser extent China meddle the most in foreign affairs across the world.  Hell, the US quite literally caused the current Iranian regime to come into existence through foreign meddling.  What&#x27;s your point? This doesn&#x27;t convince me Iran should be refining Uranium.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.armscontrol.org&#x2F;issue-briefs&#x2F;2020-08&#x2F;limits-breakout-estimates-assessing-irans-nuclear-program#:~:text=Fluctuations%20in%20Iran&#x27;s%20Breakout,at%20about%202%2D3%20months" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.armscontrol.org&#x2F;issue-briefs&#x2F;2020-08&#x2F;limits-brea...</a>.')
