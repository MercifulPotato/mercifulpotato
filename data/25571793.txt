Think of any number of 8-bit games where the game is 95% hack-and-slash, but a random villager tells you before the last boss fight, &quot;You must make sure to wear the <i>enchanted amulet</i> in order to pierce the dragon&#x27;s scales!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s one throwaway line, but if the line is in Japanese, an American playing an imported ROM might spend an hour of frustration wondering why his sword does zero damage to the final boss.')
