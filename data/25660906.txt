Item(by='phkahler', descendants=None, kids=[25660944, 25661418], score=None, time=1609959567, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25660754, text='&gt;&gt; My understanding, based on the article, is that a normal processor, we would have expected arr[idx] + arr[idx+1] and arr[idx] to take the same amount of time.<p>That depends. If the two accesses are on the same cache line, then yes. But since idx is random that will not happen sometimes. He never says how big array[] is in elements or what size each element is.<p>I thought DRAM also had the ability to stream out consecutive addresses. If so then it looks like Apple could be missing out here.<p>Then again, if his array fits in cache he&#x27;s just measuring instruction counts. His random indexes need to cover that whole range too. There&#x27;s not enough info to figure out what&#x27;s going on.')
