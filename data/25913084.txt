It&#x27;s all nasty stuff like FOGBANK that if you could remanufacture, you wouldn&#x27;t need to steal a nuke in the first place.<p>&gt; What&#x27;s there to vary anyway? Charge voltages, and discharge timing? Odds would be you could probably make it go boom in a more controlled manner than what happened in past accidents when the bombs exploded after hitting the ground.<p>Yep, nanosecond precision detonation on the shaped charges, and not just &quot;all at the same time&quot;, but a very specific sequence that&#x27;s dependent on the exact geometries, isotopes and these days, how they&#x27;ve decayed over decades.  That&#x27;s what Oak Ridge uses those fancy super computers for.<p>&gt; The trouble would be getting past the tamper-proof barrier, because the modern bombs are probably made to self-destruct, from what I&#x27;ve read, so instead of a nice ready-made bomb internals waiting for a simpler arduino control circuit for a fireset, you&#x27;d be dealing with a hot mess, after trying to get in.<p>They are very much not designed to self destruct.  Really the opposite.  And yes, the threat model is that without the codes, you leave someone with components that they essentially have to remanufacture into a new bomb, which takes a well funded state actor.  Or they just use the bits as a dirty bomb, which is why that gets so much play in the age of terrorist cells.  But you don&#x27;t get a full on usable nuke by just sticking a microcontroller on a stolen bomb.')
