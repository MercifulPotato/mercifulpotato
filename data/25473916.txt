It surprises a lot of people that the law on parody hinges on whether the humorous target of the parody is <i>the work it itself is parodying</i> or something else.<p>From the ruling, quoted in the article:<p>&gt; ’Boldly’ is not a parody. ComicMix does not seriously contend that ‘Boldly’ critiques or comments on ‘Go!.’<p>When most people think of parody they think of things like Weird Al Yankovic songs (as this article mentions), which definitely don&#x27;t critique or comment on the songs they&#x27;re based on - <i>Eat It</i> says nothing about <i>Beat It</i>; <i>The Saga Begins</i> doesn&#x27;t have anything to say about <i>American Pie</i>. And of course it doesn&#x27;t actually matter: somewhat famously, Weird Al actually licenses the songs he uses in his &#x27;parodies&#x27;, and doesn&#x27;t rely on the &#x27;right to parody&#x27; at all.<p>But the layman&#x27;s meaning of parody persists. Weird Al&#x27;s own FAQ says:<p>&gt; Al does get permission from the original writers of the songs that he parodies. While the law supports his ability to parody without permission, he feels it’s important to maintain the relationships that he’s built with artists and writers over the years.<p>(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weirdal.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#:~:text=Al%20does%20get%20permission%20from,and%20writers%20over%20the%20years" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weirdal.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#:~:text=Al%20does%20ge...</a>.)<p>So it&#x27;s maybe not surprising that there&#x27;s a pretty broad cultural understanding that &#x27;parody&#x27; means &#x27;transforming something copyrighted in a way that&#x27;s sort of funny&#x27;.<p>I mean, the Wikipedia article for <i>The Saga Begins</i> literally starts:<p>&gt; &quot;The Saga Begins&quot; is a parody song by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. It parodies &quot;American Pie&quot; by Don McLean...<p>But the law disagrees. It&#x27;s not a parody in the sense of parodic &#x27;fair use&#x27;. As far as copyright law is concerned, it&#x27;s a derivative work, and Don McLean can dictate the terms under which Weird Al is allowed to publish it.')
