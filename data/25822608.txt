It’s a Scarlett letter that devalues your opinion or your existence.<p>In other words, calling them a moron (which I’ve done already) for believing in qanon is no different than calling them ‘not so smart, look no college degree’ when they bring up immigration policy concerns. What difference does it make to them at this point, or further, to us? They’ve been exiled from the discussion and they feel that way.<p>This will manifest in some way.')
