Yyes, the expectation was the Feds would not use the Pension Benefit Guarantee System to salvage something but actually fund them with tax dollars. The PBGS should be the default solution but is not a friendly solution as benefits are generally brought back from silly levels.<p>The issue with many public pension systems is that too many payouts are excessive. No pension system, notably no public, show being paying out six figure retirements in addition to health benefits. California had to use a law to cap theirs around 125k but that has faced numerous challenges and may see more in the future.<p>They do deserve their retirement pay but it needs to be reasonable and equal across the board to best serve the public and employee interest. The lower paid employees are not well served and the managerial and certain others are over compensated in retirement.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.illinoispolicy.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;pension-apocalypse-covid-19-exposes-long-running-fragility-of-illinois-public-pensions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.illinoispolicy.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;pension-apocalypse-co...</a>')
