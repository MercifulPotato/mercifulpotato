Item(by='toyg', descendants=None, kids=[25747870], score=None, time=1610463236, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25746925, text='I reckon electoral maps are fundamentally useless when most districts are gerrymandered to the wazoo.<p>They also do not reflect movements that are fundamentally leninist in organization, where a small cohesive nucleus of activists defines the agenda and directs action. Without a Fox News stoking and directing anger, there is no &quot;red rage&quot;, and Fox people are urban people. Without someone running 4chan, there is no Anon&#x2F;QAnon, and the likes of 4chan are run by urban geeks. Trump always defined himself as a proud NewYorker. And so on and so forth.<p>What is true is that nowadays people can live in socially-isolated bubbles that do not communicate with other bubbles. This is not a function of geographical location, though, but hyper-personalized media consumption. It happened already in the 70s on the left, for example, where people who only read &quot;alternative&quot; media could not understand how their points of view where not as hegemonic as they thought. Now it&#x27;s just spread to everyone thanks to the web: at some point you&#x27;ll gravitate to a media bubble and probably stay there forever.')
