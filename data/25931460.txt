Which probably explains why the benchmark isn&#x27;t very different between the 35W and 15W configurations. The processor probably just draws 42W for the duration of the benchmark in both cases. I don&#x27;t know if comparisons to the Apple M1 are apples-to-apples (no pun intended) which tops out at like 20-25W.<p>That said, AMD&#x27;s offering in this space is very impressive and really makes you question what Intel has been doing the last three years.')
