Steve Bannon knows what words he said, he used the Facebook platform to repeat those words, and he is not a nobody but an individual who rose to prominence and is a former senior White House official, in fact, he was among the most senior one can be, on par with the chief of staff with privileged access to the President and the National Security Council. Whatever you think of him and how he may have fallen, he has a platform and he speaks to many millions of people and his words carry weight.<p>I am reminded yet again of a Jean-Paul Sartre quote from <i>Anti-Semite and Jew</i>:<p>&quot;Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play.<p>&quot;They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.&quot;<p>Here are the receipts: Facebook post here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;SteveKBannon&#x2F;posts&#x2F;376710023761776" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;SteveKBannon&#x2F;posts&#x2F;376710023761776</a><p>archive.org snapshot here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201106185230&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;SteveKBannon&#x2F;posts&#x2F;376710023761776" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201106185230&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faceb...</a><p>Here&#x27;s the text of that post in case it is removed:<p><pre><code>    [BREAKING] On www [dot] PopulistPress [dot] com -\n    *Steve Bannon Under Massive Attack*\n    - Steve Bannon Under Attack\n    - Steve Bannonâ€™s Twitter Account Suspended After Calling for Execution of Dr Fauci and FBI Director Wray\n    Get your news NOW - Bookmark www [dot] PopulistPress [dot] com</code></pre>')
