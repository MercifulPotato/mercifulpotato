Sweeped surveillance (which is usually SIGINT) is not minded, and often the backbone of programmes such as Five Eyes relies on that. Targeted surveillance (SIGINT cases that I mentioned) and espionage (mostly HUMINT) is frowned upon. HUMINT is especially frowned upon since it means you&#x27;re actively investing in recruiting citizens against their government, and the intel is usually much more valuable and more expensive to garner. HUMINT Intel isn&#x27;t practiced between staunch allies either, but maybe between uneasy allies and enemies.')
