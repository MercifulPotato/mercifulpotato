As you said, to them it&#x27;s all about what people &quot;deserve&quot;, and that ideology is one of the most fundamental and powerful poisons in societies - a part of the id that civilized nations seek to keep out of the government&#x27;s decisions. It&#x27;s something straight out of the dark ages. I would never blame a person who wanted to inflict suffering on somebody who personally wronged them gravely enough, but to want that emotion enshrined in the system is immoral in the most extreme way. On this topic, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unnecessarily dramatic or ad hominem to say that the viewpoint of many Americans is evil.')
