But upon reading deeper I see that accessing the kernel is kinda appropriate.<p>Regardless of whether you end up using eBPF or a .ko like you already have, you may have a yet simpler option.  By leveraging the loader you can do an interposition trick with LD_PRELOAD to hook C library accesses. Maybe this is all you need in order to &quot;help students understand system calls such as open, close, dup2, fork, pipe, and others. &quot;<p>Just a suggestion. Carry on, good show.')
