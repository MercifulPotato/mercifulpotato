However, this can lead to deadlocks&#x2F;timeouts if both P1 and P2 are attempting to perform this operation at the same time.<p>And once you&#x27;re into 3 or more processes, message passing as a method of synchronization breaks down.<p>Ideally you avoid this stuff with your design.  But since processes fill so many roles you can&#x27;t always avoid it.')
