So far nothing was reported to me as being against their ToS and I think it&#x27;s fine as it is. This guide does not endorse&#x2F;support anything unlawful in Germany. If that guide is used by anyone outside of Germany, they should check their local laws before. As for the code of conduct, the current &quot;no code of conduct&quot; approach is only meant to say that I have nothing to add besides the GitHub ToS which anyone has to agree to before signing up anyway. The guide also specifically states it&#x27;s not meant for use for any unethical&#x2F;unlawful activities of any kind and some sections of the guide have been limited.')
