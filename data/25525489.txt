And thats just from warehouses.  Extend that to AWS and Whole Foods and it&#x27;ll be hard to maintain any sympathy.<p>Amazon was already getting their tentacles on everything before covid, and now its just amplified.  I&#x27;d love to see this be the motivator that encourages people to rise up against their overlords, but it&#x27;s going to end up like the people that protest by blocking freeways.  It just pisses off the people trying to go about their lives, and works against the cause.')
