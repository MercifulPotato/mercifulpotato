I always thought that to use a professional designation, you need to have professional qualification. Is there any laws&#x2F;regulations&#x2F;bodies that govern use of title of &#x27;engineer&#x27;? I am interested to know, apart from learning to program and developing&#x2F;designing software solutions, what makes a software engineer an &#x27;engineer&#x27;?<p>Or is there a career path one has to take. After how many years in industry a person can start to call himself an engineer?<p>PS: Also curious what&#x27;s the nuances of distinction between a Software Developer Vs Engineer?')
