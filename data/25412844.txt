Item(by='cgriswald', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607912694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25411860, text='Where I live, drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians are all insane. When I’m driving I don’t trust any of them. When I’m walking, I don’t trust any of them. I don’t bike here because I don’t want to die. My fifteen minute, five mile commute is never completed without witnessing egregious violations.<p>My city seems dedicated to making the roads as deadly as possible. Rather than having bicycles go down a parallel road, they gave them a bike lane on the main road. Thing is, there is no real benefit to bicyclists to be on that road versus a parallel road. <i>I</i> wouldn&#x27;t bike on that road for pay. The city also added speed bumps. So idiot drivers drive into the bike lane to go around the bumps. The same city has changed left + straight lanes to be left only and right only lanes to be right + straight. This has the effect of &quot;no turn on red&quot; which should reduce danger to pedestrians... but the lanes don&#x27;t always line up, sometimes there are near collisions because people think they are in the straight lane or because people turning an unprotected left in the opposing traffic think they are in a turn lane (and indicators are optional).<p>I could rant on for pages.<p>I don&#x27;t know the solution. I now drive first for my own safety, second to limit my own liability, and third for the safety of others. I equate that with giving up. But on one side are idiots that think the road should be built just for them and on the other side are well-meaning idiots that remove the double yellow lines because drivers slow down.  One thing I <i>do</i> know is that pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers should be kept physically separate wherever possible.')
