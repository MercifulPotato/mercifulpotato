Even if it wasn&#x27;t their intention, they still messed up, and that onus remains on their head.<p>Either way you look at it, those &quot;fine people&quot; are not fine -- they propped up white supremacists, culminating in the brazen murder of an innocent, non-violent counter-protestor and the random assault of numerous others. Even if they didn&#x27;t know, their actions contributed to that, and they are to blame as are the outspoken racists. What you are saying is, &quot;those people had the privilege to join that march and support those sentiments because they are not threatened by what the march explicitly represents.&quot; This is an inherently racist mode of interacting with the world, because it opens avenues for racist violence and oppression, and emboldens more outspoken racists to commit atrocities.<p>Again, intention matters little when lives are at stake. Your argument enables the banality of evil to persist.')
