We really, really suck at diversity. Weâ€™re getting better, but we have a long way to go. Most of the industry chases the same candidates and assesses them in the same way.</i><p>I would pass this buck way, way earlier. Many diverse future candidates (non-white) are educated at awful public schools. When you begin your education at a miserable daycare-school then you are far less likely to make it all the way through the life-pipeline and get in front of a high tech recruiter. I have hired diverse candidates and they are great just like all candidates I hire. There simply aren&#x27;t that many that apply, and the pool of diverse candidates is sucked up by way better-funded FAANGs and similar.<p>I would argue we need to completely reinvent our primary education system from the ground up to offer more choice and make them way less depressing for lower-income students. You can&#x27;t expect a tech recruiter to fix 2 decades of mistakes through their hiring system.')
