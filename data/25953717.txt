Not as big as the Dolmetch collection at the Horniman. Also some lovely pre-raphelite and other notable design pieces, furniture, old fabrics. Great museum to wander in. Never regretted time spent there. And the archivists are really nice people. Well worth talking to.<p>One of the best cafe for casual student-affordable dining in the area. I meet people there all the time, when in London (I live overseas) because its friendly, cafeteria, budgetable if they want to &#x27;shout you&#x27; a meal. Crowded.')
