Every Monday, I have one morning call and one afternoon call scheduled with a pal — eight calls &#x2F; pals per month. I don&#x27;t even try to do deep work on Mondays — I just do small clerical tasks and other ad hoc calls. I go into the rest of the work week socially sated, and disconnect for a few days of deep work (ideally). I explained when proposing these recurring calls that I&#x27;m trying this to get a handle on my anxiety (which random interrupting calls don&#x27;t help). Not for everyone, but I&#x27;m excited about it.')
