The only way you can argue Parler being kicked out of AWS is right and Parler shouldn&#x27;t be able to operate is if you think those sites should be shut down too.<p>With some of the comments I&#x27;ve seen here, honestly, this site gets close sometimes too.<p>Anybody want to talk about BDS? Because that&#x27;s certainly advocating for violence and the death of lots of Jews and it&#x27;s very popular among the Justice Democrats and their followers, just as an example. They consider it justified violence, just like the article &quot;In Defense of Looting&quot; did, but proponents of political violence always consider themselves justified. That was published by NPR, so I guess they should be shut down too, right?<p>Or is this actually about silencing a specific kind of political speech and not really about violence at all? That seems more likely to be.<p>The violence at the Capitol is just an excuse to silence political opponents.')
