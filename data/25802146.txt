Most manufacturers only license cores and adjacent IPs, with no possible &quot;tweaks&quot; or the license with minimal &quot;tweaks&quot;. However, my understanding is that apple has an &quot;ISA&quot; architecture, where they basically can do whatever they want, since they can build a custom CPU that uses the ARM ISA, whereas Samsung for example, can only &quot;tweak&quot; the cores.<p>Basically, Apple doesn&#x27;t use core IP and &quot;only&quot; licenses the ISA (which is far more expensive if my memory is not lying) and so they can do whatever they want.')
