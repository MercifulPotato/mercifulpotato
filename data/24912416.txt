Like you say, don&#x27;t move too far away from the intended space, but the LoB (line of business) space is <i>vast</i> for big enterprises and that&#x27;s what these tools are for. There is no need to do 100% as you can get to 80-90% and the rest you don&#x27;t do with those packages; you do with code. Why is that a problem; you use different frameworks &#x2F; languages &#x2F; dbs &#x2F; etc with code too; these systems are no different; use them what they are meant for and do the rest with other tools. Ofcourse there is more than enough work to be had just creating departmental LoB apps to last you 1000s of lifetimes, but that&#x27;s another story.<p>So like you said; I believe you still need to be a dev to deliver with these systems; &#x27;end user programming&#x27; is not close outside Excel. People who know nothing about programming will generally make complete monsters with these systems, even after training (I saw it a lot with Outsystems when I click open a business flow).<p>Real enduser development revolutions we won&#x27;t see this low-code wave, maybe the next somewhere around 2030?')
