This was <i>very</i> strange given that this company has a machine learning platform, so either this engineer did not use it, or they did not use it that much.<p>We were talking about our machine learning platform and taking it for a spin. We do have long-running notebook scheduling[0] but we wanted to be able to watch the notebook&#x27;s output from multiple devices as it was running, and for it to survive closed tabs or network disconnections, not just get the results once it&#x27;s done. We also wanted to be able to do that right from the notebook&#x27;s interface, instead of SSH&#x27;ing and all that, as this was tedious and some of our users aren&#x27;t that comfortable doing that.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#long-running-notebooks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#long-running-notebooks</a>')
