It&#x27;s easy to see the consequences of a coup for social media companies like Twitter that had been partially shutting down Trump for months, not to mention how devastating it would be for the country&#x27;s economy.<p>So in a way social media companies are setting a precedent to ban politicians and organization leaders that they deem a threat to them or to &quot;democracy&quot;. Hopefully it won&#x27;t become a trump card to ban innocent users.')
