From Coinbase&#x27;s perspective, I just owe them $10 USD + maybe interest at the end of some fixed time period. I could pay them in USD or I could pay them in crypto. Since it&#x27;s not mandated I pay in crypto, you can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;ve &quot;spent&quot; my crypto until I use it to pay off my balance. In which case you only end up with 12 taxable events per year.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some arbitrage opportunity I&#x27;m not accounting for, but it seems like this might work?')
