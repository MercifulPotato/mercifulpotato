He uses an example of peacock but I use a different example.<p>For instance, cats have an evolutionary behavior which makes them cover their leftover food, to hide their tracks from prey (called &#x27;caching&#x27;). If you have a cat living in your apartment, then you will see them try to cover their food with imaginary dirt [1].<p>If Cats developed rational ability, and you asked them why they were doing it on a hardwood floor, they might say &quot;I do it because I give my food back to earth, this helps me procure my next meal&quot;, or &quot;I do it because I am thanking the cat gods for giving me that food&quot;, or even &quot;because I am cleaning my paws after eating by rubbing them on the ground right next to the bowl&quot; or something other funny like that.<p>Same thing goes here. Evolutionarily speaking, we evolved to chase food and satiate the hunger. What happens if we are constantly &#x27;full&#x27;, well evolution doesn&#x27;t really know much about that. There has been no natural conditions under which a creature is full all the time, however there are situations when a creature is hungry all the time.<p>If you are going to create a situation in which you&#x27;re &#x27;full&#x27; all the time (as you described &#x27;good by most measures&#x27;), then you&#x27;re pushing your mind in an uncomfortable situation where it doesn&#x27;t know what to do. It&#x27;s like if earthquake survivor sniffing dogs don&#x27;t catch survivors for some time then they get depressed, so their handler has to make them sniff out fake survivors to make them feel better.<p>In a nutshell, you&#x27;ve eliminated your hunger, and now your mind doesn&#x27;t know what to do. Reintroduce hunger. Not necessarily literally, but it would be the easiest, most practical way of doing it. I&#x27;ve been facing a similar problem for past few years, and my solution was to leave the comforts of the first world as an immediate measure and it made a big difference.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;vxpe3V0pspM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;vxpe3V0pspM</a>')
