Even when Intel was beating AMD by 30% or more it still took years for AMD percentages to drop.<p>AMD EPYC on AWS is 10.42% cheaper than Intel per hour across the board for m5 instances (9.6% cheaper for t3 instances). 7nm EPYC saves more than 10% power vs Intel 14nm and per-chip savings from buying AMD are way more than 10% vs similar Intel offerings. Why can Amazon spike prices that much? Because people will pay and still consider it a deal.<p>AMD&#x27;s main issue still seems to be available due to do much competition for 7nm and tsmc being reluctant to build new fabs.')
