It wouldn&#x27;t really make sense to travel to another solar system just to get resource that you could obtain in your own. Even if they lack something in their own solar system, they could get it from other uninhabited solar systems without needing to trade locals. Ideas are what could be valuable in trade. If it is them visiting us rather than the other way around odds are they have more advanced technology than us so that isn&#x27;t something they would need to trade. Our culture, what we sent on Voyaer, seems like it would be of the most interest to them. They might have entirely different senses than us (lacking sight, seeing different frequnecies, hearing different frequencies) that would make our &quot;culture&quot; something that wouldn&#x27;t be enjoyed directly by them. Really as I see it, scientific interest is the one thing that would make them want to contact us.')
