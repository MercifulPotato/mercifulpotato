The idea was to build a compiler framework that could support profile-guided optimization (and other then-advanced JIT techniques) for idle-time or install-time optimization of C&#x2F;C++ codes. Chris&#x27;s original thesis doesn&#x27;t even mention JIT compilers, except as comparison point for techniques, and instead focuses on things like link-time optimization. (Indeed, Chris offered LLVM to replace gcc&#x27;s then-broken LTO infrastructure, but this was turned down.)')
