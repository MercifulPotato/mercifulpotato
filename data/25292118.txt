Google manages this for my name but Right Dao does not.<p>If I search for my name like this: &quot;kevin whitefoot&quot; the first 27 hits on Google are directly relevant and my name appears in the link or in the extracted text.  Right Dao on the other hand returns a list where the most of the hits do not include my name as quoted just the two words separately which means that the hits are completely irrelevant as they refer to a completely different person.<p>So how does one search for a person by name?')
