The developer is asked to put the player into a page that has basically just the player and exposes and API. The API should allow playing videos and playlists. They do the obvious thing and it all works.<p>The fact is that the security here wasn&#x27;t the default. They need to explicitly realize that this allows the website to list playlists and consider that this should not allow listing the playlist with the user&#x27;s credentials.<p>This seems like an incredibly likely vulnerability to me and I am not surprised that even &quot;elite&quot; programmers missed it.')
