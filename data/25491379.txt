I suppose the only real improvement between my model and the new ones is that perhaps the rice cooker will soak the rice for you.<p>You can vary the amount of water to play with different textures, but once you have it dialed in, it&#x27;s pretty hands-off.<p>I feel that these manufacturers try to pass off the new-and-shiny only because they have to. The old models last forever. In fact, the only reason why my last rice cooker broke is because gunk got stuck in the switch and it was not able to turn off automatically. In all other respects, the design is as simple and elegant as can be. A single circuit controlling a heating element, which automatically shuts off once a certain temperature threshold is reached.<p>Lastly, for those with one of those fuzzy-logic rice cookers, can you make scorched rice (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scorched_rice" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scorched_rice</a>)? I didn&#x27;t think so :)')
