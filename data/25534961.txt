We do not have to succumb to our natural baggage.<p>The problem with making and accepting general statements about the behavior of men and women is that it leads to an incredibly exclusionary society where only the &quot;normal&quot; (per those general statements) can find companionship and happiness.<p>I&#x27;m a man, and I&#x27;m straight, but I&#x27;m very, very gender-nonconforming. I don&#x27;t have your typical male traits of being aggressive and competitive and assertive. I&#x27;m shy, I&#x27;m very sensitive, and my interests are much more &quot;feminine&quot; per our society&#x27;s norms than &quot;masculine.&quot; I&#x27;m not handy, I don&#x27;t go around fixing things in the house. I don&#x27;t take big risks. I much prefer the cooperative and nourishing work style of women than the competitiveness of men. Perhaps the only typically male thing I have going is being rather strong, thanks to Olympic weightlifting... which I&#x27;m attracted to a million times more because of the graceful and aesthetic nature of the movements than any sort of muscle building benefits it might have for my looks. Getting stronger and looking better as a result of practicing it is just a nice side effect.<p>I struggled with all of that for a long time. I used to be a fan of Jordan Peterson &amp; co, who promote the sort of ideas found in your post. I fell into a really deep depression because I just could not be a socially acceptable Manly Man (TM), unless I was willing to undergo a ridiculous amount of self-inflicted stress to conform to a model of being that&#x27;s just not who I am.<p>When my therapist finally convinced me to stop listening to Peterson&#x27;s ideas, things started getting better. Suddenly, there were possibilities. There are all sorts of people in the world. We&#x27;re not bound to live strictly by natural laws, because we think and make judgements on people at a much higher level of cognition than simple physical traits.')
