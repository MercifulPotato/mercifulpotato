I grew up thinking everyone heard that high pitched buzzing.<p>A recent hearing check showed I have better than average hearing for my age. I have TMJ disorder, but I didn&#x27;t (I don&#x27;t think) as a child.<p>I currently subscribe to the theory that mine may be caused by like, a blood vessel by chance too close to the eardrum or whatever, and that there is nothing I can do about it.<p>Regardless, the possible causes seem to span a wide range of things totally unrelated so everyone who didn&#x27;t get it from exposure to loud sounds is on a highly personal journey.')
