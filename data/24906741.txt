Item(by='netsharc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603801736, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24906362, text='Google bragged when they were new, that it was better than other search engines (&quot;portals&quot;) because it just had the search text field and 2 buttons, and no articles with pictures and attention-grabbing headlines in their home page.<p>And now? The freaking Google Search app on Android has &quot;trending searches&quot; under the search bar. There&#x27;s an &quot;Explore&quot; button that shows you articles&#x2F;videos it thinks you like because it knows what you googled&#x2F;watched on YouTube.<p>I&#x27;m so glad there are still settings to turn these off (from the default of on!), but the changes pissed me off when I saw them for the 1st time.')
