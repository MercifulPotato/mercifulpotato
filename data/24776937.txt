Not an absolute either, as I stated &quot;many&quot; and not &quot;all&quot;. I&#x27;m not going to pretend that the majority of progressive minds are concentrated in the older populace, because constantly I find life experience to demonstrate otherwise.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what there is to &quot;get&quot; about trans. I think everyone deserves to be treated with decency and respect, while also believing there is plenty to discuss about the moral and ethical aspects of hormone treatment (particularly during childhood), genderless bathrooms, etc.')
