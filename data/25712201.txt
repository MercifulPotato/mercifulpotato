Are you?<p>It looks like you just are OK to suppress any point of view that you don&#x27;t like. And not OK with freedom of speech. Fortunately for you - and unfortunately for everybody for whom it&#x27;s still valuable - US is no longer a country where freedom of speech exists. I am not OK with this, and I think we are entering a period in American history which will be looked by descendants with deep shame and disgust, and this is due to people like you. Welcome to your 1984, and hope you never utter an unpopular thought.')
