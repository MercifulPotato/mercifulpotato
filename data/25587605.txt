Digital computers and biological brains are not the same thing. Just like you can&#x27;t build the Golden Gate Bridge out of jell-O, it&#x27;s perfectly possible that you cannot replicate human intelligence in a completely different substrate. Physical properties matter is what he is saying.<p>He&#x27;s not denying that humans are intelligent, he&#x27;s saying that biological intelligence is (likely) unique because of its configuration.<p>The extraordinary claim is actually the almost dualistic view taken by AI people. That intelligence exists in some sort of cloud, distinct from matter or physical properties. It&#x27;s almost a Descartes like, religious fantasy.<p>Searle isn&#x27;t denying that you can build AI, but that you can build <i>any</i> AI out of <i>anything</i>. He&#x27;s saying that if you want to build human like intelligence, it is very likely that you need human like material. Just like when you build a house it actually matters what the house is structurally made of, it matters to an AI what it is made of. You can&#x27;t make a house just out of some platonic mathematical idea of a house.')
