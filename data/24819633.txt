For years we used it to fill up bottles that we stored in the refrigerator so we could have cold water through the day. But we had to constantly clean and refill the bottles, and it takes some time for them to get cold.<p>With a good ice machine, we just get some ice in a cup or thermos mug and we can instantly have as much cold water as we want. The high-end machine makes nice clear ice that does not taste any different than normal water when it melts. It&#x27;s just like store bought ice.<p>The fact that it is under the counter means it&#x27;s super easy to open it up, scoop some ice, and then fill the cup up with water from the reverse osmosis spout right behind it.<p>You end up with really great tasting cold water, instantly, and as much as you want. The thing apparently makes 35 lbs of ice per day.<p>It&#x27;s also nice for visitors, if they want pop or something and we didn&#x27;t think to put it in the refrigerator beforehand.<p>Unlike refrigerator ice, it never has a smell or taste to it. It&#x27;s just ice.')
