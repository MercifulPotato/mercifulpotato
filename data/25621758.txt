I&#x27;m also running a unprofitable business that costs me money each month (G Suite, hosting, domain registration, SES, Wordpress plugin one time cost etc).  I have 2 customers (one is a friend, another is a true customer).  The true customer signed up knowing the cost and has told me I&#x27;m charging too little but with only a single customer, I can&#x27;t bring myself to charge them.  I feel like if I go that route it becomes a bit more of a business and I open myself up to other issues.  I also don&#x27;t have time to work on gaining more customers now (I work in COVID response, so it&#x27;s been a busy 11 months).  So I&#x27;m stuck just paying out of pocket.')
