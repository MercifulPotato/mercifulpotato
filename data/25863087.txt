Microsoft had be relegated to the realm of other boring places to do our type of work but that you interview at for practice (and, you know, just in case that job at google doesn&#x27;t pan out).<p>In my interview, the topic of digg.com came up and neither interviewer had heard of them. I said they were like a type of slahsdot, or maybe magnolia. Never heard of those either I quipped &quot;oh, maybe you&#x27;re not involve much in the web &#x2F; web development world&quot;.<p>&quot;Actually, I&#x27;m one of the project managers for Internet Explorer.&quot;<p>The interview went downhill, from Microsoft, from that point forward. My heart wasn&#x27;t even in it &quot;just in case&quot; anymore.&quot;<p>Hard to believe Microsoft was so utterly reviled by competent people in 2007. Nowadays I look at some of the things they&#x27;re doing (mostly Surface line) and I would love to be involved with that. I feel like, even though they&#x27;re not always hitting the bullseye, Microsoft is really aiming for the target with Surface devices. I know the Surface Duo got a lot of hate, and I really wanted to get one, but I feel like it just isn&#x27;t &quot;there&quot; yet.  Microsoft has been on that sort of track record for the past 5 years or so... the first version of a new product is a little questionable, the second is decent enough, but the third iteration, they&#x27;re really nailing it.<p>My Surface Book 3 is the best laptop I have ever owned, and I&#x27;ve had <i>many</i>.')
