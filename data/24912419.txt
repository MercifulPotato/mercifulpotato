The single-point of exit stuff is also there for the same reason. I&#x27;d agree that it&#x27;s possibly not a good choice given the alternatives <i>if</i> you are doing non-verified code, but he had his reasons.<p>If you ever wonder why modula-3&#x27;s garbage collector only collected memory, you could not hook into it in the form of a destructor for management of resources other than memory, go and read up the complexities that being able to piggyback on a destructor brings. It gets bad.<p>We could have some agreement but with &quot;regurgitation&quot;, &quot;strange fixation&quot;, &quot;strange at best#&quot; - this is the sound of you not understanding and not realising it, not wirth&#x27;s deficiencies.<p>If you think you can do better then go ahead.
