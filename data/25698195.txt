The compiler is not able to know which calls could block. Suppose you have this async state machine server on a single thread, super fast, but somewhere it opens a file synchronously, let&#x27;s say on a network mount to make things worse. No way a purely static VM-free language can help against that. Go (see: goroutines) is able to automatically suspend at those points and continue execution elsewhere. It comes with a big runtime but you get what you pay for.')
