Yes! Would his ML experience help him come up with this solution compared to someone who just learned numerical methods and automatic control theory? No. This isn&#x27;t an ML solution.<p>Just because something is taught in an ML course doesn&#x27;t mean that it is ML. It is pretty common for physics classes to teach maths and for chemistry classes to teach physics for example.<p>So if something is taught in ML class but also in statistics class then it is statistics and not ML. If something is taught in ML class but also in a numerical methods class then it is numerical methods and not ML.')
