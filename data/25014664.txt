Its the one thing they drill in to you in chef school. Its core to their culture. Kitchens are hard places to work because everyone is expected to stay in line, and keep their workstations 100% perfect. Discipline is required. If asked how long it takes to deliver meals, no one would dream of not including preparation and cleanup time, because its core to the culture.<p>Software has the opposite culture. People glorify &quot;hacking together&quot;, always look for easy short cuts being new languages, frameworks, or straight off copying from stackoverflow. No one wants to do hard work, learn anything properly, or architect anything for the long term. Everyone just wants to go to a weekend hackathon, put something together with tape and rubberbands and somehow make it big. It never works. Our culture is destroying so much of our work.')
