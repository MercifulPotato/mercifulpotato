My name is [[h0p3]], and [[I aim|IA2DYJ]] to be a friend and an ally. I have looked through your history, and I can see it is my honor to meet you. Thank you for agreeing to speak with me. I admire your fervor and candor, nomad, and I can see that we have quite a bit in common (for example, I despise AMP with a passion, and you seem passionate about the topic too). I&#x27;m probably not as skilled with [[computers|Computing]] and prescription as you are, so go easy on me. Of course, I&#x27;m making it easier on myself by waiting too. Time has passed, and there are fewer people watching. The pressures are lower here now. Let us wrestle in dialectics openly and wisely together. We can also take our discussion off-site if you would be more comfortable.<p>&gt; What you don&#x27;t realize...<p>Hrm. Most people require more time and effort to figure out what I don&#x27;t realize, including on this matter. I [[hope]] that we will one day know each [[other]] much better.<p>Your thesis is that using AdNauseam (presumably any use) is stupid and (because it?) will get one&#x27;s accounts banned with Google and Cloudflare. You have not defended this claim (or these claims, if you meant them as disconnected propositions).<p>There are cases in which using AdNauseam is not stupid, and it is not inevitable that using it will get your accounts banned with these corporations. I&#x27;ll agree (from practice) that its use can cause service problems for some people, but even that can be remedied (at least for now).<p>&gt; most of the users are dumb and set it to maximum click through rate, because they think it is some form of achievement. Going against the advertising mafia, fooling Google, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t see why I should think most current users behave in that fashion, but perhaps you have evidence you can show me (I&#x27;ve not looked). I&#x27;ll agree that most prospective users are ignorant, though that doesn&#x27;t mean they have to be: they have a choice. Surely you would agree: just because someone can use a tool in a stupid way doesn&#x27;t mean any use of the tool is stupid. Encouraging people to understand and use their tools wisely seems reasonable. There is a path on which this tool can be used and developed wisely. Even if all it did was bring attention and experience to the problems in this sphere, it might be worth using in ways that we might otherwise deem &quot;incorrect.&quot;<p>Should we discuss the merits of monkey-wrenching digital advertisement industries? Are you claiming this tool doesn&#x27;t present a problem for Google&#x27;s business model? Let me grant that this is an arms race, one that our adversaries are winning, and one that they will likely win. There is something to be achieved here though, and this tool does achieve something, however small. I will also agree there are much bigger fish to fry than this in the political problem of the continued centralization [[power]].<p>&gt; To load the ads you need to click on, it has to contact the adserver. If it contacts the adserver, what&#x27;s the point of an adblocker?<p>There are number of reasons one might use an adblocker, right?<p>Performance is one such reason. On my [[phone|monster-14]]&#x27;s 4G connection, my throughput is so slow that I can feel the difference between having ads and not. At home, I have a strong internet connection and a sufficiently fast [[computer|monster-16]] such that I often can&#x27;t feel a sufficient difference. I use adblockers on both, but it sometimes serves an extra purpose on my phone.<p>We can consider [[privacy]] to be another reason, and an extremely complex one, no doubt.<p>I also consider the advertising industry to be immoral, but even if it weren&#x27;t, I find ads (and an internet driven by ads) slow down my ability to find what is [[salient]]. Depending on what you mean, perhaps you and I will need to discuss the concept and practical concerns of &quot;adfraud.&quot; Adblocking simplifies and improves the experience of acquiring knowledge and building relationships with [[others]] over digital mediums, and it enables us to take back some semblance of control of our [[political autonomy|Justice]].<p>An adblocker that still contacted the adserver (which will perhaps ultimately have to be done to bypass restrictions in this arms race) but eliminated the display of the content in my browser is still incredibly useful to me in a large number of contexts. Of course, our attention spans are at stake. Let us consider the spectacle together wisely.<p>&gt; Also, faking stuff (here, you are faking your interests by clicking random ads) for privacy reasons is good in only very few situations. The best way to remain private is to not give any info at all, instead of faking it. Faking stuff should be the secondary choice.<p>I&#x27;ll agree that adding polluting noise, in some cases, may disrupt their ability to model us to some [[dok]]. Attacking ad companies effectively enough may also provide some disincentives for them to attempt to model our private lives (though I think that is limited). It may be worth it even if it only raised the cost of online advertising. Among many methods, [[ML|Aispondence]] may eventually make this untenable, and the overwhelming effectiveness of fingerprinting is exceptionally problematic. Thus, I will also agree that this not the most important user-rights tool, not by a long shot! It still costs them something though. There are privacy trade-offs to be had here, and this is a low-hanging fruit method. Even in steganography, where part of privacy (or even anonymity) may require masquerading as a normal-looking user, we&#x27;d want to have some imitation clicks. My suggestion is that AdNauseam is barely even an alpha concept. There is still an arms race to consider here.<p>Continued use and development of AdNauseam doesn&#x27;t have to be stupid.')
