The realization of the spirit is peace, but in the false world it is the total opposite, perceived as suffering and detachment from the world.<p>All feelings and realizations (both of the false world, associated with the path to the spirit) that bring peace even with detachment from the world are seen as part of the path.<p>As part of the false world&#x27;s absence of spirit, the path may seem to be wandering and involve suffering. Even those that are on the path to knowing the spirit may feel suffering.<p>Christianity&#x27;s origin was a belief the one spirit (God) was in Jesus, who said that spirit is within all of us, and that recognizing that (through faith) and realizing that the world is false was the path, just as Buddhists believe. Jesus&#x27;s death on the cross was a final attempt to bring home that attachment to the false world is death, and even those that understand may greatly suffer.')
