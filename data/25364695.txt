There is a whole theory of &quot;voice leading&quot;[1] which provides a toolbox of nice-sounding ways to get from key to key, with various emotional and textural elements attached to each.<p>(Some if it, I note, is called &quot;Neo-Riemannian theory&quot;[1], which does in fact relate to geometry but is wholly unrelated to Bernhard Riemann.)<p>You don&#x27;t actually need any of that theory. You can just compose by ear. And some of that theory has been known since the Middle Ages. But the &quot;classical&quot; era composers worked very hard on pushing the state of that art -- some of which can now be autosuggested by composing software. Which is especially nice when you&#x27;re doing it for an entire 100+ piece orchestra.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Voice_leading" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Voice_leading</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neo-Riemannian_theory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neo-Riemannian_theory</a>')
