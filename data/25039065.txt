Item(by='pmiller2', descendants=None, kids=[25039112], score=None, time=1604951414, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25038084, text='Re: BTC is not money<p>In addition to attacking the &quot;BTC is money&quot; argument by claiming it isn&#x27;t really a medium of exchange, I would take exception at saying it&#x27;s any sort of &quot;store of value,&quot; either.<p>As I understand it, 1 BTC is born after somebody cracks a specific SHA-256 hash.  Okay?  Big deal.  That means all you can really say is that whoever successfully mines said BTC came up with the answer to a very specific math problem.<p>Granted, that does require a significant expenditure of resources (electricity to power mining equipment), but, who cares?  Just because I put time and work into creating something does not make it automatically worth anything.<p>As far as I can tell, there is nothing else that gives BTC its value other than &quot;proof of work,&quot; and the fact that enough people <i>believe</i> it&#x27;s worth money.  I have mentioned how &quot;proof of work&quot; clearly does not imply any particular value to a thing.  So, that basically leaves the idea that BTC is worth something because people believe it is, and that sounds an awful lot like those dirty <i>fiat</i> currencies BTC and crypto people in general like to deride.')
