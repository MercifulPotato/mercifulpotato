I have no idea and that is not shown in my Profile. Let&#x27;s say, 2018?<p>Well, what server am I on? At the time I picked it because a well-known blogger I follow was on it. The timeline today is not offensive, but not interesting either. Which server is it? I have no idea, it is not shown in my profile.<p>What other servers are available? There is no way to answer that question from the home page (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mastodon.social&#x2F;web&#x2F;timelines&#x2F;home" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mastodon.social&#x2F;web&#x2F;timelines&#x2F;home</a>). Several links in posts here go to joinMastodon.org, a site that I&#x27;d never have known about except for this HN post.<p>While the list at joinmastodon.org&#x2F;communities is interesting, it is also very shallow (where are &quot;writing&quot;, &quot;philosophy&quot;, &quot;atheism&quot;, &quot;photography&quot; -- to name only a few of my reddit subs?) and, crucially, there is no search box!!')
