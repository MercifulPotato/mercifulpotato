It always depends on the context. Several replies in this thread mention very good use cases where Docker makes sense. From what you wrote, it sounds to me like it also makes sense in your environment.<p>Yes I mean I don&#x27;t want to have to learn things that don&#x27;t bring me value. But it&#x27;s not about learning the commands. It&#x27;s about having to repeat them over and over again in my daily work. About the associated mental burden &quot;am I in the container now? Is it running?&quot; And about everything taking longer, be it running tests in Docker or pushing to a registry and waiting for the new container to be spawned. As a single dev, and I feel this is where your and my requirements differ, it simply is not worth it.')
