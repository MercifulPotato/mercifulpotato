I was able to pass their evaluation&#x2F;interview without any prep and got in to the matching phase.<p>The first time: I got matched with one company which ended up hiring someone before I could interview and another company that declined to go further after a phone screen.<p>The second time: I wasn&#x27;t matched with anything.<p>The only reason I ended up trying to go through them was because I had a virtually nonexistent response rate through the normal application process while looking for my first job and I thought it would help me get through the initial resume filtering stage which is where I assume I get dropped all the time.')
