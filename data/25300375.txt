After that it&#x27;s entirely driven by who the product is for - if it&#x27;s a straightforward tech product for B2Bs you&#x27;re going to need more product and sales than tech, but if it&#x27;s a consumer app that needs to scale fast then you&#x27;ll have to push in to tech hires rather than sales.')
