There&#x27;s some optional integration of rga with tesseract, but it&#x27;s pretty slow and less good than external OCR tools.<p>ripgrep-all can do the same regexes as rg on any filetypes it supports. So you can could do something like --multiline and foo(\\w+[\\s\\n]+){,20}bar<p>It won&#x27;t work exactly like this, but something similar should do it:<p>--multiline enables multiline matching<p>foo searches for foo\n\\w+ searches for at least one word character\n[\\W]+ searches for at least one space&#x2F;nonword character like sentence marks\n{,20} searches for at most 20 iterations of the word-space combination\nbar searches for bar')
