I&#x27;ve had the intuition for a while that decentralization is sort of a hope of end-running around power structures, but as the article hints at, the power structures don&#x27;t really go away, they just becoming less legible. Think about the failings of holocracy, or tyranny of structurelessness, or even the way framework-less software projects tend to end up with ad-hoc, buggy frameworks implemented in them. In other words, the structure is there, you&#x27;ve just reduced your ability to influence it.')
