That leaves you with code that loads just fine over JTAG, but can&#x27;t boot just from poweron.  Stuff like if your code runs out of SRAM, maybe the clock tree looks totally different depending on how it loaded the code.<p>Once you get much past that point you want your team to use an OTA update mechanism as much as possible during normal development so that it has a ton of cycles on it by the time it ships.')
