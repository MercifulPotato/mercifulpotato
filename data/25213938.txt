Once I was asked by management to _take our status dashboard down_ . That sounded backwards, so I dug a bit more.<p>Turns out our competitor was using our status dashboard as ammo against us in their sales pitch. Their claim was that we had too many issues and were unreliable.<p>That was ironic, because they didn&#x27;t even have a status dashboard to begin with. Also, an outage on their system was much more catastrophic than an outage on our system. Ours was, for the most part, a control plane. If it went down, customers would lose management abilities for as long as the outage persisted. An outage at our competitor, meanwhile, would bring customer systems down.<p>We ended up removing the public dashboard and using other mechanisms to notify customers.')
