Both states initiated rigorous disease surveillance and contact tracing early in response to the pandemic. Procedures include syndromic surveillance and SARS-CoV-2 testing for all individuals seeking care for severe acute respiratory illness or influenza-like illness at healthcare facilities; delineation of 5km “containment zones” surrounding cases for daily house-to-house surveillance to identify individuals with symptoms; and daily follow-up of all contacts of laboratory-confirmed or suspect COVID-19 cases, with the aim of testing these individuals 5-14 days after their contact with a primary case, irrespective of symptoms, to identify onward transmission.<p>A low&#x2F;medium income region with good healthcare infrastructure is a rarity and may potentially provide unique insights.<p>We have seen very different transmission patterns in high latitude versus subtropical regions. I wonder if a third pattern will emerge in tropical regions.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;29&#x2F;science.abd7672" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;29&#x2F;scie...</a>')
