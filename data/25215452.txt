Item(by='jwess', descendants=None, kids=[25215645], score=None, time=1606346905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25214956, text='I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s realistic to offset all our printing with increases in taxation. I think the money trickles up exactly the way you described, and I agree that government programs should be paid for by taxation instead of money printing--but what can be taxed to make up the multi-trillion dollar difference?<p>Consider that the federal government collected revenues of $3.5 trillion in 2019, or more than $10,000 for every person in the country. State revenues combined were more than $1 trillion in 2019, for a total average tax liability of about $13,600 per-capita. I don&#x27;t see a realistic way to double or triple that revenue number while taxing income alone (and citizens would naturally demand a commensurate increase in government services if such a tax increase applied at lower-income levels).<p>Taxing wealth or ownership in companies is another route, but individuals who own any notable percentage of a public company are naturally very mobile, and could easily change their country of residence to somewhere more tax-friendly (like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt may be planning).<p>It seems like a difficult position to be in for the government.')
