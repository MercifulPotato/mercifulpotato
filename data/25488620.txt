I am working on a global directory of all cyber security vendors. As an industry analyst one of the first things I do is search things like Pitchbook, Crunchbase, or CBInsights, for categories of companies. Sadly, categorizing companies is extremely difficult. I have done it manually for the 3,000 vendors in my database. A search on your data reveals only companies with &quot;cybersecurity&quot; in their names. That will miss most of the 174 UK cybersecurity product vendors. Thanks for sharing your work!')
