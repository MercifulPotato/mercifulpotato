Lockdowns can be enforced, it was done earlier this year. Governments can provide financial support, it&#x27;s been happening all year.<p>All this could be over in 4-6 months, and were going into the miserable 4-6 months of the year anyway.<p>But somehow it&#x27;s all too hard and the economic damage would be too severe.<p>What people won&#x27;t put up with, and rightly so, is an incoherent strategy across Europe. Why make sacrifices if everyone is then encouraged to go on their summer holiday to save the economy and undo everything?<p>Its frankly disappointing.')
