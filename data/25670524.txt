Have had two different HP G2 docks (using DP and USB C) for dual external displays and they both broken over two years of sitting on my desk. I don’t know what’s happening to them but eventually both external displays start flashing and getting artifacts and USB and Ethernet devices start randomly disconnecting.<p>Just my experience. Hope other haven’t had those issues.')
