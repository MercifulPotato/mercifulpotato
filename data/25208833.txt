I have the idea that it&#x27;s not more than 30%.<p>Also the horses that are primarily bred for food are for a large part free roaming in places where other cattle simply wouldn&#x27;t survive. This in contrast to other meats (chicken, veal, pork) that are often raised in factory like environments.')
