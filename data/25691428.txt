From the article:<p><i>Although the performance of ONNs is not yet competitive with leading-edge electronic processors at &gt;200 TOPS (for example, Google TPU and other chips), there are straightforward approaches towards increasing our performance both in scale and speed. Further, with a single processor speed of 11.3 TOPS, our VCA is approaching this range. The CA is fundamentally limited in data size only by the electrical digital-to-analogue converter memory, and processing 4K-resolution (4,096Ã—2,160 pixels) images at &gt;7,000 frames per second is possible. The 720 synapses of the CNN (72 wavelengths per synapses per neuron, 10 neurons), a substantial increase for optical networks, enabled us to classify the MNIST dataset. Nonetheless, further scaling is needed to increase the theoretical prediction accuracy from 90% to that of state-of-the-art electronics, typically substantially greater than 95%.</i>')
