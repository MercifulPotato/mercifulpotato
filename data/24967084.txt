I wouldn’t have done so after the buyout.<p>If google bricks my thermostats because my kid does something dumb on YouTube (through the linked tv accounts) that will suck.<p>I suppose regulators could also prevent companies from bundling lockouts in that shutting down gmail for YouTube problems. Or shutting down Nest for gmail problems, etc.<p>The phone company can’t just randomly cut off service and ghost me. Regulators are the reason for that, as I’m sure they’d love to if they could.')
