Early days I wanted to learn and make the next big thing, and spent a lot of my time after work reading up on design patterns, stacks, etc. Even launched a product, but it failed.<p>Looking back, I saw a lot of my friends went on trips to Europe, Asia, Africa, and across America. They had a lot of fun and made memories. I have none of that, and less.<p>Now that we&#x27;re all reaching middle age, maybe I have more money, but I can tell you it&#x27;s not worth it. And it&#x27;s not like I can make up time and go on more trips now, we&#x27;re all in a different life stage.<p>Don&#x27;t miss the boat being young, trying to be a 10x ninja hacker is worthless, especially with how the industry treats its minority workers.')
