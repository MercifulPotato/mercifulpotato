Seems better than the Pfizer vaccine, especially because transportation of the vaccine seems easier (the vaccine can be transported at a much higher temperature, -7C instead of -80C out the top of my head). Both vaccines seem to require 2 doses a couple of weeks apart which is unfortunate but workable.<p>But...<p>How long does the immunity last?<p>What are the long term side effects?<p>Does it prevent spreading (read: keep wearing masks after vaccination) or does it &quot;only&quot; prevent symptoms?<p>Answer: we don&#x27;t know. Let&#x27;s not rush this.<p>Also interesting to note: so we can develop and approve vaccines for new diseases within months? It doesn&#x27;t have to take 10 years if we really want to eradicate a disease badly enough? My conclusion: we&#x27;re under-funding research in microbiology. &quot;We&quot; as in: the entire world.
