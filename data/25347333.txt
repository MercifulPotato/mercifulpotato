Item(by='robenkleene', descendants=None, kids=[25347956], score=None, time=1607444626, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345589, text='&gt; deeply troubling subculture where passionately debating about very expensive cables and gadgets without ever being able to pass a blind test on the claims is the norm, almost like cargo cult<p>&gt; That sounds like the apple cult.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re getting at here, but this statement on its face is absurd. The equivalent comparison to &quot;without ever being able to pass a blind test&quot; would be running macOS on a computer where you&#x27;ve hidden the Apple logo, and seeing if people can tell whether it&#x27;s Windows.<p>You may have valid problems with Apple&#x27;s users, but you haven&#x27;t provided any evidence that it has anything in common with audiophile culture, and the comparison makes no sense on its face as described by the parent comment.')
