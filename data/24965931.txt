My C64 only hat 16, my friends CPC had 32, including the rad &quot;Bright White&quot; which enabled stunning effects. Man, I envied that.<p>[2] Exposed GPIO header is super awesome and quite similar to the C64 <i>User Port</i>. Even more awesome was the Commodore&#x27;s <i>Expansion Port</i> which basically exposed its bus. It think something like this would not be practically possible with today&#x27;s GHz clock speeds but still this was super awesome and allowed (and required) you to even dig deeper into the internal workings of your machine.')
