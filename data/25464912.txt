Item(by='dnautics', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608278639, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25462475, text='2) thermocycling goes through usually 3 temperatures -- denaturation at 95C to unzip the dna, ~50-65 for annealing primers, then 72-ish for extension.<p>The magic of post mullis PCR (contrary to common belief PCR existed before mullis but it was a royal pain in the ass) is that you steal DNA replicating enzymes from creatures that live in thermal pools near boiling, so the near boiling temperatures required to unzip DNA do not destroy your replicating enzymes.<p>They do, however, destroy histones.')
