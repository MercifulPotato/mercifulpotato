The process is so complicated that even if metro themselves wanted to hire labor in house and save due to being able to run things at cost rather than for profit, there wouldn&#x27;t be any talent available that is able to navigate the regulatory process as those brains have long since been hired by companies like Tutor Perini. Even if metro wanted to do things in house, they wouldn&#x27;t even know where to start with what is necessary for regulatory approval as that ground has been covered by private contractors for two decades.<p>It&#x27;s such a screwed up situation and is perfectly designed to enrich shareholders at the expense of the public purse, just a perfectly oiled machine. Metro doesn&#x27;t even accept the cheapest bids, they continually turn to Tutor Perini because that is the only contractor with people familiar with the regulatory process. I&#x27;m not sure how you ever right the ship in this case. Pretty depressing.')
