Item(by='rectang', descendants=None, kids=[25373701, 25373444], score=None, time=1607605374, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25371512, text='Documenting provenance is hard.<p>I&#x27;m considering releasing some projects under CC0, and I would like users to feel highly confident about using the material, which for anything I&#x27;m the sole author of would be fine because I have a decent reputation (past \nASF board member).  However, accepting contributions from others would require assessing their right to contribute and documenting it.<p>Any patches which show up from a previously unknown author are potentially a curse rather than a blessing.  At the least, I have to vet the author.  If I can&#x27;t do that, or don&#x27;t want to spend the effort, then not only can I not use the contribution, if I want to write my own patch I have to do in such a way to avoid creating a derivative work.  I&#x27;d rather just get a feature request, it&#x27;s less trouble!<p>I&#x27;d like to put the CC0 projects on Github for the convenience of users, but the problem is that Github&#x27;s culture of contribution doesn&#x27;t meet my requirements and you can&#x27;t turn off pull requests short of &quot;archiving&quot; the repo.  I might do something like maintain the project elsewhere and put an archived mirror on Github, running a script once per day which unarchives the repo, pushes changes, and rearchives the repo...<p>Public domain art aggregator sites like Artvee aren&#x27;t ever going to be able to offer a level of care like this.  Users who are serious about copyright need to be able to verify provenance to high degree of confidence, and Artvee can&#x27;t vet uploads to that standard or they wouldn&#x27;t have any inventory.')
