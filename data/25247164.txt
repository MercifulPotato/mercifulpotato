E.g. I could have a local change adding some editor config files, or modifying some compiler flags in the Makefile to suit my local config.<p>With git my typical solution for this is to basically keep rebasing them as uncommitted changes with `git stash`, until I inevitably lose them. Or keep a separate branch, and keep explicitly rebasing (and stay on my toes not to accidentally push the commits).')
