I even keep songs downloaded from YouTube before they got taken down. :) Is this really that uncommon with the enormous amount of storage capacity you can get for cheap these days? I even store TV series and movies. My line of thinking for this is: &quot;what if they get 0 seeders and I will not be able to download them anymore?!&quot;. If I had an account to one of those streaming services, it would be: &quot;what if my account got disabled&#x2F;suspended for some reason?&quot;, or &quot;what if their servers die?&quot;, and so forth.')
