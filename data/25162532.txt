The onboarding flow only works with Twitter right now, but once you create an alert all platforms will be polled (though some will be polled via search engines until I can fund native search, like LinkedIn). I should add a disclaimer to the onboarding UI...<p>site:TLD filtering is <i>sort of</i> in place right now but it&#x27;s not obvious... you can select the &quot;Custom&quot; platform and then use that site:tld syntax (or any syntax supported by Google). Lmk if you run into any issues there, that&#x27;s a relatively new feature.<p>Language &#x2F; geography filtering is on the backlog! <i>hopefully</i> to be funded by paying customers.<p>Thanks for trying it out!')
