The extreme bullshit that leads from there to QAnon is the problem. That the former exists doesn&#x27;t mean the latter serves some kind of useful purpose or that they&#x27;re at least half-right. In fact, QAnon does more harm than good to the legitimate causes fighting child abuse and exploitation.<p>Yet here I am being attacked and called closed-minded for even pointing things like this out.')
