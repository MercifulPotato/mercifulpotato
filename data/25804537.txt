My 8GB M1 handles Node &amp; JS about twice as fast as my 16GB 15&quot; Intel MBP from 2019.<p>Where you can run into issues is architecture support. I&#x27;m running Node natively, but this means that some packages that don&#x27;t support ARM will fail to build properly. I&#x27;ve been able to work around&#x2F;do without for now, but depending on your use case, it could be an issue, if you want to run Node natively. (I do not have a feel for Node via Rosetta 2 performance.)')
