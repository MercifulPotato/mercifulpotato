That would be instruction size or smaller, and instructions are always the same size no matter how many you do in parallel.<p>And logically once you separate the instructions you can decode in parallel in fixed time, and if all your instructions are 4 bytes then it takes no circuitry to separate them.<p>Also: &quot;We found that, at least for the design space and technologies we explored, the quadratic component is very small relative to the other components. Hence, the\ndelay of the decoder is linearly dependent on the issue width.&quot;')
