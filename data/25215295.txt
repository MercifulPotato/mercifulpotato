Having completely opaque pricing is a big red flag. I assume it is very expensive, or else you couldn&#x27;t afford to route inquiries through a sales rep. If you aren&#x27;t hiding a high price, you should publish it.  Also, and this is a strong personal preference, I never ever want to talk to or hear from a sales rep.')
