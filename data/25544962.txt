A vertically integrated vendor can capture margins across the whole product bundle and do things like charge $200 for 8gb of ram. That extra margin makes it possible to sustain low to no margins on the actual cpu, and you can afford to make much bigger chips at a more advanced process node.<p>It also makes it easy to add specialized accelerators and processor instructions that you can then build support for in the operating system you ship.')
