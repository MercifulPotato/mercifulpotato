You are correct that the programs are using somewhat different algorithms (and as an author for many other submissions on the site, I can say this is true for many of the benchmarks on the site).<p>In addition to what you&#x27;ve already mentioned, if I&#x27;m not mistaken, the programs also take different multi-threading approaches. One of the tasks in this benchmark involves reversing three very large strings. My C program took a fairly simple approach and does that reversal process for each string serially but processes multiple strings in parallel. The Rust program on the other hand does the opposite and does the reversal process for each string in a parallel manner but only processes strings one at a time. The algorithm the Rust program uses is more complicated which results in a considerably larger program size that also is a bit less flexible regarding the input (it assumes each line of input is 60 characters whereas my program will work with lines of any length) but it results in better CPU utilization, less clock time, and less memory use. I&#x27;ve been meaning to submit a faster C program using this faster algorithm but have simply been too busy with other things.')
