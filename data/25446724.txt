Drug companies focus exclusively on biological effects and can&#x27;t even get drugs to regularly pass phase 1 trials, and you&#x27;re asking for a single chemist at Industrial Sealants Inc to do what entire pharma companies can&#x27;t? Putting lead in gasoline sounds dumb, but so does putting mercury in vaccines. The only way to tell the difference is to do studies, which would take teams of people. It is absolutely not possible to expect individual chemists to accurately predict the biological consequences of their products.')
