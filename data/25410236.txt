And so you really should have a decent story for this regardless.<p>And culturally, it&#x27;s super-valuable to have a certain percentage of visitors, since it helps break down the silos, one commit at a time.<p>The counterpoints, of course, are that no team really wants to have to maintain a bunch of crap written by someone who&#x27;s moved on after a quick stab at something, and it sorta sucks for the sustaining team if all the &quot;rockstar feature requests&quot; (as the GP put it so succinctly) are picked up by folks in their 20% time.<p>The former can be mitigated with a good model for managing incoming pull requests, in my experience. The latter is a tougher nut to crack.')
