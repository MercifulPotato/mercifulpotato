I guess you would still have to have your conventions (and actually follow them) about what you put in the attributes for which kind of product. I am thinking though, that if you need to implement any new functionality for a specific product, you would discuss it with other developers (or yourself, if you are alone) and find a good convention of what to store and then on another part of the program make use of it. If you wanted to encode the convention into your code, you can create product type specific constructors, which you have to use (another convention!) when creating such a product. Still lighter weight than creating a class for everything and avoids coupling behavior with state.<p>I guess the approach stands or falls with developer discipline. If you one is not disciplined enough about the conventions and carefully choosing them, one could end up with a mess of a mass of unknown keys in products, which no one knows why or how they got there.')
