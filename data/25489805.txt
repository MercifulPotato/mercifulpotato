At home, nothing keeping you from pausing a film halfway and picking up the next day just like a TV series. Obviously telling a single story in 90-180 minutes is a different form from telling a storing over multiple seasons of 30-90 minute episodes in different from a miniseries or single-season series. But they&#x27;re all just artistic (and financial) choices.<p>While there&#x27;s arguably been an overall shift to shorter content, I don&#x27;t really see a marked falloff in movies being produced.')
