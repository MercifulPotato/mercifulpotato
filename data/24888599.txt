While I both don&#x27;t agree with Khaled and also think that she should have had her event, there&#x27;s a large difference between canceling someone who is currently advocating for violence and student protestors. Khaled is a self proclaimed freedom fighter who hijacked 2 planes. Tiananmen Square Massacre is students getting shot by their government. I&#x27;m not sure how you equate these things unless I am <i>gravely</i> misinformed about Tiananmen Square and it was really a rebel group of students that were freedom fighters advocating and participating in violent actions against the government. As far as I know, that&#x27;s not the case. Comparing the two removes any actual context between these events. There&#x27;s this large scale difference. You can&#x27;t just say because X country isn&#x27;t perfect that Y country can do whatever they want. Scale matters. Nuance matters. You also can&#x27;t call country X hypocritical based on people complaining about country Y because, at least in western countries, you&#x27;ll find those people are often complaining about similar things in their home country X (meaning ideology is consistent). I&#x27;ll even say that criticizing America is a national past time (and how democracies work, you only improve by finding your flaws).')
