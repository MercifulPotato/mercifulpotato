I&#x27;ll write a code generator!&quot;. They then have a problem generator, that will output fresh interesting problems every time it runs.<p>It is the only advanced tool available in C and C++, where people hate it. But for some reason Java developers are great fans (even though reflection is available), and their generators will always accept XML. It&#x27;s still the first time I see a C# developer asking for it.')
