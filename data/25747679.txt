It is, however, mentioned in the Quran that monasticism is rather an invention by the People of the Books namely Christians and Jews [2]. According to the Quran, it&#x27;s invented for the monks to seek God&#x27;s good pleasure, but apparently most of the monks do not observe it as it ought to have been observed.  Perhaps this book and manual from St. Benedict provided us with the most authentic and comprehensive descriptions of the rules of the monks&#x27; observations during the classical antiquity. By reading the rules I can appreciate why the monks have failed observe them ;-). Adding to the fact that it predates the Quran, these type of observations that were probably being referred to by the Quran.<p>Fun fact, there is an Ashtiname (Book of Peace), a letter sent by Muhammad to the Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery [3]. The purpose is to guarantee the safety of its monks living there against any potential aggression by the Muslim individuals or army. Given the monastery is still exist and standing today despite of being there for more than a thousand years under Islamic government rule is probably the testament of the effectiveness of the covenant provided by the Ashtiname.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theorthodoxlife.wordpress.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;12&#x2F;monasticism-in-scripture&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theorthodoxlife.wordpress.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;12&#x2F;monasticism...</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.islamicstudies.info&#x2F;tafheem.php?sura=57&amp;verse=26&amp;to=29" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.islamicstudies.info&#x2F;tafheem.php?sura=57&amp;verse=26...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ashtiname_of_Muhammad" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ashtiname_of_Muhammad</a>')
