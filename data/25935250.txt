The DOD wanted to upgrade their website, and as often happens, the lowest bidder was a giant company who could blacken the sky with lawyers. They worked and worked, and their deadline slipped. Finally, they made something that <i>kind of</i> worked, sort of, as long as the wind wasn&#x27;t blowing too hard.<p>The younger engineer noticed that the new DOD website served webpages via carrier pigeon, but with more latency. As in, page loads often took <i>minutes</i>. He proposed to the lord of his domain: &quot;your majesty, what if I crafted a robot to visit all of their pages and enscribe their lore into our own tomes, such that when your customers want the information, we can give it to them in milliseconds, and not minutes. Oh, and I can make the robot labor only at night lest the DOD get persnickety.&quot; The lord gave his blessing, and the younger engineer went away and made The Thing.<p>The Thing worked wonders, and there was much rejoicing among the many kingdoms. But lo, the DOD was not happy, for it made their contractors look as though a pack of jackasses. And so they sent a sternly worded missive: &quot;cease at once, knave, or we shall cut you off from the river of nectar for all of time!&quot; And the younger engineer&#x27;s lord&#x27;s voice quavered, for he knew that his own kingdom would starve if this were to happen.<p>But the younger engineer was cleverer. He noticed that the DOD&#x27;s website could not be perceived by those who could not see, but his own website was beautiful to behold by both the sighted and those not. He proposed a plan to his lord, and his lord giggled for the plan was good and clever.<p>The lord sent a missive of his own, both to the Maker Of The Website and the DOD, saying:<p>&quot;Alas, your own website cannot be perceived by those without sight, as are some of our customers. Our website can be. If you go away and stop sending threatening letters, our customers have agreed to behold the riches of thine data through our site as a proxy, and not file a lawsuit with an injunction that shall turn your website off tomorrow until you spend a few tens of millions of dollars fixing it.&quot;<p>And the Maker Of The Website shut the hell up about it, and the DOD formally approved the plan, and all were happy.<p>Except for the Maker Of The Website, of course, but lo, they were as though a pack of jackasses.<p>The younger engineer was celebrated, then moved away to distant lands with better pay.<p>The end.')
