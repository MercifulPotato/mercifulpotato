I mean, that’s obviously a stupidly bad way of doing it!” And <i>even if</i> the proper solution required more work for individual apps (it’d be only a tiny bit at most), Apple’s in a better position than Microsoft to require that their developers get it right.<p>I’ve still not actually seen it for myself, and even having heard from multiple sources that yes, it really does work that way, I still find it hard to believe. It’s just… “here, let’s put higher-resolution displays in our laptops, but then scale things so badly that somehow it manages to be worse than a lower-resolution 1920×1080 panel would have been”. Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.<p>I also find it utterly baffling.')
