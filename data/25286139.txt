HTTP&#x2F;2 fixed the issues of HTTP pipelining and made it so multiple requests could share one connection without issues like head-of-line blocking, and HTTP&#x2F;3 improves things further so that a missed packet in one request doesn&#x27;t slow down simultaneous requests. Server push was never a critical feature of them. The measured improvements from 2 and 3 were almost always without server push.')
