But that quickly becomes messy when you realize even the reddest states are 25-30% democrat, and rural areas in blue states are almost invariably republican. How do democrats (or republicans) manage such uniformity across the nation, if it is the massiveness that thwarts cohesion? Wouldn&#x27;t we see states that are 100% D&#x2F;R up to a rounding error?<p>I propose that the massiveness is not spatial. It is ideological. Draw a straight dividing line in ideology space, and you can cleanly cleave US society. Project it onto a map, and it looks like a fuzzy boundary between urban and rural. But I think it&#x27;s clear that the partisanship is generated by ideology and has reflections in geography, rather than the other way around.<p>So consider federalism that isn&#x27;t based on states&#x2F;territories of land, but rather based on ideological space. If we used a Proportional Representation system, I might have some ideological representatives in congress. As it stands, my representatives represent their party and my physical location, but not the thoughts and ideas of voters like me.')
