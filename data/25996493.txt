They&#x27;re used to just releasing something and having hundreds of millions of customers overnight. It seems like if that doesn&#x27;t happen, the leadership immediately blames the product rather than themselves.<p>This is the main reason I hate Google. They&#x27;re one of the largest corporations in the world, they have immense resources and power to move the human race forward. Yet they don&#x27;t. Some might attribute it to laziness, or stupidity. And maybe it&#x27;s both, but those are symptoms, and the root cause is the lack of competition allowed to fester by the flaccid noodle that is our government.<p>Break them up already!')
