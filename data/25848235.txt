It&#x27;s better to not burden your programming with your emotional shortcomings, and treat all conditions that you may encounter on an equal footing.<p>You try to open a file; the file may or may not exist, and both cases are equally likely and you get to decide what your program does in each case. No need to attach an emotionally charged label like &quot;error&quot; in one of the two cases of the conditional.
