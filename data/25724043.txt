I bought my cast iron pan for $15. I use the heck out of it, and I don&#x27;t think about seasoning one second. If I need to cook something that will stick, I put oil or butter on it, and I wash the pan afterwards. Even my stainless steel pans, I use them as I like without worrying about anything. I use oil&#x2F;butter when I need to, and then wash. What I love most about both is that I scrub it with SOS pad if something gets caked on. I don&#x27;t know why people are so concerned about &quot;seasoning&quot; the pan. My All-clad frying pan was $100, I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now, lots of scratch and dents but who cares? I&#x27;ll probably use it for a long time and not think about replacing them. They are indestructible and even if I had to replace them, it wasn&#x27;t an arm and a leg.')
