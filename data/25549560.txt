While it&#x27;s a cool idea, seems it&#x27;s insanely poorly implemented on Sony Vegas.<p>Here&#x27;s what I have: you can hover over any video track and I instantly show you what&#x27;s there. So you can decide what&#x27;s in and what&#x27;s out.<p>With this, assuming there&#x27;s enough interest in something like this, I can optimize it further and do it like in Vegas with a few quirks. Like, you would select several tracks and create a multi-track. When hovering the multi-track, you can choose to view all at once, or a single video and have a hotkey to switch between videos, and another hotkey to select that video as &quot;current video&quot;.')
