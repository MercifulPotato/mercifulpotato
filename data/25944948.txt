Two friends of mine who don&#x27;t care at all about Wall Street told me yesterday that they bought in, because they read an explanation of why they&#x27;re sure to see big gains on Friday. If the goal was just to beat Wall Street, hurt some hedge funds and get egg on a lot of people&#x27;s faces... like you said, they&#x27;ve already succeeded, so putting a stop to it before speculative investors get hurt seems appropriate.')
