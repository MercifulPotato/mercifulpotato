Nice bonus that it&#x27;s a slightly faster SoC.<p>I have a Pi 4B with a heat sink and fan that&#x27;s running BOINC 24x7 (yielding a RAC of about 750-775 on World Community Grid), and with the fan connected to 3.3V it runs at a comfortable 52-54Â°C with absolutely no throttling. I think I&#x27;m going to try overclocking it a bit and see how it handles it.')
