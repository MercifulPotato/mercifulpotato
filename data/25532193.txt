Even if it&#x27;s not directly used for ad tech, everything you would do for facebook would ultimately be for the purpose of ad tech. Rationalizing that your particular work has non ad-tech related applications seems like just that: a rationalization. Other companies offer OSS work opportunities, as well as the opportunity to carve out, say, 5-10 hours a month to the project of your choice regardless of your day job.<p>I&#x27;m not coming down on one side or the other of such a moral choice. I don&#x27;t think things are that simple. I think it&#x27;s a spectrum, and people should weight these things when making a decision, if they have the luxury of doing so.<p>And I have to say, at this point ad tech is probably only one of a few major problems with Facebook content. News feeds, memes, etc. that are rewarded with shared &amp; likes for being the most inflammatory&#x2F;emotionally manipulative are at this point at least as bad as micro-targeting of ads, and I personally think are much much worse.')
