I really like this idea and I think my city would benefit a lot as we still have trash being collected not from underground bins but from bags laid out on the street. One thing that I don&#x27;t like: the incentized tax scheme Bergen uses. Environmentalist politicians tried that here (Netherlands) as well in some towns. However what happens is that poor residents will use trashbins in parks or will just leave it on the street. It might work in Bergen, which is the heart of Norway&#x27;s oil industry and one of the richest places in Europe. But elsewhere it&#x27;s unlikely to work.')
