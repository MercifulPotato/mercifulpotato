That&#x27;s in the ballpark of what the early SARS-COV-2 research (15%) showed until we realized there were asymptomatics and people who don&#x27;t go to the hospital (because they aren&#x27;t severe) and that numbers drawn from the hospitalized were not representative. If that number was just pulled from hospitalizations because we shut SARS down before we studied it as closely, it makes me wonder if the mortality rates are similar.')
