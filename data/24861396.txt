At the macro level the only source of investment funds is income that does not go to consumption. Lower the expected rate of return through taxation, and the result is inevitably a shift from investment to consumption. At the individual firm level it&#x27;s obvious that taxation lowers the NPV of the firm&#x27;s available projects - they are obviously not going to respond by investing more.')
