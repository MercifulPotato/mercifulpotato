It is non-ethical and totally wrong!<p>Wrong why? I mean, in a time of scarcity how do you ensure that only those who need it the most are able to self-moderate their purchases?<p>I should point out the fact that artificially restricted selling prices lead to shortages really quick, as people tend to binge buy in those circumstances thus depleting supplies. It happens with bottled water in hurricanes, it happened with toilet paper in the first covid19 lockdowns, and it sure as hell happened with face masks as well.')
