All the thermostat does is connect the power wire to the given function wire (like “fan on” or “heat pump 1 on”. I am not an expert but having installed a number of thermostats in a number of homes, all the manuals talk about the ground wire being rare and I have never seen one. If you are lucky you might have an unused wire that you can find a ground for, but I have only seen that once. Somehow when houses are wired it seems the HVAC people are very efficient with using the exact right number of wires in a single cable.')
