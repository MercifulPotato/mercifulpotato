You&#x27;d get atmospheric radiation shielding, same pressure as on Earth (although obviously unbreathable air), ample sunlight and plenty of materials (=carbon and oxygen) in the form of Venusian atmospheric gasses.<p>Although hydrogen would be hard to come by, the atmospheric concentration is very low. That said, I doubt there&#x27;s that much hydrogen on Mercury either.<p>So who knows, maybe Venus is a better place for a human base than Mercury?')
