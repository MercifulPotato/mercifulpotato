It&#x27;s not unusual at this point.  And if the issue is manufacturer defect, then EV cars have that same risk.<p>Sure you might be replacing brake pads less, but is there anything to suggest the braking system is less prone to failure?  Say from rusted parts or bad seals?<p>And LED lights aren&#x27;t unique to EVs.  You can put them on ICE cars too so it&#x27;s a wash.')
