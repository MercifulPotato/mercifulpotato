The natural human tendency, the base state, is fundamentally tribal in nature and the objective is to win, to beat the other tribes.<p>The recent push to censor and silence dissent isn&#x27;t an anomaly: the several hundreds years post enlightenment that gave us the ideas of individual rights and freedoms were the anomaly.<p>I also do not believe anyone advocating the censoring of others has been themselves censored, or put in a minority position where they were afraid to express dissent.
