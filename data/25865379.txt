So they&#x27;re changing their license to one that protects against this sort of &quot;abuse&quot; of the Apache license.<p>The less charitable version is that since Elastic&#x27;s business model revolves around selling hosted ElasticSearch and AWS is outcompeting them there, they&#x27;re switching to an &quot;Open Source, but you&#x27;re not allowed to do that anymore&quot; license.  But because Elastic values the goodwill they get from being &quot;open source,&quot; they&#x27;re trying to convince the world that this is a principled, moral stance instead of a run-of-the-mill self-interested decision to make their business more viable.')
