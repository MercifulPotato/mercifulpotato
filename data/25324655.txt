Crypto isn&#x27;t much different.  If you can get it anonymously, you can move it anywhere you want as long as you stay on the blockchain.  Once you leave the blockchain, you aren&#x27;t dealing with crypto anymore. Once you sell gold you aren&#x27;t dealing with gold anymore.<p>I don&#x27;t know about Diem in particular, but a state or corporate issued currency is not a general indictment of cryptocurrency.')
