I pay for it, to use its modeling to help avoid over training.  I like the social aspects of it.  I learn new routes by following people, including the local pros.  It&#x27;s a treat when people write entertaining ride reports.<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine that GPS errors help cheating, unless you&#x27;re paying attention to really tiny segments.  I&#x27;m interested only in segments that are at least 5 minutes, but normally 20 to 40 minutes.  It would be really hard to reliably cheat to your followers who get to see how you grow over time and gain an understanding of the performances you can deliver.  And if you track heart rate, cadence, and power, it becomes really easy to see what is legit.  I have power meters on my mountain and road bikes.')
