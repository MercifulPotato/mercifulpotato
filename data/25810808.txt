Even the Twitter ban had to use all sorts of stupid and squishy language for their justification. Meanwhile, the Washington Post (just to pick one of countless examples) ran a huge story in 2019 (!!!) with an interview with Hillary Clinton on how she claimed the election was stolen via Russian “interference”. Thank god three years of that wasnt incitement. For centrists like myself, watching this devolve and lose any sense of true objectivity is depressing.<p>Bring on the downvotes...<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;hillary-clinton-trump-is-an-illegitimate-president&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;29195d5a-e099-11e9-b199-f638bf2c340f_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;hillary-clinton-trum...</a>')
