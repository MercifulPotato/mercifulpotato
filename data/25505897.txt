It would be so great if people used the word &quot;axiom&quot; to mean exclusively &quot;I need to blindly assume this is true, otherwise I do not see how can I make <i>any</i> progress&quot;. This article contains, I think, author&#x27;s <i>advices</i>.<p>The dictionaries (and people) usually conflate &quot;a proposition which cannot actually be proved or disproved&quot; with &quot;a self-evident principle&quot;&#x2F;&quot;an established principle&quot;, which looks like a very huge confusion to me. It&#x27;s like mistaking math and physics. It&#x27;s like claiming Euclid&#x27;s fifth axiom is self-evident, when others have already shown this was just an implicitly made decision (hence non-euclidean geometries), which cut off some very interesting, but difficult, mental models.
