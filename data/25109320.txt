A parasite is defined as &quot;an organism which lives in or on another organism (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other&#x27;s expense.&quot; -- Without getting into the emotional connotations of calling a child a parasite, it certainly does meet the Oxford Dictionary definition.<p>Re: bad for the creature, hyenas give birth through their clitoris. I&#x27;d suggest that&#x27;s not great. Children cost an average of $233,000 to raise. That&#x27;s certainly not great. That doesn&#x27;t take into account career cost and opportunity cost of lost income. Sub-optimal too.<p>I&#x27;d describe children as mandatory lol.')
