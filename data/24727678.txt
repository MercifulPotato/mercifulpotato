Nearly all the risk you mention is because of the insane and greedy design of credit cards.<p>In most of Europe, people pay with debit cards and the money goes straight off their bank accounts. If there&#x27;s insufficient funds, there&#x27;s no purchase. If the network fails, there&#x27;s no purchase. If your bank goes bust 5ms before your purchase would clear, there&#x27;s no purchase. I&#x27;m no banker and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some risk somewhere, but it&#x27;s really not very much.')
