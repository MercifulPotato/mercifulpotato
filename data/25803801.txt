When seconds counts the police are minutes away.<p>Guns are a tool for self defense, as such it is my human right to own one for my own protection.<p>“The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes…. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.” – Thomas Jefferson,<p>“This may be considered as the true palladium of liberty…. The right of self defense is the first law of nature: in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible. Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.” – St. George Tucker,<p>Finally for me it comes down to a simple truism,  if the government can not trust me with a gun for my own defense, I sure as hell can not trust them with a gun to &quot;defend&quot; me with.  So if the government wants disarm the population, it should also disarm itself, for how can a government be &quot;For the people by the people&quot; if the people in government do not have to follow the same laws as everyone else<p>So if all government agents are barred from owning guns, then I will also give up mine.')
