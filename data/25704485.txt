If there are differences, even minor, think about them in the process.<p>For example, I love clisp because that&#x27;s pretty much what I learned to program Common Lisp in, and it starts up so fast, making it ideal for scripting. But I also use sbcl because it has a few more features, such as compiling native binaries. And I prefer a lot of things on the command line, so both of them have that as plus points.<p>And then I also use LispWorks because it can create windowed UIs out of the box that work on both Linux, Mac and Windows without modification. And I love its much-nicer-than-emacs editing and debugging.<p>I often have 2 different ones running at the same time because I really like to play up to their strengths.<p>So, I guess I&#x27;m questioning whether you need to omit one tool at the expense of the other, so long as your workflow allows them to play nice together.')
