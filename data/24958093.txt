May I pick your brain a bit more on this topic?<p>1. Do you know what were the main arguments for and against using typeclasses vs modules for abstraction? It&#x27;s interesting to read that traits wound up in the language against Graydon&#x27;s preferences.<p>2. There&#x27;s another commenter on this thread suggesting that &#x27;Typeclasses are just OOP interfaces&#x27; who has gotten a bit downvoted. To me they seem kind of the same thing, yet at the same time there&#x27;s this feeling that I&#x27;m overlooking something and typeclasses are likely &#x27;so much more powerful&#x27;. I just can&#x27;t figure out what that may be. So, are there any major differences between what interfaces are in OOP and what typeclasses&#x2F;traits are?')
