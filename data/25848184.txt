Item(by='CaptArmchair', descendants=None, kids=[25848920, 25848222], score=None, time=1611159386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25847643, text='&gt; users are generally pretty poor at managing software<p>This is an assertion which begs many questions.<p>Who are these users? What do you mean by &quot;generally&quot;? What do you mean by &quot;poor&quot;? What do you mean with &quot;managing software&quot;? Which software specifically? Why is &quot;managing software&quot; hard? What are specific case where this might be true? Is this statement falsifiable?<p>For instance, how does age, social background, education level, language, culture,... factor into the experience of &quot;managing software&quot;? Sure, the problem can&#x27;t be software itself in it&#x27;s entirety?<p>See, statements like these tend to break down once you start digging into the murky nuances and specificities of reality.<p>Moreover, accepting them at face value tends to reinforce a belief which isn&#x27;t based on fact: that the users of digital technology can&#x27;t manage their devices, and therefore shouldn&#x27;t be confronted with managing their devices.<p>... which is then translated and implemented in interfaces and systems that simply lack the functionality that gives users fine grained control over what is or isn&#x27;t installed.<p>Over a longer term, this promotes a form of &quot;lazy thinking&quot; in which users simply don&#x27;t question what happens under the hood of their devices. Sure, people are aware of the many issues concerning privacy, personal data, security and so on. But ask them how they could make a meaningful change, and the answers will be limited to what&#x27;s possible within the limitations of what the device offers.<p>A great example of this would be people using a post-it to cover the camera in the laptop bezel.<p>People don&#x27;t know what happens inside their machine, they don&#x27;t trust what happens on their machine, and there&#x27;s no meaningful possibility to look under the hood and come to a proper understanding... so they revert to the next sensible thing they have: taping a post-it over the lens.<p>The post-it doesn&#x27;t solve the underlying issue - a lack of understanding which was cultivated - but it does solve a particular symptom: the inability to control what that camera does.')
