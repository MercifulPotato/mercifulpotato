Item(by='danShumway', descendants=None, kids=[24673124], score=None, time=1601681840, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24667016, text='It&#x27;s not as robust as it could be, but Flatpak pretty objectively has better sandboxing than a .deb package once you get rid of the dynamic linking problem. That&#x27;s a good thing, because not all security bugs come from dependency management. But, ignore the sandboxing aspect for a second:<p>1. Ease of distribution of software should be a goal on Linux if it&#x27;s not already. The lack of ease of distribution of software contributes to decreased support from developers on other OSes, increased pressure and stress for distro maintainers, and some truly awful installation methods outside of the official package managers.<p>2. Proprietary software largely already does this, so granted, using Flatpak doesn&#x27;t really change anything. But that&#x27;s also kind of the point; proprietary software already ignores the software center, so adding better sandboxing to those apps is a really good idea.<p>3. There are reasons to want the ability to link against multiple versions of the same dependency even if you&#x27;re getting all of your software compiled by a single source upstream. Reconciling dependencies if you&#x27;re a distro maintainer is hard. Being able to quickly update any app that&#x27;s using an outdated dependency without worrying that you&#x27;re going to break another app is kind of nice.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that Flatpaks should be centrally managed. My point was that people are already distributing software outside of app stores. We already have the AUR, we already have `tar.gz` files (even from Open Source projects), we already have custom repos that might break&#x2F;rename&#x2F;embed old dependencies.<p>Flatpak is responding to a trend that already exists; trying to make it slightly better so that instead of a random install script somebody pulls off Github to curl dependencies, they get a well-defined package that&#x27;s less likely to bork their system or introduce a security hole into their other applications.<p>And that&#x27;s good. We want to live in a world where people can install software from any source -- we wouldn&#x27;t use Linux otherwise. But any system where people can install software from any source is going to have the same issues with dependency management and with trusting the author to keep their app up-to-date. All of the problems people are throwing at Flatpak in that specific area are just criticisms of the fact that Flatpak isn&#x27;t centrally controlled. They&#x27;re not really criticisms of the technology itself.')
