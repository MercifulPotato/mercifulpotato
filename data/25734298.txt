It was going to be a totally new freedom for users.<p>this was really the climax of so much of the aughts, such hope vested in it.<p>however development felt like it went really really slow. time kept ticking. the API centric days of the web kept seeming to grow further off all a while, while this set of protocols felt under-developed under-supported; using the reference stack was something I tried a couple of times &amp; never quite latched on to. i don&#x27;t think alternative stacks ever came about, even though I feel like this was a protocol-centric approach.<p>a lot of this reflects my own likely deeply embellished memory. OpenSocial felt like it represented a lot of hope for a web that could emerge, a culmination of a lot of what was happening on the web, in fancier form, distilled. and it feels like the turning point where that- to me- far better web failed to really materialize, failed to become a thing. there were still a couple more years of good API based systems being the norm&#x2F;expectation, but the wind was running out of the sails, each fief of the web collapsing back in to it&#x27;s own. Google Plus launched 2011, not long after OpenSocial was underway, and until it&#x27;s demise it never shipped an API for writing a post. you had to use their client to do almost anything. this was a ghastly shocking turn, back then, something that was almost unbelievable. now a days, clients like Signal &amp;al, this is de-jure, the norm. systems are only what they were designed for you the user to get.<p>i think of opensocial semi-regularly. at the time it felt like the first big ride out for the &quot;open web&quot;, like the beginnings of a new frontier. it is with enormous &amp; sadness &amp; disappointment that i report, here, a decade latter, that it feels like the last &amp; final ride out of the spirited, hopeful, connective open web, that things only ever got worse after.<p>one last little side note, one of the main people i associate with OpenSocial, Dave Recordon, was just named Biden White House&#x27;s Director of Technology: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yro.slashdot.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;21&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;2129251&#x2F;open-source-developer-and-manager-david-recordon-named-white-house-director-of-technology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yro.slashdot.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;21&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;2129251&#x2F;open-source-...</a>')
