It&#x27;s written in C++17 with some C features that only Visual C++ accepts.  Off the top of my head, some of the changes I needed:<p>* add extern &quot;C&quot; to some of the headers<p>* include stdbool.h for bool<p>* include stdint.h for uint64_t et al.<p>* include stdlib.h and change nullptr to NULL<p>* change constexpr to enum<p>* change static_cast to C-style casts<p>* rewrite a function to take a pointer, rather than a reference<p>* write a min() function<p>I probably could have rewritten it as standard C++, but that somehow seemed like a more daunting prospect at the time.')
