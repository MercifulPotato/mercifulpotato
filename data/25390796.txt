This system is often abused by small businesses who buy personal items along with their business items and then don&#x27;t pay tax on their personal items.  In theory they have to file use tax at the end of the year (the same use tax you&#x27;re supposed to file if you buy something out of state and aren&#x27;t taxed on it), but most people don&#x27;t.')
