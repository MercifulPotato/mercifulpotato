What’s the point of that? Publicly shaming the military  isn’t a way for her to achieve anything. She is a prisoner of the people responsible for the war crimes in Rakhine state. She doesn’t need to condemn anything. Everyone in Burma already knows who is responsible. It would achieve absolutely nothing.<p>And Desmond Tutu’s letter is patronizing and ridiculous. She has no power over the Rakhine situation. None. The only power she had was negotiating with the military. She doesn’t need to be told that people don’t deserve to be victims of war and ethnic strife.<p>We stand with Aung San Suu Kyi until the end.')
