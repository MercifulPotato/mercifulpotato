What’s the point of that? Publicly shaming the military  isn’t a way for her to achieve anything. She is a prisoner of the people responsible for the war crimes in Rakhine state.<p>Quite frankly, if you think ASSK supports genocide you’re a just completely ignorant of the situation.<p>And Desmond Tutu’s letter is patronizing and ridiculous. She has no power over the Rakhine situation. None. The only power she had was negotiating with the military. His letter even seems to imply she’s racist. It’s offensive!<p>You really believe that ASSK is a secret racist that hates Muslims and just doesn’t care about Rohingya? If so you have no clue about her or the situation.<p>We stand with Aung San Suu Kyi until the end.')
