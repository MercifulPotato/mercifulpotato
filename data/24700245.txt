Item(by='claudiawerner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602005144, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24699197, text='&gt;There is none, that I&#x27;m aware of.<p>One of the most prominent utilitarians (and ethicists of modern times), Peter Singer, argues for moral consideration of animals on utilitarian grounds. There are Kantians who do the same. The point of more significant controversy is the strength of that moral consideration, as put by SEP:<p>&quot;That non-human animals can make moral claims on us does not in itself indicate how such claims are to be assessed and conflicting claims adjudicated. Being morally considerable is like showing up on a moral radar screenâ€”how strong the signal is or where it is located on the screen are separate questions.&quot;<p>&gt;Utilitarianism does not bridge the &quot;is-ought gap,&quot; for instance.<p>That&#x27;s not utilitarianism&#x27;s job, that&#x27;s the job of a realist moral epistemology. It is perfectly possible, for instance, to believe in moral reletavism <i>or</i> moral objectivism while being a utilitarian. And although I think I side more with the Humean side of the is-ought debate with regard to moral realism, I can also see that moral realists have some good arguments that natural science is not the measure of everything.<p>&gt;Personally, I&#x27;m quite convinced that it&#x27;s impossible to create a rationally justified moral theory that grants rights to animals.<p>We&#x27;re not talking about rights, we&#x27;re talking about moral consideration. What we do with that consideration and how it figures into our priorities is only an orthogonal matter. Singer, for instance, in proposing that animals have moral consideration, would not say they have rights, in this case it would be permissible to kill an animal to save the life of a human, whereas it may never be permissible to kill a human to save the life of another human.')
