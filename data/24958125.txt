Later</i> found a lot of interesting things, but the existence of a contract based on what otherwise would appear to be a gratuitous open source license doesn&#x27;t appear to be one of them (at least in the Federal Circuit decision where that doesn&#x27;t appear to have been an issue in dispute; there is a passing reference to consideration when discussing another issue, and it&#x27;s clear that the District Court ruled -- and the Federal Circuit reversed on this point -- that the case should be resolved under contract rather than copyright terms, but it&#x27;s not clear from the Federal Circuit that the District Court ruled this way basses on the existence of a contract or based on the general legal principle that, but for the areas of legal distinction between bare licenses and contracts, licenses are applied based on contract law. And the Federal Circuit reversal wasn&#x27;t based on anything which would distinguish those, but on finding that the conditions in the Artistic License were valid as conditions rather the covenants, leaving bare copyright claims available in the event the terms were violated.<p>Artifex v Hancom also doesn&#x27;t seem to offer much, since that there was a contract doesn&#x27;t appear to be a point in dispute.')
