Simple example: legal cases. Lots of outlets report on them, but mainstream news almost never cites the case numbers and only sometimes links to source material (indictments etc.). Specialist legal websites usually do, but they have more limited reach, can&#x27;t cover everything, and tend to focus on cases that are legally interesting because they might establish or overturn a precedent. So they&#x27;re not great for covering crime news where many cases turn on the facts rather than legalities. On the flip side, mainstream news reports often do a terrible job of reporting the details of a case, some just rewriting prosecutors&#x27; press releases.<p>I think trying to come up with semantic mind maps in articles is likely to limit your audience as it&#x27;s an abstract critical process that&#x27;s subject to accusations of, er, subjectivity. On the other hand, a service that reliably led people to improperly cited source material would have value; examples like criminal indictments as described above, or local coverage of events that is then taken up and rewritten (often without attribution or backlinks) by larger outlets.<p>This could solve local news outlets&#x27; revenue problem too. I hate following up a story that goes to a small newspaper in Nowheresville which then asks for a subscription; I&#x27;m unlikely to consult that paper for anything else in the foreseeable future. but it&#x27;s not fair to the <i>Nowheresville Times</i> if <i>Big City News</i> rewrites their content without attribution. If <i>BCN</i> articles about events in Nowheresville were flagged as mere rewrites of <i>NT</i> content, the latter publisher would be able to make a strong argument for pass-through revenue to flow their way.')
