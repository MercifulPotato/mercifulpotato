Item(by='brmgb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609856706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25645079, text='&gt; If Paypal freeze your account then any money in it is simply lost (and your loss is Paypal&#x27;s gain!).<p>While this is completely tangential to the current discussion, I feel compelled to inform you that that&#x27;s not how it works. When Paypal freeze your account, your account is not deleted, you just can&#x27;t do anything with it. The money on it obviously remains yours. You just have to convince them that your account should be unfrozen or wait the maximum duration you agreed to in Paypal ToS - 180 days - after which they have to hand it back to you.')
