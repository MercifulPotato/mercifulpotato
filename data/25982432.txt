Agree about the verbosity issue, although, interestingly, it did not bother me at all in Pascal, which I learned as my 2nd language or so, before C. \nNoticed it even in the syntax of BCPL (C&#x27;s grandpa), and, IIRC, BLISS, and of course  Eiffel. The 2nd- and 3rd-last above were before my time, only read about them in books. I like Eiffel for many reasons, though. A real pity it did not get more popular.')
