Item(by='Nextgrid', descendants=None, kids=[25190174], score=None, time=1606150708, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25188195, text='&gt; getting a duplicate immobilizer chip is hard and usually requires an inside man in a dealer network<p>Unless you talk to the car&#x27;s ECUs over the diagnostic port and read out the secret values for creating a duplicate or outright patch out the immobilizer check in the firmware. There&#x27;s usually no auth on this and it&#x27;s just obscurity, which I expect to already be broken and exploited by tools available on the black market.')
