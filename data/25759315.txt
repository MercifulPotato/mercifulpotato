I ended up not to when I noticed you just picked the submissions having significant engagement, or the ones coming from straight from beakerbrowser or pfraze.<p>I guess adding links to past stories (at least when not posted by you dang) can signal different things; in this case, maybe including the title may have changed my first impression.')
