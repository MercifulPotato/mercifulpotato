Identifying a root note, major&#x2F;minor and number of sharps OR flats doesn&#x27;t really pin down a large number of actual scales.<p>For your purposes, it may be enough, but in more general terms, it&#x27;s woefully underspecified.<p>A better way for MIDI to have done this would have been to use a &quot;standard&quot; scale numbering system combined with a tonicity count. An example or two is given here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ianring.com&#x2F;musictheory&#x2F;scales&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ianring.com&#x2F;musictheory&#x2F;scales&#x2F;</a><p>I appreciate that your current project doesn&#x27;t need this, but if someone wanted to somehow create a MIDI file that included the information &quot;this uses Locrian with a flat second&quot;, the current SMF spec is inadequate.')
