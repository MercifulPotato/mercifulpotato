You can reach into your pocket or handbag, put the finger on the button and press it <i>while you&#x27;re taking it out</i>. By the time your phone is out it&#x27;s unlocked and on the home screen. I don&#x27;t recall seeing people failing to unlock their phones while paying with Apple Pay before but now it&#x27;s a reasonably common occurrence if they didn&#x27;t &quot;prime&quot; it ahead of time.<p>You can also quickly unlock your phone if it&#x27;s not directly aligned with your face without having to pick it up (let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s on a table or desk) or if you&#x27;re letting another person handle it.<p>Face ID is also annoying in bed, when either your face is obstructed by pillows&#x2F;blankets or if you&#x27;re holding your phone too close to your face and need to hold it further away for a second, illuminating the whole room in the process.<p>Touch ID also makes the authentication action explicit. If you&#x27;re handling someone else&#x27;s phone, you can look at the lockscreen without attempting to authenticate by simply keeping away from the home button and using the power button to wake it up. With Face ID the simple fact of looking at the phone is an authentication attempt and you&#x27;d be consuming the limited amount of attempts the owner has before they have to fall back to a passcode.')
