XSS is the idiot server sending the browser code that the server thinks is text. The browser&#x27;s job is to execute code the server sends it: the browser trusts the server, and it&#x27;s the server&#x27;s job to ensure what it&#x27;s sending as code is code and what it&#x27;s sending as text is text.')
