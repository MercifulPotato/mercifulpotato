They implement whatever process they needed and show a colleague who wants to do that too - either run the same process to build a new one. Your goal in this situation is to rapidly expand adoption inside that company and complex licensing will really slow you down. The second they need to place another order to get more access or sign a bigger cheque you will get dragged into sign offs and approvals and procurement and all kinds of wasted time.<p>&quot;Land and Expand&quot; is the right strategy for this type of solution and you should do everything you can to not slow down adoption. Your current pricing model is definitely limiting this and the initial plan of 350&#x2F;mo is quite a jump up - that WILL require levels of sign off and approvals and slow you down.<p>Try this exercise - create personas for users of your service (power user who wants to automate EVERYTHING, administrators who will use it because its their job, end users, managers) and work what is important to them and what variables will increase or decrease the speed and volume of adoption.<p>I think pricing based on number of users alone would be easier to understand and not restrict growth. If one person gets really into your product and wants to automate 100 processes DO NOT GET IN THEIR WAY! Let that champion sing your praises and tell everyone that will listen how incredible your product is, because in a few months time when they roll those processes out they will come back for more user licenses. And if you select the right features into the higher plans they may well opt for a more expensive plan to meet the needs of security, billing, management, reporting etc')
