It saves more face if it’s noticed earlier I&#x27;m not well suited for the task rather than letting it drag on.<p>This applies to any kind of work. Even if I’m taking on a home improvement project I can ask my wife what she thinks of my progress thus far and get a sense of how I should adjust course (up to giving up and calling an expert).')
