Item(by='geofft', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603636660, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24883661, text='I think the only meaningful definition of the term &quot;blockchain&quot; requires the idea of mining blocks &#x2F; addressing double-spend somehow. Otherwise it&#x27;s just a chain, a data structure we&#x27;ve had for decades. The term was introduced with Nakamoto&#x27;s paper, and the insight of that paper was mining &#x2F; proof-of-work, not hash chains.<p>It is technically true that one application of blockchains is solving problems that can be solved by regular chains, just like it is technically true that one application of self-driving cars is the ability to turn off the automation and let a human drive. But if someone asks about the applications of self-driving cars and you say &quot;Driving on the open road is fun,&quot; I think most people would not accept that as answering the question asked.<p>(And I&#x27;m not just being pedantic: blockchains have a significant computational&#x2F;environmental cost, so if you don&#x27;t need the block mining feature, you will get many orders of magnitude faster performance <i>and</i> run many of orders of magnitude cheaper <i>and</i> cause fewer negative externalities if you just use a plain old hash chain.)')
