I use Manjaro with XFCE as my daily driver and I haven&#x27;t had to tinker with shit on it since I set it up. Has nobody tried this distro?<p>Everything I need to do on it runs like a dream. Installing software is easier than anything, especially since I just use the GUI for that. I&#x27;ve had more trouble with Mac and Windows.<p>Even other Linux distros that I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t really stand up to Manjaro. Ubuntu and other Debian derivatives have you hunting down PPAs and using the terminal to add things - maybe that&#x27;s the &quot;tinkering&quot; that annoys people? If so, I wholly recommend you try Manjaro or another Arch based distro.')
