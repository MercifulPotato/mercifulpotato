Item(by='hnlmorg', descendants=None, kids=[25992485], score=None, time=1612197874, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25988917, text='The NES had a 54 colour pallet with up to 25 colours on screen (without mid-refresh pallet swapping, a technique some games employed to access more colours). By contrast NES.css uses 12 distinct colours. So how exactly is NES.css breaking &quot;that feel&quot;?<p>The biggest issue I complaint I could make about NES.css is that it&#x27;s type face has a weird ligature with &quot;fi&quot; which is somewhat distracting from the rest of the text. But even that is forgivable considering this isn&#x27;t a serious project. And before the obvious comments that &quot;the type face isn&#x27;t the same as in ${NES_GAME}&quot;: the NES, like all 8-bit systems I&#x27;ve programmed on, does allow you to define your own type faces as well. Thus Capcom games have different looking letters to Hudson games to Nintendo&#x27;s own releases.<p>I&#x27;ve got a NES and a Famicom (plus a Famicom FDD and 3D System). I still play them regularly. This CSS framework is clearly just a bit of fun but it does capture the general aesthetic of the era. All these complaints about colour pallets, while demonstrably wrong, is just nitpicking of the highest order. And the fact that I got downvoted in my earlier comment for saying &quot;naming things is hard&quot; (a point so true it has it&#x27;s own joke) is pretty evident of just how ridiculous the complaints are.')
