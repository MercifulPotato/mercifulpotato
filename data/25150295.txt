The day Whatsapp stops encrypting chats is the day I jump ship. The day Youtube blocks access to those using uBlock, I&#x27;ll stop going to Youtube. The day old.reddit.com and i.reddit.com stop working, sayonara Reddit.<p>I&#x27;ve come to realise that a) I just don&#x27;t derive TOO much value from any of these websites&#x2F;services, and b) I don&#x27;t mind paying for value added.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to pay for Youtube. But not 15 dollars a _month_! Youtube is an amateur platform. Charge me maybe 3 dollars a month. 5 if I&#x27;m feeling generous. But not 15. And certainly not when it&#x27;s bundled with Google tracking the living bejeesus out of me.')
