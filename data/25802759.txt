The really popular libs are often framework  agnostic (e.g. lodash, date-fns, etc), but there&#x27;s also a long tail of questionable quality libs: some react packages only work with webpack, some use unusual idioms (e.g. having to reference a node_modules path for some css, which doesn&#x27;t fly with yarn 2), some are unmaintained, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen cases where people were not aware that high quality vanilla libs exist, e.g. react-dnd vs dragula<p>There are a lot more wrapper libs for react, that is definitely true, but FWIW, I&#x27;ve come to despise them. Often you end up running into governance&#x2F;versioning issues (e.g. one moving part releases a new version but you&#x27;re stuck with the old one because a wrapper author doesn&#x27;t have time to fix the breaking change, or are MIA, etc), or there are missing&#x2F;broken pass-through options or whatever...')
