It is basically taking the idea of MVP down a notch to BVP (barely viable product).<p>I&#x27;ve never done this, but it makes sense. Why spend the engineering effort to go from Demo --&gt; BVP --&gt; MVP when you can just do the first jump and test the idea.<p>Everything is on a spectrum and -- given the vast graveyard of random ideas engineers build as side projects -- we should figure out a better way to drive better yield.')
