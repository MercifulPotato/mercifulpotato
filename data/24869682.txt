And flat earthers. And other anti-science folks. Yet, it has spread. THe other party has to be willing to actually accept the facts: Unfortunately, the very nature of a conspiracy is that they don&#x27;t accept the facts that others have.<p><i>This move will serve to push these movements underground to Tor or other uncensorable networks where they&#x27;re even harder to monitor. It also sends a message to them that they&#x27;re on to something (because if the QAnon conspiracy was real, the &quot;deep state&quot; would indeed try to snuff it out).</i><p>Good. You know what happens when the information isn&#x27;t easy to access? They have less reach. It gets harder to radicalize and convince others. It gets harder to stumble across the content. It isn&#x27;t like we can avoid them thinking they are onto something: Everything against them is a sign to that.<p>It isn&#x27;t like we really monitor them well enough to prevent all attacks, anyway.<p><i>I feel like this is such a bad precedent and will not end well. It will embolden the crazies. It&#x27;s also not clear where this is supposed to end? Flat earthers? 9&#x2F;11 truthers? Who&#x27;s next?</i><p>Folks whose conspiracies harm others. Most flat earthers aren&#x27;t going to cause harm to you unless you work in the right field. Some folks might just need watched from time to time. However, anti-vaxxers hurt others. Not only do they convince others not to vaccinate, but they put folks that can&#x27;t be vaccinated or the immunocompromised at risk.<p>In any case, it will end somewhere, like things always do.')
