Item(by='jasode', descendants=None, kids=[25904057], score=None, time=1611584888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903259, text='<i>&gt;Upvote to encourage more people to visit New Links on Hacker News</i><p>I experimented with the &quot;&#x2F;newest&quot; link a while back and I decided that it was not a good use of my limited reading time.  It was better to read the threads that the crowd voted up to the default HN front page or the &quot;&#x2F;best&quot; algorithm for some older threads.<p>The issue is that the &quot;&#x2F;newest&quot; would only work for me if it was a <i>whitelist</i> of the 50 HN users&#x27; opinions I trust.<p>(And nothing against you personally because I don&#x27;t know you but I notice that &#x2F;newest page has many more submissions by crazypython because you&#x27;ve submitted many articles in the last 24 hours.  Do I need to see <i>more</i> crazypython submissions?!?  I dunno.)<p>But I&#x27;m willing to be convinced that I should expend reading effort on the &#x2F;newest page again.')
