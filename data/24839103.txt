Item(by='quacked', descendants=None, kids=[24839961], score=None, time=1603210469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24838279, text='I am inclined to agree with the impossibility of reconciling a definition of &quot;power&quot; that does not involve violence and non-consensual control; a lot of modern writers and thinkers will use their own definition of &quot;power&quot; in order to frame it based on collectivism, as if &quot;power&quot; only exists if it&#x27;s conceded voluntarily by other people, but I think this is wishful thinking.<p>Oddly enough, they want to specifically use the word &quot;power&quot; because of its existing reputation, i.e. its connotations with acts of non-consensual control. They may say something like &quot;real power does not stem from violence, real power comes from a group and does not exist without group coherence.&quot; However, the only reason they&#x27;re focusing on the word &quot;power&quot; is because they know what it implies and are using its reputation as a concept in order to lend credibility to their own ideas, which themselves usually contradict the agreed-upon meaning of the &quot;power&quot;.<p>To be clear, this may not strictly apply to Hannah Arendt, but I see other people playing with the word &quot;power&quot; so frequently that I thought it was relevant to mention.')
