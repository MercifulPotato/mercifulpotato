Microsoft Teams isn&#x27;t very self-contained. (It&#x27;s also unequivocally the worst piece of Microsoft software I&#x27;ve ever used – probably worse than some of the early versions of Internet Explorer – but that&#x27;s not too relevant here.)<p>Did you know that Teams sends a big telemetry dump every few (somewhere between 3 and 15) seconds, if you&#x27;re on certain views? Well, there&#x27;s a <i>separate system</i> for each, meaning if you have two open at once it can double-send the telemetry. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Teams was responsible for the majority of an organisation&#x27;s network traffic.')
