The short cable is good as it keeps careless people from entangling and making a cable mess. \n2. Compared to the chademo plug, the Tesla plug is light and small and is less likely to get damaged if dropped accidentally. \n3. When you press the button on the plug, the car charging port opens automatically. Also the charging port closes automatically when unplugged. \n4. If port is broken, most Tesla owners have the etiquette to signal this to the next user by keeping the plug out. What would be better is to show this status like a light (visibly from 20ft at night). \n5. They show chargers right in the car display map and tell you how many are free to use no need for another app.<p>These are all nice small touches. The biggest mess the EV folks have made is having 5 different types of poorly designed chargers and plugs and current capacity. Having one type of plug and making them all fast will go a long way to better EV adoption. The oil companies have done much better and this is a shame.')
