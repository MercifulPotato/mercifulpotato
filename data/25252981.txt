The only solution is the market, it is available to people in our industry readily (which isn’t the case in many other industries).<p>Don’t overthink this, if the market cannot get you what you believe you are worth, then you simply are not worth that (yet). Going to your current company and asking for justice is pretty much a fools errand.<p>Don’t even think about asking for a raise or new position unless you validated your assumption on the open market first (a job offer with your desired role and salary).<p>As for being hurt, try to understand that companies are usually passive aggressive. This is what they understand. They won’t understand you getting riled up and explaining your feelings and leaving. What they will understand is, well, passive aggressiveness. Hunt for another job and just quietly leave, they’ll get it. Sadly, there are no winners in this game, but who cares - it’s not like you’re winning now right? A solid quiet fuck you is the only shred of justice you can get for yourself, and that’s the most you can ask for.<p>Lastly, infer intention. You are quietly being told something. Sounds like you are getting the message. Don’t make a ruckus and fuck off is the gist.')
