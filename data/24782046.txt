It did work on mobile prior to me refactoring things to the native event system, but, not since.  My best suspect.  I&#x27;ll give it a look for an upcoming update, thanks for reminding me.<p>Though, honestly when it did work, the performance was ... garbage. I don&#x27;t have too old of an Android phone or tablet, but it was still a performance struggle on both at simplest of settings and configurations.  HTML5 + SVG + DND &#x2F; touch libs simply weren&#x27;t stellar for this sort of thing.')
