I got a ton of value out of the above course ($1800).<p>The CSI course is 10-20 hours a week for the year.<p>Lastly, up to this point I&#x27;ve been self-taught through Udemy. The problem with that is, sometimes, if you&#x27;re stuck on something, it might take you 8 hours or more to figure it out. Where if you have someone knowledgeable, they can explain it in 15 minutes. Bradfield seems to do the best at that.<p>I&#x27;ve tried hiring a tutor outside of a MOOC and asking them for help, but it wasn&#x27;t quite the same as a teacher who is actively engaged with the material.')
