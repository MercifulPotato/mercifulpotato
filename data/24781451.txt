For the cloud I would suggest you take a basic practitioner exam, or at least a preparation course in a platform like whizlabs. There you would get a basic understanding of how networking is laid on the cloud.<p>For private, on-premises projects, it really comes down to what you have at hand. In this case maybe the Google SRE book would be good.
