Kubernetes is deprecating Docker as a container runtime, see: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;CHANGELOG&#x2F;CHANGELOG-1.20.md#deprecation<p>2. He mentioned reproducibility issues with the archives (containers) and that Docker is aware of this common issue. Personal notes here: I worked for a ML&#x2F;DL PaaS and never saw this issue in 3 years of works.<p>Instead he suggested to use OCI (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencontainers.org&#x2F;), but actually docker containers are OCI complaints! This is where started my confusion. Did he confuse docker runtime with containers?<p>From my understanding, even if you have a k8s cluster, you will not have any problem at running docker containers given that they are OCI compliant.<p>I&#x27;m feeling a bit confused here. My guess is that we were talking about Docker (which is an entire tech stack!) from different perspectives, for me is still the best way to build and ship containers, but for him was only about the runtime.<p>Should we still use docker (at least to build containers)? Would love to hear what you think.')
