Item(by='Siira', descendants=None, kids=[25639492], score=None, time=1609794055, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25636370, text='&gt; The reason the US dollar is valuable worldwide is because if you run into trouble, you can use the US courts to be made whole, and if that doesn&#x27;t work, assuming the dollar amount is high enough, the US military or Secret Service will use violence to make you whole again.<p>I have heard dollars are popular with crime orgs all the world over, who are unlikely to use or be able to use the dollars in US courts. Dollars are valued by people (and they exchange goods&#x2F;services for it), and Americans need them to pay their taxes.<p>&gt; If someone takes your Bitcoin<p>This is one big if, and it will still be prosecutable by courts, as evidenced by all the current legal cases about crypto theft.<p>&gt; Same thing with the Euro and all the other major currencies (and even a lot of the minor ones). They have the threat of legal recourse and military violence back them.<p>Military might matters only so far as it defends the country and makes it possible to produce stuff that other people want. A lot of countries with good military might (e.g., North Korea) don&#x27;t have valuable currencies.')
