Say as a draft e-mail? I don&#x27;t think there would be anything technical to stop me, and it&#x27;s not going to set off any automatic exfiltration flags.<p>But those notes could very well need to be classified. Does everyone in the Capitol with access to classified material have the necessary skills and incentives not to make notes about them on their personal computer?')
