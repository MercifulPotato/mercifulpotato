I am just saying that moonshot projects are supposed to be &quot;very high risk, high reward&quot; projects -- unlikely to work, but if they do would provide big benefits. Your points argue that this is a &quot;high risk, no reward&quot; project, which is not the way to run a <i>10-year</i> moonshot.<p>Occasionally starting moonshots as &quot;high risk, uncertain reward&quot; is OK for a short time, but if there is no clear reward on success after a year or two it might be continued as a PR or a charity, but not a moonshot.
