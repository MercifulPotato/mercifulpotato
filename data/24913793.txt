I recently came back to it for a project after doing software and just wow--the tooling is still absolutely awful.  Possibly worse than before.  Vivado in particular seems almost designed to foil version control systems.  Which files actually contain user input and are necessary to rebuild a project?  Why would you want to keep source and configuration files separate from derived objects?  Entire swaths of documentation and examples become immediately obsolete with each new tool version.  Not to mention infuriating bugs at every turn.')
