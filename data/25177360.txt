That seems very little.<p>Then I googled &quot;1 tablespoon to ml&quot; and found that about 15ml is the definition of tablespoon.<p>I just measured mine. They hold 10ml, and I consider them regular size.<p>Are American tablespoons larger? Or is the measure &quot;tablespoon&quot; independent from actual utensils, and whenever you read &quot;two tablespoons&quot; in a recipe, you know to pour three actual tablespoons?')
