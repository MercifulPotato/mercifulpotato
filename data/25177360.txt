Item(by='Tomte', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1606052495, title='Ask HN: How big are your tablespoons?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='This is kind of random, but I was watching a cooking video where the presenter said things like &quot;we add two tablespoons of olive oil&quot;, and it looks like they pour much more than that.<p>And that has been my feeling all along. &quot;Sprinkle a tablespoon of kosher salt on a chicken&quot;? That seems very little.<p>Then I googled &quot;1 tablespoon to ml&quot; and found that about 15ml is the definition of tablespoon.<p>I just measured mine. They hold 10ml, and I consider them regular size.<p>Are American tablespoons larger? Or is the measure &quot;tablespoon&quot; independent from actual utensils, and whenever you read &quot;two tablespoons&quot; in a recipe, you know to pour three actual tablespoons?')
