And the keyboard fiasco means they had a time when form won over function but I see them reverting to the old keyboard as function coming back into relevance.<p>I’m hoping for an Apple Silicon MacBook Air or something equivalent to to replace my heavy pro — but it’d be for personal use not professional given my reservations posted above and since Desktop Linux has come so far.')
