So to take a course I have to first sign-up for the platform, then sign-up for the specific course, then the material is arbitrarily split in micro-segments where you have to watch the professor droning on like in person education, then you have to answer some inane quizzes. The firs section is the SAME for all the courses, introduce yourself and blah blah. At the end you realize that the actual content was like 50% of a traditional college course. Do you want some credit? You have two options, you may pay 50-100 bucks for a useless certificate or the second option and the most insulting one, you take the course from a BIG NAME UNIVERSITY and you are requested to pay a high fee but the credit given is from a third-rate-municipal college for their  &quot;general requirements&quot; course.<p>In the case of OCW you are presented with THE SAME EXACT course the kids at MIT are taking and many many courses have full lecture notes, quizzes, and so on. You could argue that the experience is not the same but at least the content is, you don&#x27;t have to sign up for anything, the institution is actually world-class and the cost is 0.')
