Of course, bribes and that sort of thing from k-street usually prevent the need for use of dirt, but the more powerful one is, the more likely there&#x27;s a video of them somewhere on an Epstein alike property doing dirty things.<p>A real analysis of the three branches including the fourth estate will show the executive has gobbled them all up in the backroom, of course allowing the illusion to continue for the public. This bribery-blackmail system is bipartisan, and as for the executive... it&#x27;s the cabinet and shadow cabinet with real power.')
