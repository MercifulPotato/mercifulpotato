My first (and last) contract involved <i>knowing</i> how to code, but no actual coding. After a few weeks, I started coding in my spare time again. It wasn&#x27;t to keep myself employable. It just scratched an itch.<p>Now, I live from a website I built, and coding became one of my favourite hobbies again. I wake up, make pancakes, have coffee, put some good music on, and code until I&#x27;ve had enough. It&#x27;s not work; it&#x27;s my definition of a good day. I&#x27;m not trying to build a product, or my resume. I just work on whatever feels interesting.<p>There&#x27;s an article that changed my perspective on programming [0]. It argues that an app can be something you make for the delight of a select few, like a home-cooked meal. I&#x27;ve made many home-cooked apps since then: achievements for my personal website [1], a timeline for my personal life [2], and lots of small improvements to other private projects.<p>I guess the lesson here is that programming is a great hobby, but programming for money can be a soul-crushing compromise. I think you&#x27;d hate any other hobby if you turned it into a full time job.<p>---<p><i>Every programmer occasionally, when nobody’s home, turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on their computer. It’s a different file for every programmer. Sometimes they wrote it, sometimes they found it and knew they had to save it. They read over the lines, and weep at their beauty, then the tears turn bitter as they remember the rest of the files and the inevitable collapse of all that is good and true in the world.</i><p><i>This file is Good Code. It has sensible and consistent names for functions and variables. It’s concise. It doesn’t do anything obviously stupid. It has never had to live in the wild, or answer to a sales team. It does exactly one, mundane, specific thing, and it does it well. It was written by a single person, and never touched by another. It reads like poetry written by someone over thirty.</i><p><i>Every programmer starts out writing some perfect little snowflake like this. Then they’re told on Friday they need to have six hundred snowflakes written by Tuesday</i> [3]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.robinsloan.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;home-cooked-app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.robinsloan.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;home-cooked-app&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nicolasbouliane.com&#x2F;achievements" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nicolasbouliane.com&#x2F;achievements</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nicbou&#x2F;backups" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nicbou&#x2F;backups</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stilldrinking.org&#x2F;programming-sucks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stilldrinking.org&#x2F;programming-sucks</a>')
