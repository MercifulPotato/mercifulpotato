Most young people will start by cycling to see friends and get about, change to a moped when they have the money, and then one day maybe have a car. So when you see a cyclist they are very much &#x27;you&#x27; and not &#x27;other&#x27; - there is also great support of the French cycling team and local teams, so there is a feeling of pride when you see cyclist out.<p>I can only speak for the UK, people certainly see you (on a bike) as something that is impeding their journey, rather than a fellow human getting to work&#x2F;out to enjoy the location.<p>I&#x27;ve been told so many times that I don&#x27;t pay for the roads (I do) and that I&#x27;m slowing them down - in London while you might overtake a cyclist they will certainly catch you up at the next light.')
