How many elements does a collection have, if it only has a 0th element? Is it 0? What about the size of a collection [0th, 1st, 2nd]? Or [0th .. 100th]? In language, we use 1-based indices for collections because we enumerate the elements based on counting them. A zeroth element doesn&#x27;t exist, because if we had 0 elements, the collection would be empty.<p>Indexing of natural collections is based on cardinality, not ordinality.')
