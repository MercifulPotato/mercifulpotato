A 70% increase in an <i>exponential</i> gain leads to many multiples more cases.<p>You could halve the death rate in that scenario and still have 10x the number of deaths or more.<p>Run two exponential series: one at 1.1x, one at 1.7x. Start at 1,000 cases each. Death rate 1% for the first, 0.5% for the second. Assume doubling in a week. Check new cases and thus new deaths after eight weeks.<p>2143 new cases on week eight fir the second one, 21.4 deaths.<p>110,199 new cases on week eight for second one, resulting in 550.5 deaths.<p>20x worse. And unfortunately the new strain doesn’t seem to be less deadly, so it would be 40x worse if death rate the same.')
