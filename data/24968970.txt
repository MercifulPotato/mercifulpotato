If I switch the BIOS from &quot;balanced&quot; to &quot;performance&quot; mode, the ThinkPad will run a bit faster but within an inch of thermal shutdown. I might be able to overclock the Pi enough to achieve parity with the throttled i7.<p>Eight years ago, I&#x27;d never had guessed that we&#x27;d see the Pi turn the corner to become a usable general-purpose desktop.')
