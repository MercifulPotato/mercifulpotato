Although there&#x27;s a clear consensus that reducing emissions is great, but what&#x27;s next?\nWhat do you do with the emissions you inevitably produce? As an amateur, it&#x27;s super confusing:\n- offsetting is criticised as &quot;paying of your guilt without fixing the problem&quot;\n- carbon capture is next to impossible as an individual because there are so few projects to sponsor, besides planting trees which has questionable returns in the long run since who can guarantee these trees will not be burned 50 years from now?<p>Any ideas or good overviews are welcome.')
