For most of my life I just drank caffeine as if it were synomynous with hydration - coffee in the morning, diet sodas in the afternoon, teas in the evenings. And for years, I wondered why I couldn&#x27;t sleep...<p>Withdrawal was surprising. On the first day, I fell asleep at 6pm until the next morning. The next day, 8pm until morning. Felt ill for a week. Ached all over. The waistband on my pyjamas was uncomfortable... felt like I had the flu, until my one allowed morning coffee, which made it all go away.<p>Never went full cold turkey, but compared to routine intake, it was close enough. I still have my coffee in the morning, but in the evening, I&#x27;m asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow. For the first time since I was a kid.')
