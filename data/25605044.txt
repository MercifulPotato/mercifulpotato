Tell me we still know how to speak of kings!”3 Generations of scholars have limped along, translating Hwaet! as “Listen!” or “Yes!” or “Lo!” or “Hail!” (Why not “Belay that!” or “Tut! Tut! I say!”?) Headley has had the wicked idea that what we’ve needed all along is Beowulf: The Frat-Boy Chronicles. If she had continued in this cheeky vein, Headley might have altered Beowulf Studies forever.&quot;</i><p>and lol<p><i>&quot;Headley apparently knows little Old English, and it shows. In preparation, she read all the translations by women she could find.&quot;</i><p>Stunning and brave.<p>Do yourself a favor and put in the couple of hours it requires to just read it in the original language. Or if you can&#x27;t be arsed to do the trivial work required, as apparently the author of this &quot;translation,&quot; read Rebsamen.')
