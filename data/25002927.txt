Item(by='mschuster91', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604616414, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25001479, text='You don&#x27;t need to bribe people if you are on the run, and as long as you&#x27;re not on the run for a fresh murder&#x2F;rape case with your pictures spread all over the papers, law enforcement won&#x27;t actively go out and fleece neighborhoods looking for you - they <i>will</i> turn up at your home, your work and any known relatives&#x2F;associates though.<p>First thing is to get away at least one town or two, preferably a couple counties, from where people might recognize you. Use rail or a taxi, and shut down your phone.<p>Pay hotels, food, gas, <i>anything</i> in cash so it can&#x27;t be used to track you down, get rid of your old phone&#x2F;sim card&#x2F;computer, <i>don&#x27;t use Facebook to contact family or &quot;associates&quot;</i>, don&#x27;t do drugs or at least stay away from trouble (bar fights) and for heavens sake don&#x27;t drive a beater car, use rail or bus instead (flights are monitored).<p>Even crossing borders is easy in many cases. Dress up as a hiker and go for it. If you&#x27;re not in a narc smuggling area and have sea access, buy a small rubber boat (with cash) and use that to get out of the country.<p>When cash runs out: agriculture, anything in the hospitality area (hotels, motels, pubs, restaurants), cleaning and moving services, construction&#x2F;teardown <i>always</i> have high demand for new able and willing staff, pay in cash and don&#x27;t give a fuck about who you are as long as you show up on time and do your work without stealing stuff. If you&#x27;re into sex work and it&#x27;s legal where you are, it&#x27;s a great way to make money.<p>You need a place to stay? Every area has some sort of ... shoddy district with cheap lodging, Craigslist or whatever can get you actual cheap rentals.<p>Other things to avoid? Mentioning you&#x27;re on the run, bragging about whatever crime you did, stealing, getting into fights, driving a car (random traffic stops, &quot;your tail light is broken&quot;), breaking more than one law at a time.<p>You can get a fairly long run if you stick to the above, many years even without resorting to bribery. If you are in an area where bribery is the norm though - South America, Eastern Europe, Russia, Africa come to mind - then by all means go for it, might make your getaway a whole lot easier.')
