Item(by='pstch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604853215, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25024639, text='There are lots of things to be said about Nix and NixOS, and many of these things have been mentionned in this page, but there&#x27;s one thing I really like with Nix : the fact the the configuration is expressed as a function that takes its own result as argument, and that the final configuration is the fixed point of that function. This is a very powerful concept, as these functions can be composed together.<p>I think this idea is not specific to Nix, and I wish it was used a lot more in configuration languages. For example, it was something I really missed when using Ansible. The lack of this feature means that writing the inventory is much harder than it needs to be, and I&#x27;ve seen <i>horrible</i> hacks that try to get around this.')
