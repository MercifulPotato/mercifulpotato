OpenCL compute benchmarks on the packaged driver are coming in a separate article today. The OpenCL&#x2F;compute support for Radeon RX 6800 series is working and better off than the current RDNA 1 support. It&#x27;s great to see things working in the limited testing thus far. Presumably for the imminent ROCm 4.0 release they will also have the Big Navi support independent of the packaged driver, but in any case great to see it coming.&quot;')
