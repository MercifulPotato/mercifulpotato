You hear this all the time on message boards; for instance, it&#x27;s at times been an article of faith around here that reference checks aren&#x27;t OK, unless they&#x27;re directed specifically to people candidates provide as references. But that&#x27;s not how reputation works in reality! In reality, people can share unfavorable information about you for their own reasons and, as long as that information isn&#x27;t false, there really isn&#x27;t much you can do about it. Nor should you be able to! You can&#x27;t coerce random people into not sharing true things about you.<p>You italicize &quot;blog&quot;, like there&#x27;s some important norm of &quot;blogging&quot; that was violated here, but Alexander wrote that blog for years under his own name, and, as I said upthread, some of his better-known pieces originally bore that name. I get that he had a bad experience when employers came across it, and can totally understand why he&#x27;d want to undo the decision to publish his name.

If not, where&#x27;s the line between me and Alexander?<p>Ultimately, I think the NYT made the right decision here: that Alexander simply isn&#x27;t important enough to publish a profile under these fraught circumstances. But the next person in this situation might not fit that fact pattern; they might actually be important, not just a &quot;blogger&quot;, and it&#x27;ll be important that nobody in the NYT buys into this message board kabuki dance about how we have to cooperate to maintain a psuedonymity anybody who can reach Google can puncture.')
