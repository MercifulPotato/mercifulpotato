Going by your knee-jerk reaction that maybe a few people died from an internet forum, we also should absolutely abolish automobiles, right? I mean, automobiles crashes have literally killed more humans in ONLY America, than both world wars, terrorism, and extremist hate speech combined. Why do vehicles get a pass? And then this just leads us to the old &quot;NERF the world&quot; sentiment in which, every single thing humans do is dangerous enough that maybe we shouldn&#x27;t allow anyone to do anything at all? Right?')
