This is why I recommend Kafka for _data_, rabbit for _tasks_. The article doesn&#x27;t really explain how this works, but I&#x27;m guessing that one service holds commands in memory, then sends http messages to the workers. As they noted, you end up with lost tasks on restart, and that&#x27;s the big gaping hole that a lot of people would not want to fall into - your mileage may vary. I assume the kafka reader service has to also track how busy each worker is, also lost on restart.')
