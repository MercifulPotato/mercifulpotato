Item(by='yorwba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604362438, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24974180, text='&gt; Yiddish and Ladino are basically German and Italian, respectively, only written down with Hebrew characters, with some words from it.<p>Yiddish is basically German in the same way that Dutch is basically German: it&#x27;s often possible to directly translate a word with some simple letter substitutions, but the choice of different letters in each language&#x27;s orthography reflects an underlying difference in pronunciation.<p>E.g. אוי וויי is often transliterated as &quot;oy vey&quot; while the corresponding Standard German pronunciation would be &quot;au weh&quot;. If you ignore the usual Hebrew letter values and pretend that it&#x27;s actually an unorthodox orthography for Standard German (א glottal stop, וי au, וו w, יי eh), I&#x27;ve found written Yiddish quite easy to get used to as a native German speaker, but understanding it spoken aloud is much more difficult.')
