I might help you fake things like that but only if i really like you, and still feel a little skeezy about it cuz its wrong.<p>Less polite, more arrogant demands for TLDR (which is how many come across) are worse. Feels like being bullied into helping someone cheat.<p>By comparison, try this: &quot;I read half of this and am totally lost? Can someone help?&quot; The same question, but the feeling is much different with just a little implied humility.')
