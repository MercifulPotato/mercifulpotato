Or is it more the concern of those still alive?<p>I wouldn&#x27;t weigh them. It could go either way.<p>The problem for the dead is the loss of opportunity. The waste. If I have some amount of cash in my wallet, what I&#x27;m able to do with it will depend on the market that&#x27;s available to me. Maybe I won&#x27;t be able to afford the same things others do in other places, but I should be able to take <i>some</i> advantage of it. Dying is dropping that cash down the gutter. It&#x27;s utterly wasteful, to put it politely.<p>Doing the same with your time alive is even more so because you can&#x27;t get it back.<p>Even the most minimal use of your 5 senses is a good use. Even dreaming while sleep is a good use. Even just thinking is a good use. The opportunity to use that time for anything at all is lost when you die.<p>I&#x27;m sure there must be someone that would love to be in your shoes. You say you got your pay reduced by $10,000 a year. I know people that likely make only 1&#x2F;4 of that a year. Then there&#x27;s the terminally ill. The envy! How luxurious of you to not want your life.<p>At the very least, couldn&#x27;t you seek someone terminally ill and live to fulfill their dream? Live the life they wanted? It could be a simple one. Doesn&#x27;t matter if you don&#x27;t manage to fulfill it, just part-way is fine. Someone else might be able to continue from where you left off if that happens. And it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re planning on doing something else anyway.')
