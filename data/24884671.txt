The world needs to stand up to their lone wolf style. If we do not stand up against the US now it will only embolden the evil. Vote with your wallets. Avoid using US made products and services. Pressure&#x2F; Make laws for retailers to enforce Country of Origin information for each and every product. The web is flooded with services made in the US that spread their propaganda (antivax and QAnon started in the anglosphere) made to keep their population feeble and powerless (some of them even die because they cannot afford insuline). The US, Trump and their 2 party system must not be emboldened any further.')
