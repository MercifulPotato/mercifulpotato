And I&#x27;m not in any way an Apple &#x27;fan-boy&#x27; - I&#x27;m very much opposed to how deceptive the app-subscription system can be, and hate the monetized apps aimed at children (and have written to Apple many times about these matters).<p>But pretty much the only substantive argument in favor of using legislation to attack Apple&#x27;s &#x27;monopoly&#x27; always seems to boil down to &quot;their system is so much better than the alternatives that the user is locked-in&quot;.<p>If that&#x27;s the best HN has got, then I think the standard stance is basically sour grapes.<p>Anyway, as others have pointed out, Amphetamine could totally have been distributed <i>outside</i> the supposed &#x27;monopoly&#x27; store environment - so the app-developers bleating was especially egregious.')
