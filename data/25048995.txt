My wife would kick me out of the house if I brought any more bikes home!<p>Seriously though, that would be amazing. I know several people who never would have considered being a “serious biker” but bought an electric bike. Now they ride to work, out to eat, to the store, everywhere!<p>Electric bikes are great for commuting when it’s warm outside because you can rely on the motor and not be drenched in sweat when you arrive to work. And if it’s cold out you can use the motor less and pedal to stay warm, plus you’ll get some bonus exercise!')
