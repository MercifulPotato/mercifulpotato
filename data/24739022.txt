Arguably, the Wintel monopoly did us all a favour, providing a stable backwards-compatible monoculture for a few decades so that people could focus on building applications instead of OSs. You could argue that Linux would never have taken flight without that monoculture to grow in.<p>And maybe Operating Systems aren&#x27;t that important any more. I think having two or three major ones in play is about right. Innovation can happen in the layer on top and feed back into the OS as needed.<p>There&#x27;s now a more important layer below the OS, the virtual host&#x2F;data centre&#x2F;cloud layer in which OSs sit like atoms. Thats the more important area now. If &#x27;operating system&#x27; means &#x27;something running on hardware that lets us run applications&#x27; then the hodge podge of systems that make Data Centres or groups of Data Centres work are the new &#x27;operating systems&#x27;. Things like Kubernetes are the prototypes for future features of those operating systems.')
