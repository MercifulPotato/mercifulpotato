In the real world we have people in power, with their own personal interests, with institutions that are ever more distant from the people and with ever less consequences to face when they do wrong.<p>The one exception is perhaps Switzerland, and this would be more due to how local governments and cantons prevail over national leaders. The institutions are <i>small</i> and <i>limited</i> in reach. Aside from them, every model (US, the EU, China, Russian) relies on over-centralization and ever-expanding reach of the institutions and the consequential subversion of said institutions to the favor of interest groups.<p>So, unless you are Swiss I really don&#x27;t have any reason to believe you actually have any power over the government, and I really don&#x27;t believe you should be defending to give them even more power and attributions.<p>&gt; maximises profit to the detriment of consumers<p>Last I checked, no one forced me to buy anything from Apple. I don&#x27;t think closed systems are beneficial for me, so I don&#x27;t buy them. No one forced me to buy anything from Google, either. No one forced me to buy a car or to live in an expensive metro area or even check any trendy bar with overpriced drinks. No one forced me to buy home appliances that can I not repair.<p>&quot;Well, where I live there is only one internet provider, so I am forced to use it&quot;. No, you are not. It&#x27;s just that the inconvenience of not having internet at home outweighs your willingness to get your community and put together an alternative. Also, more likely than not, the reason that there is no alternative is due to <i>REGULATIONS</i> that lobbyists from big telco managed to pass so that they have an advantage.<p>To truly believe that &quot;regulations creates a level-playing field&quot; is beyond naive. It&#x27;s borderline harmful to you and for society at large.')
