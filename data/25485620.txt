I bought a very new laptop that just launched last year. The windows version out of box was I believe 1909. I haven’t yet tried running LTSC on it yet but worried about drivers or other issues. My CPU in the laptop was released in March 2020 and 1809 was released in 2018. I didn’t think it was too good of an idea because of that, even though prior I always ran LTSC and would love to go back if I didn’t have to worry about too new of hardware messing with it.')
