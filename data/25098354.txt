Things like forced sterilization are obviously unethical but the reasons have absolutely nothing to do with gene editing. Maybe we could make this more concrete if you gave some specific examples of the ethical claims against eugenics that you are referring to, which you think also apply to gene editing. Also, if you are talking about public appetite, I think it&#x27;s worth observing that this is the first time I&#x27;ve heard someone compare gene editing to eugenics (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been done before, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t seem common), and your comment is at the very bottom of the page.')
