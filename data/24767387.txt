There wouldn&#x27;t have to be a 1:1 ratio of senators to representatives. Maybe there would be something like 1 senator&#x2F;2 representatives?<p>Or, if we kept the same 2 senators&#x2F;state maybe we split high population states into smaller states so that we don&#x27;t have huge gap between number or residents&#x2F;senator?<p>Personally, I think we should probably move in the unicameral direction. I don&#x27;t think that &quot;fast-changing&quot; adaptability is a negative in this modern world.')
