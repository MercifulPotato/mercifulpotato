We&#x27;re a fast growing startup, over 500 customers from around the world love our product.<p>Our tech stack: Vue.js front-end, various back-end applications using both Ruby on Rails and Python&#x2F;Django. Many 3rd party API integrations. Lots of our stuff already runs on Kubernetes, and we&#x27;re working towards migrating our main app. Unit tests, continuous integration and deployment are core to our dev process.<p>We&#x27;re a small team that&#x27;s mostly based in London, but looking to grow significantly in the near-term.
