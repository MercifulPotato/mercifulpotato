Also it just isn&#x27;t for everyone. I love much of those things but struggle to get anything from contemporary dance. Precisely because I haven&#x27;t invested much time or effort into it.<p>Finding a local contemporary artist scene and socialising with these people can be extremely rewarding, especially if you yourself are not a full time artist.')
