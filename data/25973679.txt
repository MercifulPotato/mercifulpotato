They cannot justify owning a console and purchasing $60 games. But they&#x27;d be easy to sell on a $5 monthly games on demand subscription.<p>They will be playing with bluetooth gamepads (5ms latency) on their TV (10-20ms latency) using Wifi (5-10ms latency), so the internet streaming delay of &lt;10ms from an edge server will be barely noticeable.<p>For example, Stadia is featuring &quot;Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris&quot; which is a perfect game for high-latency unskilled casual play.')
