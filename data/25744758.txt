Item(by='roelschroeven', descendants=None, kids=[25745582], score=None, time=1610446667, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25743322, text='&gt; Absolutely agree with his gripes in the first article about the traditional historically-oriented introduction to QM confusing students.<p>Off-topic but that&#x27;s also my problem with any introduction to philosophy I&#x27;ve seen. This old Greek said something. This other old Greek thought something else. Some German philosopher said still something else.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s what philosophy is all about, in which case I&#x27;m perfectly happy not to learn anything about it. But I have the feeling there really is something interesting to be found, if only the books would talk about that instead of painstakingly reconstructing the whole history of the field.')
