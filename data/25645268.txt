Seems clear that this is for a thread requiring C connections <i>simultaneously</i> to get its work done. That would make it a necessary calculation to avoid deadlocks. I don&#x27;t see this being necessary in a Rails type app where there&#x27;s usually one connection per request, but if one were using Go, setting a max connections parameter, and then simultaneously checking out more than one connections to do work, there&#x27;s an easy chance of deadlocks.<p>Will add a section talking about that and this formula.')
