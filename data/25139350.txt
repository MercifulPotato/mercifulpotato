They’re pretty rigorous about conforming to style and it’d be hard for the (presumably English-speaking) editors to uphold the same standards for a language they don’t share. Not to mention each language would probably require its own style guide. I know French literature often uses guillemets or a leading em dash where English uses quotes.')
