What gets copied into the clipboard is actually the Canonical url rather than the actual one you are at.<p>So for &#x2F;amp&#x2F; pages, it ends up copying the non-amp url.<p>imo, it&#x27;s a bad experience because sometimes canonicals and non canonicals aren&#x27;t exactly the same.  For example, if I&#x27;m looking at a specific filter or sort, then it might make sense for the canonical to be the non-sorted version. But if I&#x27;m sharing a specific url, I want it to share exactly what I&#x27;m looking at.')
