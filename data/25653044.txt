He could pay cash, no issue. They gave him many thousands of dollars of discounts for financing it if he promised to keep the loan for 3 payments (or their fee from the bank would get clawed back).<p>He held up his end of the deal, paying 18% interest on a massive truck loan for 3 months.<p>The sad thing is many people would do the same thing without the ability to pay it off in full. At that interest rate and a ~7-10 year loan term, you&#x27;ll be upside down on the vehicle until the very end of the loan. And most people wouldn&#x27;t keep the vehicle that long because something else changes in their life...or they just want a newer vehicle.')
