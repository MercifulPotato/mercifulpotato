Republicans and Democrats are basically arguing over the specifics of content moderation by these social media companies. Republicans think the moderation goes too far or is politically biased while Democrats argue the moderation doesn&#x27;t go far enough and want dissent they call &quot;disinformation&quot; removed from social media. Lindsey Graham at multiple points indulged in McCarthyite questioning about the political beliefs of Twitter and Facebook employees.<p>All the while, Section 230 is being held hostage even though it has absolutely nothing to do with the content moderation these companies currently perform. Few in elected office seem to have much regard for the 1st Amendment. At this point there&#x27;s clear bipartisan support for curtailing the Section 230 protections that make these discussions possible.')
