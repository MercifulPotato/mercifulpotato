Surely that’s still valuable?<p>Also a separate study seemed to show anywhere between 60% to 80% efficacy is needed depending on vaccine coverage - 70% requires 75% coverage [2].<p>&gt; Simulation experiments revealed that to prevent an epidemic (reduce the peak by &gt;99%), the vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60% when vaccination coverage is 100% (reproduction number=2.5–3.5). This vaccine efficacy threshold rises to 70% when coverage drops to 75% and up to 80% when coverage drops to 60% when reproduction number is 2.5, rising to 80% when coverage drops to 75% when the reproduction number is 3.5.<p>Also, does anyone know - supposedly the Oxford vaccine had swab tests for the virus every week to catch cases even if trial participants weren’t showing symptoms, whereas for the Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech vaccine they were only swabbing if someone showed symptoms. Would that not have a large effect on efficacy numbers?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7361120&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7361120&#x2F;</a>')
