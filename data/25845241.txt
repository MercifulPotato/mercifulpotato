It&#x27;s designed to force people to handle the damn error as near to the call as possible.<p>I&#x27;ve seen way too many programs with a single exception handler right at the base of the program, that just goes &quot;whoops, something bad happened, bye!&quot;. I&#x27;ve even seen this anti-pattern used with Go&#x27;s panic-recover mechanism.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting find though, that the actual performance cost for checking the error return is random, variable, and small. Good to know :)')
