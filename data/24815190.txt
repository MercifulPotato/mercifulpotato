Looking forward to giving this one a read.<p>The caps point is interesting to me.  I can&#x27;t think of a good reason why caps should be shouting, but I definitely agree with it.  Hilarious to remember back when mixed case was not the norm.  (Also, awkward to work in languages where symbols are case sensitive.  Worse when they are case significant.)<p>I&#x27;m curious on the tree representations you mean.  Most make some use of whitespace, that I have seen.  But they lose the portability of the representation that I have with easy copy&#x2F;paste to other environments.  (To and from chats, emails, etc.)')
