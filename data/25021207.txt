Item(by='aksss', descendants=None, kids=[25024303], score=None, time=1604793996, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25020419, text='Well, again - videos of poll watchers being denied access to polling places; videos of political material posted at the entrance to multiple polling places; videos of official party observers being denied access to the ballot counting process; ballots with no postmarks being accepted after Election Day; software glitches in MI that alter the vote count; States abandoning witness requirements for absentee ballots - these are all real events and people don’t know whether or how these samples should be extrapolated.<p>Further, when the body of material lacks metadata to support chain of custody investigations, or observers can’t witness counting processes, it’s pretty disingenuous to say no evidence can be found. The control failures are the evidence.<p>There are very real bad examples, and we don’t know how representative they are. There are critical control failures (missing information) that make investigation difficult.<p>If you want to convince people everything is fine, take away these distractions by shoring up the process - transparency and authentication controls would go a long way towards fending off the accusations of fraud.')
