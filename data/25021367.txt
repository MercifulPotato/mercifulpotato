This list seems hit-or-miss, but I spot checked a few entries with birth years before that (excluding Jan 1900 since that might be used as NULL) and it showed them as having voted via absentee ballot. I don&#x27;t know if the number is large enough to make any meaningful difference, but it&#x27;s not a good look.')
