And yet, whenever I see or hear the term &quot;string&quot;, I associate it with &quot;sequence of characters&quot;, not with &quot;cord&quot;. Same goes for &quot;thread&quot;, but even more strongly [1]<p>So I agree, you don&#x27;t have to speak fluent English to be able to read and write programs. Knowledge of English grammar won&#x27;t help (except for reading comments â€“ if they exist...), and the vocabulary is small, specialized, and has little to do with colloquial language.<p>[1] Or should it be &quot;...even stronger&quot;? I don&#x27;t think so, because it refers to the verb &quot;goes&quot;, so it should be an adverb, right?')
