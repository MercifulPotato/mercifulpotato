Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24945998], score=None, time=1604016185, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24937574, text='&gt; Greenwald has in his contract that he&#x27;s not subject to editorial oversight<p>Really? Where can I inspect that contract? Clearly, the terms that allow him to publish elsewhere if TI doesn&#x27;t want to publish his stuff that he claims exist seem at odds with the claim that there are terms that he is free to publish whatever he wants in TI without TI exercising editorial control.<p>I suspect that the story he is painting about the contract terms is misleading, as it makes no sense as presented.')
