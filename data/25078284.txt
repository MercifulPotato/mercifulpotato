You can switch to a different company if you don&#x27;t like pixel phones and get almost the same experience. You can switch between manufacturers and use windows&#x2F;Linux as well. The same isn&#x27;t true about Mac os or iOS.<p>This doesn&#x27;t really make much sense to me. Unless you are going with a niche privacy-oriented fork of AOSP, any non-iOS smartphone you move to will still be controlled by Google. And if you do move to one of those forks, you are essentially migrating to an entirely new ecosystem anyways. It&#x27;s no easier to leave Google&#x27;s Android ecosystem than it is to leave iOS or macOS.')
