Comparing ARM and x86 scores is an exercise in futility as there are simply too many factors to work through. It also doesn&#x27;t include all workload types.<p>For example, I can say with 100% confidence that M1 has nowhere near 32MB of onboard cache. Once it starts hitting cache limits, it&#x27;s performance will drop off a cliff as fast cores that can&#x27;t be fed are just slow cores. It&#x27;s also worth noting that around 30% of the AMD power budget is just Infinity Fabric (hypertransport 4.0). When things get wide and you have to manage that much wider complexity, the resulting control circuitry has a big effect on power consumption too.<p>All that said, I do wonder how much of a part the ISA plays here.')
