Item(by='dropit_sphere', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611009090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25823907, text='&quot;Engineer&quot; sounds like kind of a moving target.  The only &quot;real&quot; engineers design...engines.  So it&#x27;s worth asking what the actual value is of &quot;engineering.&quot;<p>In my mind, there are two: making stuff, and tolerances.<p>Making stuff is magic.  Most people reading this can sit down at a computer and formalize an idea such that the computer can do it.  Most people can&#x27;t do this.  It is valuable for the same reason the ability to design a car or escalator or rocketship is valuable.<p><i>Tolerances</i> is all about providing certain guarantees about the stuff you make.  I think most developers <i>could</i> hit those guarantees...if they were ever verbalized.  What, you want me to decrease memory usage by 50%?  Actually, I probably <i>can</i> do it.  At the very least, I can point you some academic papers as to why it&#x27;s impossible.<p>But nobody has ever asked me to do that, ever (except in interview questions).  I suspect my experience is common among developers.<p>So, from a &quot;making-stuff&quot; perspective, yeah, we&#x27;re engineers.  From a &quot;tolerances&quot; perspective, most of us aren&#x27;t, but wouldn&#x27;t have much trouble becoming them.  It&#x27;s just that no one actually wants that.')
