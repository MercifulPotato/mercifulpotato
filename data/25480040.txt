It also doesn&#x27;t annoy me too much since I can just go to definition, but if it&#x27;s only 3-4 lines long I would rather have it in the block itself so I can read it at a glance.<p>&gt; try-catch is generally an anti-pattern.<p>Exceptions are a very useful part of the language if you use them right (to divert code flow in predictable ways in unpredictable scenarios), although I agree it can be easy to go wrong.<p>Regarding your juniors, that seems more of a problem of skill or determination than anything. Debugging in Java is relaxing, it has stack traces, a debugger, a nice IDE, no segfaults.. a 15 line function should not be an obstacle. I would even prefer to have more of the code on the screen sometimes so I can get the implementation details in my head .')
