I don&#x27;t think it helps anything to have m1 macOS binaries on my intel mbp.<p>- again, yes it would make sense to have this if you&#x27;re booting from an external drive.  Should be optional to have both binaries though.<p>- yes, the apps themselves will have binaries for both.  That makes sense to me since you want one download link for an app and a lot of users don&#x27;t want to think about what kind of mac they have.<p>the OS update tool should be smart enough to just get the OS binaries I need.  Unless it&#x27;s some kind of external boot disk like you mentioned, but that seems like a special case to me.')
