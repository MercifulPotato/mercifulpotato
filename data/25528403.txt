She was lucky if her tips brought her up to minimum wage most days.  On a few, she did great, and because she liked the interaction with customers, she stayed with it for years.<p>Whether or not she made enough tips to bring her up to minimum wage, the manager required her (illegally) to report enough tips so her wage met minimum.<p>If she had to split her tips with full-wage staff, I&#x27;m sure she would refuse to report tips.  Pizza Hut will likely have to pay wait staff full-wage or just not have wait staff anymore.  People won&#x27;t tolerate this.')
