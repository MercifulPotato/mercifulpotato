I either don&#x27;t think those numbers are accurate enough to reflect people who &quot;put themselves through college&quot;, or that people back in the &#x27;80s didn&#x27;t actually put themselves through college.<p>Edit: To clarify, he says &quot;net tuition&quot;, then throws out a $15,000 number for modern colleges. That&#x27;s on the low-to-medium end of the per-semester cost of a modern public institution, so I&#x27;m assuming he&#x27;s also listing the per-semester cost for the 1986 tuition.')
