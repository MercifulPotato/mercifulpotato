If you&#x27;re already using REST tools such as Postman and every caching tool in existence (browser, http proxy, etc. etc.) then GraphQL tossing it all out is the exact opposite of &quot;ergonomic.&quot;<p>The caching story in GraphQL is a joke. What the browser gives you for free with GET caching takes weeks and months of fine-tuning and tweaking and head scratching with something like Apollo. Then you&#x27;ll probably try decreasing the payload size (there&#x27;s a third-party solution for this), or batching requests together (guess what... there is a third-party solution for this too). The amount of tooling and implementation work GraphQL needs to get up to par with built-in REST is pretty incredible.')
