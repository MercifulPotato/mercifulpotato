You&#x27;ve nailed it: we can only do so much with typical extensions, they are limited. As per your quesiton: I&#x27;ll do my best to answer.<p>1. Lisp is what enables any part of Nyxt to be reprogrammed at any time (even whilst running).<p>2. Lisp enables us to easily program DSL&#x27;s for different bits of functionality. For example, we could easily write&#x2F;interpret a DSL for describing uBlock matrix rules.<p>3. We try to insulate users who don&#x27;t know Lisp a little bit by providing graphical configuration interfaces (like emacs), we are working on improving these to make them almost as effective as writing your config by hand.<p>We&#x27;re working on it. Big projects like this take time. Hopefully with time our vision will crystallize into something more obvious :-)')
