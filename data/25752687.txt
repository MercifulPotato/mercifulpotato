Quoting from the article you linked<p>&gt; to elaborate his thoughts on why he feels he “no longer believes that it is possible to build a <i>competitive</i> federated messenger at all.”<p>I think competitive is the key word here. Signal has moved fast in the last year, especially in the last few months. I can&#x27;t imagine that happening on a federated system.<p>The other point is it isn&#x27;t as trivial to join a federated system or create your own node. Signal? Download app and you&#x27;re good to go. Matrix? Well who has a node? Where are we going? How do I set one up?<p>Personally I&#x27;ll be happy with a bridge (like Matrix wants) when Signal is fully featured (I&#x27;d argue it is almost there. Just a few things like usernames, video scaling, channels, etc). But I couldn&#x27;t imagine the mass adoption and moving at the speed they did (are) with a federated system. Even email didn&#x27;t take off until Yahoo and Hotmail. Pretty much every federated system people are mentioning here didn&#x27;t gain mass adoption until there was a large provider. Which has gone to such a point that rolling your own email now is difficult and you&#x27;ll have a harder time avoiding all the spam. So even these examples have moved more towards centralization, if not at least a hybrid.<p>So what am I missing here? What&#x27;s the big killer feature of federation that makes things better and proven?')
