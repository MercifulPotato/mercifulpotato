It&#x27;s not a choice. I have rent, etc.</i><p>I see what you&#x27;re saying, but at the same time, at what annual revenue level do humans actually start &quot;chilling&quot; more and work less? 500 thousand? I&#x27;d be curious to see statistics.<p>Where I live (Canadian city), a lot of parents are working less, through a variety of arrangements (stay-at-home mom, consulting, part-time work, parental leave). Some of them have pretty low incomes. Society doesn&#x27;t make it exactly <i>easy</i>, but it&#x27;s certainly possible, it&#x27;s just not yet the mainstream option. Social safety nets obviously help.<p>Wikipedia has this nice chart: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;3&#x2F;3b&#x2F;Heures_travaillees_OCDE.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;3&#x2F;3b&#x2F;Heures_t...</a> . Some countries have seen impressive reductions.<p>Anyway, I definitely agree with that:<p><i>A solution that relies exclusively on choice fails the smell test.</i><p>Wealth inequality, etc...')
