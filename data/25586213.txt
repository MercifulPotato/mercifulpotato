They hyped up the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, but - as far as I can tell - that challenge didn&#x27;t require the applicants to take on such risk.<p>I get that they want to stem the tide of low-quality submissions, but doing it this way really takes the wind out of their James Randi spiel.<p>With the paranormal challenge, you could say &quot;the lack of applicants indicates they know the claim is false.&quot; With this, the lack of applicants could just as easily indicate a lack of funds&#x2F;risk tolerance.')
