Item(by='shadowgovt', descendants=None, kids=[25435211], score=None, time=1608063342, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25434539, text='Some of the rioters are victims, so I&#x27;ll be upset with all kinds of people.<p>In general, it&#x27;s somewhat irrelevant whether someone declares themselves to be press because there are scant laws that declare the press is allowed to do X while a normal citizen can&#x27;t. The &quot;PRESS&quot; signage should, in theory, be a useful signal to law enforcement that someone isn&#x27;t there to make a disturbance (this, of course, breaks down if rioters mis-apply the label, but the end result is they endanger the press more than benefit themselves, since the cops can arrest a person breaking the law whether or not they have a particular symbol on their uniform).')
