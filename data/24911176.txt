Today, giving it another shot, I see some serious work has gone into it and it&#x27;s really expanded into something interesting. Kudos to you and your co-founder!<p>The only thing stopping me from going all-in on paying for Polar and using it as the &quot;hub&quot; of my reading (mostly technical docs, long-form blogs, whitepapers, and textbooks) is the lack of tie-in with E Ink readers, which I vastly prefer for reading and note-taking over computer screens.<p>I use a ReMarkable 2 tablet for reading technical docs (nd a Kindle Oasis for casual nonfiction. It would completely &quot;connect the ecosystem&quot; if there were ways to sync with my readers or at least push documents to them and pull annotations back. Boox, ReMarkable, and other popular E Ink tablets have APIs, OTG USB disk access, and other ways to interchange the docs (with authorization). I&#x27;m seeing loads of hacks for them on Github, so maybe even opening a plugin system would be enough; the community would contribute to fill in the gaps.<p>IMO, this is the killer final piece of the puzzle and would keep my reading and note-taking in one wonderfully organized place, which is something I&#x27;m 100% interested in paying for and supporting.')
