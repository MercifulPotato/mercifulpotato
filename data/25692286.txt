Item(by='ksk', descendants=None, kids=[25701690], score=None, time=1610149046, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25691199, text='&gt;That Russia helped Trump is generally agreed upon.<p>It is only agreed upon when you don&#x27;t talk to people outside of your own echo chamber. In 2016, people were just shocked that so many people could vote for a loathsome person like Trump. Dems were unhappy and looked for someone to blame, except themselves for running such a weak candidate. 2020 was just as fair an election, and Trump got even more votes than 2016.<p>&gt;Sure, there are subreddits that commonly exaggerated the truth about the Russia thing. Should they should get banned, since r&#x2F;donaldtrump got banned for supporting violence?<p>What is the standard? Misinformation is OK? Anyway, I don&#x27;t think an argument here will change anyone&#x27;s views. People will eventually realize that the Dems have been conning their supporters for quite a while now.')
