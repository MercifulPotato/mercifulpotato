I have some friends on Signal and use NextCloud talk (my own server, yay, still waiting for federated chat to chat to other servers), but so many &quot;official&quot; things are on WA, children&#x27;s birthday parties, school announcements, sports related announcements, neighborhood announcements. We are really too dependent on WA, and you know, based on WA&#x27;s original promises this wouldn&#x27;t really be a problem.
