Getting the keys into it was of a novel experience, but hey there aren&#x27;t many and thereafter it signs emails just fine.<p>Verifying received email is more problematic.  There are far more of them, it can&#x27;t get them from the GPG database I trust, it can&#x27;t get them from a key server and manually importing them is again ... novel.<p>I understand the reasons for not wanting to use GPG to verify emails as they come from an untrusted source, not using it to sign emails could possibly be justified for forwarding emails from  untrusted sources with attachments, not having nice way to import your trusted keys and keys from key servers I hope is only because this is version 1.')
