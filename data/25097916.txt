It&#x27;s because the DSM-V criteria for Major Depressive Disorder is &quot;Depressed most of the day, nearly every day...&quot; - and it&#x27;s one of several other features you have to match within a 2 week period to match it.<p>It&#x27;s a fancy way of saying &quot;The unusual depressive episode (which can be normal) has lasted at least two weeks (not as normal)&quot;. How that exact number was determined I&#x27;m not sure (though it was the APA), but that&#x27;s the standard everyone follows.<p>EDIT: I believe a variation of this question is standard as part of the PHQ-9 which is a screening&#x2F;benchmark quick self-assessment for depression.')
