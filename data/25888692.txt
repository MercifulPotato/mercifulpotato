It can be a good way to explore the spec before building the implementation. At the same time, you shouldn&#x27;t force yourself to write all of the tests up front; additional tests will typically occur to you as you build the implementation.<p>If you don&#x27;t have external factors forcing a spec, I feel that test driven development is a net negative. Forcing a spec up front often requires making decisions before you fully understand the problem. Once you have tests, you have invested in the decisions and are less likely to reconsider them when encountering things that should have influenced the design. On a related note, most interfaces, particularly internal interfaces, should be influenced by the implementation to keep the implementation simple. Building a simple yet comprehensive solution typically requires a full understanding of the problem.')
