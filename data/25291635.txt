Then when some data showed that actually masks do seem to help I didn&#x27;t argue. I listened to the reasons for the change in advice and it all sounded, to me at least, perfectly reasonable. Yet I <i>still</i> hear people saying medical experts are &quot;flip flopping&quot; on masks as if changing ones advice based on new, scientifically backed information is a bad thing.<p>Highly intelligent people I know have made comments to me about masks, 5G, Bill Gates microchip vaccines, &quot;Plandemic&quot; and all that kind of stuff.<p>Sadly I have a (second) aunt that has been sucked into the QAnon madness. She honest to god believes the election was stolen from Trump. She isn&#x27;t even American! She is a lamb farmer in Wales that still believes Brexit is going to be the best thing ever. But that is a conversation for a different thread.<p>I am just mentally exhausted from it all. I miss the days of moon landing and what <i>really</i> goes on at Area 51 conspiracies.')
