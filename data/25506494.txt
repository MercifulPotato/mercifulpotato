Everybody likes to point at him but there is a reason why he is a unique case. Especially since it would be trivial for fascists to monopolize his time by just claiming to be open to discussion while actually not being interested in changing their views. This is why Davis holds his conversations <i>in private</i>. When done in public, his approach is exploitable to create a seemingly legitimate channel to spread fascist propaganda.')
