They do apply.<p>&gt; What formatting tools? Why would I need any formatting tools to hack the kernel?<p>Having text formatting tools is really useful when communicating things. If you don&#x27;t need it, okay, that doesn&#x27;t negate its usefulness for others.<p>&gt; Security mechanisms?<p>DKIM&#x2F;DMARC&#x2F;SPF. The rest of your paragraph is tangential, applies to the entire world and all tech where identities come to play, with a few smaller exceptions.<p>&gt; So, how about all those forums fix their &quot;forum config&quot; problems, and then maybe we&#x27;ll talk?<p>You do realize that&#x27;s an absolutely ridiculous demand, it&#x27;s up to the project to have a configuration they like.<p>&gt; GitHub Issues, for example, doesn&#x27;t even support threading within an Issue; unlike the mailing lists since decades ago.<p>That&#x27;s a feature, not a bug.<p>&gt; So, even in such basic aspects, mailing lists are already superior<p>Yet in so many others it lags so much behind.

Just calling it &quot;superior&quot; would&#x27;ve been a stretch, &quot;far superior&quot; is borderline delusional.')
