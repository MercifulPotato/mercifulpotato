Item(by='rsynnott', descendants=None, kids=[25576323], score=None, time=1609278565, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25575085, text='A couple of months ago, the Irish Supreme Court ruled that Subway&#x27;s &#x27;bread&#x27; wasn&#x27;t bread (the reason this went to court was that it&#x27;s important for setting a VAT rate), due to containing too much added sugar. In Ireland (and, as far as I know, most places in Europe) it would not be normal for bread to contain added sugar _at all_.<p>So, yeah, a sandwich made with what is legally cake seems fairly garbage (though, I do see the problem in that it seems to be hard to get normal bread cheaply in the US).<p>This does point to a potential solution, though. As I understand it, the determination was only directly relevant to taxation. However, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to imagine that a country could take the stance that advertising sandwiches made with non-bread as sandwiches wasn’t permissible. That might be enough of a marketing problem for Subway that they’d just drop the sugar.')
