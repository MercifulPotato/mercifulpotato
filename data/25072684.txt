Item(by='umvi', descendants=None, kids=[25072854, 25072808], score=None, time=1605204374, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25072416, text='Angular&#x27;s fatal mistake was the name change around Angular 2 (&quot;Don&#x27;t call it &#x27;Angular 2&#x27;, just call it &#x27;Angular&#x27;&quot;).<p>The problem is that Angular 1 is VERY different from Angular 2+ and searching &quot;Angular&quot; gave Angular 1 results... the search index of Google was poisoned for so long with the wrong results that I switched to React out of frustration.')
