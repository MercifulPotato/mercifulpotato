Real professionals, and they were serious about the spirit, as well as the letter, of their vocation. The State Police, in that state, are quite powerful. They have (at least in the early 1980s) complete jurisdiction, throughout the state.<p>I also think they would have written their own mothers jaywalking tickets, for going across the street to borrow a cup of sugar.<p>One of them explained to me, how the state code was written, so that everyone is breaking some law, at any given time, and a lot of their training involved learning all these little violations, so they could pretty much justify pulling someone over, at any time.<p>I suspect these bar owners did something to piss off someone in some authority. It could have been as mild as their main clientele.')
