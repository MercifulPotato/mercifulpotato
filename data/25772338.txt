When they protested, I supported them. When they harassed mayor wheeler, I supported them.<p>When they started destroying local businesses, I didn&#x27;t support them. I posted once on my next door to please let&#x27;s all remain peaceful and stop the destruction of local small businesses, and was met with immediate condemnations of being racist. I got so many hate messages, despite being brown myself, that I eventually left next door, out of fear of doxxing.<p>When BLM then went and tagged Pelosi and McConnell&#x27;s homes, I cheered them on. I don&#x27;t mind seeing people harass politicians. I just don&#x27;t want them destroying private citizen&#x27;s stuff, or killing them when they defend it.<p>And I don&#x27;t read Breitbart. I read Mother Jones and the New Yorker, and sometimes I read Breitbart when left wing people get outraged by their articles.')
