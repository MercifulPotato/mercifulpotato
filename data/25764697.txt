That includes the President. Television and radio have increasingly (since at least the Bush years, got much worse with Obama, and continued with Trump) chosen to ignore Presidential press conferences and addresses they didn&#x27;t feel like covering, or heavily edited them, provided them only with their commentary, etc.<p>That&#x27;s one reason why politicians have increasingly turned to social media!')
