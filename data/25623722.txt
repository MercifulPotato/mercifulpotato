Item(by='loup-vaillant', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609698399, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25622570, text='&gt; <i>I can assure you that your standard computer components are not rated for century-scale use.</i><p>And that&#x27;s probably not what GP asked for. There&#x27;s a difference between guaranteeing an error rate of 1 error per century of use on average, and guaranteeing it over the course of an <i>actual century</i>. It might be okay to guarantee that error rate for only 5 years of uninterrupted use, and degrade after that. For instance:<p><pre><code>  Years  1- 5:  1 error  per century.\n  Years  6-10:  3 errors per century.\n  Years 10-15: 10 errors per century.\n  Years 15-20: 20 errors per century.\n  Years 20-30:  1 error  per *year*.\n  Years 30+  : the chip is broken.\n</code></pre>\nNow, given how energy hungry and polluting the whole computer industry actually is, it might be a good idea to shoot for extreme durability and reliability anyway. Say, sustain 1 error per century, over the course of <i>fifty years</i>. It will be slower and more expensive, but at least it won&#x27;t burn the planet as fast as our current electronics.')
