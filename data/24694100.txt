We stayed on the island. We loved it. We avoided the tourist areas during the day. The island just isn&#x27;t that crowded away from a handful of locations. At night, we had the island almost to ourselves to explore.<p>Wandering around in the dark alleys was at first a bit unnerving. In any big city, you&#x27;d feel unsafe in such locations. But after we realized we really had nothing to fear, we relaxed and just enjoyed the experience.<p>In the morning, I got up early and wandered to the fish market to watch it get setup for the day.<p>All in all, a totally great and memorable experience. We enjoyed it as much as Rome.<p>Florence on the other hand... not our favorite.<p>Italy was a joy to visit. We hope to go back someday.')
