I&#x27;d love to just download a virtual appliance, point it at some disk space, and tell it how much bandwidth to use. Maaaaybe tell it what region to focus on, if I want to use my own local tile server for my own local projects because it won&#x27;t ratelimit me because I&#x27;m me.<p>But if I could just do that, and with no further admin overhead, contribute to some sort of tile-cloud, I&#x27;d find that a lot more meaningful than seeding my favorite distro&#x27;s torrents, you know?')
