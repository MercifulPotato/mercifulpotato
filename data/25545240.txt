Literally zero is the ideal but not necessarily achievable.<p>If you spend more computation on pedestrian detection, it will do better. If you have to spend computation on useless antivirus, it can&#x27;t be spent on pedestrian detection, or some other thing that improves safety. And pedestrian detection is itself a trade off -- one algorithm might be more accurate but slower, and so give the vehicle less time to respond after detection. Using a RTOS doesn&#x27;t save you -- if the CPU isn&#x27;t fast enough to run both the algorithm and the antivirus then it could have to starve the antivirus of resources indefinitely, which might not be compliant. So then the presence of the antivirus requires you to use an algorithm which is faster but less accurate.<p>You could also use a faster processor, but that&#x27;s still a trade off. It could increase the cost of the vehicle and cause some people to continue to use vehicles that are less expensive and less safe, leading to an overall cost in lives.<p>Any time you&#x27;re making a trade off where one of the variables is human lives, any inefficiency that requires you to make the trade off in a worse way is potentially costing lives. And installing antivirus where it doesn&#x27;t belong is an inefficiency.')
