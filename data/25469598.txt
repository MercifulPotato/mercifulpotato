Purely as a user, I love the fact that when I click on an AMP&#x27;ed page, it loads almost instantly on my mobile, as opposed to a few seconds that I have to wait before they load completely. How it could have been done in a way that didn&#x27;t hurt publishers is not a consumer&#x27;s concern. For an end-user who doesn&#x27;t know much about tech, they &#x27;made the web better&#x27;.')
