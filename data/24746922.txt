In total I earned from it about $60k in 8 years of being a side-project (which is only around $6k&#x2F;year, but enough to keep me going).<p>My bigger goal is to make self-hosting in general a lot more appealing for non-technical users or small businesses who can&#x27;t afford sys admins and they have to rely on &quot;free&quot; services that affect the privacy of their users and even of their own data.\nI think this is not only possible, but the expected future. We just have to create useful products that can be self-hosted AND find an easy way to allow users to install&#x2F;use them.<p>I am glad to answer any questions about userTrack, the tech stack, its history or myself.<p>Demo (automatic login): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dashboard.usertrack.net&#x2F;server&#x2F;demoLogin.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dashboard.usertrack.net&#x2F;server&#x2F;demoLogin.php</a><p>Changelog: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.usertrack.net&#x2F;changelog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.usertrack.net&#x2F;changelog</a><p>Roadmap: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trello.com&#x2F;b&#x2F;z4HCNb15&#x2F;usertrack-roadmap" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trello.com&#x2F;b&#x2F;z4HCNb15&#x2F;usertrack-roadmap</a>')
