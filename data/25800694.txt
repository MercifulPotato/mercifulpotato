My company has dozens of large production scale databases and I think only one or two NoSQL products. We don&#x27;t use Postgres unfortunately though.<p>NoSQL went through a hype in some circles (stayed non-existent in mine for the most part), but in my eyes, SQL has always been the work horse and was never not the default in the greater industry in my eyes. The Postgres implementation has become pretty popular recently, but so has Oracle and others in the past.<p>I think the commenter was getting at this.')
