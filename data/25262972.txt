A quick of Amazon shows an &quot;Amazon&#x27;s choice&quot; of a 6.3x3.9&quot; tablet for 34 USD. That&#x27;s a bit on the small side, but very usable.<p>If you are looking at flagship professional-level Cintiqs, sure, they are expensive. But that&#x27;s like looking at an Apple XDR display and complaining that monitors are so expensive. I&#x27;ll add that display tablets have multiple drawbacks compared with non-display tablets - nothing major for the occasional user though.')
