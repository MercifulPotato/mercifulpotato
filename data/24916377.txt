Item(by='ncmncm', descendants=None, kids=[24924769, 24918710], score=None, time=1603872228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24914992, text='You appear to imagine that something you think of as &quot;EM fields&quot; can achieve things that cannot be done with wires or axons and transistors or nerve cells.<p>EM fields are linear. That means you can&#x27;t get any information out of EM interactions [except in ferromagnetic materials] that you didn&#x27;t put in. It makes them useful for communication, but not for computation, or &quot;consciousness&quot;, whatever woowoo you imagine that to be. That you don&#x27;t understand electromagnetics <i>utterly fails</i> to endow electromagnetics with divine powers.<p>Information processing with nonlinear computational elements such as transistors and nerve cells is stuff we (like every living creature, and your thermostat) use all day, every day. Magickal &quot;consciousness&quot; processes that don&#x27;t depend on nerve cell operations are an extraordinary claim that demands actual, you know, evidence, which would require words that have actual, you know, definitions. If you imagine that you have this &quot;consciousness&quot; magick that bonobos, ravens, and elephants don&#x27;t, it is on you to demonstrate it. Good luck.<p>I find &quot;consciousness&quot; mysticism actively disgusting, overwhelmingly worse than Martian UFO fantasies, homeopathy scams, claims of quantum-based ESP powers, or even Ayn Rand objectivism. Even to bring it up is an insult to thinking persons.')
