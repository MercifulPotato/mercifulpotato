They started with this very good advice and then took it one step stupider: Disallowing circular imports.<p>Why is this bad? It makes it impossible in many situations to locate your public API at the top level. Let&#x27;s say you have a Widget interface and APIs to do things with those Widgets. Eventually your library gets complex enough that you want to separate functionality into subdirs. Now you have a problem: You can&#x27;t access the definition for Widget from the subdir because importing the top level would create a circular import!<p>The only way to get around this problem is to have no code at the top level, and put your public API in a subdir. Just be sure to do this when first starting your library or you&#x27;ll have to break things.')
