Pins rubbing (wearing) both sides of the tooth. Including the back side, which will never exert any forward longitudinal force on a chain unless it&#x27;s made of magnets. I also see a highly suspect FEA diagram on the right, where teeth not even engaged still show non-zero stresses (lighter blue, not the darkest blue), indicating that the color&#x2F;stress scale has been changed compared to the baseline on the left. So it&#x27;s not an honest comparison. Add to that the fact that this is a &#x27;better mousetrap&#x27; that requires you to first replace all the mice in the house, and I guess I&#x27;m a bit (to use one of Bike Snob NYC&#x27;s favorite words) nonplussed.')
