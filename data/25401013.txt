I wasn&#x27;t particularly good at it, but I understood the methods used--I read everything I could find on the subject that was available in the open literature. See the bibliography below if you&#x27;d like to try some interesting cryptography on paper and pencil methods.<p>In graduate school I studied CS and I proposed to my Ph.D. advisor that I would like to do research into cryptography (this was 1983) and he told me that all the interesting things about cryptography have already been discovered and that I should work on something else.<p>In 1983 Byte magazine, volume 3, an article proposed using a program based on the <i>Bazeries Cylinder</i>, see [6, 7], to obtain a practically unbreakable cipher. I didn&#x27;t own a personal computer at the time, so as soon as I could get together with my best friend, a fellow grad student that owned a PC, we were able to break the cipher in just one evening. (Unfortunately, we were the second to do so and missing out on the $10 prize for the first person that broke the cipher.)<p>There are paper and pencil ciphers that are well designed and are much stronger than the Zodiac Killer&#x27;s ciphers as I understand them. One designed for Soviet spies, known as the VIC cipher, resisted US cryptographers (as far as I know) and is explained in an interesting Scientific American in the July 1966 edition, see [7].
