I&#x27;ve always found it fascinating how corporatism is so similar to aspects of communism, or how communist bureaus in some ways are very similar to corporations with huge market shares (de facto monopolies, with only token competition being allowed). A corporation of course works under the system of capitalism, which is often said to be the antithesis of communism. Yet the outcome of either model goven monopolist tendencies and largesse is strangely similar.')
