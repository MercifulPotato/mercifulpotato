The first Banjo was released in 1998, while <i>Dobutsu no Mori</i> (Animal Crossing) for N64 didn&#x27;t come out until 2001.<p>Nintendo was <i>definitely</i> talking with Rareware at the time and they exchanged ideas and techniques on game engine design, platformer mechanics, etc. Interviews from the Rare side admitted this (I&#x27;ll need to dig up some sources to include here).<p>I&#x27;m curious if Nintendo picked up the Animal Crossing Bebebese voices directly from Banjo-Kazooie.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9ZE5A3DbHDk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9ZE5A3DbHDk</a> (Actually a video of the year 2000 sequel, Banjo-Tooie, but this is a better example of the same voice engine using various voices.)<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;animalcrossing.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Language#Bebebese" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;animalcrossing.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Language#Bebebese</a>')
