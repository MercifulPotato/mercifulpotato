What&#x27;s worthless about giving those people better care that more closely aligns with their preferences?<p>&gt; is a net loss for the economy<p>This is such a weird way of thinking about activity that happens outside the market. Should I feel guilty about cooking my own meals because I haven&#x27;t payed a restaurant worker to do it?<p>Sometimes people do things outside of the market, and that&#x27;s OK, they don&#x27;t have to feel guilty about that. The market exists to help us live our lives, not the other way around. Whether GP watches their parents on their own or hires someone else to do it, the parents are still getting watched, and somebody is still doing that as part of their &quot;job&quot;. That&#x27;s the important part.<p>You&#x27;re concerned about prices going up, but what GP is describing would be vastly cheaper than paying for assisted living on the market today. It&#x27;s making in-home assisted living more available than it currently is on the market. Why would that be a bad thing?')
