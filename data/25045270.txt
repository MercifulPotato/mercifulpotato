Convenience to what ? Personally, I find that far from the truth. Rust is very powerful, offers lots of flexibility in memory managing and allocation, which makes a difference in gamedev, but overall it&#x27;s far slower to code in, because of that. And that is very bad for gamedev, in which fast iteration times is crucial. You code something, test it. Scratch it. Fix it. Test it. And so on.')
