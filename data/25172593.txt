SwiftUI felt like an expressive way to define UI elements, but I had some small weird details that took long time to solve, perhaps because I defined something in a way that wasn&#x27;t supposed to. Ultimately, I mostly got the code to look in the way I preferred, but for example regarding animation or gestures there were some problematic details I didn&#x27;t want to spend time to get exactly right.<p>Overall I enjoyed it much more than UIKit but I would hesitate to use it in the future in a professional setting without properly investigating how mature it is at that point of time.<p>If anyone is interested, here&#x27;s the Shogi app I developed, intended for two local two players, and as a reminder I am quite new to the iOS ecosystem: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;EvidentSolutions&#x2F;toodim" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;EvidentSolutions&#x2F;toodim</a>')
