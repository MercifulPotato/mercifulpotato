I get that it&#x27;s a well mature platform with a massive ecosystem but it needs to be have something like npm or yarn for javascript development.<p>And importantly are there any thin and light JVMs that can be bundled with this? I&#x27;m thinking AdoptOpenJDK openJ9. It seems to be well suited for this use case. would it be efficient in the RAM and CPU usage? If not I&#x27;m not sure why this would be any good since we can develop stuff much faster with electron at the moment.')
