I&#x27;ve led 200+ person community orgs and helped put in governance for Fortune 500s, it&#x27;s all the same - policies are an exercise in leadership, and are exactly as effective as the leadership in place.<p>Rules, policies, laws, Hammurabi&#x27;s Code - they&#x27;re all just leadership decisions made in advance. The problem here is that the leadership clearly doesn&#x27;t really care.  They got a complaint, they &quot;investigated,&quot; and they moved on.  Classic &quot;governance&quot; - totally ineffective.<p>After years, my favorite governance approach is still the one from a college club.  It read in it&#x27;s entirety: &quot;No !ssholes.&quot; It makes clear the goal, who will be enforcing, and what to expect: The goal is no !ssholes, I will be enforcing, and I will do so by calling you an !sshole. It&#x27;s just social pressure - and for anything outside of the judicial or corporate systems, that&#x27;s all there is anyway.')
