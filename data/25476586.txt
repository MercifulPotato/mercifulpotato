The acquisition of that certification was perhaps the most meaningless thing of my life. Behind my Bachelor&#x27;s by far. No one was really proud of me, and I only finished it because I have a problem with not finishing things. Finish it if you have it in you, cut it loose if you do not. Dr. means nothing, and no one in the real world will care either way.')
