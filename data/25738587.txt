There&#x27;s a huge uptick in <i>deplatform-proof</i> p2p mesh networks running web applications.<p>How do you take down a mesh network that will simply regenerate and absorb most external shocks?<p>I believe that the future of the internet would be fragmented into a conventional centralized server like we see with AWS dominating the market which will still serve useful purpose for most applications and another for the rest.<p>With Moore&#x27;s law and 6G we are heading towards a hyper connected world that will facilitate the rise of robust, secure, mesh network based software that runs on our phones.<p>It will not be without trouble, people will find ways to poison the well. The mesh network would evolve into essentially islands where you physically travel to in order to join that private network to minimize DDOS, MITM attacks.<p>It would be a <i>cyberpunkesque</i> reality where to buy a bag of weed in a non-legal state, you simply head towards a dark alley, connect to the mesh network, find the drop, and head back to your tiny apartment occasionally poking your head out the window to take in the sights of foggy neon-lit streets with flying cars and spiky haired gender-neutral entities shouting &quot;I&#x27;m mad as hell and I&#x27;m not going to take it no more!&quot;')
