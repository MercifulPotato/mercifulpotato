Item(by='kazinator', descendants=None, kids=[25851131], score=None, time=1611171104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25850717, text='Why should the venue owner pay the musician?<p>It&#x27;s not an iron-clad given that the musician provides value to a venue.<p>Musicians who are confident they can bring business to a venue negotiate with confidence and get paid.<p>Those who play for free are ones who don&#x27;t have that confidence.<p>What you accept is what you cost. That&#x27;s the market rate.<p>How about this argument. Say I have a restaurant. Typically that means there is some landlord, and I pay them utilities and rent in exchange for using the space. Now some guitar-strumming, crooning ape wants to perform in the same space. If he and I are to be considered part of the same organization, we are on the same level of the &quot;org chart&quot;. We are sharing the space and doing our thing. Why would I pay him anything? He should pay part of the rent and utilities. Or, why not the other way around?<p>Let&#x27;s reverse it. Suppose a musician has a venue where he performs every night, and people come. Paying people. Suppose I want sell hot-dogs and sandwiches there, and he lets me do that. Why the fuck should he also pay me anything? He would be right to ask me to pay some sort of rent.<p>Now if I give the hot dogs and sandwiches for free, so that many more people come, and those people pay to get into this music venue, then there is a case that I&#x27;m increasing the business, and doing it out of my pocket. Still, that is my problem; I shouldn&#x27;t be doing such a thing. Maybe I know what I&#x27;m doing! Or maybe I&#x27;m trying out new product to see how people like it or whatever (market research).')
