We hope that with the increase of the vaccinated population we can have a more precise estimate<p>- We are talking about 95% inside a confidence interval which is still uncertain lower&#x2F;higher boundaries, given the small sample<p>- It is very dangerous to claim any statistical conclusion with small sample sizes<p>- Almost all &quot;advanced machine learning AI methods&quot; fail miserably. And they fail even worse with small datasets (which is the case). Examples are the handful of &quot;covid pollsters&quot; we got since the beginning of 2020, trying to guess how many people would die, or get infected.<p>- About vaccine efficacy in asians - we should monitor phase 3 results of CoronaVac (the chinese vaccine) trials (which are in course in China, Brazil and other countries), so we can account for these biases. I heard these results are coming in the next few weeks')
