This is a typical strategy used by single header libraries. It can be done in two ways in a .c file: a) call a huge macro after #include to insert the actual code and&#x2F;or b) define a macro like &quot;#define LIBRARY_IMPL&quot; prior to #include to let the header insert the code. Single-header libraries don&#x27;t necessarily have the problems you are describing if implemented properly.<p>The owner of this repo is a well known figure on game development. His libraries are somewhat widely used and have probably inspired quite a few single-header libraries which adopt similar strategies. My comments are not specific to his libraries, either.')
