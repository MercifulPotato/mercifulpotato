AT&amp;T</i>? Or <i>United States v. Microsoft Corporation</i>?<p>&gt; <i>The role of courts is not of fact finder, market minder, or regulator.</i><p>It&#x27;s certainly the courts&#x27; job to enforce anti-trust legislation.<p>&gt; <i>You would have to create an IRS-like body to determine the monopolistic status of every market, industry, company.</i><p>You mean like the FTC?<p>But again, it&#x27;s not whether a company is a monopoly; it&#x27;s whether they&#x27;re engaged in anti-competititive practices to maintain that monopoly. The FTC and the Antitrust division of the DoJ investigate antitrust violations, not so-called &quot;innocent&quot; monopolies.<p>&gt; <i>And tell me, are you just concerned about big tech companies making 30%, or would you regulate grocery chains that make 4% just the same?</i><p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how much profit a company makes, or how much it charges; it&#x27;s whether or not it&#x27;s artificially reducing competition in order to keep prices high. There&#x27;s typically less barriers to entry to selling groceries, but its certainly not impossible for a grocery chain to engage in anticompetitive practices.<p>&gt; <i>It&#x27;s like people don&#x27;t think of the details and implications of an idea before proposing that they&#x27;ve got the answer.</i><p>You seem to be under the impression this is an idea I&#x27;m proposing, but what I&#x27;m describing is how competition law has worked for the last century.')
