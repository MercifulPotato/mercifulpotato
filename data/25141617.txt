We just don’t know which one of them is correct. And why is that? It’s because we cannot observe black hole evaporation.<p>&gt; You need data, there is no data, and there won’t be any data. Which is why the black hole information loss problem is for all practical purposes unsolvable.<p>She didn&#x27;t say it was inherently unsolvable, only that it was practically unsolvable. There&#x27;s still the possibility that it could be solved with some other data that doesn&#x27;t require observing black hole evaporation.')
