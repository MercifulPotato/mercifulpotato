An electric fan could perform similarly if it could provide enough static pressure to achieve supersonic flow through a de Laval nozzle. If that could be done (whether it can is something I&#x27;d love to see data on!), the best electric power source would probably have what looks like a regular jet engine intake on the front, a subsonic fan, and a de Laval nozzle in the back like a rocket engine.')
