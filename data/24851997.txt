Hard pass on that element.<p>1password used to have a peer to peer sync mode that I loved. No need for a server anywhere. You would open it on your Mac and then open it on your phone and if they were on the same network they would self discover. Too inconvenient, perhaps, for most users, but for the paranoid like me, it was ideal -- no servers involved at all.<p>(Technically, wifi sync I believe still exists IF you use 1password on Mac with a old style local vault, but it&#x27;s basically unsupported. Mine just stopped working and I switched to 1password.com.)')
