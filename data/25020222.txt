I did put some thought into it, and came to the conclusion that Trumpism is no ideaology or even a movement. Especially when compared to historical political movements like the national socialists in Germany, fascists in Italy or Russian communism. It looks more like a combination of white supremacists, conservatives, conspiracy theorists, religious hardliners and macho culture. All held together by Trump&#x27;s reality TV style bling and the GOP establishment.<p>Trump never was the leader of the GOP, was he? He turned people like Cruz and Graham into devote followers. Mostly, I think, out of fear of Trumps base. People like McConnell were never swayed, these people pushed their policies through. Yes, Trump has his stable 40%. But with him gone, that number will decrease. The GOP will make sure of that, because continuously embrassing Trump after he lost will only hurt them.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s wishful thinking, but for now I, as a European, am grateful that the US internal problems are again internal ones and don&#x27;t affect every country on Earth anymore. I am also glad that the incoming admin already now seems a lot better prepared and organized to fight COVID-19 and its effects. Because that alone will safe lives. And maybe a couple of years of America&#x27;s absence from Western leadership was a necessary wake up call for the world in general.<p>Personally, so I hope Biden finds a way to sort stuff like healthcare, police violence, voter suppression, gerrymandering out. Because that can only be good.<p>Ah, and before I forget, I hope Harris as VP is a sign that they intend to legally clean up Trump&#x27;s legacy. Letting him get away scott free because he was president once would do as much harm to Democracy than 4 more years of Trump.')
