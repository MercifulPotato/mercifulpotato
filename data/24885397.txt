I say this ironically, because that is what education is. Human civilisation exercises language to exchange ideas. It records this knowledge to extend education.<p>The Internet was&#x2F;is a medium for exchange. In the historical view, the Internet is a sophisticated medium without precedent.<p>&gt; When we say mainstream, I think we mean aligned to the dominant power<p>The word means prevailing discourse, or some perception of the prevailing discourse. It is healthy to question prevailing discourse -- or any discourse. But it is not healthy to abandon reason and the tests (and self-tests) of validity.<p>Wild assertions and unfounded accusations may divert weak minds, but they also seem to thrill fanatics.<p>&gt; the desperate political struggle for approval that is mainstream social media.<p>People who favour their vanity over reason and truth are in deep trouble intellectually. Anti-intellectualism, if it becomes the prevailing discourse, will destroy a society.<p>&gt; The reality is the mainstream is not &quot;good,&quot; the public sphere is an open sewer<p>This is a sign of societal decline.<p>&quot;Social media&quot; is vulgar business. It is not about education, intelligent discourse, or even civilisation.')
