It seems like they want a law on the books that every marijuana user is technically breaking, but that they plan to not enforce. That&#x27;s not good policy. That&#x27;s something they can hold over your head.<p>My take is that they are pushing rescheduling rather than legalization because marijuana serves a valid purpose in the Democratic party agenda of eroding the second amendment. It is a felony for an &quot;unlawful user of [...] any controlled substance&quot; to &quot;possess [...] any firearm.&quot; Rescheduling doesn&#x27;t change anything in that equation, which they like.<p>Under a Biden administration, we&#x27;re probably going to get half-baked rescheduling solution that appropriates millions of federal tax dollars for expunging records, provides zero additional tax income, and continues the practice of making pot smokers second class citizens with regards to the second amendment. Why can&#x27;t the government ever do <i>anything</i> right?')
