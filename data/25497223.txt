The product is focused on security first so I think user experience suffers a bit.  It&#x27;s works fine but if you previously used a mail client like Spark on your phone you&#x27;ll definitely miss it.<p>The mobile app is okay, it&#x27;s good enough for reading and sending short replies.  The web interface is alright.  I like to use the bridge application from ProtonMail on my desktop and use a mail client like Thunderbird or Apple Mail.')
