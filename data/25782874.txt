Saying there are no monopoly issues as long as there are at least two competitors is even more flawed.<p>There are significantly more than two companies that allow mass communication over the internet. In fact, there are a significant number of perfectly free and open ways to communicate over the internet.<p>Why is Twitter special?<p>&gt; If major cinema chains (Twitter, Facebook..) refuse to show a movie, but you can still rent the back of Moe&#x27;s bar (and thousands bars like it) and use their second-hand projector (an analogy for the small audience of alternative platforms). How successful will such movies be?<p>Sorta my point, because that happens <i>all the time</i>. No one goes around saying theater chains are monopolies and need to show every movie anyone deigns to have projected on a screen.<p>&gt; Should we be concerned that the cinema chains can decide what sort of movies can be made or have any sort of impact?<p>Maybe, but that isn&#x27;t legal standing for doing anything. If you don&#x27;t like it, boycott theaters, tell your friends not to go to them, promote alternatives that deliver what you want.<p>Oh, but then the market might disagree with you and keep going to the theaters anyway. Well tough. You&#x27;re not entitled to force people to care.<p>Alternatively, push for legislation around online communication platforms and how they are allowed to determine who can and cannot speak on them. But then don&#x27;t be surprised when those rules apply to your mailing list too.')
