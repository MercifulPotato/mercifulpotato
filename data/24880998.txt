In my experience, choosing a language&#x2F;platform based on the teams experience instead of the best tool for the job is a siren song. It’s less pain upfront, but way more amortized pain over the life of the project.<p>Start with good engineers who understand CS fundamentals. After a week or two of immersion, they’re passable in a new language. After a month or two, there’s basically no difference with a veteran.<p>Okay, sure there are exceptions with very different paradigms. Kotlin devs may take more time with low-level memory managed C code. C hackers may struggle with Haskell. But Pythonistas can write pretty good Typescript in their first week.<p>In contrast starting with wrong tool for the job, just gets continuously worse as the project progresses. The friction of constantly cutting against the grain is an accumulated drag. As the project grows more complex, the kludges and workarounds become an increasingly heavy burden on a day-to-day basis.')
