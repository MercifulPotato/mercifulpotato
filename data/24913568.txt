Item(by='DiabloD3', descendants=None, kids=[24914685, 24914080, 24917380], score=None, time=1603844229, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24913222, text='Samsung&#x27;s process seems to be consistently DOA.... by the time it is stabilized, its already behind everyone else.<p>Consequently, almost all of Nvidia&#x27;s current troubles stem from being unable to do all of their fabrication at TSMC, and the yields for Samsung 8nm being very poor.<p>Nvidia recently canceled the 2x RAM variants of their 3070 and 3080 cards (and not because of insufficient GDDR6x, only the 3090 takes that), have stopped shipments of GPUs for new cards (they are only continuing to ship to fill existing orders), pushed the 3070 release date until after the RDNA2 announcement; most of this stems from Samsung&#x27;s poor yields no matter how inexpensively Samsung is selling those wafers for.<p>This also isn&#x27;t the first time Nvidia used the Samsung footgun.')
