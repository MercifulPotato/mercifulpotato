Item(by='barumi', descendants=None, kids=[25086898], score=None, time=1605297798, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25086701, text='&gt;&gt;I think this only solves the problem for the API owner, not the consumer, right?<p>The only problem this solves is their need to sell their product.<p>This so-called &quot;schema-driven development&quot; approach was already tried in the past and failed miserably. Call it SOAP or OData, the world already gave that a try, saw all the mess and operational and productivity problems it creates, and in spite of the gold mine it represented for tooling vendors and consulting firms, it was a collosal mess.<p>It&#x27;s very weird how their selling pitch is based on  veiled insults on hoe &quot;the industry is still twenty years behind&quot;, but they failed to do their homework to learn the absolute mess that their so-called &quot;schema-driven development&quot; approach left behind.<p>It&#x27;s as if they are totally oblivious to why the whole world shifted to &quot;free-form&quot; APIs, which worked far better than the SOAP mess, and their are hell bent on betting on a rehash of the bad old days.')
