But how dismissive Rudder was of the need to normalize that data was surprising and a bit disturbing as some many people take what is presented as fact and possibly draw incorrect conclusions.\nI would not be surprised if normalizing for height did account for some of it, but the data should be available so outside people can run their own tests. (and half jokingly, as someone who wears glasses, normalizing for that as well).<p>As for education and kids, I can see how that can explain the difference between Asian women and Black women&#x27;s response rate. But again, need a real examination of the data.<p>It is a very touchy subject, which is unfortunately plagued by both uninformed people and also those who just want to cause pain to to others.')
