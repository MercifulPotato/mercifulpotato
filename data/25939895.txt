I&#x27;ve been thinking about this.. let me just paste my tweets thread from a few weeks ago:<p>--<p>An issue with mobile UX is that it&#x27;s tricky to maintain &#x27;ambient awareness&#x27;. How do you &#x27;keep an eye&#x27; on Slack? You have to foreground it &amp; disable screen locking, or get push notifications.<p>On desktop you can just alt+tab to it every so often, plus the taskbar icon lights up.<p>I sometimes use Chrome on desktop to address a similar requirement (they have a feature to &#x27;pin&#x27; a tab, so you can have GMail plus stuff like WhatsApp pinned.)<p>Would be cool if there was a cheap always-on tablet that could display arbitrary web widgets like a calendar, slack etc<p>Just thinking about this ambient computing thing reminds me of the ‘Chumby’, a cute smart alarm clock from the early 2000s.<p>Apparently the Amazon Echo Show is a bit of a successor. And I came across a wall-mounted calendar display called ‘Dakboard’ (it’s like $400 though.)<p>I have a use case that sounds ridiculously lazy, but I guess has been a problem for me for most of this decade: I need to know the time in various cities without doing any work besides a glance<p>---<p>Addendum: over the last couple days I&#x27;ve been looking into stuff like Arduino, Raspberry Pi etc but re-using a Kindle is cool if you don&#x27;t want to do a whole electronics project')
