You can&#x27;t just see hogs in a field and shoot them.  You need permission from the land owner (this goes for pretty much everywhere).  Texas is particularly bad because owners see hunting as a possible revenue stream since there is literally no state land open to hunting so they don&#x27;t grant permission to just anyone.')
