Item(by='rualca', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608938455, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25538145, text='&gt; What makes Darcs different is that it does not need to organize history sequentially. It knows what commits depend on other commits, and a branch is simply a &quot;sea of patches&quot; whose order is inferred. This means that you can share commits across branches without conflicts (unless the branches actually conflict, of course).<p>Is that property relevant, though? I mean, although it does not need commits to be sequential, well... They already are, and there is no way around that. And sharing commits  across branches, whether it&#x27;s in the form of cherry-picked commits or pure old diff&#x2F;patch workflows, is something that Git already handles.<p>Additionally, is there any workflow that does require any of those properties&#x2F;features?<p>Meanwhile, how about Darcs&#x27; computational cost?')
