The first is that the addition and subtraction is associative and transitive, but their use towards non-zoned wall clock timestamps like time_t is limited anyway; they normally operate on zoned date &amp; time (e.g. &quot;tomorrow&quot; typically refers to the local time) or on monotonic and steady timestamps with no particular epoch. The second is that the timestamp doesn&#x27;t repeat but this can also happen with TAI, just that it can only happen with (a large amount of) clock synchronization; you should be prepared of wall clock timestamps repeating no matter it&#x27;s UTC or TAI.<p>For that reason I consider it to be not much superior to using UTC primarily. Not that I don&#x27;t wish TAI to be universal, but given the current circumstances the switch doesn&#x27;t justify its cost.')
