There is a lot of handwaving in my short HN comment as I wasn&#x27;t planning on writing out my full RFC here :). Here is some general thoughts I had on the matter -<p>Placing things on a blockchain is a paradigm shift. Yes you can &#x27;just&#x27; do it on a blockchain, but you&#x27;re likely not taking full advantage of the capabilities you receive. Looking at the TLS signing example - why do we actually need to sign the TLS cert?<p>The purpose of a CA signing a cert today is so that the CA can say a cert is what the CA saw and has not been modified. Well if we put it on a blockchain we know it cant be modified (as this is an inherent property of a blockchain). Instead of asking &#x27;can I verify this cert with the CA pub key&#x27; I ask &#x27;can I find this cert on the blockchain&#x27;.')
