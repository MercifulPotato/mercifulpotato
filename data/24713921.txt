We teach music so wrong. Classical training is about militaristic precision - the ability to achieve perfect regurgitation of a piece that everyone has heard before.<p>But this is the least interesting version of music. Still interesting because it requires skill, but, at least for me, not awe inspiring.<p>Piano is one of the most versatile instruments (like the guitar) in that you can play lots of notes with it (and synthesizers make for a wide array of sounds). It is one of the more powerful tools for speaking the language of music. And that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about, communicating with the listener. Learning to improvise and compose is a much more rewarding approach to piano than learning to play Fur Elise.<p>If you&#x27;d like some inspiration, check out Jacob Collier, Haywyre, Anomalie, or basically any funk band with a keys player.')
