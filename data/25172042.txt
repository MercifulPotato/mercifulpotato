No doubt due to the fact that YC is no longer a scrappy incubator, but a venerable titan of industry. YC isn&#x27;t like going to &quot;summer camp&quot; any more, but more akin to getting an MBA.<p>For example, this quote by Jessica: &quot;A good way to ensure that you make something people want is to make something you yourself want.&quot; -- is at odds with the ethos of one of my favorite pg essays (all the way from 2005[1]) in which I feel he really gets to the <i>core</i> of &quot;building what people want:&quot;<p>&gt; If you want to learn what people want, read Dale Carnegie&#x27;s How to Win Friends and Influence People. When a friend recommended this book, I couldn&#x27;t believe he was serious. But he insisted it was good, so I read it, and he was right. It deals with the most difficult problem in human experience: how to see things from other people&#x27;s point of view, instead of thinking only of yourself. [...] Most smart people don&#x27;t do that very well. But adding this ability to raw brainpower is like adding tin to copper. The result is bronze, which is so much harder that it seems a different metal.<p>I think building things that <i>you</i> want is a bit of a red herring. Every time I&#x27;m working on a project that solely solves <i>my</i> problems, the solution tends to be solipsistic and myopic. In any case, jl&#x27;s essay is a great read, and I really do miss when HN had mostly startup content on the front page :)<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;bronze.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;bronze.html</a>')
