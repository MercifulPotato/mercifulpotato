I probably could have lived with the lock screen ads, but the home screen ad was unacceptable. Vast majority of my book purchases over the past ten years have been ebooks. I’ve gone a bit sentimental in thinking of the book list as my library. And I didn’t want a billboard of any sort in my library. Real or virtual. Have a feeling there are at least dozens of us who are that allergic to ads.<p>I have also purchased a Fire during a Black Friday sale. Got rid of the ads on that one too, but for free since some nice person over at xda made an automated process for that. On a side note, with Termux it isn’t entirely horrible as a 7 inch laptop when paired with a hinged keyboard case. A portable system at a similar price to a Pi.')
