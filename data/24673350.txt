I mean, with modest cooling, an RPi 4 can OC to ~2.1ghz without issue.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind if these were slightly larger if the I&#x2F;O could be mostly on one side.  Add 1-2x sata and&#x2F;or m.2 slots and a second nic and the possibilities really open up.  Though USB3 isn&#x27;t too bad depending on your needs.<p>Also, kind of hoping that a few more polished options for 4-8 board cluster cases start popping up... The ability to do clustering solutions on real hardware for low-cost testing is really interesting as well.<p>All of that said, I agree, other than GPU support, I&#x27;m not sure that this actually performs any better than an RPi 4, and with the pi having 8gb option in play, this is potentially a much worse option.<p>1-2 more generations of these super small form computers, and it&#x27;ll get even more compelling for general use for most people.')
