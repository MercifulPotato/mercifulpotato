A bit of frozen fish or meat for the dog, but not too much, means protection and assistance on the trap line, and a companion through the winter.<p>EDIT: My border collie currently lying behind me on a bed is anxiously and steadily watching me because what she really wants me to do is put on my skis and go for a hike in the woods with her. She won&#x27;t really be happy until I do that.')
