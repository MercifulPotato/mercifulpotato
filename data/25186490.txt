If enough workers say, “I’ll work full-time for you, and only you, and at a lower rate” then your scenario is dead in the water.<p>The opposite scenario is more likely: offshoring. If remote work becomes functionally 80% as good as in-person, there is no reason for BigCo to spend $200,000 in SV when they could spend $20,000 in Chile or Serbia.<p>If you really want to have two “jobs” and maximize your income, just do consulting.')
