My claim is that even without any additional tooling beyond TLA+ to produce a specification and your development environment of choice, just using mathematical reasoning as you derive your program text makes it considerably easier to build systems that satisfy the specification. That mathematical method using predicate transformers is well-developed and has been for decades. This formal approach to deriving the program text results in an object that is a mathematical proof of its own correctness. The human act of writing the program is exactly the same as deriving a proof. I&#x27;m simply incapable of accepting the proposition that avoiding mathematical rigor scales better than using it.')
