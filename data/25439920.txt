What I had in mind is that if anyone you&#x27;re helping comes to rely on your continuous support and you&#x27;re suddenly unable to work for a year due to health issues, you&#x27;ll have a problem anyway. Unless you have a home with no mortgage and other people can step in to both support you long term and the people you&#x27;ve been helping.<p>I&#x27;m thinking less of &quot;achieving more giving&quot; and more of &quot;what&#x27;s the plan when you&#x27;re current support system fails long term&quot;.')
