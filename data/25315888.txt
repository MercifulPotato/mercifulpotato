There&#x27;s a remark made by George Orwell somewhere in which he addresses the claim made in the early 20th century that the working class don&#x27;t read because they can&#x27;t afford books. He counters that assertion by calculating that, based on the cost of going to the pictures, and the number of times a year a working-class person is likely to go, they could afford to buy enough second-hand books to read for several hours a week.<p>On the other hand, for anyone with a smartphone (something like 90% of adults in the developed world), there is zero marginal cost to accessing unlimited written word. I think, on the contrary, we&#x27;ve never as a society been more literate. Never before has such a large proportion of our communication been through text. The &quot;deep reading&quot; complaint might be re-characterised (and in fairness the article hints at it) as the fact that the internet makes many-to-many communication by written word as cheap as one-to-many. When the economic barriers to reaching an audience are removed, the written word more closely represents the average reader, which has never been closer than today to the average person.')
