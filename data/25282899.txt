In my opinion, that&#x27;s pretty ignorant.  If you look beyond all the drama of systemd vs no-systemd, systemd is actually very useful, powerful and conceptually simple service manager.  Yes, it&#x27;s a &quot;monolith&quot; and &quot;not Unix-y&quot;, but from a user perspective it doesn&#x27;t matter.  All that matters is that it&#x27;s simple to use and reliable.  Having been accustomed to systems with systemd, I often struggle to manage Linux systems without it as efficiently.  And I don&#x27;t even have a deep knowledge of systemd, just the basics of service management commands and the structure of unit files.')
