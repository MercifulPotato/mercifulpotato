Theoretically, if there was some way of preserving that ad revenue while committing that infringement, I would assume they wouldn&#x27;t care about the infringement.  They&#x27;re just using the infringement as a tool to preserve the ad revenue.<p>What you&#x27;re worried about is the converse, if there is a way to avoid infringing on copywrite while bypassing ads (which there is, ad-blocking), then there&#x27;s no infringement to use as a tool, then they&#x27;re going to want to make ad-blocking illegal.  It&#x27;s not hard to predict that&#x27;s coming, especially in Europe given Article 13 last year.')
