There are bike lanes, lower crime rates, better parks and waterfront areas. They feel alive inasmuch as the suburbs feel dead.<p>There is one, major problem with cities right now and that is property prices have climbed beyond the levels that are affordable for the working class. The reason that has happened is that interest rates have been kept low for decades and the state usually backstops either banks, or mortgages up to a certain amount, or both; so the risk of loss is lower. To solve this issue we need higher property taxes, especially on land value and street frontage of non-heritage buildings and to make up the difference, lower income taxes or a basic income. I also think we need specialized taxes on foreign national owned or occupied homes to prevent every city from becoming a digital nomad hub, while pushing out the locals. I like being a digital nomad, but I hate what we&#x27;re collectively doing to middle income countries.')
