I can hit 980mbps and negligible latency. It’s got slightly more spread on small packet sizes compared to a 300$ gaming wifi router. Where it really sucks is VPN and cryptography since there is no hardware acceleration. It sits mostly idle just doing nat and ipv6 forwarding (and pihole)<p>I’m going to document it once i work out the kinks. Ipv6 was a real learning experience and had to workaround issues with lack of good native ipv6 support in the tooling and configuration.')
