Requiring the user&#x27;s machine to resolve dependencies to install your software is fragile, bug prone, and harms the user experience.<p>Like it or not, users don&#x27;t care if your software has interchangeable parts. They care if it runs on their system. The only sane way to guarantee a piece of software runs outside your developer machine is to include its dependencies during distribution and packaging (not refer to them - which is what package managers require). The less sane way is to use containers, but those are required when developers don&#x27;t package their software sanely.<p>This doesn&#x27;t preclude users from installing software or replacing interchangeable components should developers support it. What it prevents is disgusting bugs and workarounds because dev A built on distro B while user C wants to use it on distro D but the packages have to be separately for everyone because the distro package managers don&#x27;t agree with each other on what things are named or how they should be built.')
