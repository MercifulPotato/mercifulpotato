E.g. if light with a 450nm wavelength hits your retina, certain neurons fire. You get a pattern of electrical impulses. There&#x27;s your internal representation.<p>But why does that representation also carry with it an experience of the color blue? Why isn&#x27;t it just the electrical impulses and that&#x27;s it? The organism would still work. We could be like robots, behaving exactly the same as our nerve impulses move us around, with no inner experience at all.<p>And what about electrical impulses in things other than brains? Are there qualia associated with them? Is there something it&#x27;s like to be a computer, light bulb, thermostat, lightning bolt, or rock? If not, why not?<p>If you and I both see that 450nm light, how do you know that I&#x27;m not having an experience of color that you have in response to 700nm, i.e. red? Maybe the rainbow of colors is upside-down in my experience compared to yours. Maybe my qualia are different entirely. We have no way to prove anything different, because all we can measure is the electrical impulses. And because we haven&#x27;t the faintest hint of a theory that connects the physical stuff to the particulars of the conscious experience.')
