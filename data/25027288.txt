You were one of a kind and inspired millions. I am incredibly glad to have had the opportunity to meet you (and grateful to my wife for making it happen). You played a huge role in making nerdy cool, in addition to bringing credibility back to trivia game shows.<p>(For Jeopardy! fans, I believe the show producers approached Jennings earlier this year and he expressed interest in taking over as host.)<p>EDIT: Posted to the official Jeopardy! twitter feed: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Jeopardy&#x2F;status&#x2F;1325490106329751553?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Enews%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Jeopardy&#x2F;status&#x2F;1325490106329751553?ref_...</a>')
