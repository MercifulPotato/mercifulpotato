What bothers me is that, if someone were to break into your home there is risk to them because you are allowed to defend yourself by fighting back.<p>As far as I know, we aren’t allowed to counter attack cyber attackers so our only option is better defenses and then handing things off to authorities. I used to work for an smaller eBay-for-a-niche market type site and dealing with fraud was our biggest issue.<p>We tracked fraud ourselves and even managed to send a delivery to a PO Box used by someone who had swindled customers out of thousands of dollars.
