Eight megabytes and constantly swapping.<p>Even today editor bloat is real.  On my netbook VSCode is noticeably laggy sometimes, and it wouldn&#x27;t take too much more to start paging out the editor!  It amazes me that we still can&#x27;t do instantly responsive editors.  Even my dinky notebook still has a gigabyte of RAM and can do a billion integer operations a second.  But VSCode can&#x27;t show text instantly.  I guess I&#x27;ll stick with vi!')
