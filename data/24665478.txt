At first glance shapes look similar to what have become launch dimensions. I think it&#x27;d be pretty interesting to hear a comparison from someone who&#x27;s used both C-star and CUDA, about the plusses and minuses of each... have you used both?<p>Nope. I&#x27;m looking at C-Star through a historical lens, I was curious at the overall development of CUDA and was researching the &quot;line of influence&quot;, so to speak.<p>&gt; Right; I&#x27;m saying the &quot;SIMT&quot; of 10 years ago has to do with masking and maybe other per-thread control (even though the Connection Machines might have had it as well), and that per-thread counters are now going beyond what we used to know as SIMT, perhaps deserving of some other acronym. Or maybe SIMT is becoming more appropriate and more differentiated from SIMD over time? Is it possible that CM5 should be called SIMT and we simply didn&#x27;t have that acronym at the time?<p>CM2 was just another SIMD machine, there were plenty of others before CM2 (its just that CM2 was one of the more popular ones). IIRC, Cray had similar SIMD machines that competed against them. The overall SIMD-methodology reaches back until the 70s at least, maybe earlier.<p>Just noting that CM5 was MIMD at the lowest level, trying to correct a mistake I made a few posts back.<p>------------<p>I think what &quot;happened&quot; was that Intel adopted SWAR: &quot;SIMD With A Register&quot; when Intel created the MMX &#x2F; SSE &#x2F; AVX instruction sets. (compared to dedicated SIMD-computers like the CM-2).<p>At some point, Intel&#x27;s SWAR approach became colloquially known as SIMD (even though SWAR was much more limited compared to &quot;proper&quot; SIMD computers like the CM2). NVidia creates a new acronym called SIMT to differentiate Intel&#x27;s SIMD (aka: SWAR) from a proper SIMD machine, even though the 80s-style SIMD was substantially similar to NVidia&#x27;s new SIMT term.')
