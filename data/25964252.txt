For most of the week, there have been no options available for sale far out of the money.  Last week there were <i>no</i> calls that even could exist that were out of the money.  See last Friday&#x27;s gamma squeeze and resulting short covering on the 25th and 26th.  Anyway, at this point, the position is costing many 10&#x27;s of % per week to carry, not exactly great when the bag has also been doubling in size every day.')
