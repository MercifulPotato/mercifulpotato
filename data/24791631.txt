As in &quot;my cousin Jane says...&quot;?<p>Because &quot;Word of mouth&quot; over the internet would imply that The Internet still has a big role to play in disintermediation.<p>Would &quot;reviews&quot; from your network, any network, physical, or digital, of people you know, be valuable? I believe that a &quot;review&quot; is only useful if you know the reviewer well enough. Regardless of the medium.<p>For example, when &quot;angry uncle Joe&quot; rants about some libtard-foreigner-restaurant-scum which is ruining the neighborhood with their horrible foreign food, I know how to take that &#x27;review&#x27; of the restaurant. Same when aunt Carol explains how she heard from the new boyfriend of the cousin of Foo that her brother said that she heard from.. and so on. But when a friend who knows a lot about fintech explains that SomeBank is really doing a lot of interesting tech and hiring, I also know how to take that.<p>If you know who the &quot;review&quot; comes from, you can trust it. Otherwise you cannot. I assume this comes down to &quot;word of mouth&quot;, though.')
