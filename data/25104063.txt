I do not agree that the gear to support the pilot is 1-2% (windscreens, ejection seats, life support, 3X redundancy, wasted space and the dimensional burden of it all). It is in fact on the order of 30% as this all has to be carried and thus reduces fuel and limits the plane to ~~7-9G loads.\nAn AI plane will converge to a missile - possibly with 10 or more remote sub-munitions. 20MM cannons? They might be removed to allow for another 20-50 sub-munitions. With AI, these sub-munitions can be dispensed singly or in volleys with active control to deal with any possible escape envelope of the prey.\nThe prey will also evolve to have counter sub-munitions as well as ecm   - all this at blinding speed, with huge savings paying for it all.')
