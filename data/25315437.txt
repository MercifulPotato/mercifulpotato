If you have a private moderated forum (e.g. HN), or even a small one with only 5000 users, that&#x27;s still more than enough to attract spam and trolls. So the small forum operator deletes the spam and the trolling.<p>That’s not decentralized. That’s just small. With decentralized services there is no entity to sue. It would be like trying to sue a torrent. You can’t.<p>Imagine Chase Bank vs Bitcoin. If you want to se Chase Bank, you can. If you want to sue Bitcoin you go pound sand.')
