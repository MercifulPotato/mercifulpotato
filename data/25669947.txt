Moxie went so far as to talk in the biggest hall at the last chaos communication congress about how important it is that we don&#x27;t use decentralized services and clients.<p>I&#x27;m not buying it. Look at Matrix and tell me it&#x27;s holding them back.<p>What&#x27;s holding them back, perhaps, is not having a shitton of money in the bank like Signal, and they&#x27;re actively supportive of decentralization which costs developer resources. Signal (or Matrix, for that matter) <i>could</i> not spend dev time on decentralization and just let the open source community do its thing. But that&#x27;s not what Signal is doing, they&#x27;re instead actively hostile towards it.<p>Or look at Telegram, they have an open network and third party clients. There also are unofficial clients that some people use. But what does the 99% use? The official clients. Signal&#x27;s argument is that people might use insecure, unofficial clients. In practice, that&#x27;s not what your average mom will do. (And it&#x27;s not as if the official Signal app was audited either.)<p>I&#x27;m also not buying the &quot;China can move faster&quot; thing. They can be more oppressive without consequences, but is that really better? Does that &quot;centralized dictatorship&quot; allow them to be &quot;more stable&quot;? It&#x27;s easy to say, and easy to see how indeed an oppressive government&#x27;s decree can change things from one day to the next, but on that scale I think you need to consider more things than I am qualified to do before you can really say whether that is a superior system in a given situation.<p>I guess we conclude the same thing in the end, though, as you say &quot;The internet is too important to herd all our services into control of dictators, no matter how benevolent.&quot;')
