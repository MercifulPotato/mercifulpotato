All the result pages almost contains same result. Let&#x27;s say 7 years back or so. If you go back to 10th page you could see old results(not the latest one). I actually miss those. Now even if you go for more more more it&#x27;s almost same results.<p>So I guess they moved on search engine business. Time to find another search engine, feed their engine with data and see how it goes.<p>So far no complaints on their other products in GCP platforms or drive or store or firebase or domains or app engine or big query or photos.<p>Wait browser based photo UI need to be updated seriously. There are so many photos, they could have options to list them up like folders each month and what folder they were from Android like it&#x27;s downloads, watsapp or camera like seggregate like that, listing them all together in thumbnails in scrolling hell. They need to improve that, I hope they improve before their upgrade next year')
