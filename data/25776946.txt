The long term fortunes to be made are obvious. What isn&#x27;t clear is when. Long term might mean 200 years of development before any money is to be made, and thus you shouldn&#x27;t invest as you will be dead before there is a payoff.  But Long term might be 3 years, in which case it is too late for first mover advantage, the first movers have already (secretly?) put a large sum into their investments - but there might be a profit to me made as a second mover. Of course often the second mover is the one who makes the real money (Bill Gates wasn&#x27;t a first mover in PC operating systems, Digital Research at least was before him), so it isn&#x27;t clear at all when you should get into the market.<p>Good luck. If I had real insight I wouldn&#x27;t be posting it here I&#x27;d be putting everything I had into my investments.')
