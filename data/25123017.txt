The very first question:<p>&gt;Oh, I just pushed a change. I really didnâ€™t wanna push that, so how do I undo it?<p>Is a Github problem, not a git problem. You might as well ask how to unsend an email. If you don&#x27;t know what git push means, you shouldn&#x27;t be using it and are playing with intellectual property fire.<p>The conflation of Github with git is responsible for a lot of confusion. Having Github be your first interaction with git is a disaster.<p>Regardless, there&#x27;s no shortage of blog posts complaining about git being hard. But there is a shortage of effective, popular competitors. I think that, actually, many-chefs many-branch differential version control is just a hard problem and creating a simple model for it is much harder than complaining about git.')
