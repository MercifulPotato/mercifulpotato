Bitcoin is not very useful as a currency. But I trust bitcoin as a concept more than I trust USD, which is currently being devalued&#x2F;inflated in favor of the stock market, solely for the gain of people who are more well off than most. I&#x27;m not a doomsday prophet nor an economist but the future of the world economy is not looking great.<p>Bitcoin was created as something that governments&#x2F;banks&#x2F;corporations couldn&#x27;t control or manipulate and that&#x27;s something that&#x27;s worth a lot in itself, I think.<p>And as I mentioned Monero is quite convenient for shopping on the dark web, without government intervention.<p>If you trust your government, banks, politicians, and agree with all the laws and taxes, then yeah, you might truthfully state that cryptocurrencies are useless. But some believe and argue that governments shouldn&#x27;t have that kind of control and people should have a higher degree of freedom and privacy.<p>This went a bit off topic perhaps.')
