There’s just way too much latency added and dropouts.<p>I like to look at the audio systems that professionals use in broadcast television, and then loo around in that space for creative solutions. The Røde Wireless Go microphone is one such solution (see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rode.com&#x2F;wireless&#x2F;wirelessgo" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rode.com&#x2F;wireless&#x2F;wirelessgo</a> ), but that only handles the microphone side.
