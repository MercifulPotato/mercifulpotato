There&#x27;s just some criteria you have to follow like allowing end-users to re-link their own version of the library and giving back any code changes made to the library itself (which in my experience it was never necessary to make any patches to Qt itself). Whether that extra burden is worth it vs. just paying for a commercial license is up to the individual company.')
