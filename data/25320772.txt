It looks really bad on a terminal emulator that does not support emojis (at least half of the ones out there esp on Linux). There are dozens of emoji fonts which all look different. You never know what your user is going to see. If your users are only using macOS and Terminal.app, then it may not be so bad, but if you are building a command line application, then I should be able to use it from a text-only console on an old system, VM, or embedded device. Don&#x27;t assume all your users are going to be using it from a Macbook Pro or Ubuntu.')
