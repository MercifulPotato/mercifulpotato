I loved the auto-sizing but there were little niggles on the Mac e.g. some windows really needed to be floating and layout oddities when certain windows expected more width.<p>I tended to find I was mostly just using spaces to keep apps I was interested full screen and using the occasional split.  I was just cmd&#x2F;alt-tab&#x27;ing between apps most of the time.  When I did have content in multiple windows it was then a faff to try and get the two windows I wanted in the same space. I didn&#x27;t feel like I was making the most of it.<p>I&#x27;ve since gone back to SizeUp <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irradiatedsoftware.com&#x2F;sizeup&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irradiatedsoftware.com&#x2F;sizeup&#x2F;</a> and manually move windows to where I want them.<p>I feel like I wasn&#x27;t and perhaps I&#x27;m still not using it as effectively as I could though hence the question.')
