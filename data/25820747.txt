Item(by='wegs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610970218, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25819916, text='I don&#x27;t feel too bad about replacement parts being obsoleted for good reason (e.g. leaded solder or similar changes). My car&#x2F;vacuum&#x2F;desk&#x2F;etc. might get hit by a meteor, or fall down the stairs, or otherwise be totaled. Life is full of risks.<p>What I care about is good intent and reasonable measures to support me for the lifetime of the product. In most cases, I can&#x27;t get replacement parts because manufacturers discontinue them after a few years as a business choice, not because they have to. Most manufacturers rotate product models every year, and I presume it&#x27;s expensive and not good business to stock parts for models from a decade ago. That&#x27;s what I want to avoid. I&#x27;d like a manufacturer that will continue supporting me as long as reasonable.<p>What I do now is I look at manufacturer&#x27;s web pages, and see the oldest products they still support. It&#x27;s pathetically short.<p>My last vacuum lasted 15 years before replacement parts ceased to exist. I&#x27;ve been looking at upscale Dyson vacuums, and the oldest ones with replacement parts are a decade old from date-of-introduction (less from date-of-purchase, of course). For a $800 vacuum, that means you&#x27;re looking at an annualized cost of $80-$160 before you&#x27;re dumped on the curb.<p>Of course, there are companies which simply don&#x27;t offer replacement parts. If a roller or belt fails, the vacuum is disposable. The TCO seems similar, since those don&#x27;t run $800, though, and a $150 vacuum will probably last a couple of years before something breaks.<p>What I&#x27;d really like is a web site which compiles this sort of information.')
