These <i>can</i> still break things, but much less frequently.<p>I haven&#x27;t been a distro packager in many years, but my recollection is that in other distros (debian, fedora, arch, etc) patches that add new functionality would generally not be considered okay unless accepted by upstream. I&#x27;d be interested to learn the rationale for not upstreaming this patch before including it.')
