I love Linux and I love running it natively. Currently I can grab almost any Dell, HP, Lenovo, MSI, etc. desktop&#x2F;laptop and there&#x27;s a very good chance all the hardware will work with mainline Linux. If I get a laptop with replaceable Wi-Fi on those little PCI-E or M.2 cards, I can pretty much get past any hardware limitations.<p>Microsoft pretends they&#x27;re onboard with Linux, but they still have hundreds of thousands (maybe millions? I don&#x27;t think they sold that well) Nokia Lumina Windows phones that are e-waste bricks. They&#x27;ve released no docs for people who want to make Linux drivers and people have had to find exploits to unlock their bootloaders.<p>PostmarketOS is making some amazing strides, but they can&#x27;t keep up with all these new incompatible ARM devices. PC architecture based Intel x86&#x2F;64 devices allowed for Linux to thrive in the niece hacker&#x2F;developer world. ARM has no standards for basic-input-output or device management (please don&#x27;t say &quot;device tree.&quot; It&#x27;s garbage and no one uses it).<p>Alternatively, Intel or AMD need to step up their game and show the x86_64 instruction set can be implemented in such a way to get some of the same speed boosts seen on the M1. I&#x27;m not sure which one we&#x27;ll see going forward, but I hope Linux doesn&#x27;t get left behind.')
