Item(by='bhupy', descendants=None, kids=[25865225, 25865260], score=None, time=1611267197, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865000, text='But that&#x27;s sort of a straw-man representation of what (most) Bitcoin adherents see as the future of Bitcoin &#x2F; crypto. I don&#x27;t think anyone serious expects the raw blockchain to power every single transaction in real time, rather it&#x27;s seen as a mechanism to supplant <i>clearing houses</i>. Consider that every night, banks submit batch files to a network of clearing houses in order to electronically transact US dollars (credit cards, Venmo, etc are all just abstractions on top of this ultimate step). The slow, asynchronous blockchain transaction is meant to be a replacement for <i>that</i> step.<p>The steel-man version of the Bitcoin&#x2F;crypto future is that most people would use trust-based institutions to perform instant transactions (like credit cards and Venmo), just that the ultimate step involves an hour long blockchain transaction rather than a days-long ACH batch file. The fact that the Blockchain also enables individual point-to-point payments (albeit slowly) in a trust-less way is more of a replacement to having to mail somebody an envelope&#x2F;briefcase full of cash, which is currently the only way one can transact if one is blacklisted by the centralized institutions. And depending on your political leanings, you might still prefer to use centralized payments on top of Bitcoin&#x2F;crypto instead of on top of USD because with the former, there&#x27;s little room for funny business by central bank reserve messing with the supply of money.')
