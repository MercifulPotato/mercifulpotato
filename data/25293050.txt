I&#x27;d been using LastPass for about a decade and their security quiz told me I was in their top 1% of rated users.<p>1Password was a drop in replacement for me and my family and it even let&#x27;s me save TOTP keys so that&#x27;s very convenient.<p>It also has a printable backup key so it&#x27;s beginner friendly and looks aesthetically pleasing so my partner is happier using it.<p>Meanwhile LastPass was still struggling with U2F&#x2F;WebAuthn support when I last used them.')
