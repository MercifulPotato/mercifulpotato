I also use IntelliJ IDEA every day. And yes, there&#x27;s a bit of mental switching I do, and every now and then I use vim navigation keys while in IDEA, but generally it works for me. Different tools for different jobs.<p>Then again, I have no trouble loading reasonably large documents in vim, so maybe I don&#x27;t have mine <i>quite</i> as customized as the author.<p>BUT I relate to the feeling of not being quite sure that all of my customization are quite enough, of not using vim to its full potential. Or even 10% of its potential.')
