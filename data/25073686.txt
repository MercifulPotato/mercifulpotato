At this point it might just be because I&#x27;m used to Chrome&#x27;s and I just need a little exercise in mental plasticity. However, eventually I&#x27;d like to take a look at porting Vue devtools to Safari, if only for iOS.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just old enough to remember the bad old days, but browser bugs seem very few and far between. One I&#x27;ve found is Chrome&#x27;s implementation of backdrop-filter is extremely buggy, while Safari works 100% of the time. Specifically it seems that two sibling elements cannot both specify a backdrop-filter in Chrome. I work on a rather large SPA and it has only one browser hack: a dummy div that works around Chrome (and thus Edge&#x27;s) implementation.')
