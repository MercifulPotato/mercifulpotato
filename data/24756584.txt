I think the examples images have too fine of a grid that makes the illusion seem unimpressive and trivial.  But if you open them in an image editor (or just use your browser&#x27;s magnify feature) and zoom in, there&#x27;s a point where things change from being just a blurry color image to a surprising illusion.')
