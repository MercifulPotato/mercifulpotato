The European Parliament is ethnically pretty homogeneous, for example.<p>The figures are hard to come by because the EU don&#x27;t record ethnicity AFAIK, but in 2017 there were approximately 17 non-white MEPs out of a total 751. I think 8 of those were from the UK. Given the amount of times I&#x27;ve been called racist for voting to leave the EU, I always find that figure quite hilarious.')
