[1] Instead, they adapted Intel&#x27;s EFI [2] which is meant to replace the legacy BIOS. Now you could argue why Apple didn&#x27;t provide legacy BIOS support like other motherboard manufacturers do today. [3] But I think it conforms to Apple&#x27;s thinking to not adapt old or unnecessary technology in the first place, and fairly quickly dropping support for older technology. This can be seen in Apple&#x27;s hardware decisions by being one of the first companies to use USB in the first iMac in the late 90s, dropping disk drives and other ports, etc. and in their software decisions by dropping old APIs or 32-bit fairly quickly.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Apple%E2%80%93Intel_architecture" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Apple%E2%80%93Intel_architectu...</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unified_Extensible_Firmware_In...</a><p>3: Well, they added BIOS compatibility later, to allow booting OSes like Windows, but what&#x27;s missing is some fancy GUI around it - see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Apple%E2%80%93Intel_architecture#The_EFI_and_GUID_Partition_Table" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Apple%E2%80%93Intel_architectu...</a>')
