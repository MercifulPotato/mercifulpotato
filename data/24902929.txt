The DMCA makes it illegal to distribute software whose intention is to circumvent technical measures that prevent access to copyrighted materials [1]. youtube-dl&#x27;s own documentation provides instructions on downloading copyrighted music videos and its test suite uses copyrighted material as well. It&#x27;s pretty hard, although not impossible, to claim that the intention of the software isn&#x27;t to engage in copyright violations given those two facts.<p>Okay so you make a counterargument that maybe this qualifies as fair-use or falls under some other exemption. Maybe you&#x27;re right, maybe you&#x27;re not right, that&#x27;s for a court to decide. The RIAA&#x27;s lawyer is not here to defend youtube-dl&#x27;s position on the matter, youtube-dl has the responsibility of defending itself and demonstrating why it chose to use copyrighted music videos as the key example and use case.<p>You can object to the law and you can even provide a defense for youtube-dl and counter the takedown notice, but you can&#x27;t say that RIAA&#x27;s lawyer abused the DMCA takedown process by defending its client.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.copyright.gov&#x2F;policy&#x2F;1201&#x2F;#:~:text=Enacted%20in%201998%20as%20part,in%20technology%20or%20services%20that" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.copyright.gov&#x2F;policy&#x2F;1201&#x2F;#:~:text=Enacted%20in%...</a>')
