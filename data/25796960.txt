For example, the filesystem journal may record &quot;CREATE FILE&quot;, which translates to &quot;update directory entry 1234 in directory block 5678, then allocate and initialize extent descriptor 9999, then write an inode at array entry 74234&quot;<p>- Database journalling is making robust changes to the data structures describing the actual file contents, in units of atomic logical application operations. For example, a DB journal may record &quot;INSERT ROW&quot;, which translates to &quot;update block 123 of this index file, and 234 of this data file&quot;, application-specific relationships like that cannot be captured by the filesystem on UNIX.<p>(Note: NTFS is transactional on Windows. It&#x27;s entirely possible to correlate independent writes and make them atomic, so on Windows at least, in theory a DB could exist without a separate journal. I don&#x27;t know if this is used in practice). Even if it were in use, it places severe limits on the kinds of concurrency optimizations a database system could otherwise perform, because all of that stuff moves behind the curtain of the OS interfaces.')
