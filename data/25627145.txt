And I think the yak shaving on one’s config isn’t really a great use of time (if you want it as a hobby then I guess that’s fine).<p>I totally agree. The only reason I justify my Emacs customization is because I customize it very slowly, over years, and periodically remove things I don’t use any more.<p>It’s getting harder to justify now that alternatives like VS Code have a bucketload of features and working autocomplete without futzing around too much. It’s just that VS Code is so <i>damn slow.</i> Maybe better language server support will bring me back to Emacs as my daily driver in a couple years, or maybe I’ll be paying for CLion.')
