The pessimist in me sees a future where these local business are largely gone, kind of like how Walmart and other big box stores replaced many small, local retailers.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;7&#x2F;12&#x2F;15961416&#x2F;spotify-fake-artist-controversy-mystery-tracks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;7&#x2F;12&#x2F;15961416&#x2F;spotify-fake-art...</a>')
