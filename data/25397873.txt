These assumptions are presented as true at school, in work, on TV, etc and they see that everyone else treats these assumptions as true, so... well they are true, right?<p>People cannot accept holding something as a hypothesis.  They may even say they do this, but they do not change their hypotheses when they get new information.  If pushed, they may state something to be a &#x27;hypothesis&#x27; and that they use the word &#x27;know&#x27; as a shortcut to that - all fine - but then if they are presented with additional information they cannot take it on and will reject it.  Cognitive dissonance has no place in their minds - it is a tension that is unacceptable.  Apparently most of us seek certainty and prefer a certain story to just resting with the evidence.<p>The idea of &#x27;believing we know&#x27; permeates our lives, and is why I argue that science is religion.  And beliefs held as true operate on fundamental levels, despite a lack of verified evidence.<p>TLDR, people prefer stories to truth.')
