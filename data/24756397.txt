The slaughter ban enacted over a decade ago has emptied out horses from the American heartland. Lots of them starved to death. Many of them ended up slaughtered anyway, only in much poorer conditions in Mexico. Large livestock used to have inherent value in this country. Not anymore. We&#x27;re the India of horses.<p>When poor rural families are doing fine, spending thirty bucks a month on feeding and caring for a horse is no problem. But poor families know they won&#x27;t be doing fine forever. They can&#x27;t afford to spend $800 on a horse they don&#x27;t know they&#x27;ll be able to sell at all if they need to do so suddenly. So, lots of kids who would have spent time around horses absent the ban, haven&#x27;t.<p>Rich morons and the charities they support don&#x27;t care about that. There are still markets in place for horses with economic value such as Thoroughbred race horses. Although, since they don&#x27;t race their entire natural lives, Thoroughbreds have also been harmed by the slaughter ban.')
