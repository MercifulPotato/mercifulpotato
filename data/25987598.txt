In other words the market will protect itself.<p>In the case of $GME even the major shareholders who have the majority of their funds tied up in other stocks are motivated to do what they can to end the $GME “squeeze” because over time they have more to lose from it than gain. The reason being is at best the volatility will pull the market down and at worst the liquidation of large funds will cause the market to dip more violently.<p>Even though this dip may only be momentary if it doesn’t correct itself quickly it will eat into quarterly or yearly profits and reported earnings. It is also likely that capital will move out of the US stock market and into other markets&#x2F;investments or stores of value.<p>The only market participants that would like to see the “squeeze” continue are those holding a large amount  of cash because they can “buy the dip”.<p>Am are right here? Is this how it is going to play out? Is there anything I am not seeing or taking into account?')
