It&#x27;s really nice. Walkable neighbourhoods full of interesting things to see and do, because that space isn&#x27;t being wasted on car storage.<p>&gt; As for sharing everything, it&#x27;s a good theory but would never work in practice. Have you ever lived with people outside of your family or bubble? Some people are filthy and don&#x27;t even take care of things they own, let alone things they don&#x27;t.<p>That seems like a problem that can be solved technologically. Certainly e.g. Zipcars have always been clean when I got in them, somehow.')
