It showed his name, google profile, and photo. Their name helped me find their Facebook and Instagram. Long story short, I got my money back.<p>Iirc: Google used to enable allowing people to look you up  by your phone number (it was something along the lines of: help your friends find your account). This used to be on by default, it doesn’t seem to be anymore.<p>Try looking up your friend’s google voice numbers in google voice and see if they have the option enabled.')
