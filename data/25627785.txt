It showed his name, google profile, and photo. Their name helped me find their Facebook and Instagram. Long story short, I got my money back.<p>Iirc: Google used to enable allowing people to look you up  by your phone number (help your friends find your account). This used to be on by default, it doesn’t seem to be anymore.<p>Try looking up your friend’s google voice numbers in google voice and see if they have the option enabled.')
