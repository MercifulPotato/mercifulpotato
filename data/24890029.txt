Item(by='Rochus', descendants=None, kids=[24890739], score=None, time=1603661181, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24889547, text='&gt; The test is whether the tool is designed and&#x2F;or offered for the purpose of circumventing copyright<p>It is not more designed and&#x2F;or offered for this purpose than any other communication tool. At least I didn&#x27;t see an evidence. The fact that it could be used is not sufficient. The goal of the whole exercise was probably more to set an example and to intimidate people a bit.<p>EDIT: That is probably why they called in the RIAA, which is quite peculiar. The RIAA is no copyright collective, is it?')
