But that&#x27;s to be expected because it&#x27;s a fictional drama and not a documentary.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that Cameron was &quot;zoomed out&quot; after the first season either. Her role in the 2nd season was bigger than the first. Frankly I like the way they written her in the later seasons because even from the first season she reminded of engineers who have more attitude than skill (and we&#x27;ve all worked with people like that!) so seeing her career largely wash out felt more authentic to how a character like her would have survived through those eras.<p>On balance though, I felt this show was largely overrated. It had some good content but it was waaaay over the top with the melodrama. Unfortunately geek drama rarely satisfies American audiences so they need arson, punch ups and adultery to weaved into the story line.')
