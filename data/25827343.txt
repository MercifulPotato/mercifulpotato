The trick seems to depend on the fact that the dataset is a sequence of frames of  the same object shot from slightly different angles.  But that&#x27;s a terrible dataset - it might work for training a toy proof-of-concept, but if you actually wanted to do calorie estimation in the wild, you&#x27;d need a much more varied (and larger) training set.  And once you have that, you lose the properties that made this labelling approach viable in the first place.')
