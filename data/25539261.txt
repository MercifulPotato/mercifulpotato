Based on my experience with studying and notetaking, I think retention is better with paper because it&#x27;s an object you&#x27;re interacting with. The fact that text (whether I&#x27;m reading or writing it) is on a static location relative to the world seems to give it some extra anchor in my memory. Assuming I&#x27;m not completely imagining that effect, then an eink monitor wouldn&#x27;t have any of those benefits.')
