Tried to get a discount in our Inner Sunset 1BR that we paid $3250 for. Other units in the same building listed for the past few months for $2700 with 2 months free (effectively $2250).<p>Denied a decrease (citing CA Fair Housing and not giving anyone a decrease) so we paid 1 months rent to break the lease. Now living in a 2BR by the beach for the same price as before with 50% more space, W&#x2F;D, garage.<p>Old apartment went from ~10 vacant 1BR to ~25 vacant 1BR listings during the past couple of months during our negotiation and move.')
