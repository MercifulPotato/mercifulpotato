(N)RVO <i>can</i> elide the copy, but it&#x27;s not guaranteed, and in any case, not always applicable. So destructors are still lexically scoped.<p>What makes C++ flexible in practice is move semantics, which lets you move-return values, such that only the destructor call on the caller side is the one that matters.')
