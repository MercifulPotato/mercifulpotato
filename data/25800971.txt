I&#x27;m saying you clearly don&#x27;t mean that... so you must mean some evolved response you are anthropomorphizing as &quot;not allowing&quot;.<p>The best response to a hot desert is to move slowly and surely to some place to hide, which is the opposite optimal strategy for a boiling pot of water (jump rapidly, try as many times as possible in a short time).  An evolved response to survive in a hot desert would work against the boiling pot situation.')
