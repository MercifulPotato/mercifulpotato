Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=[25801093], score=None, time=1610786036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25799927, text='&gt; no animal would allow itself to be boiled alive<p>The most plain reading of this statement implies both understanding of the situation, and consent, which implies an understanding of self and the implications for the self.  I&#x27;m saying you clearly don&#x27;t mean that... so you must be anthropomorphizing some evolved environmental response as &quot;not allowing&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m arguing that very few frogs and their ancestors have been in situations where the best response to slowly rising heat  is to move frantically.  So, maybe the have some other evolved response that will get them out of the pot, but it&#x27;s almost certainly not an evolved response to an evolutionary pressure of slowly rising water temperatures.<p>The best response to a hot desert is to move slowly and surely to some place to hide, which is the opposite optimal strategy for a boiling pot of water (jump rapidly, try as many times as possible in a short time).  An evolved response to survive in a hot desert would work against the boiling pot situation.<p>&gt; By that logic people will stay outside and freeze to death from hypothermia<p>This analogy makes no sense unless you think frogs have a human-like ability to understand situations and plan.  Humans&#x27; response to extreme cold is dominated by their understanding of the self and their situation.  Even some humans will die of hypothermia in their own homes before seeking help[0].  Humans starting to get hypothermia don&#x27;t run around frantically, which is what heated frogs need to do in order to survive a hot pot.  The analogy is just badly broken.<p>This is your second response that seems to be anthropomorphizing frogs.  Frogs aren&#x27;t just small slow thinking humans without opposable thumbs.  Their response to situation is different in kind, not just degree, from that of humans.  Reasoning by analogy with human behavior is downright misleading.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?q=hide+and+die+syndrome" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?q=hide+and+die+syndrome</a>')
