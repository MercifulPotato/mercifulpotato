We don&#x27;t know what allergies the affected people had AFAIK, but the advice goes far beyond people with a history of severe reactions to vaccines&#x2F;its ingredients:<p>&gt; “Any person with a history of a significant allergic reaction to a vaccine, medicine or food (such as previous history of anaphylactoid reaction or those who have been advised to carry an adrenaline autoinjector) should not receive the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine,” it said.<p>I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to vaccines, I&#x27;m unaware of having a reaction to any medicine, so from what Pfizer said I could have been in the trial. But I&#x27;d be excluded by this new advice because I carry an epi-pen for a food allergy.')
