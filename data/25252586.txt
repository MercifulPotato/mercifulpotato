Item(by='ehnto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606734193, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25251526, text='&gt; Both the EV tax and the ICE fine for parking in EV slots were mentioned in the original article<p>I think the discussion just moved on that&#x27;s all. I wasn&#x27;t commenting about the fine,the fine makes sense.<p>My suggestion was to inflate general tax revenue with a carbon emissions tax on all carbon heavy activities (driving or other). Then forget the per-mile&#x2F;per-litre stuff all together. I wouldn&#x27;t even be against an infrastructure tax levy in my income tax.<p>Part of my enthusiasm for that is so that the absurd spend on car infrastructure is actually pitted against other options such as public transport projects and my hope is thst more public infrastructure would be built because of that.<p>But I am spitballing policy here, I haven&#x27;t thought particularly deeply about a restructuring like that and it depends on where you live too.')
