If you dig deeper however, you&#x27;ll sometimes learn that the thing you considered overly complicated, was actually designed that way, not to annoy you, but because the same tool has to support use cases you didn&#x27;t consider or don&#x27;t understand.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that things couldn&#x27;t be simpler in many cases.')
