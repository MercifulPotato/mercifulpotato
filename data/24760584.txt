Sure, granted. But the title doesn&#x27;t say &quot;It isn&#x27;t reasonable&#x2F;feasible to compute explicit probabilities in all cases.&quot; , it says what probability _can&#x27;t_ do.<p>And the article does not demonstrate the existence of something that probability _can&#x27;t_ do.<p>The main content of the page might be, fine I guess (I&#x27;m having trouble finding it), but it doesn&#x27;t address what the title says it addresses.<p>What are the things that probability can&#x27;t do? What I&#x27;m asking for, which is my initial interpretation of the title, is not merely a single example, but rather an explanation of a _class_ of things which &quot;probability can&#x27;t do&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a complete characterization, but it should give a sufficient condition for something to be something that &quot;probability can&#x27;t do&quot;.<p>If you have a single example which you can demonstrate that &quot;probability can&#x27;t do&quot;, you should be able to take that example, and then ask &quot;what things could I change in this example without changing the validity of the argument?&quot;, which should then give you a broader class of things which &quot;probability can&#x27;t do&quot;.<p>The article by nostalgabraist which this article links to, I like much more.\nEspecially section 8.<p>I saw another post on lesswrong semi-recently which talked about Jeffry updates, and Jeffrey Bolker&#x27;s broader generalized probability theory ideas. That was pretty good I thought. The point about updating on an uncertain observation (the &quot;Jeffry updates&quot;) part I especially thought was convincing.<p>___<p>So far, the real shortcomings in the base form of (&quot;strong&quot;) bayesian probability that I see&#x2F;understand are :<p>1) observations we make are not suddenly gaining perfect certainty of a proposition, but rather some sense experiences. We may not be entirely sure of what we are seeing.<p>2) we have bounded computation and memory, and as such:<p>2.i) we cannot enumerate all the possibly hypotheses that could be relevant<p>2.ii) we cannot process all of the logical implications even just between the different hypotheses that we do consider')
