They can be useful. Not that often, sure, but still. Not zero. They have something to do with what I&#x27;m trying to use Google for.<p>They&#x27;re not random attention whore ads like, say, newspaper sites have. No big, moving, brightly colored &quot;CONTEST! PARTICIPATE!&quot; ad, none for getting a fitness subscription and no attempt to sell me wine.<p>But you&#x27;re right that they aren&#x27;t &quot;pull&quot; in an absolute sense. I guess I still think they were closer to &quot;pull&quot; ads than pretty much any other website I use. And if the whole web would do ads Google style, I&#x27;d be very happy and consider that a big improvement.')
