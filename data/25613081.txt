However if you ask me today what did I learn in the last year, my answer will barely scratch the surface of everything I have read. Effectively, it means that the time I have spent reading was merely spent on a diversion, not  learning. I still hope that everything I have read is somehow absorbed in my unconsciousness, but being honest with myself I understand that should I have taken at least a few notes, and should I have reviewed those notes at least once or twice during the year, I would have probably <i>learnt</i> much more.<p>Tangentially: unlearn to read mostly blogs and learn to start more books; unlearn to be only motivated by doing things and spend more time learning new things; unlearn to pile up open tabs with &quot;things to read later because I don&#x27;t have enough focus for it now&quot; (and I don&#x27;t know how to solve the latter yet).<p>A single blog post (oh the irony...) that acted as a catalyst for the thinking process that lead me to this decision: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maartenvandoorn.nl&#x2F;reading-guide" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maartenvandoorn.nl&#x2F;reading-guide</a> (It was  previously shared somewhere on the HN by the way).')
