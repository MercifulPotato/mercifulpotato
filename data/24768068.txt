Item(by='blisterpeanuts', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602612368, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764605, text='Years ago, I was a contract programmer at a large university, working on Perl reporting scripts for the library system.<p>Once a month, they reloaded the patron database; it took about 24 hours.  If there were a network interruption or power glitch, it would have to be rolled back and run again the next day.  Pretty bad.<p>It wasn&#x27;t my task, but I was curious why this program took so long to run, so I started picking it apart.  It was written by a PL&#x2F;I programmer -- his first Perl project.  No comments.  He was no longer there.  No one understood the script.<p>I started changing things, among other things I moved the Oracle-specific DBD calls out into a separate module, because someone on the internet said Perl ran more efficiently that way.  And poof! just like that, the program then ran in 8 minutes, down from 24 hours.<p>I looked like a hero, but I very openly said I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what I did. Just got curious and moved things around, and apparently discovered some bug in the DBD layer by pure accident.<p>Sometimes curiosity and willingness to experiment is all it takes.')
