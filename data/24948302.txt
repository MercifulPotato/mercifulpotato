Clearly not the kind of policy a sane system would result in.<p>If you&#x27;ve owned a home in California for more than about 20 years, and you aren&#x27;t in one of the senior citizen categories that is exempt from tax increases, it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to sell your home unless you leave the state.')
