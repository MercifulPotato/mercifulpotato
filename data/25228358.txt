It is the wrong solution for a real problem.<p>But I think what many people get wrong (not the person I&#x27;m replying to) is that how you write code and how you execute code does not have to be the same.<p>This is essentially why google made their N:M threading patches: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lore.kernel.org&#x2F;lkml&#x2F;20200722234538.166697-1-posk@posk.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lore.kernel.org&#x2F;lkml&#x2F;20200722234538.166697-1-posk@po...</a><p>This is why Golang uses goroutines. This is why Javascript made async&#x2F;await. This is why project loom exists. This is why erlang uses erlang processes.<p>All of these initiatives make it possible to write synchronous code and execute it as if it was written asynchronously.<p>And I think all of this also makes it clear that how you write code and how code is executed is not the same, so yes, I&#x27;m in agreement with the person I&#x27;m replying to, I don&#x27;t think this will change how code is written that much, because this can&#x27;t make writing code asynchronously any less of a bad idea than it is now.')
