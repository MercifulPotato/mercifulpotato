I don&#x27;t think full-tang is a prerequisite for BIFL. Why? Because I have my grandmother&#x27;s kitchen knife from Ireland from the 1910&#x27;s and it isn&#x27;t full tang and is still a workhorse despite having the handle replaced sometime in the 70&#x27;s.<p>So what is a rating system to do when people have very different ideas on BIFL?<p>For this existential dilemma, it would be helpful if the top DIMENSIONS of quality were explored. In this case with a knife: tang, bolster, handle material, riveting, metal type, hardness, grind angle, etc are all variables that have either a PREFERENCE scale or a DURABILITY scale. I don&#x27;t think a simple NoSQL-comment-style database is sufficient to define what elements need to be considered to rank a product as high quality vs. low quality.<p>You must know about AvE&#x27;s YouTube channel, yes? He&#x27;s an engineer who deeply understands metallurgy and machining and industrial design, so he can explore these vectors of quality for power tools:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UChWv6Pn_zP0rI6lgGt3MyfA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UChWv6Pn_zP0rI6lgGt3MyfA</a><p>This kind of professional analysis is needed FIRST, to determine what the key metrics are. Then the rating system should grade based on this, rather than 5-stars.<p>Five star reviews are dead. Long live multiple variables!')
