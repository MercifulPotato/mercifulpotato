Some of these lines were originally cable car! So, it isn’t that the city completely neglected public transportation, but just didn’t complete the subway portion (in 1925).<p>Sadly, the streetcar was eventually dismantled (1952), so you can still lament the lack of public transportation.<p>I live near one of the old streetcar stops, and it would be great to still have that kind of access to downtown.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cincinnati_Street_Railway" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cincinnati_Street_Railway</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wcpo.com&#x2F;longform&#x2F;a-city-built-by-streetcars-a-look-back-at-cincinnatis-street-railroads" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wcpo.com&#x2F;longform&#x2F;a-city-built-by-streetcars-a-l...</a>')
