So if you&#x27;ve got 16 devices, they all share that few gigabits of potential airtime assuming they have all nearly perfect connections to the AP. My 16-port gigabit switch can handle 32Gbit of switching, significantly more throughput than the latest WiFi can even hope to achieve in ideal circumstances. Adding more capacity is buying another switch. Depending on the existing density and RF noise of the area, you might not be able to add much more density even with adding more APs.<p>I think its more that we&#x27;re seeing wireless get somewhat competitive with its wired counterparts in the home, not necessarily that its surpassing it. Its still not as reliable as wired. Unless you live in a anechoic chamber you&#x27;re going to get dropped frames from time to time, requiring retransmits and increasing your jitter. If you&#x27;re experiencing that on your wired networking, you either messed up your cable runs or you need to step outside of your microwave oven.<p>That said, 10GbE+ outside of the datacenter has been a long time coming. Its there, but its not very widespread. Most devices tend to use a good bit of power and are rather expensive. On top of that, unless you&#x27;re doing something datacenter-like (using a SAN or building HPC cluster) you usually don&#x27;t experience much of a difference. In the few instances where you <i>might</i> want more throughput, you can often set up your devices in a LAGG to combine multiple gigabit ports to increase aggregate throughput.')
