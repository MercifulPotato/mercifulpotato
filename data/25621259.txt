I&#x27;d rather run longer computations on my desktop system, which can handle these loads for a long period time without getting stressed thermally.<p>My use case is to run ground-truth code designed by my professor and cross-check the results generated by my scientific software. These MATLAB&#x2F;Octave generated values are also incorporated to sanity check and CI pipelines to test developed software&#x27;s sanity and computational integrity.')
