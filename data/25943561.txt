Item(by='FabHK', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611848504, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25942240, text='The article is very tendentious.<p>I despise HFT as much as the next guy, but it&#x27;s mostly useless rent seeking, economically, not massive manipulation. There is money on the table in trading, and the HFT firms try to take a bigger part of that pie, rather than letting it go to their competitors or other traders (like funds or retail investors).<p>Next, hedge funds shorting businesses they consider overvalued is a perfectly fine activity that helps price discovery and capital allocation. To the extent that they are deceptive and manipulative, that is a problem, just as deceptively and manipulatively hyping a stock up is a problem.<p>Finally, note that there is no value created here. It&#x27;s purely a transfer of money. A few hedge funds might lose something (though that remains to be seen - shorts have no expiry, per se, and the borrow cost is absolutely manageable over days, weeks, or even months).<p>But mostly, this will be a huge transfer of money from those that jumped on the long trade late, to those that were in it early.<p>EDIT to add: And, putting a cherry on the fine research that went into the article, the Keynes quote is from A. Gary Shilling from the 1980s.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quoteinvestigator.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;08&#x2F;09&#x2F;remain-solvent&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quoteinvestigator.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;08&#x2F;09&#x2F;remain-solvent&#x2F;</a>')
