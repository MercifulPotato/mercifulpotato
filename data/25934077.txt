However, it&#x27;s entirely likely that through sheer force of personality and name recognition, Cuban can force through a program of &quot;check our company first&quot;, without advertising any particular drug, that gets popular among doctors.  Hopefully that will drive eyes to the company without running afoul of the FDA&#x27;s well intentioned but horribly gone wrong rule.')
