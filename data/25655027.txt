That really captivated her because it was something she could show off to her friends.<p>Same with the calculator. I remember kids having those at school and programming them when I was young. It was something you could actually bring to school and show off, it was something relevant to all kids because they all had to get one.<p>Another modern suggestion would be mobile app dev.')
