Harbor Freight is known for high variance.  If they added a “no really, not destined for a landfill” brand line that was 99% unbreakable, then that would bubble up to the top.<p>The problem with trusting brands is that manufacturers (like whirlpool and frigidaire) intentionally rotate which of their sub brands is garbage every few years to prevent people from avoiding planned obsolescence.<p>Better then, to go off of manufacturers &#x2F; holding companies &#x2F; design houses, but that varies by industry.  (In computing, counting all the name brand computer companies as design houses would make sense.  But then, what about ikea appliances?  They’re mostly rebranded whirlpools...)<p>The other problem is that internal politics can tear down a reliable brand in less time than it takes their old stuff to fail.  Various shoe brands in the late 90’s come to mind.  They went from reliably lasting years to lasting 6 months (there was a trend where the hiking or leather tongue bottoms were replaced by tennis shoe style material).')
