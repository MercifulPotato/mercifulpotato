They are no longer shipping it with Edge and IE and are preventing it from running there.  You can choose to run it in other ways, but Microsoft does not want their browser used as an vehicle for exploits that come through Adobe.  Chrome and Firefox are planning to do the same, for similar reasons, and you can also get Flash working on those manually if needed in similar ways.<p>The title here is pure clickbait.  It&#x27;s not Windows 10, it&#x27;s a change in the <i>default behavior</i> of Edge and IE, and eventually Firefox and Chrome.  A change that&#x27;s as easy to work around as it was to get flash originally before browser vendors started including it by default.<p>If you want to talk about signed bootloaders and completely locked down systems and app stores and how those devices aren&#x27;t really owned by you anymore, I&#x27;m totally on board.  But to say that a change in the default behavior of a few applications on just some of the operating systems you can install on your PC is evidence of you not owning your computer, I think that&#x27;s a lot harder of a case to make.')
