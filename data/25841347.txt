Item(by='wutbrodo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611105162, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25840515, text='Yes, I agree, and tried to capture this sentiment in my edit. It&#x27;s easy to sit in an ivory tower and sniff about how the masses don&#x27;t agree with you, and it&#x27;s much harder to find an intersection point that fires up the masses while also doing some good. The latter is how change actually happens, so I give a lot of leeway to activist or policy groups when it comes to not having perfect policy goals.<p>BLM 2015 didn&#x27;t quite meet this tradeoff, and was in some cases explicitly against race-blind solutions to police violence and in favor of pseudoscience like IATs (at which point their detachment from reality points them in the opposite direction from managing to do good). BLM 2020 is pretty different in character, and while it still has its stupidities, I reckon that it&#x27;s a decent enough direction that it may lead to some positive change.')
