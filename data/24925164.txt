They aren&#x27;t told it&#x27;s a no-win situation, the goal is to make sure they can keep calm and see how they cope with the situation.<p>In the scenario, they&#x27;re in command of a starship and have to rescue another ship, named the Kobayashi Maru, but in doing so they fall into a trap that results in both ships being destroyed and all crew killed.<p>TOS-era Captain Kirk was the first to win the no-win scenario.  He did so by cheating: reprogramming the computer.')
