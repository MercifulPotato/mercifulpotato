And when they build an upper floor, they love complex roof systems where almost every upper floor window has a first floor roof or porch below it.<p>This means problems like fires spreading to adjacent buildings and fires trapping people where they can&#x27;t escape are much reduced; you&#x27;d never see a repeat of the great fire of London in an American suburb because there&#x27;s practically a fire break between every single home.<p>This is made affordable by America&#x27;s vast tracts of land and high rates of car ownership.')
