Ideally your NT6 BOOT folder would be on your C: volume too, and that partiton would be Actively bootable instead of some separate hidden boot partition.  The NT6 BOOT folder migrated toward hidden during Windows 7 support period.  Both NT5 &amp; NT6 work with either combined or separate Boot &amp; System partitions.<p>So you&#x27;re basically ready to install XP alongside W10 (without reformatting of course) into its own dedicated folder other than WINDOWS.  I suggest the folder WINXP instead of the WINNT name that was also shared by W2K and earlier NT.  The XP setup routine will prompt you to create a different folder on your target volume if there is already a WINDOWS folder there.  You will have already needed to rename the W10 Program Files folder to something like Program10Files so it will not be replaced by the XP install.  The only other folder written by XP setup is Documents And Settings, so there will be a real folder there when finished and W10 can handle it no differently than the default symlink it carries for backward compatibility.<p>Simply XP setup will overwrite the bootsector of your Active volume with an NT5 NTLDR-seeking version, put NTDETECT.COM, BOOT.INI, and NTLDR on the root of your Active boot volume next to the NT6 BOOTMGR and BOOT folder already there, and write the three WINXP, Program Files, &amp; Documents and Settings folders to C:.<p>And act like you no longer have Windows 10 unless you know better.<p>Windows 10 is of course still properly installed too, but it will need a BOOTMGR-seeking bootsector again which can be easily replaced from the command prompt of W10 install media using the BOOTSECT.EXE command.  Before you boot back to Windows 10, you need to also rename the new Program Files folder to something like ProgramXPFiles, and rename Program10Files back to plain Program Files.<p>Then it will act like you don&#x27;t have XP any more<p>So then you add an NTLDR entry to the W10 boot menu using BCDEDIT.EXE, not a difficult exercise, and you get freedom of choice.<p>When XP boots it doesn&#x27;t use the Program Files folder anyway until you actually try to run a program residing there.<p>So you can do file management, and lots of other things when booted to XP whenever you want with fewer headaches many times than NT6.<p>Even without drivers for all your devices, none of them current either, and default low-resolution graphics.<p>Too bad going forward Intel is discontinuing BIOS support leaving only UEFI on its branded mainboards.')
