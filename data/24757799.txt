I wish gdb and lldb pick on up this quickly and that it doesn&#x27;t need you to specify anything explicitly.<p>* If you&#x27;re doing JITing with LLVM, you can now run your code&#x27;s static initializations (which apparently you couldn&#x27;t before? :-O )<p>* Lots of RISC-V-related work (features, optimization improvements and bug fixes).<p>* Nothing new for PTX (the CUDA IR which you can use LLVM to generate).')
