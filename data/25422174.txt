Even on non-mobile devices obvious actions and behaviours are made impossible. Want to open a new tab for every folder in Drive? Tough luck, you can&#x27;t use middle click nor &quot;Open in new tab&quot; since it&#x27;s some poorly made abomination without respect for the user. So you need to go back, but it&#x27;s a large folder and will never load folders in one go, so you have to scroll down again and spend 5 seconds for the animations to end and load the next dozen elements. Just one of the many things personally annoying me, and it&#x27;s not limited to it alone but all Google services, they are definitely among the worst I&#x27;ve ever had to deal with when it comes to usability.')
