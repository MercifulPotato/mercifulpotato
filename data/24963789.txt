Often a Pilot Metropolitan fountain pen, Marvy Le Pen (almost felt-like), and also gel rollers from Muji (0.38, 0.5, 0.7).<p>Overall, the Le Pen is my favorite, but I notice an improvement in style and consistency with the fountain pen.<p>I think one of the main differences between &#x27;the old days&#x27; and what we&#x27;re taught now is that we&#x27;re not raised to write from the shoulder, which can lead to extra strain and exhaustion.
