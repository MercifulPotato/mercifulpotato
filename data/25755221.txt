The optimal treatment for persistent Borrelia infection remains to be determined.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;324539470_Persistent_Borrelia_Infection_in_Patients_with_Ongoing_Symptoms_of_Lyme_Disease" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;324539470_Persisten...</a><p>2019: \n&gt;We collected data from an online survey of 200 of our patients, which evaluated the efficacy of dapsone (diaminodiphenyl sulfone, ie, DDS) combined with other antibiotics and agents that disrupt biofilms for the treatment of chronic Lyme disease&#x2F;post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). ... Conclusion DDS CT decreased eight major Lyme symptoms severity and improved treatment outcomes among patients with chronic Lyme disease&#x2F;PTLDS and associated coinfections.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6388746&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6388746&#x2F;</a><p>2020:\n&gt; This study, which drew on a sample of over 3500 patients ... Approximately half (53%) of the patients in the study reported some improvement, and more than a third (35%) were “high responders” to antibiotic treatment, underscoring the value of large samples, subgroup analysis, and real-world evidence as standard components of Lyme disease treatment studies. This spectrum of improvement is consistent with reports for most pharmaceuticals due to patient treatment response variation \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;2227-9032&#x2F;8&#x2F;4&#x2F;383" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;2227-9032&#x2F;8&#x2F;4&#x2F;383</a><p>They only test for Borrelia Burgdorferi.
