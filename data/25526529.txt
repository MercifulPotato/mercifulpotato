Google will try to monetize the data somehow but not outright sell it, while Fitbit might have sold it directly if they stayed independent, especially if they struggled financially.<p>But really, neither Google nor Fitbit are the biggest worry, the mere existence of such health tracking devices already is the problem.  Health Insurers and even life Insurers will ask you to submit your data &quot;voluntarily&quot;. Right now, there are plenty of insurers already who offer rebates on premiums if you wear a health tracker and submit data showing you meet some goals[1].<p>My guess is that in the future policies in many jurisdictions will become prohibitively expensive without the &quot;rebate&quot; you get for wearing health tracking devices, if this goes unregulated (or any such regulations are not enforced). Insurers might force you into &quot;voluntarily&quot; sharing your data this way, and may even force you into &quot;voluntarily&quot; sharing historical data when you apply for a policy.<p>My German insurer offers to pitch in I think 90 EUR to buy a fitness&#x2F;health tracking device. They cannot ask me or anybody for the data (yet) in return for rebates or amenities, due to regulation, which is good. However, I already dread the day when our politicians decide that to &quot;help people stay fit&quot; and &quot;encourage people to stay healthy&quot; and &quot;help reduce insurance costs for regular(!) people(!)&quot; the regulations need to change to allow such schemes.<p>[1] e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;25&#x2F;an-insurance-company-wants-you-hand-over-your-fitbit-data-so-they-can-make-more-money-should-you&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;25&#x2F;an-insura...</a>')
