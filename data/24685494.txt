In fact, the explanation of &quot;don&#x27;t shake their cells enough&quot; must be very fringe because I haven&#x27;t heard it any one time before from any serious scientist or a health book etc. The human body is much more complicated, and the way we understand many of the functions of it, including healthy functions, are based on biochemistry, both intra-cell and throughout the body.<p>Also &quot;shaking the cells&quot; can&#x27;t even be that important physically, when you compare the speeds at which the limbs move during running to the base speeds of molecules inside the cell due to basic heat-based brownian motion.')
