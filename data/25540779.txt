But I think it&#x27;s rather unlikely.<p>Aside from that, I seriously doubt that just disruption of AT&amp;T services was the objective here. Considering that this appears to have been a rather serious explosion, I guess the intent was more likely destruction rather than disruption.<p>With the amount of 5G nut jobs running around these days, I suspect that it is far more likely that somebody just seriously underestimated what it takes to bring down a building like this one.<p>But I guess that time will tell (more). I&#x27;m just speculating of course.')
