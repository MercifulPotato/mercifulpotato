Most experts in substance abuse normally say Alcohol is the worst of all the substances. With many stating, it causes more havoc in families on scale than heroin. More people die because of Alcohol, not just from drinking it but from drink drivers, drunken fights, etc. The general violence caused by it is more than any other drug. The amount of families dealing with alcohol abuse with their family is more than any other substance. Drugs like heroin cause crime problems and family problems not because of what the drug does but because of the cost of the drug. It generally causes lots of petty crimes instead of murder, rape, etc.')
