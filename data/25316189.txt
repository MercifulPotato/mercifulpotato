The abuser may even pretend to apologize to the abused.<p>5) Months later, the abuser only remembers &quot;both sides were wrong&quot; or the abused &quot;kind of deserved it&quot;<p>The relevant quote is &quot;Propriety is the least of all laws, but the most obeyed.&quot; If a person offends the group&#x27;s vague sense of manners, that person risks being condemned and ostracized. But if a person can cloak their action under a thin veneer of respectability (propriety), they can do quite a bit, even harm a fellow human being, without being detected.')
