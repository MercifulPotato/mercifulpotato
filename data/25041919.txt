Item(by='hellotomyrars', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604971140, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25038734, text='I recently somehow ended up on a mailing list exchanging free products for reviews.<p>Decided I was curious and followed up. The process was incredibly effortless and quick. I haven&#x27;t received the product yet (which I will review but I&#x27;m not going to lie about it if it sucks). They sent me slightly more than the cost of the item via paypal 30 minutes after I placed my order.<p>I was surprised how quick and easy it was. No wonder it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;ve also gotten plenty of those cards or similar offers from stuff I&#x27;ve ordered on Amazon in the last six months. Never followed up on those.')
