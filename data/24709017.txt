A friend of mine ran a machine shop in the early 2000s that had the world&#x27;s largest plasma cutter. Apparently one afternoon the police and FAA showed up to investigate their property.  The plasma cutter was generating enough interference to cause computer problems at IAH airport and on landing planes (their shop was in the flight path of the aiport.)  Allegedly it had taken the FAA months to figure out where it was coming from due to the fact the plasma cutter was typically only running for a few minutes at a time.')
