Item(by='neilv', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607554555, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25362807, text='The keys incident was a good example of <i>one</i> general weakness that I&#x27;d want to vet: how easy is it for an arbitrary one of the numerous  Debian package maintainer to introduce a change (accidentally or intentionally) that compromises the system?  Before that incident, I&#x27;d already had mixed feelings about Debian-specific changes to upstream, and one of those turned out to be a whopper.<p>One thing that&#x27;s reassuring: both of us thought immediately of the same incident, from years ago, so there&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s a stream of known defects discovered frequently, like in some other other areas of this general kind of system.<p>Another thing that&#x27;s reassuring about Debian is that some of their principles or policies align with security.  For example, in the past I reported an instance in which upstream code of a package was effectively phoning-home to upstream unnecessarily, and Debian took it seriously, and fixed it.  I like that the intent is there, so hopefully they&#x27;ll catch many problems before I have to, and not introduce new problems on top of upstream.')
