One can engage with individuals directly all they want, but there is a limit on the number of public posts one can make, and they are scrutinized for misinformation before going public. This will drive the creation of &quot;discussion&#x2F;topic groups&quot; in an effort to get around the public posting scrutiny, but placing a limit on the size of a discussion&#x2F;topic group halts that effort.<p>Such changes will be required by law. FaceBook is a controversy engine, and as such they will fight tooth and nail to maintain as much controversy generation capability as they can, because that is what drives engagement there. It is certainly not friends sharing their days.')
