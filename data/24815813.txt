Was in ~&#x2F;somedirectory, wanted to clear the contents, ran `rm -rf *`. Turns out somewhere in between I had done a `cd ..`, but I thought I was still in the child directory. Fastest Ctrl+C ever once I saw some permission errors, but most of the home directory was wiped in that second or two.<p>Didn&#x27;t have a backup of it unfortunately, though thankfully there wasn&#x27;t anything too critical in there. Mostly just lost a bunch of utility scripts and dotfiles. I feel like it&#x27;s beneficial in the long run for everyone to make a mistake like this once early on in their career.')
