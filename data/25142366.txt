The inductivists will therefore outcompete the anti-inductivists.<p>On the other hand, as a friend of mine pointed out, for the anti-inductivists that manage to exist, although they keep suffering from making wrong predictions, they will not see this as a reason to change their philosophy, so they are stuck in an epistemic trap.  Since evidence has no meaning for them, no evidence can change their minds.')
