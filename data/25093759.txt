You aren&#x27;t trained for this.<p>I don&#x27;t know about NYC&#x27;s new program, but Portland has been doing something like this for a couple years. They send out teams of a medic from the fire department and a counselor&#x2F;social worker with specific training in deescalating acute mental health crisis.<p>There have been no incidents of these teams being attacked or injured.<p>This &quot;under siege&quot; mentality that the police have adopted as central dogma, which clearly has spread to you as well, <i>is</i> the problem.<p>I&#x27;d suggest reading the various interviews and comments from Patrick Skinner. He&#x27;s been on a solo crusade for a more compassionate approach to beat policing for a few years now. He gets a lot more clout with police with it though, as he&#x27;s ex CIA, so no one questions his machoness. The very core of his approach is &quot;how would you solve this without a badge and gun?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s simple. It works. It&#x27;s moral. It doesn&#x27;t mean we abandon society to anarchy, it just means we stop seeing citizens and police as enemies of each other, where the default assumption is that a restraint and a gun are necessary to even have a conversation.')
