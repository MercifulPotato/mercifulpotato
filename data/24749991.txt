Themes aren&#x27;t created so much as discovered. If you start from a theme <i>a priori</i>, you&#x27;re at risk of being preachy. However, the amount of effort involved in constructing a long story, drafting it over and over, and then editing it to sufficient quality, is so substantial that no writer can keep it up for the amount of time a serious work takes unless he has a strong philosophical reason.')
