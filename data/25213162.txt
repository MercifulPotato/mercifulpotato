Now that you have an idea of how much money that actually costs, do you understand why things don&#x27;t scale the way you think they do?<p>Even then, it will take you years to get the skills needed to be a nurse (and in ~1 year, thanks to the vaccine, the surge in nurses won&#x27;t be needed anymore). What needed to happen is that you needed to start training to be a nurse 2 years ago, if we wanted you helping a hospital today. And that&#x27;s assuming you&#x27;re inclined to learn biological sciences and actually pass nursing school on your first try.')
