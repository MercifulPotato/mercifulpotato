After seeing what&#x27;s happened to TravisCI, Sencha and QlikTech, I can only assume that the private equity firms that bought them are rife with MBAs.  And the story is the same, buy the company, cut engineering, murder new development, choke support and off-short what survives and then eat off of the trapped subscribers.  They don&#x27;t create value, they don&#x27;t make a better product, all they do is stagnant the company while eating off of the lowered OpEx.')
