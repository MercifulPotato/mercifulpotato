Item(by='ndespres', descendants=None, kids=[25584361], score=None, time=1609349855, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25582679, text='Much in the way that I would recommend to anyone struggling with &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; to try starting with Melville&#x27;s much shorter novella &quot;Bartleby, the Scrivener&quot; to get a taste for the authors&#x27; style, wit, and use of language; I would suggest a volume of Greene&#x27;s short stories. In a few or a few dozen pages it is easier to see how he draws a character, uses dialogue, employs irony and humor to make a point or cause the reader to reflect. Once you have a feel for what Greene finds funny (or distasteful) it is easier to see how his commentary takes shape over the course of a longer novel.<p>A few stories that come to mind that might make good examples are &quot;When Greek Meets Greek&quot; and &quot;The Destructors.&quot;')
