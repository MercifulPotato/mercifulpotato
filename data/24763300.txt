As we peel that back what we&#x27;re finding is serverless really means &quot;not my server&quot;. Someone else manages that piece of infrastructure, it can be anything, a VM, a database, etc. But in this case it feels like serverless is falling squarely into the PaaS category, building a better Heroku. Google Cloud Run is one prime example. DigitalOcean App Platform is another. I think this is likely the primary way software gets run in the cloud in the future BUT with one huge caveat, its not clear its going to be the way forward for large scale development itself.<p>Cloud lacks what mobile lacked before the iPhone, a development model. When we finally figure that out, it&#x27;ll become obvious that table stakes here is an actual full end to end experience with one language and a set of primitives to help scale development for the cloud. That&#x27;s not FaaS. Its something entirely new. The language will be popular, maybe Go, the focus will be on cloud APIs. Everything else will be become a client. The web era is over, thats not what the cloud is about. Cloud is all about APIs.')
