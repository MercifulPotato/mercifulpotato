In the pop-up it says &quot;You can also review where our partners claim a legitimate interest to use your data and, should you wish, object to them doing so.&quot;.<p>If you click manage it opens with &quot;user consent&quot; selected, where everything is turned off. Click save means they&#x27;re not going to start tracking you, right?<p>Wrong, if you switch to &quot;legitimate purpose&quot;, you&#x27;ll see that everything is turned on. All those ad companies claim they have a legitimate purpose to be tracking you, even though you have zero business relationship with them.<p>Unless the ICO hands out some very heavy fines to those companies, the whole thing&#x27;s become a farce, just like the cookie law was.')
