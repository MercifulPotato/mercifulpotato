You will now be able to set the probability that a MIDI note will fire in a melody. Or set a range of probabilities for the velocity value of a MIDI note. I&#x27;m sure that you will be able to map the range probabilities to the ADSR of synths etc... I&#x27;m curious if that is more of a novelty or will actually be a valuable tool for exploring ideas.')
