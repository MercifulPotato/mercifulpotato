Including 12v&#x2F;5v buck converters for auto stuff.\nYou can configure for headless when you set up the SD card before you ever boot. I have never booted a Pi with attached display&#x2F;keyboard.<p>The Pi is cheap, for a reason, but it is still more powerful than anything I use it for.\nBut the same goes for the Beagle Board.<p>Choose the board you want, for the project you are doing.<p>Note: For every RPi project I have done, I have done two or three ESP8266&#x2F;ESP32 projects along with five or six AVR&#x2F;M0&#x2F;M2 Arduino projects.')
