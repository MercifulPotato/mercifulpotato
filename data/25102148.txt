If the response was &quot;I don&#x27;t have time to work on fixing this. If you wanted to fix this I think it would be in $package and maybe $file. You can create unit tests for this in $place&quot;. Or even better &quot;I&#x27;ve added a unit test into master as ignored that is failing right now, if someone can step through and debug this I&#x27;d merge it&quot;.<p>It takes a lot of energy but it&#x27;s a great way to create a community.')
