Coffee shops don&#x27;t. Classrooms don&#x27;t (certainly not enough for every student, at least). Parks don&#x27;t. Trains&#x2F;busses&#x2F;airplanes don&#x27;t. Backseat of the parents minivan probably doesn&#x27;t, either.<p>Like where else can you use this other than a basically permanent installation at home for this to qualify as &quot;taken everywhere by kids&quot;?')
