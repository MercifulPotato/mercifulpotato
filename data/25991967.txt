It is a tool that aims to be a friendly and powerful static HTML site generator backed by Org-Mode files.  It should be very familiar for those who have used tools like hugo or jekyll.  It&#x27;s far away from being as comprehensive and stable as such tools, though I do aim to get there :)<p>Weblorg is a declarative API that defines routes similar to how lean HTTP application frameworks are structured.  With a file at the root of the website conventionally called publish.el. It contains the routes with information to find Org-Mode files and templates to render them.  It&#x27;s backed by a powerful templating language and we&#x27;re working on a more thorough and thorough documentation.  You can check out some examples and learn more about it on our website:<p><pre><code>   website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emacs.love&#x2F;weblorg&#x2F;\n   release post: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emacs.love&#x2F;weblorg&#x2F;posts&#x2F;v0-1-1-we-re-live.html\n   github: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;emacs-love&#x2F;weblorg\n   templatel: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;clarete&#x2F;templatel</code></pre>')
