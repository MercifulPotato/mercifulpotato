You should use the UI elements that make sense. It doesn&#x27;t make sense for Maya or Blender or Photoshop to constrain themselves to whatever Microsoft picked out for them to use. The palette of native widgets and native UX methods is woeful across all systems. It&#x27;s constrained to the set of generic elements which are applicable to some theoretical business application, like Word or Excel (which, I must point out, could <i>neither</i> be implemented fully in terms of native UI widgets alone).<p>&gt; If an app can&#x27;t survive on its usefulness alone, it probably shouldn&#x27;t exist.<p>Form follows function. And I would argue the opposite of the point you&#x27;re making: if an app can exist purely in terms of native UI widgets, does it even need to exist? I can think of almost no useful apps outside of basic utility apps (file copying, patching, app installers, etc.) that are useful and fully native UI.')
