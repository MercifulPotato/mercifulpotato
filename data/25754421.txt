With all that, if someone still supports the president, I&#x27;ll question their character, fiscal policies and tax breaks be damned.<p>I face a similar issue in my own home country of origin: 58 million people voted for a corrupt ex-military drop out, racist, homophobic, and incompetent beyond belief who&#x27;s trying to bypass all democratic processes and take over local police forces which overwhelmingly support him. I can&#x27;t have those 58 million fellow Brazilians in high regard. Even if you say the previous government was corrupt, corruption is much less serious than letting 200 thousand people die while sabotaging emergency healthcare measures so that your possible political opponents in the next presidential election don&#x27;t get credit.')
