Its not that penetrable to begin with.<p>However, that was only a couple of weeks ago, since then i’ve come to really appreciate the simple magic of lisp syntax.<p>I’ve also been able to put it to practical use rather than just appreciating it - i’ve been spoiled by Calva in VS Code, structural editing that doesn’t just work, it actually flows - i’m no stranger to structural find and replace in Intellij but this is different, this smoothes an impedance mismatch between our thinking and expressing code.')
