Wix shares have gone from roughly ~$17 in 2013 to ~$257 today, while Shopify has gone from ~$20 a share in 2016 to ~$1,184 today. Automattic&#x27;s flagship platform—Wordpress—is responsible for over a third of all sites on the web, and Squarespace was generating over $300 million in revenue back in 2017.<p>Webflow has roughly zero chance of replacing frontend developers, but the &quot;everyone who needs a website and doesn&#x27;t want to hire a frontend team&quot; market is pretty large and has been for a longtime.<p>What makes Webflow interesting to me, and where it is a gamble, is where it stands on the spectrum of developer-friendliness to &quot;can kind of use a computer&quot;-friendliness. They seem to be betting on a change in the market, particularly around the emergence (or rapid growth) of a certain demographic: people who are familiar with web technologies (HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS etc.) but who don&#x27;t want to muck around in them directly to build a site—the &quot;know enough to be dangerous&quot; crowd, if I had to give it a name.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that will work out exactly, and I personally don&#x27;t really find it helpful, but it&#x27;s interesting. At the very least, I personally know a lot of teams building non-SaaS products (infra tools etc.) that use Webflow for their frontend.')
