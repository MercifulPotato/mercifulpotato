My career has rather seen me in consulting, analytics and product management and being technically savvy has often given me an edge here. However, I am completely unenthused with business strategy of late and consider doing something a bit different.<p>While I recognize being a developer in a company would be different to developing myself (more formalized, slower etc), I would love to know if anyone here has moved laterally into a software development role without a Software Engineering background? Did you start over in your career or able to find some middle ground?')
