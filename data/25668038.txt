While reverse enginering is always gray area there is a lot of device drivers in Linux kernel tree that was created using RE. Also Apple never sued anyone for doing this.<p>Developer funded by community has more freedom than Red Hat employee. There is simply no profit for hardware vendor in attacking him.<p>Also OSX graphics stack is completely different from Linux one and Apple only implement their own proprietary Metal API. So even if you gonna decompile Apple drivers chances of copying Apple code are very small since the only common part would be running compilee code on the GPU.')
