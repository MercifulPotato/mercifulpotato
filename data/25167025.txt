That&#x27;s a requirement for reactors to be classified as Gen III, so all of the models listed above have some variant of that.<p>&gt; eliminating the need for ever increasing safety tech and complexity of it for conventional reactors would be a cost savings<p>Passive safety features are useful, but they don&#x27;t end up replacing active features (you still need to control the reactor during normal use).  At best they might allow for reducing the redundancy level on a critical system -- which might save a bit bit of money, although not much.<p>Better safety is always a great feature in general, but it&#x27;s not close to making breeders cost competitive on its own.<p>&gt; Not to mention the clean up costs when you compare to a conventional reactor that could melt down, even if it&#x27;s rare.<p>Actual meltdowns are exceedingly rare (and catastrophically expensive + devastating), so you don&#x27;t really factor them into the cost equation for a normal reactor.<p>&gt; Especially in the US, a driving reason that new designs aren&#x27;t used is that there have been few built I&#x27;m recent decades - partially due to lower cost alternatives and also due to public opinion<p>Mostly cost tbh -- nuclear energy has been historically somewhat unpopular (especially after major accidents) but there&#x27;s a lot of industrial projects that continue anyway despite being unpopular (oil pipelines etc).  The financials for nuclear reactors are not great (it&#x27;s a big, financially high-risk investment that takes decades to really pay off), so there&#x27;s less incentive.')
