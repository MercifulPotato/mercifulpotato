Item(by='xrd', descendants=None, kids=[25922356], score=None, time=1611695815, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25918717, text='One of my favorite Mad magazine cartoons has this patient sitting with his dentist. The dentist tells him the cost of the dental work, and the payment plans for it. The patient says &quot;sounds like I&#x27;m buying a car!&quot; The dentist replies: &quot;Yes, I am!&quot; I think some of the comments here are confused about how pricing works and why GitLab is doing it. And, IMHO, there is so much value in even the free open source version that they&#x27;ll have to do a lot worse to lose my business.<p>Does anyone know if the open source (totally free) version, under these new pricing guidelines, permits you to charge people for accounts on a self-hosted GitLab instance? Am I able to run a business based on GitLab without paying a penny to GitLab as long as I use the open source features?')
