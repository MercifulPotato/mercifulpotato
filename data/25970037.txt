Item(by='jpmattia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612022141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25965068, text='&gt; <i>There is nothing special about being short more than 100%</i><p>The actual value was 113% from S3, but other sources had different values so I rounded down.  While there is nothing magic about 113% or 100% or any other number, it is a measure of the difficulty of covering the entirety of the short interest: Higher numbers are more likely to result in a short squeeze, since those covering will likely have a higher bid to attract the attention of longs.')
