This is true even if you speculate on more than the per-byte &quot;boundary or not boundary&quot; condition. A parallel-prefix circuit for processing a DFA with m states where you speculate on all m possible initial states for each of n bytes &quot;only&quot; consumes O(m n) power. [1] In absolute terms this is obviously still a problem as you crank up m or n, but the scaling is certainly not exponential. You do see local exponential scaling if the state space is large enough (think of minimax search in chess) but for these decoding problems the state space is tiny and you don&#x27;t even need to speculate over all possible states (e.g. you&#x27;re not going to decode all possible combinations of 4 instructions per cycle, only certain prefixes, etc).<p>[1] The Hillis-Steele paper on data-parallel algorithms from 1986 describes this algorithm for parallel lexing.')
