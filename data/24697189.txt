It&#x27;s been 6 months since I started working on this project. It was just a side project for a while but it quickly became my main work. I&#x27;m Imed Adel, 21, a CS college student[1] from Tunisia[2].<p>Centige is a collaborative website and web app builder. There is no need for learning programming and I&#x27;m trying to keep the interface simple (and magical) so that you don&#x27;t even need to know CSS to get it to work. You can export HTML and React though, although code export is not my main focus right now.<p>As more companies are going remote and many brick-and-mortar businesses are going online, I am sure that Centige will have a huge role to play in helping those teams communicate, build, and grow.<p>I got the idea for project while working at my last internship. The company had a hard time updating projects and moving from the old chaotic code and infrastructure to a newer and cheaper alternative.<p>There are still many moving parts right now, but I wanted to follow PG&#x27;s and Michael advice to &quot;just launch&quot;. Expanding the editor and the components is my top priority, followed closely by adding memberships and a collaborative CMS.<p>I would love to hear all of your feedback on the product so far and what should my next focus be. Feel free to DM me or email me at any time :)<p>---\n[1]: TBH, I skipped most classes to work on my side projects. Now that I think about it, my classes are actually my side projects<p>[2]: That&#x27;s a country in North Africa. It&#x27;s on the other of the Mediterranean, facing Italy.')
