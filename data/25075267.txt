Except now you can do lossless streaming which isn&#x27;t something google music, youtube music, spotify, (most things) can do. But you can still transcode when using LTE if you want to keep the bandwidth down. Its up to you... bit rate, codec, etc. You&#x27;re not just stuck with pre-selected lossy formats like mp3 or vorbis. You can use OPUS for example.')
