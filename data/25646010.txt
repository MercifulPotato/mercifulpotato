Unfortunately public health researchers&#x2F;biologists have very little credibility at this point so appeals to their authority won&#x27;t work. In particular arguments of the form &quot;we need more evidence&quot; look weak given how many enormous leaps of faith the supposedly scientific establishment has been willing to make on the basis of no evidence at all for the past year, e.g. masks, lockdowns, asymptomatic infection (apparently now contradicted by a large study of &gt;90% of the entire population of Wuhan!), now vaccines are being advertised as totally safe even though trial protocols are being abandoned left and right.<p>Public health research is really worrying, frankly. The quality gap between epidemiology papers I read in the last 12 months and computer science papers are shocking. Epidemiology routinely publishes papers that contain major errors that the authors clearly knew about and chose to ignore or cover up. The Flaxman paper is an example of how absurdly fraudulent it can get, yet we&#x27;re told constantly that the &quot;experts&quot; have reached a &quot;consensus&quot; that isn&#x27;t to be questioned.<p>At this point I&#x27;m pretty much ready to believe it came from a lab simply because scientists are claiming it didn&#x27;t. My prior for public health researchers being honest has dropped through the floor.')
