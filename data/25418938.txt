The experience, in common with a lot of other DIY related searches I&#x27;ve done recently as I work on the house, was deeply frustrating. The top result was spun to within an inch of its life, and incredibly repetitive and frustrating to read. Worse, the information was misleading to the point of being potentially hazardous if followed.<p>As GP has observed, the word &quot;ruining&quot; might be better used in place of the word &quot;gentrifying&quot; in this piece.')
