Retroactively, espressif called this &quot;FSM ULP&quot;. For example, among other weirdness, this core has only one way to write memory that:<p>- writes only 32-bit words;<p>- only at 32-bit-aligned addresses;<p>- user program only controls lower 16 bits of the word;<p>- upper 16 bits are written with, basically, garbage (part of program counter).<p>Second-generation, ESP32-S2 is supposed to have a regular RISC-V low-power CPU core, in addition to the FSM.')
