Exclusively left wing celebrities openly call for violence all the time on there, nobody does anything about it. That has been going on for the past four years non-stop.<p>Actor Peter Fonda called for violently assaulting Trump&#x27;s underage child on Twitter in 2018 (his account was not permanently banned), and that&#x27;s very typical posting from leftist celebrities on Twitter these past four years.<p>Thousands of violent posts were in the &quot;Hang Mike Pence&quot; Twitter trend that was going on the other day. People have been openly calling for executions for treason and similar on Twitter in relation to the Capitol riots. There was widespread cheering and celebrating when that woman got shot in the neck by Capitol Police, I read thousands of Tweets that were literally cheering for her death, all on Twitter, and nobody gives a fuck.<p>The double standard by Twitter is beyond disgusting. It&#x27;s psychopath behavior.')
