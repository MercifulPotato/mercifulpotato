Explaining the concept of a &quot;key&quot; is essential to explain why this doesn&#x27;t work.<p>- In your example, the contents can be deduced from the &quot;encrypted&quot; data, without the key. Indeed, there is no key, but rather a complex dictionary transformation.<p>- A &quot;backdoor&quot; is merely teaching GCHQ to speak English.  Sounds perfectly reasonable in your example.<p>I&#x27;d argue the exact problem is that politicians have the particular understanding of encryption that <i>you just gave</i>.<p>You need to communicate two things:<p>1) Why backdooring safe encryption irreversibly breaks it for everybody<p>2) Why that&#x27;s a bad thing')
