The core problem is an incentive structure in a game that requires government to solve as it is a public goods problem. I thereby see people complaining about the issue from a website that does the same things being complained about as an example of how deep the issue is... it isn&#x27;t at all strange, nor does it to detract from the concept: if anything, I feel like it furthers the argument.')
