If so, it would be possible to implement just these methods to target an in-memory or on-disk store without the SQL — and get a dramatic performance improvement.<p>But because data management requires a lot of disciplines and it is easier to test “is this is a better abstraction?” if by creating these kinds of abstractions on abstractions.<p>Some of them will evolve into “noSQL” but most fail because SQL has a first-movers advantage and they aren’t <i>enough</i> better to warrant further investment. Better may be possible but too few people can afford the luxury of exploring language design — and those that can are scared off easily; People who make bad investments worry about their fellow human and try to prevent them from making the same mistake; and so you worry about what happens when it goes wrong, which is why I say, “what if it doesn’t?”')
