The building itself was purchased in the 60s and used as a research institute. Loosely affiliated with the large university in town.<p>I worked at there as a software engineer by day, and took care of the property the rest of the time. There was no shortage of  projects. My girlfriend moved in with me eventually. We returned there after our honeymoon, and our son was most likely conceived there. I miss it often.<p>I still work there, but covid has kept us away. This article reminds me of that time in my life. Thanks for sharing.')
