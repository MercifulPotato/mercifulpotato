Also, I just think it&#x27;s a funny project and my goal was to create it for those who share a similar sense of humor and could get a laugh out of it. I&#x27;ve been downvoted to hell and people have messaged with everything but the kitchen sink, from being called a transphobe, sexist, trumptard, bernie bro, the whole gamut. Thing is I&#x27;m none of these (maybe a bernie supporter... not bro. Support the policies, then the individual) and just wanted to make something absurd, funny, and fun for friends and others who share the same sense of humor.<p>The setup is a bit complicated, but it&#x27;s what my budget allows for. One linux machine w&#x2F; a GTX 1060 monitors for incoming chats, when one is received it generates a text and TTS reply, then adds the username and text&#x2F;audio files to the queue. The second machine handles the streaming, playing of pre-generated audio files, and monitors the queue for usernames to display in the stream and chat responses to play&#x2F;display.<p>I&#x27;ve got a long list of other ideas for technical and content improvements, but they&#x27;re taking the backburner for the time being while I work on learning&#x2F;building more with React and search for work.')
