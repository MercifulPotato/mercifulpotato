Item(by='TimTheTinker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604685048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25008084, text='&gt; Poor and dangerous cities usually suffer from a lack of institutional capital.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that philanthropy has the biggest long-lasting positive impact when funds move into and through local centers of institutional capital.<p>Building the institutional capital is the <i>hard</i> part. No amount of money thrown at a problem will fix it in the long term without the local institutional capital, and a shared and transmittable wordview that keeps it alive across generations. Churches were indeed the historical local institution that endured across generations in the United States for many generations past, but those also fed into non-parochial committees that would tackle local projects.<p>I&#x27;m generalizing primarily from knowledge of the history of my own city. It&#x27;s the most beautiful city for miles around. It had many churches in its early history (there&#x27;s still a single block with 5 historic church buildings and a YWCA), and also had rich benefactors starting about 110 years ago who formed committees and built a lot of beautiful things here, including a beautiful Moorish architecture library, a series of beautiful parks, and a 2500-seat amphitheater which still hosts a free concert&#x2F;show series every summer.')
