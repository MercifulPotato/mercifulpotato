There are many demos online.<p>Stepping back it is just a translation problem e.g. English idea -&gt; Python code, which an ideal language model would be able to do.<p>I think what I’m picking a gripe over is that “language model” is a very general term. Calling GPT3 just a language model is like calling a human just a bunch of atoms. It’s not actually limiting.<p>What I’d love to talk about is how <i>useful</i> of a language model is GPT3? And how useful do you think GPT4, 5, etc. are going to be?')
