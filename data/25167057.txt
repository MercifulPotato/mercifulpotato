Last I checked WWAN drivers were spotty but getting better but that was also when i was trying Ubuntu amd Kubuntu 19.04 which had kind of janky hardware support for keyboard LEDs and audio). I didn&#x27;t see any native support in the network manager but aside from that, great hardware and firmware support in OS, plug and play for audio devices can sometimes be dumb but its much better than most linux OS I&#x27;ve used. I was never a fan of GNOME but Pop!_OS pulls it off quite nicely.')
