If you <i>only</i> need it to replace a very low end smartphone (i.e. just making phone calls and text messages with very low expectations for apps&#x2F;web as you might use a sub-$100 smartphone for) then it might work for that definition of daily driver.  What it is right now is an excellent mobile Linux device that is perfect for me in many situations that I&#x27;d previously consider using a SBC or don&#x27;t want to lug a laptop around for a few minute task.  It will get there eventually, but the software still needs a <i>lot</i> of work and the hardware probably needs to advance a generation or two.<p>For a daily driver, I literally just went out and picked up a new Android device this weekend because I can&#x27;t see the Pinephone being able to take on that role for me from a software standpoint for quite some time or with this generation of hardware.')
