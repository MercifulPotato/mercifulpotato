That&#x27;s hardly better from what we used in the 90s and 00s, dpi-wise. Sure, if you haven&#x27;t used to hi-dpi it looks ok. But try using a 5K&#x2F;27-inch monitor for a while and then go back to 1440p&#x2F;27-inch to see the difference you miss.<p>Now, 4K hi-dpi (pixel doubled) on 27&quot; is 1920x1080.<p>This makes pixels just fine and detail is great, but everything too large and cuts off screen space, as it&#x27;s 33% less area than 1440p (which, I presume, you don&#x27;t use pixel-doubled)<p>The solution is either 5K&#x2F;27&quot; (which gives you back the 1440p kind of screen space and UI control size PLUS hi-dpi), or using a non-doubled, fractional resolution, to overcome, (which is not optimal, looks fuzzier, and wastes cpu).')
