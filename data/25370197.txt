Distributors <i>are</i> in the business of distributing third party content. You <i>can’t</i> force a distributor to carry your content, and it would <i>not</i> become a “thorny legal issue” for them to stop carrying your product unless they violate your contract with them.<p>Speaking of contracts, when someone sign up for YouTube, they agree to their terms of service, which don’t say “we’re an open platform where opinions of any kind can be published”. They say “YouTube is under no obligation to host or serve Content” and “you understand and agree that there will be times when we make […] changes without notice” and “If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we may remove or take down that Content in our discretion”.')
