Milestones are comically similar from project to project.<p>Software in internal development, software available in testing, beta deployment on the customer site with real customers&#x2F;data, go live in production, first user, first thousand users, etc...<p>For hardware projects (I did a lot of joint software&#x2F;hardware) hardware design, ready to manufacture, first prototype, second prototype, first production series, first delivery to customers, etc...<p>Last but not least, the primary use cases are major milestones, the software allows to do A then B then C. Gotta determine the main use cases of the project as early as possible.<p>Large projects (10+ people over years) are split into components, each component has its own milestones and should stand on its own as a deliverable. Add major milestones for integrations, as soon as any 2 dependent pieces are in a working state, they need to be integrated together and tested.')
