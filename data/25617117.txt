Pelias core maintainer and former Mapen employee here.\n It is not gone :)<p>After Mapzen shut down a co-worker and I founded Geocode Earth(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;geocode.earth&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;geocode.earth&#x2F;</a>) to continue working on the Pelias project, funded by consulting and, primarily, a SaaS much like Mapzen Search.<p>Over the past 3 years the project has improved quite a bit, and Geocode Earth has had solid growth (50% SaaS revenue in 2020). We&#x27;ve been fully bootstrapped this whole time and plan on continuing this well...indefinitely!<p>In fact, intersection support is already present in Pelias and will be rolling out to Geocode Earth soon :)')
