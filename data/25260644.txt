New Jersey (AT&amp;T &#x2F; Bell Labs) used to be the place to do telecommunications.  Silicon Valley is not in the telecommunications industry, it&#x27;s in the Internet industry.  I&#x27;m talking about which industries will replace BioMed, chemistry, and manufacturing.<p>Silicon Valley is really good at 3 things:<p>1.) Eating our old.<p>2.) Replacing humans with computers.<p>3.) Thinking we know better than everyone else.<p>Makes us kind of insufferable, but that&#x27;s precisely the mindset you need when your goal is to replace large segments of the economy with machines and take all the spoils for yourself (and your co-conspirators).  If you&#x27;re going to play nice and respect established wisdom, you&#x27;ll never even bother embarking on such a project.  SV&#x27;s greatest strength is the large number of people who can be convinced to apply their technical knowledge to a project that sounds crazy and doesn&#x27;t exist yet.')
