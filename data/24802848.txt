There are, though, quite a few people who reduce a whole wide range of totally different substances down to the single term &quot;drugs&quot; and portray everybody involved using junkie stereotypes.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to say that any substance is completely innocent: in fact, I believe that pretty much any action significant enough to have a positive result can be used in some way to create a negative one.
