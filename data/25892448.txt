As OP said, that can be shown by studying their meanings outside the technical context. The original meaning was retained in Academia but merely as jargon. Magister artium is a &quot;master degree.&quot; There is no &quot;slave degree&quot;, though. There is also &quot;mastery&quot;, master&#x2F;apprentice, and so on.<p>In other words, the offensive component of the combo is &quot;slave&quot;, not &quot;master.&quot; You can safely continue to use the master&#x2F;apprentice combo.')
