As for the more recent merchant marine, Christopher Buckley&#x27;s <i>Steaming to Bamboola</i> is very funny, and I suppose fairly accurate. For forest rangers, Norman Maclean&#x27;s novella &quot;USFS 1919&quot;, collected in <i>A River Runs Through It</i>, gives a picture of how it was then.<p>August Fruge, longtime director of the University of California Press, wrote an excellent memoir, <i>A Skeptic Among Scholars</i>. There are many academic novels and memoirs, but I think very well of Alvin Kernan&#x27;s <i>In Plato&#x27;s Cave</i>. Also there is Herbert Simon&#x27;s <i>Models of My Life</i>, which touches on academia and computing.')
