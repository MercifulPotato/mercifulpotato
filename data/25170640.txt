However, I&#x27;m LOVING it now that everyone is working from home.  I find it crazy awkward when just one or two people are on a screen.  It&#x27;s hard to describe why but I know it&#x27;s a common feeling.  I&#x27;ve even heard of mixed office&#x2F;remote teams will do all meeting over video chat, even the ones in the office, as it puts everyone on the same level.')
