If they need more funding to buy the land for the project then so be it. If eminent domain is used to take land from people then it can be a bureaucratic decision or it could be a referendum. Its still the power of the state (or government) being applied to expropriate people because other people want their land for something but are unable or unwilling to do what is necessary to obtain their consent. This is prone to abuse and if the interests of the landowner are dismissed too readily then it suggests that the interests of the landowner aren&#x27;t being given the proper weight.')
