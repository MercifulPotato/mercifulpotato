People don&#x27;t buy Nabisco because it&#x27;s at Target; they go to Target because it has Nabisco products, hopefully for cheaper than other stores.<p>This is true for smaller stores (eg the mom-and-pop corner store or even large stores), but once retailers get to the super-large sizes, eg Target&#x2F;Walmart, the relationship flips. People go to Target first and buy Nabisco because its at Target. If Nabisco wasn&#x27;t there, they buy something else, but they don&#x27;t stop shopping at Target.<p>&gt;Thus, stores absolutely pay for every item of inventory that appears on their shelves except for some new products that might have special consignment arrangements.<p>&gt;Suppliers do not pay for better shelf placement. Stores determine that based on sell through and margin; the products that generate the best overall revenue get the best placement on the shelves.<p>This is 100% incorrect. As I mentioned in my previous comment, <i>some</i> stores may operate like this, but not all. I can tell you from personal expertise in this space, but also just from a simple Google search about how retailers operate (do a search for the terms: slotting allowance, shelf-space rental, pay-to-stay, pay-to-display). See below for some links to get you started. Big retailers <i>do not</i> own all of the products on its shelves, and they certainly <i>do</i> make arrangements where manufacturers can pay extra fees to get preferential endcap placement, shelf placement, and shelf space. I have even seen agreements where a manufacturer will <i>literally own</i> (rather than rent) a specific shelf in an important store and can do whatever they want with it, as long as they pay recurrent fees (it reminds me of someone owning a condo in a building and paying HOA fees).<p>Big retailers may of course choose to not sell a certain shelf placement to a specific product because they want to reserve it for another purpose (like another competing product), but as a general rule of the thumb, if you&#x27;re willing to pay enough, you can have whatever shelf spot you want.<p>Big retailers will also charge fees to manufacturers for the transportation and storage of the product for when the product is being stored in the retailer&#x27;s warehouses or being moved by the retailer&#x27;s trucks (sound familiar to what Amazon does?). The reason they can do this is because the retailer doesn&#x27;t own the product, the manufacturer still does. The retailer profits by facilitating the sale of the product.<p>In some situations, big retailers may indeed purchase a block of products, but in every scenario I have personal experience with, the agreement was always one in which the manufacturer was obligated to buy back any product which did not successfully sell in the store, which ultimately has the same effect as just renting shelf space.<p>Further reading:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;transcripts&#x2F;718711109" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;transcripts&#x2F;718711109</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;22&#x2F;13707022&#x2F;grocery-store-slotting-fees-slotting-allowances" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;22&#x2F;13707022&#x2F;grocery-store-slotti...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;how-grocers-wring-extra-cash-out-of-shelf-space&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;how-grocers-wring-extra-cash-ou...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;r-wal-mart-to-impose-charges-on-suppliers-as-its-costs-mount-2015-6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;r-wal-mart-to-impose-charges...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cspinet.org&#x2F;resource&#x2F;rigged" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cspinet.org&#x2F;resource&#x2F;rigged</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smallbusiness.chron.com&#x2F;rent-space-grocery-store-vendors-37469.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smallbusiness.chron.com&#x2F;rent-space-grocery-store-ven...</a>')
