Note the questions about materials, alloys, and flow sensors in the video.<p>ORNL had fully functional reactors in the 60&#x27;s, but those reactors were only safe to operate for a few years, and they were at lower temperatures than what we are targeting today.  Liquid fluoride thorium salts at 700+ C will readily dissolve chromium, which makes working with stainless very difficult.  Other common alloying agents are susceptible to radiation (Co &amp; Ni transmute when irradiated) which further shortens the lifespan.  There is also the issue of tritium, which can permeate stainless steels, cause embrittlement, and escape into the environment.<p>ORNL developed Hastelloy N to help address these issues, and there is an effort to certify other structural steels to for use in reactors (316H, 800H, inco 617).  None of the studies that I have seen indicate that any of these metals will survive for more that 5 years or so.')
