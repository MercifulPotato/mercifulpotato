Take foreign-born software engineers out of the picture and the majority of software engineers in Silicon Valley are gone.<p>You can&#x27;t make up for that by just offering higher wages. Maybe a few top companies would be able to manage it, but only by poaching all the engineers from other companies. Ultimately, the industry will move elsewhere if US companies can&#x27;t hire foreign engineers. The US only supplies a fraction of the world&#x27;s software engineers. There&#x27;s no inherent reason why the world&#x27;s tech sector has to be so concentrated in the US.')
