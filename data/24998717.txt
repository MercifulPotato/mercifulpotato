The mobile chips with the same number were always one gen behind the desktop (mobile 4xxx ~= desktop 3xxx), but now they&#x27;ve skipped desktop 4000 both are back in sync.<p>Also Intel&#x27;s naming scheme is getting complicated too. Base vs K vs KF Vs F. 10xxxgY vs 10xxxH&#x2F;U on mobile are two entirely seperate tenth gens with lots of overlap.')
