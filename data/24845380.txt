Indeed, the fingering is nearly the same. Yet, the brass resonates in a much brighter and louder way. The reed and the mouthpiece are of clarinet design, except of conical kind.  A true hybrid, ingenious synthesis.<p>Oboe&#x27;s sound is pliable, thanks to the double reed,  player&#x27;s embouchure, and the richer spectrum of the conical bore. On the other hand, clarinet&#x27;s  sound is more robust, but somewhat limited by the straight cylindrical bore. Marrying these two resulted in a robust yet richer sound. Let alone using brass for the body no need to worry so much about cracks and temperature swings. Perfect for outdoor performances!<p>Wish I&#x27;ve known these similarities back in the day ..., would&#x27;ve saved us lots of effort trying to blend in oboe sound into a &#x27;cool&#x27; band - sax was all it needed! Oh, well, experimentation was fun still ...')
