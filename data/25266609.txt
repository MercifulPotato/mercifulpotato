Do you need to keep your product data (Postgres) in-sync with Hubspot, Marketo and Zendesk?  Do you want to limit the PII that leaves your firewall but still be able to have meaningful conversations with your customers?  That’s what Grouparoo does.<p>As our first hires, you will be responsible for helping to craft the roadmap, developing features, fixing bugs, and building products that make our customers happy. We are a small team, and so we are looking for generalist engineers who are interested in learning about a wide variety of tools and technologies rather than becoming experts in any one part of the stack. We connect many different APIs, databases, and vendors, so there’s always something new to learn.   The main components of our stack are Typescript&#x2F;Javascript, Actionhero, Next.js and React.<p>Learn more about the position @ <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grouparoo.com&#x2F;jobs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grouparoo.com&#x2F;jobs</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keyvalues.com&#x2F;grouparoo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keyvalues.com&#x2F;grouparoo</a> .
