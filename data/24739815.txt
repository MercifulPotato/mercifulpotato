It often seems to be adjusted as if you will be living in that location (and retiring) in that location, which is rarely the case. Yes, in your example both engineers _may_ end up being equally-prepared for retirement, and be in a similar financial situation presuming that 1, all life costs scale proportionally (which is not true, college tuition for children is a great example, regular vacations are another), and 2, they will live in that location always. This is rarely the case, and just leaves the Bay area engineer _miles_ ahead when they relocate 10 years down the line.')
