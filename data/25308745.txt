And why is there so much war between tech companies specifically in US?<p>Less regulation. Facebook would&#x27;ve hit multiple EU privacy laws before it got even medium-sized.<p>Uber, Doordash and others would&#x27;ve never gotten past EU labor laws. They&#x27;re having trouble even now.<p>And yes, the US has a huge concentration of enthusiastic talent willing to do pretty much anything as long as it&#x27;s &quot;disruptive&quot;. Also the US has ridiculous amounts of people wit millions to waste on said disruptive ideas. (Like over-engineered juice presses).')
