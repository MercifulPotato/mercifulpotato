They make wilder bets &quot;just for fun&quot;, because the rewards are highly asymmetrical: everybody cares if you&#x27;re top of the leaderboard, nobody cares if you&#x27;re in the bottom 95%, so the rational strategy is to make wild improbable bets and hope you get lucky, because there&#x27;s lots of upside if you win and zero downside if you don&#x27;t. (Or create 1,000+ different accounts to cover every combination of outcomes, and only publicly claim ownership of the one that wins the most.) All of this necessarily &quot;pollutes&quot; predictions making them ultimately worthless.<p>Prediction markets <i>have to use real money people care about not losing</i>. There is simply <i>no way</i> around that principle.<p>Poker players are well aware of this: advice on learning poker stresses how important it is to play for money as opposed to &quot;fake money&quot;, because you and the other players will all play differently. (Play money is only when you&#x27;re learning&#x2F;practicing the basic mechanics of the game.)<p>Now of course, prediction markets have the unfortunate necessary side effect of people making money off of morally abhorrent events -- literally profiting off of a genocide or terrorist bombing -- when they successfully predict them. And a lot of people also see it as closer to gambling than investing. Which is why I can&#x27;t ever imagine a large corporation like Facebook designing one -- it would be suicidal PR.')
