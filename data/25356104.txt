Don&#x27;t the LLVM and GCC LTO implementations currently involve outputting compiler IR to object files, then running the optimization passes against the full collection of object files prior to linking? So they inherently collect all the object files together in a linkable form.<p>(Of course, it&#x27;s probably more efficient to just dynamically link Qt and pay for a license if you want to publish for iOS.)')
