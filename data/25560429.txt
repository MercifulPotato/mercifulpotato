But while it looks great and will probably feel good, I imagine it will primarily be for playing games [2] or decoration. And at the price point of high end mechanical keyboards, it&#x27;s not cheap decoration. Of course, it won&#x27;t look or feel cheap either.<p>The subculture is cool, though. A lot of people here write it off as an expensive hobby, but successful keyboard designers can quit their day jobs. Group buys are the norm because these keyboards are being made professionally in factories where they need to know how many to make. You can&#x27;t go back and make one more after the run. They are so limited in stock because the designers can&#x27;t afford to buy more than a few extras (sometimes dozens of extras) to sell after the group buy is over.<p>Yes, all of that leads to the &quot;hype culture&quot; if you&#x27;re on the outside, there&#x27;s a real cred to getting in on a limited run. But like anything, it makes more sense the more you know about it. (Of course, you might still end up leaving the hobby feeling like it was a waste of money!)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;MechanicalKeyboards&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k6sv12&#x2F;gb_nk65_olivia_edition_is_live&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;MechanicalKeyboards&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k6sv12...</a><p>[2] a lot of hot keys in games don&#x27;t make sense for the kinesis advantage if your right hand is on a mouse')
