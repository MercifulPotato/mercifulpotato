There&#x27;s no better way to learn something than to do something. It&#x27;s even better if your first project is recreating something that is known to work. In that case, if it doesn&#x27;t work its because something in your build doesn&#x27;t work. If you design from scratch and then build, you don&#x27;t know if the build is wrong or if the design is wrong. Not everyone can ride a bike without training wheels when they learn to ride a bike. It just happens that training wheels for real world things tends to look a lot like making a copy of something else that already exists.<p>If that falls outside of what you approve of how someone spends their time&#x2F;energy&#x2F;money, then find something else to worry about.')
