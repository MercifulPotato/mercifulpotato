Remind me, BBC, why is that a &quot;secure&quot; area? In case people smuggle bombs&#x2F;weapons on a flight, just do nothing <i>on the flight</i> and than harm people afterwards?! I get that you want the are to be a one-lane-road to the outside, so nobody boards a plane that way. But how is a random passenger who is supposed to be there a danger? Do passengers spoil, like idk, milk, and become dangerous after a certain date? Why and how would anyone detect a passenger overstaying in the post-flight area? Who cares? That is the world most dumb threat model? Why is this a <i>felony</i>? This is the most victimless &quot;crime&quot; I have ever seen. Did the private prison called with a need for more slave labour, or why is this guy in court and not therapy?<p>&quot;Based upon the need for airports to be absolutely secure so that people feel safe to travel [...]&quot; - you mean the need to implement wide-net surveillance and a massive military under the veil of an imaginary terrorist threat?<p>Also, why the fuck is the full name and age of this obviously unwell guy printed? So that I can imagine that he is brown based on the last name? This disgusting practice adds zero journalistic value and ensures that this three-month mental health episode will now harm him for the rest of his life.<p>This is disgusting journalism, disgusting framing and disgusting behaviour from all officials mentioned. It reads like someone badly satirizing Reagan-propaganda. Disgusting.')
