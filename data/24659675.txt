UI specific state (eg a flag to store whether the left panel is folded) should be as local as possible.<p>When you have some functional data (the lisk of tasks in a todo app) then putting that in the React context and injecting it in the UI blocks that need it is the simplest way as long the injection part is well separated (using something like unstated.next).<p>There is some grey area between the two but with this methodology I have never felt the need to use redux or mobx again.<p>The last time I had to use mobx I was bitten by the rough edges of the decorators.')
