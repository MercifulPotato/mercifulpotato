Item(by='minot', descendants=None, kids=[25596084, 25595737, 25595812, 25595834, 25595728, 25595935], score=None, time=1609439959, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25595328, text='&gt; mirrorless camera (with clean HDMI out)<p>sorry if this is a stupid question but I don&#x27;t have much experience with cameras and recently learned that cameras have a limited lifespan when it comes to the shutter (the thing that opens and closes to let in light). It is apparently enough of a concern that people ask for this count when buying used.<p>So my question is: does a video in this HDMI out mode count as just one click? how does this work? Also can you completely avoid using a battery with a power line adapter?<p>I tried using an old Nexus 4 as a live streaming camera a while back but after a few weeks the battery bulged and the gorgeous glass back shattered.')
