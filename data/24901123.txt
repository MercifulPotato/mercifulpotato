Little polluter + big polluter yields more pollution than big polluter.<p>2) Taking the small positive actions is actually a lot of what helps people work on the huge, difficult problems. Humans are more effective when our psychology is a unified self rather than in conflict with itself, and taking small, positive concrete steps helps us keep ourselves in alignment with our big-picture goals and ideals.<p>I guess both of those fit into the abstract observation that you&#x27;re bifurcating - people don&#x27;t have to choose between individual concrete actions and contributing to policy efforts and other high-level approaches.<p>By all means, if you see someone explicitly saying they choose one at the expense of the other, say something.<p>When they don&#x27;t say that, though, don&#x27;t assume that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing.')
