Some feedback as someone who has screened many tech resumes.<p>- Design is one thing to think about but I think you&#x27;d be giving your readers more value with some custom advice &#x2F; structure - like how to talk about the value you&#x27;ve created at a position rather than simply listing responsibilities.<p>- As others mentioned, grammar is pretty important for CVs, so tidying up the copy you use in examples and the rest of your site would be good.<p>- The pricing is confusing. What is &#x27;an application&#x27;. Don&#x27;t I get the PDF and then I can use it to apply to as many places as I need? I know it&#x27;s almost an unspoken rule to have 3 pricing options, but I would just go for one in this case and have a link to the subscription&#x2F;hosting service with its own page and pricing rather than confusing people there.')
