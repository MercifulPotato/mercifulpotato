Why Detroit? It has the third highest rate of any US city in 2017. Was that the point?<p>For comparison the US national rate in 2019 was 5 and NYC (more comparable to London and Shanghai) has a rate of 2.8.<p>Yeah, look ... I like the 2A too and don’t think guns cause higher murder rates. But there is no data to support the narrative that Europe and other countries are more dangerous in some way because they don’t have guns.<p>Edit: To be clear, there is no evidence that they are more dangerous. They look safer.')
