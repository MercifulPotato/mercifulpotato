Moreover a large number of talented people <i>really want</i> to do it.  Whatever money they are asking for is a fraction of the cumulative benefits these people have provided to humanity. When arguing about money you never argue about &quot;science discoveries&quot;, no-one in their right mind cares about them when it comes to fundamental science, when you talk about this level of funding. If you manage to build a 100 TeV detector you need to figure out a mind boggling number of practical technical challenges along the way. All of those sum up to a value that is far larger than 10 billion. For other projects like the Human Genome project or the Brain projects the ROI <i>seems</i> more immediate. But in fact physics projects have routinely yielded higher ROIs. There is an <i>extremely</i> long tail of physics &#x2F; technology research that is funded by a new detector.<p>As another example take the EU quantum initiative, they managed to get ~1 Billion and have promised to get ~5000 people working on it for ~10 years. That works out to ~20000 per person &#x2F; per year. This only works because a lot of these people are so passionate about this project, that they are willing to self exploit themselves for years.')
