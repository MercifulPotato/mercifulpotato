Two rounds of antibiotics, pain meds. Finally gabapentin was the only thing that worked and now I&#x27;m slowly weening myself off of it. It&#x27;s been hell. I had to sleep on the couch elevated. I could barely walk. Everything looked fine down there physically, two ultrasounds, MRI, nothing looked odd. I&#x27;m really hoping it never comes back because it was like either someone was squeezing it off and on or someone replaced the boys with pine cones. The pain was just so bad I wanted to get rid of them. Thank god for the lock down because I was working from home during this. I probably would have lost my job or something had I had to go to the office.')
