From Wikipedia:<p><pre><code>    VBUS and GND provide 5 V up to 900 mA, in accordance with the USB 3.1 specification. A specific USB-C mode may also be entered, where 5 V at either 1.5 A or 3 A is provided.[55] A third alternative is to establish a Power Delivery contract.\n</code></pre>\nI spent hours trying to find how to add a USB-C port to my PC that supports the 15W (5V at 3A) one of my VR devices requires, and about gave up. (You&#x27;re lucky if most motherboard or add-in card even tell you how much power they can deliver).<p>I get the desire to make the spec flexible so it can be simple&#x2F;cheap when the extra speed &amp; juice isn&#x27;t needed, but it is really a confusing mess, and not helpful to consumers who just think &quot;Oh it has a USB-C port. That&#x27;ll work then&quot;.<p>I believe USB 4 was created to try to reduce this fragmentation and confusion, but not much in the way of implementation yet.
