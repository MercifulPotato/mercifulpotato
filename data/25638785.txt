Given those conditions, any company that wants to survive will have to move production abroad (and those that do not will quickly be replaced).<p>So if we want to keep domestic production, either consumers need to voluntarily choose more expensive alternatives -- which seems unlikely to happen -- or we have to put tariffs or other restrictions on import of goods. The EU does this for a variety of agricultural products to protect farming, for example.<p>Or is there another way out?')
