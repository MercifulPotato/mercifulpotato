It looked like any dimensionality is equally at home in this model, and generally a random infinite hypergraph would require infinite dimensions to represent as a manifold (or at least I&#x27;d think so after a quick think about it).  So that we ended up in a universe with three seems quite arbitrary.  If Wolfram can find a simple non-arbitrary explanation of why three dimensions, that would be a big step.')
