About 950 MW is as far along to have an interconnection agreement.<p>Grids think of energy sources primarily in terms of power, not in terms of energy, so that&#x27;s the number that gets reported to ERCOT. Grid ops dispatch W, not Wh.  We may never know the exact GWh for these planned projects, but since it&#x27;s likely nearly all lithium ion tech, we can expect 1-4 GWh per GW for each project, and probably an average between 2-3GWh&#x2F;GW overall.<p>Going from less than a GWh storage currently in the <i>entire</i> US, to probably 20x that planned for Texas alone in the near future shows just how scalable battery tech is and how quickly it is advancing. This switch is unprecedented, and is going to catch a ton of energy folks by complete surprise. People aren&#x27;t used to things changing so quickly when it comes to electrical grids. The next decade is going to be a wild ride and I can&#x27;t wait to see the grid drop carbon-based  generation faster than nearly anyone is imagining. Next, we need to decarbonize industry.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mis.ercot.com&#x2F;misdownload&#x2F;servlets&#x2F;mirDownload?mimic_duns=000000000&amp;doclookupId=731966427" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mis.ercot.com&#x2F;misdownload&#x2F;servlets&#x2F;mirDownload?mimic_...</a><p>PS: I originally replied to a &quot;manfredo&quot; and your username is &quot;Manfredo_&quot;, which seems like a remarkable coincidence.
