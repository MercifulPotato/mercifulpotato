I saw Glenn&#x27;s response as pretty measured, except for the follow up after his first email where he gets a bit heated.<p>I thought his point by point rebuttal was pretty effective - he basically said &quot;if you think my allegations aren&#x27;t tempered enough, then suggest how to temper them further, don&#x27;t just remove them entirely&quot;.<p>Again, it&#x27;s the two-faced approach the media is taking.
