Something grows by an exponent of something. 2<i>4</i>16...<p>&gt; &quot;is by defining the exponential as the function satisfying f&#x27;=f (with suitable normalization)&quot;...<p>I don&#x27;t know what an exponential is. A function, to me, is something I call as part of code, so I am not sure if I might be confusing the programmer and mathematician-definition of &#x27;function&#x27;. I don&#x27;t really know how to interpret f&#x27;=f in any way. (F-apostrophe equals f? Why?). I also don&#x27;t really know how normalization plays into it. For me, normalization is something related to homogenising a series of things. Sometimes it can be related to normalising the volume of a bunch of mp3 files, or in other cases it can be turning a bunch of badly formatted phone numbers into a common format for a database.<p>&gt; &quot;In other words, it is the &quot;eigenfunction&quot; of the derivative, which is a linear operator. This is a very natural thing to ask when studying derivatives, ODEs, etc.&quot;<p>I have often heard terms like &quot;eigen&quot;-something, but this always causes me trouble, because I end up parsing it in German (&quot;eigen&quot; means &quot;self&quot; in German). So now it is the &quot;self&quot;-function of something?\nOkay, of the &#x27;derivative&#x27;. Is a derivative the mathematician&#x27;s way of saying &quot;figuring out something you don&#x27;t know by using a bunch of other things you do know&quot;?\nI do not know what a linear operator is at all.\nI also do not know what ODEs are.<p>You see, I love logic and science and have been a programmer for so long, yet when I hear something like the statement above, I almost become despondent over the fact that seemingly I know nothing of the underpinnings or logical foundations of the things I spend my life with (aka computers and programming being born from maths...).<p>Anyway, just a random drive-by thought.')
