Item(by='im3w1l', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606937956, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25278680, text='I dislike humor on HN (but don&#x27;t mind it in more light-hearted places, everything has a time and a place) for two reasons.<p>a. It crowds out other content.<p>b. It&#x27;s harder to argue against a point made as a joke. Consider your examples. Let&#x27;s say there is an issue with argument y. It&#x27;s much more natural to point out in phrasing 1, than in phrasing 2. You look like someone who doesn&#x27;t get that it&#x27;s just a joke and there were some artistic liberties taken. So y is allowed to stand uncontested.')
