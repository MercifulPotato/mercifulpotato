Foreigners probably do not have personal rights, that citizens of Poland are granted. And Polish citizens cannot enforce their personal rights outside of Poland.<p>So it seems, only Polish coders need to be careful that when they use FOSS software, that they don&#x27;t impinge upon the personal rights of any other Polish citizen who contributed code. I guess, to be on the safe side, they can decide to never impinge upon anyone&#x27;s personal rights.')
