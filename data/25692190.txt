Item(by='FireBeyond', descendants=None, kids=[25692727], score=None, time=1610148863, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25691868, text='&gt; It is really time to bridge the divide and come together.<p>&quot;Fuck your feelings&quot;. I could probably count on the fingers of one hand the number of times where the right has suggested &quot;bridging the divide&quot;. Instead it&#x27;s &quot;patriot&quot; this, &quot;traitor&quot; that, and so on.<p>And all the while any conciliatory efforts are ignored. One side clearly isn&#x27;t interested in this bridge. But constantly expects the other side to make concessions to them in the name of some hypothetical middle ground that they openly mock even as they do so.')
