I think LSD (not micro, but full on) is probably the most &quot;dangerous&quot;. I&#x27;ve seen people fall into full retard mode on LSD, never seen anything quite as severe from people taking shrooms. Personally, I&#x27;ve never had a bad trip on shrooms, definitely had one or two on acid. The nature of the trip is quite a bit different. I&#x27;d call LSD an &quot;advanced&quot; psychedelic, and shrooms way more beginner-friendly&#x2F;benign. Writing none of this to disparage either, just interesting that you have a very different opinion&#x2F;experience regarding their nature.')
