A website can be hosted without a DNS record).<p>As I see it, the core issue is that with enough substitutes denying business to a person&#x2F;organization, the customer can effectively be denied access to “the town square”.<p>In the relevant case law, the “town square” is only applied when there was only a single meeting space in the town. In that case, it was a private mall. Twitter doesn’t apply as a town square on the internet because there are plenty other places to communicate on the internet, even if it is not as convenient or wide reaching. The problem lies in the case where all substitutes for a town square all block you.<p>The solution historically was to insist on a common carrier designation for certain utilities.')
