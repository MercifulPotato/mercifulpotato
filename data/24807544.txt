Anything can be made into an idol.<p>The fact remains that the &quot;lesswrong rationalism&quot; community was the first to popularize several rather sophisticated reasoning concepts.  They have provided common reference points that have made it easier for me to communicate my thinking to others and vice versa, and I am far from the only writer&#x2F;reader who has benefited in this way.  As a consequence, I&#x27;m generally sympathetic to this group, and personally identify as a rationalist.<p>I agree that the heuristic &quot;internal consistency is <i>always</i> worth actively working on&quot; can go very wrong.  It looks like you&#x27;re defining rationalism as structuring of one&#x27;s life around that heuristic; I&#x27;m guessing you must have had bad experiences with people who actually do that.')
