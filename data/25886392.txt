Better 10% of Bitcoiners be able to run their own fully validating node, and all 7 billion people be able to generate transactions *with their own private keys*, than let every one with a PC run a fully validating node, while only 0.1% make writes to Bitcoin with their own private keys.<p>In a scenario where a party cannot write a transaction to Bitcoin, due to limited on-chain capacity, there is little point in running a fully validating node. Emphasizing full node validation accessibility over main chain write accessibility to this extent is not a sensible prioritization.<p>Regarding this off-chain payment channel networks Red Herring, there is no reason to be confident that PCNs like the lightning network can provide a mix of trade-offs that will make them compelling to a wide set of users, and indeed the LN has still failed to get traction nearly 6 years after first being proposed.<p>The capital lock-up requirements, especially in a setting where on-chain transaction fees are high, the need for being online to trustlessly receive funds, and the routing challenges, are all potentially fundamental showstoppers for the LN being a viable technology for widespread utilization&#x2F;adoption.<p>Finally, even if payment channel networks work - which is a very speculative &#x27;if&#x27; and not one that the entire empowerment of humanity with access to electronic cash should be made dependent on - blocks would still need to be on the order of 100X larger to enable global mass-adoption, as payment channel networks do not completely do away with the need to have on-chain throughput.')
