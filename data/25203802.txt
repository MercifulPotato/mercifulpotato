The mess that is your average build script.<p>Tell me how many tasks there are to complete, how many you&#x27;ve done, and some rough details of what you&#x27;re doing (e.g. is it a network request). Don&#x27;t be shy about commentary (&quot;This may take a while&quot;, &quot;If this fails multiple times do X&quot;).<p>These generally contain all of the information that the developer has access to, and rarely am I left having no idea if something&#x27;s failed, or what to do if I know it&#x27;s failed.<p>Now I&#x27;m not suggesting that this is good as-is for non-technical users, but it feels wrong-headed keep iterating on a solution everyone hates (progress bars), rather than trying to adapt a solution that (if other people feel the same as me) is quite well-liked in its domain.<p>You see a sort of adaptation in some progress bars with the &quot;Show details&quot; button, but that generally sanitised variant, with one line per task and no commentary (and often, for some reason, no task count) feels like it misses all the good parts of what it&#x27;s emulating.')
