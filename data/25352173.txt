Humanity progressed so far just in the last couple of decades, but we&#x27;re still supposed to prepare ourselves to smash each others heads in like we&#x27;re some brutish barbarians? At some point, we should start acting like civilized adults and solve our conflicts by discussion, not by smashing each others head in.<p>The things you mentioned with regards to skills and such - you&#x27;re right, but you don&#x27;t need to have training on the weapon and such. The army teaches you ultimately death and destruction; everything else is just a means to that end. After all, if it truly were about the skills you mentioned, we could just have an obligatory boy scout camp instead and learn all the stuff without the barbaric parts, no?')
