Both players write down their moves and, once they have both committed, both moves are executed in parallel.  If two moving pieces end up on the same square, both are eliminated.  If one piece moves onto a square that has been vacated by an opponent&#x27;s piece in the same move then no capture takes place.<p>Addendum: One benefit of this variant is that it is completely symmetric and hence completely fair.  There is no advantage for either side because neither side moves first.')
