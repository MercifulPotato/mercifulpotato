Item(by='bachmeier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612215496, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25992875, text='&gt; The problem with Facebook is not that they are using user uploaded content, is that the user has no clue whatsoever the data is being collected by means of tracking actions (likes, time spend on a video...) and cross site tracking and what is going to be used for (Ads, make the site more addictive ?, recommendations?).<p>I&#x27;d say the two biggest questions that outweigh any others are:<p>Who will access the data?<p>What will they do with it?<p>The problem is that few of us know how our data is being used against us. &quot;We will use the latest artificial intelligence methods to convince you that [political issue] is a good thing, since you&#x27;re just on the other side of the fence.&quot;<p>The key thing you didn&#x27;t mention is who the data will be sold to. I doubt the extremist nonsense, not related at all to any videos I&#x27;ve watched, creeps into my YouTube recommendations by accident. Who&#x27;s paying them to generate clicks and viewing hours? What conversion are they attempting with my information? Only one side understands this game. Is there any justification for not having to reveal who paid them for my information or my clicks?')
