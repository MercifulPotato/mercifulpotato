It relates to what you originally said by suggesting there could be plenty of guys, even a majority, for whom no amount of self-improvement will boost them above that threshold.<p>Anyway even if thats the case, it&#x27;s still a good idea to take care of yourself and cultivate your interests regardless of their application to dating. And being approached by women isn&#x27;t at all necessary for a successful dating life.')
