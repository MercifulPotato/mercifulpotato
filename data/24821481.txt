Tidal effects don&#x27;t change that; tidal effects mean the spacetime curvature &quot;over here&quot; is different than the spacetime curvature &quot;over there&quot;, which means the principle of equivalence isn&#x27;t true in a global sense. But objects still follow spacetime geodesics, which is a concept that&#x27;s hard to reconcile with the notion of a &quot;force.&quot;')
