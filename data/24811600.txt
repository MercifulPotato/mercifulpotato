Say we start with equal free speech for both sides of some spectrum. As some ideas from one spectrum take hold, they are selected for. After a while, the ideas of one spectrum slightly overtake the ideas of another, then it&#x27;s easy for that side to now try and silence the other side and lose that freedom of speech.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like that common saying that pure evil is the belief that there is nothing left to know. That&#x27;s what losing free speech does. It&#x27;s society thinking &quot;our system right now is the best&quot; and not bothering to try and improve things.')
