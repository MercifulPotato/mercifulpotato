I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the human tendency to view the past with rose colored glasses or an opinion of younger folks who weren&#x27;t around when things got crazy in the past.<p>The US has been through periods like (and much worse) in the last 60 years:<p>- 60&#x27;s race riots across most major cities that resulted in the deaths of hundreds &amp; Vietnam War where every opinion article lamented about &quot;America&#x27;s global leadership is over&quot;<p>- Watergate where a sitting president was forced from office due to truly breathtaking corruption and law breaking<p>- The 80&#x27;s when Japan was on the rise and people talked about the US falling behind and no longer being a major economic player (I remember people smashing Japan electronics on the Whitehouse lawn)<p>- Gulf War, LA Riots, Clinton scandals, pre-9&#x2F;11 terror attacks in the 90&#x27;s<p>- In the 2000&#x27;s, 9&#x2F;11, the financial crisis (aka &quot;The End of Capitalism&quot;)<p>It&#x27;s always been like this.')
