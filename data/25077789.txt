That said, people have repeatedly told me I look like Jude Law and Tobey Maguire. I have repeatedly been a focus of group discussion among strangers, &quot;which celebrity does this guy look like?&quot; Strangers also ask &quot;Do I know you from somewhere?&quot; No, I&#x27;m just pleasing to look at in a familiar, trustworthy sort of way.<p>In my teens&#x2F;early 20s was so common for women to approach me and tell me I have beautiful eyes that I didn&#x27;t realize they were expressing interest. At my first programming job, a chinese woman came up to me and haltingly said (yes, this was a programming joke): &quot;your eyes are so captivating, like a python&#x27;s.&quot; I said thank you. She blushed and rushed away.<p>My control here is that my weight fluctuates between 150-180, though, and when I&#x27;m heavier and I don&#x27;t shave, the attention vanishes. Humans are just apes trying to be near the best apes. I&#x27;m glad I got a nice mannequin to walk around in, and I&#x27;m glad it compensates for the fact that I&#x27;m an objectively pretty weird dude. But it kind of sucks in every direction - beauty prevents people from getting really important negative social feedback, and often just exempts people from social consequences and warps their sense of reality. Likewise, preference-ing physical attributes over competence has to drive hilariously iniquitous outcomes, leaving a lot of smart, capable people in inferior positions.<p>While I&#x27;m just talking about random stuff: taking pride in one&#x27;s appearance is off putting because you didn&#x27;t earn it. Likewise, being smart&#x2F;likeable&#x2F;socially capable are also things that people generally haven&#x27;t earned. All of the good things in our lives are arbitrary, as are all of the bad things. The things we work for are the only things that are of value - &quot;our actions are our one true possession.&quot;')
