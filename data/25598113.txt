I&#x27;m sure everyone has stories.<p>My takeaways.<p>1) Understand what people need -&gt; AND LET THEM DO IT.<p>2) DO NOT ADD A SINGLE NEW THING with the IT &#x2F; automation. If the old system doesn&#x27;t have it DO NOT ADD IT. No 20 extra fields for demographics if you didn&#x27;t track that before. That can be added later IF it&#x27;s a MUST.<p>If they would take away all various fifedoms and hassle - people actually would bring a lot more tech into gov. Let the local business &#x2F; division people make a decision. The only requirement be that they go through a 1 hr training and be exposed to 3 packages in their space (ie, do demos no powerpoint).<p>Take away all other requirements. Be OK with smaller failures. Govt is so scared of just letting folks try stuff out that everything turns into a 100M project that goes totally of the rails in terms of scope etc (ie, what people need &#x2F; want is long forgotten, it&#x27;s what MANAGERS want that gets emphasized).<p>Result - even if successful (rarely) for downline workers the software brings TONS of extra (not less) work.<p>----<p>My own examples. The IT folks say that passwords have to change every 90 days. Google for example does not default to this (stupid) rule - they push two factor without SMS (which is better). Bam - you are out or have to pay for a &quot;security&quot; solution on top of whatever standard platform you are using with admin rights that can force rotate passwords (and is a MASSIVE backdoor itself vs self-serve password mgmt).<p>Then purchasing. We need an ipad to edit some videos. OH, Apple is not supported. This is 10K employees but you can&#x27;t get an apple product to use unless the city atty will sign off on a variance (no chance).')
