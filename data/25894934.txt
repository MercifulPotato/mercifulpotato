Calling it a framework seemed disingenuous because, well, HTML+HTTP is the &quot;framework,&quot; htmx is just an extension on top. At the end of it all, we went with InertiaJS with a component library -- not a bad alternative in its own right -- but I was hoping to do away with the frontend&#x2F;backend distinction entirely. I hope I get to use your library in production someday, tho! Nice work!')
