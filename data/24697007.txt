Item(by='claudiawerner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601987557, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24696784, text='There are several arguments listed at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy[0]; namely, the argument from animal suffering, the argument from animal killing, the argument from environmental damage, and the argument from harm to humans. These are compatible not just with utilitarian moral frameworks, but a variety of metaethical theories.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any theory which has convincingly been able to show that animals are not worthy of moral consideration (but <i>all</i> humans are). Similarly, I&#x27;m not aware of any theory which successfully argues that human pleasure from eating meat outweighs the suffering of the animals (without also applying to a variety of human behaviours). Justification like that usually entails that the suffering is <i>necessary</i>, yet moral vegetarianism does make any claim as far as people who need to eat meat (or at least purchase meat or kill animals) for dietary reasons.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;vegetarianism&#x2F;#ScheCaseAgaiMeatProd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;vegetarianism&#x2F;#ScheCaseAg...</a>')
