I should have phrased my comment better because my point wasn&#x27;t that all trans people get stronger by what they go through.<p>I was trying to say that the comment isn&#x27;t transphobic at all, and if people think stuff like this is the reason why trans people kill themselves then they&#x27;re probably blind to the actual transphobia that happens in the world.<p>Also, I strongly believe that we shouldn&#x27;t be restricting language out of fear of being offensive, because then people become too afraid to talk about important issues.')
