The public system, it&#x27;s not an issue; the state pays. If you have private health insurance and go to a private hospital, they&#x27;ll... check with your insurance that it&#x27;s covered beforehand. Which just seems like common sense, really; do they not do that in the US?<p>I suppose emergency medicine is done in US private hospitals, which to a large extent doesn&#x27;t happen here; private hospitals would typically do elective stuff. But presumably that doesn&#x27;t apply in the case in the article, so why on earth wasn&#x27;t the hospital required to check first?')
