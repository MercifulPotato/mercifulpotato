You can very roughly split people&#x27;s mindsets into 2 groups:<p>* Long-termers. They don&#x27;t mind delayed gratification. They like planning and saving for the future. Most have complex multi-year degrees or have business experience. They are generally happy with life and want to teach their ways to their kids. What they want from the political environment is a clear set of rules (e.g. taxes, laws backed by a truly independent court system) with minimum interference in their lives.<p>* Short-termers. They prefer instant gratification. They gather credit card debts on impulsive purchases. They live here and now don&#x27;t want the headache of long-term planning. They are usually less happy with life and expect politicians to appeal to their emotions. Recognize them through identity gestures, say great words, show attention.<p>Long-termers tend to earn more, except something in our society changed, and they are quickly becoming a dying breed. So many new social policies, especially in high-density areas, are targeting short-termers and blaming long-termers for inequity. Quite predictably, they are leaving these areas, driving the median income lower.<p>But, what&#x27;s even more alarming, the same trend is happening all over the West - the middle class of happy independent thinkers satisfied with life, is vanishing, replaced by unhappy low-earners driven by divisive tribal instincts.')
