And continuous memory allows for efficient use of CPU caches. So for small string sizes simple algorithms are better.<p>Another reason might be compacting GC. When you compact the heap, you need to rewrite pointers. So you need less objects overall and less pointers. When your string is just one array, it&#x27;s much more friendly than having bunch of substrings with pointers.<p>If you&#x27;re dealing with megabyte strings, you need to think about algorithms, ropes might be the right choice.')
