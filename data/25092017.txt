There are also many ways for a co-op to organize, the pure profit-sharing model is probably not the most popular for the reasons you outlined.<p>For example, the largest company in the Basque region of Spain is the Mondragon corporation, a 12â€”billion euro yearly revenue, 60 years old federation of co-ops with about 81,000 members+employees, working in industry, finance, retail, and knowledge - hardly low-capital areas. They are currently the 10th largest company in Spain. They do have traditional employees as well as worker-owners, and there are concerns about the percentages of each, but overall they are a true co-op at a huge scale, proving that it can be done.<p>If there were government policies to encourage this type of business, especially by providing better credit access, and if this was closer to the beaten path, I don&#x27;t see any reason that it couldn&#x27;t be at least a major part of the economic landscape, even if not easily becoming dominant.')
