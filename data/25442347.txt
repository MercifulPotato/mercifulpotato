Both Mac and Linux use all the keys, so in addition to the half-dozen characters with accents, I have access to a lot more directly. Mac and Linux do remap the remaining keys differently, though.<p>(2) My code got a lot more readable. Î”x is easier to read and more concise than delta_x.<p>(3) I have a lot more characters to pick from.<p>A lot of the issues you raise with regexp are due to limits of ASCII.<p>For more esoteric characters, I do Google and either enter alt codes or cut-and-paste, which might sound like , but remember that you write code once, and read it many times. And editors are increasingly good.<p>Beyond Unicode, one does have text formats with support for colors, bold, and whatnot, either embedded (escape codes in text) or as syntax highlighting (editor parses).<p>The CS-level reg exps seem like a good idea. The implementation -- where they&#x27;re encoded as bizarre ASCII escape sequences -- could use a good revamp.<p>Oddly enough, I think this is my first HN post where I went beyond ASCII....<p>Edit: And HN filtered out a bunch of Unicode. It kept only the delta.')
