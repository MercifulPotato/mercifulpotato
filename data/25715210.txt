There wasn&#x27;t a single one for Linux desktop that felt modern and up to speed with the latest XEPs.<p>And let&#x27;s not even mention trying to get multiple clients supporting the same history with encryption enabled, that was super chaotic.<p>I&#x27;m really glad I abandoned my XMPP server in favor of Matrix. Matrix is modern and it just works and setting up a Synpase server is way easier than setting up a Prosody server.')
