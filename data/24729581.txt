I absolutely see the appeal, and I do want this project to succeed.\nI also understand, that it&#x27;s a work in progress.<p>However, from my experience, I believe that Linux is simply not enjoyable to use. Other operating systems provide advanced features out of the box, such as clipboard-history, clipboard-sync, PiP, powerful search and more. In Linux, you may need to use the command line to arrange your screens [1].<p>The Website should have convinced me, that this project is built by a company that cares about usability just as much as they care about privacy and openness. Instead, I get the impression that it&#x27;s only for the most determined of linux users - you know... the kind that would wan&#x27;t desktop firefox on their phone even if it&#x27;s almost unusable.<p>&gt; There is no need to write new applications, just adapt the existing ones<p>Yes, in theory this is great. But in practice, on my Surface, it never worked. The Interface was laggy, buttons were hard to hit, the touch keyboard didn&#x27;t appear when it was supposed to, smooth zooming in Firefox didn&#x27;t work. The difference to an iPad was like night and day.<p>[1]: Source: Watching a coworker use Linux for the first time. I don&#x27;t remember the distro.')
