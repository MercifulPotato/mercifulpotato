Some pioneering shelters have developed programs that now save huge numbers of animals with these diseases. For example, parvovirus in puppies is very contagious and it&#x27;s a grueling course, but puppies that survive parvo have normal lives and can be great dogs. Austin now saves around 500 puppies a year with parvo that end up in shelters. Most other cities still kill these animals, so adopting proven programs to save them would go a long way to ending any supposed &quot;shortage&quot; of animals.<p>Parvo is just one example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.austinpetsalive.org&#x2F;programs&#x2F;ringworm-adoption-center" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.austinpetsalive.org&#x2F;programs&#x2F;ringworm-adoption-c...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.austinpetsalive.org&#x2F;programs&#x2F;parvo-puppy-icu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.austinpetsalive.org&#x2F;programs&#x2F;parvo-puppy-icu</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.austinpetsalive.org&#x2F;programs&#x2F;feline-leukemia-adoption-center" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.austinpetsalive.org&#x2F;programs&#x2F;feline-leukemia-ado...</a>')
