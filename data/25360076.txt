Or that Stacey Abrams &quot;should be the governor of Georgia right now.&quot; Or that <i>Citizens United</i> was about campaign contributions. Or that we are 10 years away from the end of civilization due to climate change. As a life-long Democrat, I didn&#x27;t realize how much false received wisdom I had internalized until I married a Republican.<p>I think it&#x27;s fair to say that Republicans are somewhat more likely to believe in false information, but Democrats believe plenty of incorrect things as well. And I&#x27;d rather have a broken marketplace than one where Democrats just get to decide what&#x27;s true.<p>Especially when its taken just 5 minutes for the perceived guard rails to evaporate! We&#x27;re not talking about &quot;the earth is flat&quot; here. We are talking about Hunter Biden emails that still nobody has proven are inauthentic. We&#x27;re talking about election fraud allegations which are the subject of ongoing court cases for god&#x27;s sake. Even if I&#x27;m amenable to &quot;fact checking&quot; something like &quot;Obama was born in Kenya&quot; I&#x27;m sure as hell not going to support Google deciding something is true or untrue before the courts do.')
