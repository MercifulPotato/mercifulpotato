Now they&#x27;ve all got something to complain about, all at the same time. I don&#x27;t see the point of considering the &#x27;risk&#x27; of increasing anti-vaxx sentiment. We&#x27;re in a pandemic, we just need to crack on with it. The anti-vaxxers aren&#x27;t going to change their minds either way.')
