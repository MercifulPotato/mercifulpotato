I use graphql with juniper on the server side, and WebAssembly on the client side, together with Vue. I love it. It&#x27;s still more complex and verbose than a full javascript project, and the compilation time are long but I enjoy it.<p>I would recommend Rust over Typescript, if you are going to spend time on types, use Rust it&#x27;s more worth it.')
