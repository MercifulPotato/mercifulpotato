The projects I dream up are super cool feats of hacker ability ... I’m going to be stuck screwing around with the most trivial boilerplate crap.<p>But obviously you are creative and come up with ideas. Probably you should be more picky in which ideas to pursue and which not. Personally I like grand, rabbit hole like projects. I think they are most fun when the time-result curve has early plateaus but also continues to go up later, i.e. already after working a day you have a proof-of-concept and after week or so, you already have something you like. I found such projects quite enjoyable in the past. It&#x27;s no fun when even after a year you&#x27;re still at 30% and the whole thing is only usable at &gt;= 80%.<p>That said, I think there are also fun mini projects and it doesn&#x27;t even have to be a running software. It could be Infrastructure as code or just a sketch of a library.')
