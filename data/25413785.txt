It is unsurprising that people choose the safer option over the legal option. Plenty of laws are broken and &quot;it&#x27;s the law&quot; has never been a great excuse.<p>We should also consider that many people have different definitions for &quot;running a stop sign&quot; and it isn&#x27;t equally applied to cars and bikes. A roll at a stop sign is ignored for a car but &quot;running&quot; for a bike. I don&#x27;t blow through (that&#x27;s irresponsible), but I do roll, per the given reasons above (funny enough I never roll when driving).')
