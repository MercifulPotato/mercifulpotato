It is a reality show about surviving in the wild, except that they drop you in at the start of the fall where there is no food and the end of every season is a starvation and suffering fest. The most recent season there are mostly poor people, one formerly homeless, who are all so desperate for the money that they take medical or wildlife-related risks on a regular basis. In one season, a poor dad is hiding frost bitten toes so a he can try to win money for his kid etc. In several seasons somebody has requested emergency extraction because of cold or animals or other things and it took 6–12 hours to get help - imagine if it was really urgent. I used to really enjoy the show but reality tv is pushing the envelope here a bit too much. They aren’t slaves and are doing this by choice, but like I said, some are desperately poor')
