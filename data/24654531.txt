Part of the negotiation protocol is telling each side &quot;what they can offer&quot; and &quot;what they accept&quot; and picking the highest one that matches both sides. It often isn&#x27;t displayed in software because I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a way (or at least a unified way) to display that back to a host processor.<p>Data doesn&#x27;t make sense since USB2 is USB2, there&#x27;s no context on how &#x27;fast&#x27; it is (besides USB high speed vs. standard speed). USB3&#x2F;Thunderbolt&#x2F;etc is more complicated, but that&#x27;s also a tricky behavior.<p>In principle, I agree that it would be nice if there was a unified software that could tell you what is negotiated and what an upstream device is &#x27;looking for&#x27;.  I imagine we might eventually get there... maybe... kinda depends on hardware vendors to enable that though.')
