From memory it was a museum about the history of broadcasting technology. One of the final rooms had a video running about what the future might hold. Something in that video made a huge impression on me.<p>A boy is lying on his front watching what appears to be a TV on the floor, but the screen is almost flush to the floor. He gets called away.
