It&#x27;s commercial success drove educational adoption not the other way round.<p>Conversely the BBC Micro was picked as a winner by the BBC back when it&#x27;s predecessor systems were also-rans. This drove educational purchases, and ultimately led to ARM.<p>Honestly the main thing that drove the US tech sector was the invention of the integrated circuit, and massive scale. Europe back then was still very balkanised, the EEC (which became the EU) was only just getting going.<p>Fully agree with your last point, Europe was and still is much more bureaucratic.')
