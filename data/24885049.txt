Item(by='ratonroy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603619181, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24882921, text='The 17 USC (2)(c)(1)(C) safe-harbour protections apply only to hosting of infringing works, and neither youtube-dl nor its test suites infringe on any RIAA or member copyrights as averred in RIAA&#x27;s notice.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;17&#x2F;512" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;17&#x2F;512</a><p>The RIAA&#x27;s letter does not claim infringement within the text of youtube-dl source or test suites, though it tries hard to appear so, but rather anti-circumvention of a &quot;copyright protection mechanism&quot;, under §1201. That is also part of the DMCA, but falls outside the safe-harbour.<p>At best, youtube-dl&#x27;s test suite may be infringing works when run, in which case infringement would accrue to the operator, presumably a tester or Github&#x27;s CI&#x2F;CD process. Even that argument is specious.<p>Given output is discarded, no permanent copy is retained, and the action is for research and development, and numerous Fair Use affirmative defence claims exist under §107, notably (1) and (4), test suite execution falls outside exclusive rights. Any one fair-use test is sufficient, or none at all. Test suite execution could be argued non-infinging under numerous theories, including reverse engineering, research, interoperability, all under §1201, or under general limitations on exclusive rights in §112, §117, or elsewhere.<p>This is where ... things get interesting...')
