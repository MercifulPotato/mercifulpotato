You can’t claim to be privacy king while simultaneously doing something like this. Maybe this is caused by Apple departments being siloed. The privacy champions are in a different silo?<p>They never claimed to be the &#x27;privacy king&#x27;. They just suggested it, and people took the bait.<p>Apple is a company, and as such are only allowed to care about their bottom line. If privacy aligns with their bottom line, they&#x27;ll use it for easy advertisement and goodwill, but if it doesn&#x27;t then they&#x27;ll forego privacy just as easily.')
