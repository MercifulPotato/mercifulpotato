Through all this, the FBI never breathed down the neck of the protestors- not even those who could have been actually committing a crime.<p>Most of the people who went to DC did so peacefully and lawfully. The fact that all protestors are being tracked - and are being told they are tracked- will send quite a chilling message:<p>Don&#x27;t ever, ever admit that you are visibly or loudly on the &quot;right&quot;. We are watching, and we are powerful, and you cannot prove innocence.')
