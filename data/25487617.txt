Do you not value discussion, hearing new ideas, learning new concepts, having a soundboard for your thoughts? I also like sharing knowledge and participation in the process of humanity developing its collective memeplex (or at least fooling myself that I&#x27;m doing that). The fact that I&#x27;m not going to meet the people I discuss with has no bearing at all.<p>While what you describe in your comment is a factor, I cannot agree the rush is the dominant factor for commenting for me.')
