They’ve had some pretty big software&#x2F;vendor blunders over my adult life (38yo), but I don’t imagine they’re that different from any other state&#x2F;federal organization with big software projects.<p>To put it bluntly, government contracts under pay for the complications they provide, are never straightforward, have too many competing stakeholders, and huge changes will be required mid-way through every project.<p>On top of that, only certain companies that have been vetted and approved to be a vendor can even apply, which effectively weeds out most potential companies. What you wind up with is Oracle selling a one-size fits all “platform” to one state for DMV, and the next state for Electronic Medical Records.<p>Additionally, the FTE pay scale is shit compared to the private sector so they will never have any chance at getting, let alone retaining, any decent talent.')
