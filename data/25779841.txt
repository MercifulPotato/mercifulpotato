Fixing a problem once it&#x27;s been identified, and thus refining the technology, is exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do. If you realize your ocean liners don&#x27;t have enough life boats, you add more lifeboats, you don&#x27;t ban ships.<p>I&#x27;m sure people will claim that this problem should have been foreseen, but it&#x27;s really only obvious in hindsight. Just a few weeks ago, none of us would ever have thought to plan for the possibility of the US Capitol being stormed. Of course we could know that there would be problematic edge cases, but we couldn&#x27;t have anticipated every single one, nonetheless handled all of them.<p>I think we sometimes forget that if Facebook were a person, they still wouldn&#x27;t be old enough to drive. For all the billions of users and billions of dollars, this is still a technology in its infancy. I&#x27;ll gladly hand out pitchforks if it&#x27;s shown that Facebook has been dragging its feet fixing known problems, or if it&#x27;s shown they&#x27;ve feigned ignorance about a problem they were warned would happen, but if we forbid any innovation that carries the risk of unforeseen issues, we will be banning all innovation.')
