Fair enough, there were mitigating circumstances. But then in what sense is the government accountable for anything?<p>Corporations and government are both held to account through the courts, I suppose. But the government will often change the rules so it isn&#x27;t accountable (eg, wiretapping scandals), so that is a weaker form of accountability than a corporation faces. Is there an actual meaty argument to the idea that governments are more accountable than corporations? Because I&#x27;m drawing blanks on the times when a government was held to account for anything in a manner that wouldn&#x27;t also apply to corporate actions.')
