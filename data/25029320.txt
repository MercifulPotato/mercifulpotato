But biometric authentication doesn&#x27;t provide protection against the state, because the state can legally and physically force you to biometrically authenticate to your phone.<p>Then you said you can protect against this by activating a password. But that&#x27;s not biometrics, that&#x27;s a password. The biometrics aren&#x27;t helping, the only thing providing security against the state is the password.')
