What path does the ball follow now? It&#x27;s probably following a path we would more usually call an &quot;orbit&quot;, and it sure looks a lot like an ellipse. Now just put the mass of the Earth back where it was, and notice that the ball hits the ground before it can trace out very much of its orbit.')
