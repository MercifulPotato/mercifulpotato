Item(by='rglullis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603752601, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24901672, text='&gt; This trend will continue until users revolt against this by refusing to use engagement-funded services in favor of service they actually pay for.<p>Will they revolt, though? Will consumers pay for it, though?<p>I sure hope so, as this is basically the whole reason I started working on communick[0]. But every feedback I&#x27;ve been collecting so far has been along the lines of &quot;You should target this for the enterprise, not end-users&quot;. I went to Brave&#x27;s BAT subreddit (a group of people supposedly tech-savvy people and who I thought were privacy-conscious) to ask them how&#x2F;if they would like to spend the BAT received in privacy-oriented services[1]. The answers were depressing.<p>Granted, I was not expecting communick to be an overnight success and there is still <i>a lot</i> of work to be done to help people get onboard - both the technology and the privacy-first mindset. But even running super-lean I am far from covering my operational costs. If I don&#x27;t get to the end of year and it is still not paying itself, I guess I will have to pivot and focus only on enterprise customers.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;communick.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;communick.com</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;BATProject&#x2F;comments&#x2F;i46g72&#x2F;howwhere_would_you_like_to_spend_bat_that_you&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;BATProject&#x2F;comments&#x2F;i46g72&#x2F;howwhere...</a>')
