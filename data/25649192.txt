In 2019 it was 12k.<p>If Nissan Leaf was sold out in U.S. it&#x27;s only because Nissan decided not to make enough of them. Or they made exactly the very small amount that people were willing to buy.<p>Bolt was even worse. They did 23k in 2017 and dropped to 16k in 2019. GM dealers were so desperate to get rid of them that at some point they offered up to $10k cash rebate. At that despite the fact that GM admitted they are loosing money on Bolt even when sold at full price.<p>20k a year in U.S. market of ~10 million cars is a rounding error. Whatever the reason, no one except Tesla was selling EV cars in US at non-laughable numbers.<p>In contrast, Tesla sales went from 50k in 2017 to 195k in 2019.')
