They really show how important humans are to a system. You can have high tech security equiptment and all it takes is someone to go dumpster diving or appeal to another person&#x27;s human nature.<p>I didn&#x27;t finish it, but I enjoyed <i>The Best of 2600</i>. It&#x27;s a collection of the old <i>2600</i> magazine. Lots of cool older stories in there.')
