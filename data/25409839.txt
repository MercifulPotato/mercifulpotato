I don&#x27;t think they would make this public information if they don&#x27;t have to. As far as I can tell they wouldn&#x27;t need to recompile any previous ARM binaries so this could remain under the hood and they would never need to tell you whether or not they&#x27;re doing it. So I&#x27;d be interested if you have any source on this.')
