Item(by='capableweb', descendants=None, kids=[25237800], score=None, time=1606566162, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25237065, text='The privacy policy starts with &quot;We take your privacy very seriously&quot;, which coming from Google, is kind of funny. A bit like sitting on the phone in a queue for 2 hours and hearing an automated voice saying &quot;We care about customer service!&quot; repeatedly.<p>The &quot;Google does not use any personal information collected through the Public DNS service to target ads&quot; sentence is oddly specific as well. Why is it only mentioning &quot;targeted ads&quot; and not &quot;for any sort of purposed&quot;? Why is it collected if you&#x27;re not using it? What does &quot;abuse&quot; really mean in this context, and what does &quot;addressing&quot; it entail? Only the big guys at Google knows.<p>Finally, the holy privacy policy of Google can change at any time. &quot;We change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.&quot; it says, which makes sense if you&#x27;re a Google user. What about me, who don&#x27;t have a Google account? How do I, tell this public DNS service that I don&#x27;t agree to the new privacy policy? Right, I can&#x27;t, you assume I&#x27;m fine with it.<p>I think we&#x27;re long past the point of having to prove that various tech companies don&#x27;t care about people&#x27;s privacy. The burden of proof that you&#x27;re actively taking steps to preserve it is on you, as you&#x27;ve already burned all the goodwill you had from the internet crowd.')
