Exceed your monthly quota at high priority, and all of your traffic gets dropped to base priority.<p>Though, realistically, nobody is properly incentivized to make use of QoS&#x2F;ToS (except internally to some networks), because ISPs aren&#x27;t incentivized to implement anything until application developers label traffic, and consumers won&#x27;t pressure application developers to implement anything until ISPs provide incentives to consumers.<p>Also, OS&#x2F;API support isn&#x27;t great at present, and application developers in most cases would just always label traffic as high priority.  At least for phone apps, tagging traffic as high priority could be a an app permission that could be flagged&#x2F;denied to the app at installation time (or later granted&#x2F;revoked).')
