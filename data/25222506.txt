I had 125mbps Comcast for years and the upload speed was around 30mbps.<p>I don’t believe this.  I have never been able to find any upload specs from any cable coaxial internet provider.  In addition, the multitude of homes with Comcast I’ve been in crap out after a couple simultaneous FaceTime calls.<p>If Comcast is capable of giving you 30mbps upload consistently throughout the day, you must be super lucky.  If they actually budgeted for this for everyone, they would advertise it.  But since they don’t, the only conclusion is they massively oversubscribe the upload.')
