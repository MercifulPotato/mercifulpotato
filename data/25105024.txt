I had accounts on both and MySpace looked way more attractive compared to FB (it had the feel of Instagram).<p>So no, FB did not take over overnight. And even a few years into FB, no one (yes, no one) knew that FB will go past MySpace and there will simply be no comparison between the two 10 or 15 years down the road.<p>When FB took over MySpace a full FOUR years in [0], investors knew FB had momentum, but no one (yes, no one) had any idea why.<p>Not only that, many investors had no second thoughts about MySpace, and it felt like a competition space, instead of a winner take all. There was still an opinion that MySpace will retake the top spot again &#x27;any minute now.&#x27;<p>So why FB took over MySpace? We don&#x27;t know. Yes, we don&#x27;t know in 2020, 16 years later.<p>(I&#x27;m not dismissing hard work, marketing, execution, commitment. But it was there for both FB and MySpace. It&#x27;s a pre-requisite.
