I went from an Antec 900 to a BeQuiet PureBase 500 and although it&#x27;s a good case for a good price, I&#x27;m disappointed in noise and thermals. Turns out, as many reviewers have pointed out and others long realized, you&#x27;re better off with a more open case with bigger and slower fans than an enclosed one where you have to run your fans at higher rpms to get equivalent thermals. It&#x27;s actually noisier and has worse thermals than my 13yr old Antec even after configuring for a quieter fan rpm profile. Although the newer DX model seems to have improved a bit in that area of increased airflow which pretty much defeats the noise savings from insulated panels. All in all, it&#x27;s still quiet enough that it&#x27;s not distracting, good enough for me.')
