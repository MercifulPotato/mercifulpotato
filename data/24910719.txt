It&#x27;s either resistant or it&#x27;s not.</i><p>The thing you&#x27;re missing is that bacteria <i>share genes</i>. So if you have a high proportion of resistant bacteria, but non-resistant bacteria are still around, the genes survive and spread. But if only the (few) resistant ones are around, the (weakened) immune system can kill them and the genes don&#x27;t.<p>(And also, “it&#x27;s either resistant or it&#x27;s not” is an oversimplification in many real-world cases.)')
