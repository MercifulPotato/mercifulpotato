As pioneers we the technical community herded them at these push button solutions decades ago, and now it&#x27;s up to us to realize we&#x27;ve somehow failed them at this point by locking them into monopolistic companies that don&#x27;t have their best interests at heart.<p>To me this just sounds like the worst sort of techno-elitism.  You&#x27;re describing a world of Morlocks and Eloi and campaigning for veganism.<p>&gt; 1. We educate them and start promoting services which won&#x27;t pull the carpet out from under them on a whim<p>Yes.  I agree.<p>&gt; 2. We start advocating for regulation on the existing services and force them to comply.<p>No.  I disagree.  I have come to believe that it&#x27;s just simple hubris to think that we (the technical community) have any clue what&#x27;s going on in re: normals using computers.  Did you predict Twitter?  I sure didn&#x27;t.<p>I predicted a lot, like coin vending machines for raccoons, and mesh networking.  But no one cares about those things.  Half the world thinks Facebook <i>IS</i> the Internet.<p>Google-- FAANG and the other corps, are already AIs that merely farm human beings.  The sick (IMO) thing is that most people are hunky-dorey with it.  Amazon is one of the most trusted entities according to polls.<p>Sovereignty is jealous: either these mechanical gods with humans for cells will become the new <i>de facto</i> governments of the world, or we <i>nationalize</i> them, which I don&#x27;t even know what that would mean...<p>Er, um, I got a little ranty there at the end, eh?  Sorry.  What I&#x27;m saying is, if they are private corporations then grabbing their services by legal theft is bad pool.  If you really want to wrest control, go whole hog and nationalize the suckers.')
