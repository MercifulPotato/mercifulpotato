This sounds like its related to triggering &quot;system 2&quot; as Kahneman would call it in &quot;Thinking, Fast and Slow&quot;<p><pre><code>    Experimenters recruited 40 Princeton students to take the \n    CRT [Shane Frederick&#x27;s Cognitive Reflection Test]. Half \n    of them saw the puzzles in a small font in washed-out \n    gray print. The puzzles were legible, but the font \n    induced cognitive strain. The results tell a clear story: \n    90% of the students who saw the CRT in normal font made \n    at least one mistake in the test, but the proportion \n    dropped to 35% when the font was barely legible. You read \n    this correctly: performance was better with the bad font. \n    Cognitive strain, whatever its source, mobilizes System 2 \n    [slow, conscious, laborious thinking], which is more \n    likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System \n    1 [the immediate, unreflective thinking by which we make \n    most of our minute-to-minute judgments].[1]\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;quotes&#x2F;8867651-the-experimenters-recruited-40-princeton-students-to-take-the-crt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;quotes&#x2F;8867651-the-experimenters-r...</a>')
