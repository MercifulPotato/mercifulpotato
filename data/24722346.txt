I bought an I7 NUC10 for this role and it’s great. Virtualised OS, Docker for Plex and it’ll do 11x transcodes (1080p to 720p) in hardware while also hosting several other machines. The first time you pass though the GPU to the Vm, then into Docker is a bit of a head scratcher, but it’s actually fine and works well.<p>It has a maximum of 64gb ram and is tiny. With an nvme drive (Samsung Evo) it is really really fast.<p>The next best option as far as I was concerned was the NUC8, and while I’d love to have the PSU onboard and no brick, a Mac Mini is a lot of money.<p>The Nuc8 is a better option than the 10 for anything that’s needing actual graphics. The 10 has a very anaemic GPU compared to the 8, but has 2 more CPU cores when comparing i7s.')
