It&#x27;s such an infringement on personal liberty that it&#x27;s politically laughable to propose it. Keep in mind that most politicians are over the 50 year age limit themselves. It&#x27;s just impossible to realistically implement.<p>That&#x27;s on top of the massively increased cost of the newly retired people, mental health crisis from being prohibited to work for the last 25-40 years of your life, getting rid of the layer of the workforce with most experience and expertise. It&#x27;s absurdly dumb.')
