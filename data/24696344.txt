Throw some seasonal vegetables in when you have them. Eat some cut oats for breakfast. Nothing pretentious about that! You don&#x27;t need all the processed meat substitutes, they&#x27;re not especially healthy either. Also cows milk surely must be more expensive than oat milk to produce, but we all live in countries where dairy is heavily subsidized.')
