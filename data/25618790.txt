Item(by='kkaranth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609641019, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25616945, text='1) Fully remote<p>2) ~10 minute bus ride<p>3) Not too well. I work at a lab as a grad student and miss school and all its facilities<p>4) Pros: eating out less and improved my cooking skills much\nCons: too easy to stagnate in terms of learning&#x2F;making progress<p>5) Nothing in particular, just glad that I still have the opportunity to work despite the situation<p>6) For me, no. Its nice to have the option to work from home every once in a while, but in general I prefer going to a physical workplace. (it helps that my commute was very quick)')
