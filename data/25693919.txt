Then you’re a racist.<p>Find me one Democrat with actual power advocating for open borders.<p>And it&#x27;s not as if the speech used by xenophobes is free of racial overtones and dogwhistles, either.<p>&gt; Are against abortion? Then you’re a misogynist.<p>If you are against a woman&#x27;s right to do what they please to their own body, you have to give compelling evidence for why.  There is no such evidence.<p>&gt; (which isn’t even a bad word but they make it sound like one)<p>Because it is a word that historically was used by people who started a lot of wars and were fixated on who&#x2F;what was _truly_ part of their nation.<p>The &quot;they&quot; in &quot;they&#x27;ve been shifting&quot; is a strong majority of the people around you who now value racial inclusion and self-autonomy far more highly than ever before.
