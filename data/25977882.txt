I think it’s fair to say that it also has the potential to move the needle in a significant way for the “browser as an app platform” story.<p>The question then becomes where does that leave us with JavaScript when you take away it’s main advantage.<p>On the backend as well there are a lot of interesting things happening. Containers have gone from requiring a lot of complexity (kubernetes) to dead simple (knative &#x2F; Google cloud run) where you just ship a container and everything works out of the box. Combined with things like gRPC on the backend and also coming to the browser I feel like the future of application development is looking genuinely exciting.')
