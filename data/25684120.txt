I thought it was only a chunk of USD that was missing? Or did they completely abandon the usd backing?<p>If it&#x27;s still somewhat backed and just that chunk of usd that remains unaccounted for, printing tether isn&#x27;t exactly a scam? People trade their usd for printed tethers and use that to buy bitcoin, so it&#x27;s still essentially people exchanging usd for bitcoin')
