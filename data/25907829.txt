Keyboard is mechanically reliable so far. It&#x27;s nice and tactile. Because of the width of the device thumb typing can get a little tiring, and there&#x27;s no way to touch type (too small). Overall, while I&#x27;d prefer a full layout like on the Toshiba Libretto 50CT, I&#x27;ve no real complaints given the size and what I use it for (basic mobile troubleshooting and light CLI).<p>That being said, if there&#x27;s a USB keyboard within 50 feet of me, I&#x27;ll grab it instead of using the built-in.')
