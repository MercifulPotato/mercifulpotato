I do not favor Facebook at all, for example, but defend them equally in instances where I would defend others. I do favor Uber (or at least tech-enabled ride sharing companies in general) but think the common criticism here is warranted even though I do not feel nearly as strongly one way or another. It&#x27;s a mixed bag.<p>Edit: Why was my GP moved to top level? It made much more sense as a response to the comment questioning the true sentiment.')
