Item(by='rrrrrrrrrrrryan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604081408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24944337, text='FPTP makes the mistake of assuming that the person with the most votes is the best.<p>Likewise, the biggest flaw of RCV (to me) is that it makes the opposite mistake: it assumes the person with the least votes in each round is the worst. This isn&#x27;t necessarily the case.<p>It&#x27;s still much better than our current system because it collects more data-points from voters about their preferences, and uses that data to make more comparisons between different batches of candidates.<p>But there are simpler systems out there with even greater voter satisfaction efficiency, because they don&#x27;t make the same flawed assumptions about voter preferences. In approval voting, you either approve of a candidate or you don&#x27;t, and you vote as such.<p>Election science wonks like to talk about theorems and satisfaction of obscure criteria, but I think they often undervalue the two things that matter most: voter satisfaction and simplicity. &quot;Simplicity&quot; meaning: an optimal strategy that&#x27;s simple-to-explain, an easy to understand outcome, low cost of implementation, etc.<p>Most of us here are software folks, and we understand that designing a great system is the easy part; the hard parts are implementation and change management. Voting systems should be thought of the same way.')
