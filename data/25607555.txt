Item(by='ohazi', descendants=None, kids=[25608865], score=None, time=1609537817, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25603453, text='Sorry, I misunderstood your original comment. When you said:<p>&gt; Up, flat, down, flat. Guess what: you&#x27;ve just introduced enormous amounts of aliasing.<p>I <i>thought</i> you were suggesting that the jagged, stair-step output of a DAC is what causes aliasing, which is a common misconception.<p>I was trying to point out that stair-step output is just the reconstruction filter of the DAC operating as intended, and that a reconstruction filter <i>is</i> an anti-aliasing filter. In the case of a DAC&#x27;s sample-and-hold, it&#x27;s an easy way to select the baseband alias. [1]<p>I think one reason this thread went off the rails is that there are two anti-aliasing filters in a digital synthesizer. I was initially referring to the hardware anti-aliasing filter at the output of the DAC, which is also called a reconstruction filter or an anti-imaging filter. Everybody else was referring to the digital anti-aliasing filter that you need in order to create a band-limited approximation of an infinite bandwidth ideal signal so that you can actually sample it, because attempting to sample the ideal signal directly is always incorrect.<p>Given that the article is about the precursor to digital synthesis, I suppose I should have realized that people were going to be more interested in discussing the latter. However, now we&#x27;re getting to the <i>second</i> reason this thread went off the rails (and the reason I usually regret participating in audiophile threads): Differences in terminology, points of focus, and &quot;Well, Ackchyually&quot; audiophile-grade condescension cause people to read past each other and continue to argue despite largely being in agreement.<p>If you read my downstream responses (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25601970" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25601970</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25602267" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25602267</a>), I hope it&#x27;s clear that I both understand and agree with the actual argument you wanted to make.<p>[1] Aside: If you were to insert sinusoids at twice the sampling frequency instead of flats in between each sample, you&#x27;d be selecting the alias centered around twice the sampling frequency instead of the one at baseband. This is (roughly) how a mixer works.')
