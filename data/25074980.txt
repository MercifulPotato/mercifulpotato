Item(by='vidarh', descendants=None, kids=[25076814], score=None, time=1605214888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25072943, text='The problem with &quot;people who liked this song also liked that song&quot; is that very often I don&#x27;t want to listen to that song <i>now</i> even if it&#x27;s something I really love.<p>If I&#x27;m listening to ambient music I don&#x27;t suddenly want to be ambushed by something uptempo. If I&#x27;m listening to e.g. Debussy, you might be excused for suggesting something vaguely new age in a similar mood and tempo, but certainly not rock.<p>Another problem is that you can&#x27;t just take raw overlap in tastes, because some people like &quot;everything&quot;, and the fact their tastes overlap with mine does not mean I&#x27;ll like everything else they like.<p>I&#x27;ve yet to hear a recommendation system that chooses music I want to listen to reliably enough that I can generally stand to listen to them for more than a few songs at a time without it turning into an endless annoying sequence of skipping.<p>Respecting genre (segues need to be gradual, if at all), respecting mood and tempo needs to come <i>first</i>. <i>Then</i> you can consider what others who likes the same songs <i>within those constraints</i> also likes <i>within those constraints</i>. Honestly if I have to choose between personalised recommendation and precise control of genre and mood&#x2F;tempo, I&#x27;d take genre and mood&#x2F;tempo over personalisation any day.<p>Another pet peeve of mine is lack of visibility into how to teach a system what I want. E.g. if I dislike or skip a song, will it get that it doesn&#x27;t fit my current mood or what I want to listen to now, or will it wrongly infer I don&#x27;t like the song at all?<p>Sometimes it feels as if the people designing these systems don&#x27;t use them.')
