Just because Hooks was inspired by functional concepts like algebraic effects doesn&#x27;t mean the core React team is suggesting that writing React code is functional programming.<p>With that said, my point is that it&#x27;s more important what you can _do_ with a tool, rather than the purity of the tool with respect to an abstract concept.
