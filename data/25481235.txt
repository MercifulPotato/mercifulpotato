Just think about how many developers &quot;fix&quot; bugs by addressing the symptoms instead of the foundational issues in the code.<p>Probably goes something like this: we can make these easy-to-use mission designer tools and hire a bunch of interns to crank out content.<p>Then such a huge mess gets created it takes over a year for the more senior developers and designers to untangle it. Your VIP mission absurdness is buried under a list of 10k other issues.<p>Hitman level design is probably at the other end of this spectrum.')
