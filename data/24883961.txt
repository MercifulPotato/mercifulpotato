In order for git tools to compare and otherwise work with two commits, both commits need to be in the same repo.<p>If &quot;forking&quot; a repo on github really cloned it in their infrastructure, they&#x27;d require far more data. So all forks of a github repo point to the same repo, only with different branches.<p>Note that git clone only clones the actually present branches of the upstream you point it to, but on the backend, all branches of all forks are present.')
