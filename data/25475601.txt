If you are avoiding all EDM because you don&#x27;t like some shit trance or techno, you could be missing out on a lot of other music just because mainstream music giants don&#x27;t like it. There are hundreds of electronic music streams going on right now that all have different genres and styles, but if you looked on like XM radio, there is only two streams and both are mostly trash house dance music.<p>I think a lot of people just don&#x27;t get exposed to a lot of great new music just because they avoid the electronic label over assumptions of what it will be. But that label means it could be anything and isn&#x27;t much better than calling it post 2000s music.')
