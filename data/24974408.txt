AWS services do a lot of this for you. In the on-prem world, you have to build (or buy&#x2F;integrate) this yourself, but that&#x27;s not free so you have to account for that cost in your comparison.<p>You can still make the argument that on-prem is a better value proposition when accounting for the total cost of ownership, but that&#x27;s a different argument than those which ignore engineering costs altogether.')
