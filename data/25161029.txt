Becoming a housewife isn&#x27;t really an aspirational achievement in the way having a prestigious career is, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a story many are really interested in, nor one that would be easy to tell in a manner that doesn&#x27;t seem forced.<p>This is not a true statement for many folks out there, and there are plenty of people who can relate to stories of being in the home. I think the best answer is broadening the things that are acceptable to aspire to, not opening one door while simultaneously locking another.')
