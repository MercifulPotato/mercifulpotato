Thoughtful exchange with people who are not of the same opinion is so much more rewarding than the echo chambers we often find ourselves in.<p>It would be quite interesting to hear from those not voting why they didn&#x27;t vote. My suspicion is that these people would almost never vote, or maybe only vote for so extremely perfect candidates that it&#x27;s just not realistic. But yeah, maybe there is a large group of people who would vote if the candidate would just be a little bit more progressive. But honestly, in a situation like this, with the knowledge of the last four years, I just can&#x27;t understand why you wouldn&#x27;t vote, at least if you are left of center.<p>I also cannot understand why election day isn&#x27;t on a Sunday, or a holiday. It should be the highest holiday the US has. Any democracy has, actually.<p>Biden is also somewhat too old for my taste, but no candidate is perfect. Age does bring experience though, and he has long-lasting relationships with people on both sides of the aisle. That will help. Personally, I really liked Buttigieg, and I&#x27;m happy to see that he&#x27;ll like have a role in the Biden administration.')
