Item(by='adjkant', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606530953, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25234428, text='&gt; The message was I can&#x27;t believe people made comments with the points above.<p>Again, where was that said? Disbelief is expressed nowhere in the post.<p>Even if that was the message, what in the world is the reply adding here?<p>The post is basically:<p>- points out the poster is emotionally invested in <i>being discriminated against</i><p>- &quot;well racism exists in 2020 idk what to tell you&quot;<p>- You shouldn&#x27;t expect people have any sort of productive discussion about the article<p>All of that is then followed by then saying they misrepresented everything. I&#x27;m not even directly tied to this in any way, and that made my blood boil a bit. The first line really sets the tone by leading with an apology, yet posting still. It ends in confusion while contributing nothing and basically saying &quot;well the world is shit, expect it&quot; but also trying to argue that all of this isn&#x27;t shitty at the same time, tacitly adding to the racism. It&#x27;s just incredibly unempathetic and doesn&#x27;t really serve a purpose.<p>And yet, we have people now commenting in detail on the linguistic interpretation of the post to try and eke out some case for the response. What is this even for?')
