You&#x27;re gonna to pay more but the nutritional value of a gallon of milk at $8 vs $2 is still well worth it imo.<p>I&#x27;d also really recommend looking into the health impacts of vegetable oils. Most milk substitutes are, at their core, emulsified vegetable oils. I found that the trade-offs were higher glycemic load(oat&#x2F;rice), increased vegetable oils(soy&#x2F;almond) or something that tastes nothing like milk (unsweetened coconut milk).')
