Ever heard the conspiracy theory that Menthol cigarettes cause infertility to target certain demographics? I remember this wild theory being widely propagated long before social media even existed, among other ridiculous conspiracy theories. The idea that the moon landing is false is as old as the moon landing itself. This is not a new phenomena.<p>Whether the phenomenon being new or not is beside the point.  The concern is that conspiracy theories are spreading more than they were in the past, and that groups have learned to exploit the them to accomplish their goals.<p>This has a parallel to what happened with computer malware.  It&#x27;s existed for about as long as home computers have, but up until 2000 or so, the bulk of it was merely childish pranks and wasn&#x27;t very concerning.  Since then, it&#x27;s exploded in volume <i>and</i> danger, as criminals realized it could be used to make money by sending spam, stealing passwords and payment info, or by holding data ransom.
