Novel technologies donâ€™t absolve you of adhering to the law. [...] Consider regulations and laws as requirements when building systems that store or transmit value.<p>This assumes that one lives in a jurisdiction where the law is just and financial institutions are trustworthy. As another example, if the United States were to make end to end encryption illegal [1], are you willing to say, well that&#x27;s the law of the land, why do we need to keep developing Wireguard or OpenVPN? There would be other jurisdictions that don&#x27;t disallow it, so the existence of jurisdictions that do disallow it isn&#x27;t a reason not to continue to develop the technology.<p>Technologists can be picky about when it&#x27;s okay to flaunt regulation. I won&#x27;t speak for you, but many who denounce cryptocurrency for its dubious legal status will in the same breath praise companies like Uber for improving the transportation status quo by &quot;disrupting&quot; the outdated regulations that existed. I see cryptocurrency the same way. I hope that its disruptive nature will cause jurisdictions to reevaluate their financial laws. In the United States, the aforementioned announcement from the OCC today [2] giving guidance to banks on how to use cryptocurrency is a step in the right direction, whether or not you think it&#x27;s a genuine opinion or opportunism.

If one doesn&#x27;t trust the person&#x2F;company&#x2F;government running the centralized service, there should be alternatives.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;protonmail.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;usa-laed-act-anti-encryption&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;protonmail.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;usa-laed-act-anti-encryption&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;haileylennon&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;04&#x2F;occ-regulator-implements-groundbreaking-cryptocurrency-guidance-for-banks-and-the-future-of-payments&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;haileylennon&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;04&#x2F;occ-reg...</a>')
