Holiday sales? Delivering a product not delayed again? Management bonuses? Did the developers get bonuses for delivering &quot;on time&quot;?<p>-- At what cost did the crunch &#x2F; delivering the product cause the team of developers? Now they need to keep working; fix the bugs; get this back in the store(s) and try to make everyone happy?<p>We go through our share of crunches. Bugs always get through and we have to fix them of course, but nothing as bad as some of the stuff I&#x27;ve read about this.<p>Management never realizes burnout is a real thing. I feel for these developers. It&#x27;s double sided. Keep delaying the game &#x2F; product and people get pissed off it&#x27;s delayed. Ship it, and now they&#x27;re pissed off its buggy. So now, everyone (programmers) are burned out; management is probably fuming over being removed from the store(s) and everyone needs to smile and get back to it, probably as a worse crunch than before. What a shitty way to spend the holidays.<p>It&#x27;s like getting made at a company building your house that your water pipes leak but you rushed them to get it done because of some arbitrary move in date. Take the time; do it right; do a good job. Cut corners and rush stuff and deal with the consequences.')
