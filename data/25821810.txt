I wouldn’t open an issue unless I thought someone more than me might find the topic useful, and so I also don’t feel like I have an obligation to participate in the conversation – after all, it’s not about me, but about ways to improve the code. I find it somewhat offensive when people post to request support on something that can’t reasonably be useful to anyone else.')
