I know they&#x27;re not used as much now but haven&#x27;t seen any evidence that they are specifically to blame for deaths.<p>The majority conclusion I&#x27;ve seen in Europe about why earlier death rates were so high in some places was that the hospitals were overloaded and therefore didn&#x27;t have enough capacity (staff, equipment, etc) and therefore some died due to there not being enough ventilators.<p>This isn&#x27;t my field of expertise so I&#x27;m very open to finding out that my impression is wrong, but my gut feeling is that your comment is not accurate.')
