You don&#x27;t need domain-specific knowledge for it, or knowledge of the rest of the code base.</i><p>A question I ask, is that if I reverted&#x2F;rolled back to this commit, would the system still work? Commits that require other commits to work should never be in isolation in case a rollback is required. You should be able to check out any commit in the entire system and have a (hopefully) working program.')
