It should be split and regulated, so that production companies cannot own distribution companies. It&#x27;s a PITA as a consumer that I need to subscribe to a bunch of different services because all of them have exclusive content that they are using to try to win the monopoly wars. The government should just nip the war in the bud and say that you have to choose to be a producer or a distributor, but not both, and then shows will flow out to all the streaming companies, which will have to compete on service rather than selection.')
