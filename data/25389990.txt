He was born into emerald mines, got a first class education, and used that inherited wealth to start companies, sell, and then buy stakes in growing companies other people founded (inc. Tesla, incidentally).<p>So is the lesson here to be born rich rather than try to get an education? Or just that when you are born rich education is optional? It is notable that the other founders in companies he&#x27;d later buy actually had to get an education, he just used wealth to stand on their shoulders.')
