It&#x27;s made mostly of the same components as all of the other crap furniture but it&#x27;s generally had enough engineering and testing put into it that you can be sure it&#x27;s strong enough for what you want it to do.<p>As an aside, if you ever buy the same piece of Ikea furniture a few years later it&#x27;s interesting to see what has been changed.<p>As a bit of a hobbyist wood worker, Ikea furniture is slightly soul destroying. It&#x27;s often more expensive to buy the wood stock materials than it is to buy the finished Ikea piece.')
