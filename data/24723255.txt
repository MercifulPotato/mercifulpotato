So they end up selling &quot;Watson AI&quot; or implement a &quot;24&#x2F;7 Cyber Security Operation Center&quot;. They don&#x27;t give a shit how useful or long term successful those products or services are. They only care about how big the contract is and how high their margins are on the contracts.')
