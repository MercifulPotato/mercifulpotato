Does this inferential aspect of Chinese still apply in certain cases once it is written in Hangul?<p>It depends.  For this particular example, I think most Koreans will treat 부동산 as a single word meaning &quot;real estate&quot;, because it&#x27;s not a very productive combination: the alternative 동산 (moveable properties?) is a legal term which is much less common, and 산(産) as &quot;property&quot; isn&#x27;t common either.<p>On the other hand, a word like 고밀도화(高密度化 - densification) is transparently decomposable to 고(高 high) + 밀도(密度 density) + 화(化 -ify).  Few people can write it down in hanja (I just copy-pasted from dictionary), but most people will immediately recognize its meaning, even if they&#x27;ve never seen the word before.')
