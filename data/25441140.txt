The voting public <i>is</i> in control and can collectively act to get government to work for shared public benefit. We do have individual and collective responsibility here and empowerment to change things too.<p>It makes sense that empowered citizens in a society would naturally want to protect their rights to not have their natural human biases gamed or manipulated. Thinking ourselves above human nature and beyond the tactics of persuasion would be na√Øve but we needn&#x27;t see ourselves as helpless victims. Instead, we should act to defend our rights and remain empowered and in control. We&#x27;re <i>not</i> disenfranchised and we <i>can</i> introduce regulation to ensure that our freedom is preserved.')
