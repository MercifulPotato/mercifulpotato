Item(by='lkrubner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607853270, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25405368, text='Many of us make the assumption that Paul Graham&#x27;s essay, discussed here, is partly in response to Zach Tellman&#x27;s criticism, which was discussed here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25325716" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25325716</a><p>The footnote, in particular, which Tellman highlights, seems to be a swipe at Tellman. It reads as Graham accusing Tellman of not being earnest.<p>A &quot;Renaissance man&quot; is an old phrase, referring to someone who is good at many things (since Renaissance people like DaVinci were good at art, engineering, architecture and more). Tellman was making a joke about the laundry list of vices that Graham seemed to be imputing to Tellman.<p>Not that the whole essay is in response to Tellman, but, the idea that Tellman&#x27;s essay was on Graham&#x27;s mind seems likely, especially when Graham makes the crack about Twitter.')
