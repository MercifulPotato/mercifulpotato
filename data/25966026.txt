If you only use vim, stay plugged into an outlet all day, and don&#x27;t need great video conferencing, then Linux is fine. But that&#x27;s not most people.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with any of this[1]! But we&#x27;re talking about <i>developers</i>, not most people, and it looks like this particular author went out of their way to install a CLI editor.<p>Others have pointed out that Windows is still the right platform if you&#x27;re a game developer, which makes a lot of sense to me. Are there other specific hobbyist development cases that are best served by a Windows environment?<p>[1]: Except the 4K and video conferencing. Those actually work quite nicely for me (n=1) on Linux.')
