A lot of software platforms&#x2F;infrastructure we use is the way it is for fairly arbitrary historical reasons, quite apart from the fact that many domains where software is applied are quite hard to parametrize rigorously. There are islands however, where the design is fairly rigorous and could be considered closer to the spirit of “engineering”. But the most important input for a craft to mature into engineering is time and rigorous effort.<p>Either ways, I don’t see this question mattering too much in immediate practice.')
