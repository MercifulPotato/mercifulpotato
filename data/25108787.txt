But I assume the caller was just calling some (imaginary) function like<p><pre><code>    validate_cert(cert, ENABLE_ALL_CHECKS);\n</code></pre>\nand that was it.<p>That ENABLE_ALL_CHECKS would then go out to check the OCSP server was probably not immediately known or was just seen as something that&#x27;s part of, well, enabling all checks without much additional thought.<p>Whether the certificate also lists a CRL endpoint and whether that imaginary ENABLE_ALL_CHECKS also checks that I don&#x27;t know, but possibly neither did the person who called that (imaginary) function.<p>Heck, the function might even default to ENABLE_ALL_CHECKS internally at which point the author of this code in question might not even have been aware of the network calls.')
