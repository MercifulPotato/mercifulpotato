He used a system with pink colored post-it notes to keep track of his story lines, yellow post-its for quotes and green post-its for general ideas. His desk used to be a nice collection of post-its, and he would regularly send the entire class away to work on his novel. (He&#x27;d be really startled when the class entered his classroom, as if it was a large surprise that he&#x27;d have to teach us french. &quot;Eeehm... I&#x27;m busy. Go away!&quot; he&#x27;d say).<p>Bottomline: use the simplest tools you can and don&#x27;t let things (or classes!) distract you.')
