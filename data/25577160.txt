Regardless of this physical interpretation, the fact remains that there are many many distinct solutions of string theory at low energies, and in order to make predictions that are falsifiable, we need to know which of these solutions we&#x27;re living in.<p>You have created a mathematical structure that is so flexible that it can fit any data. It is useless. You have abandoned the hypothetico-deductive model.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hypothetico-deductive_model" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hypothetico-deductive_model</a>')
