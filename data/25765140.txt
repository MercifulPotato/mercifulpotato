It seems more efficient to just cross-compile on your fastest build machines. You get much faster CI feedback that way. Obviously you want to validate RISC-V code on native devices but using them as builders seems wasteful.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely curious why that&#x27;s desirable. Maybe I just misunderstand your comment and you want the RISC-V boards for validation i.e. make sure you can self-host the distro even if in general releases are cross-compiled on your (I assume AMD64) build fleet.')
