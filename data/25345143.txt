The majority of these bunkers are artillery and anti-tank bunkers built during the cold war (some during WWII) to play a decisive role in large tank battles.<p>The article confuses this, as there were some plans in actually deconstructing them which however turned out to be too expensive. So virtually all of these bunkers were indeed decommissioned and most also declassified in the last 10 years (some turned into a museum e.g. a WWII bunker <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crestawald.ch&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crestawald.ch&#x2F;</a>). Others, such as the Castello mentioned by &#x2F;u&#x2F;nix23 are used as temporary barracks for troops, but don&#x27;t have an actual defensive function any more.')
