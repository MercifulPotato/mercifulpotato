If you invest the time to learn this and then don&#x27;t get a $350k job, what&#x27;s your recourse? Furthermore, the applications of KDB+ in broader industry are few, so you won&#x27;t come out of finance with a valued skill. The practitioners of this obscure skill are therefore bimodal in their distribution of pay: those who get a job working with KDB+ and those who don&#x27;t and wonder why they wasted their time. I think a better relatively obscure language would be a functional language like OCaml or Reason or Rust.')
