I used them in college in the 80s, and grad school in the early 90s.  Mostly HP15, 41, and 42.  My last 42 is sitting in a drawer nearby, with a relatively fresh battery, and it works well.<p>I recall writing &quot;programs&quot; that performed some of the calcs I needed in the physics curriculum.  I also recall being amused that I could calculate 1&#x2F;3 (or 1&#x2F;7) and add it to itself until I got (nearly) 1.  From there this led me to study what fixed and floating point were, and think about the implications for the code I was writing (precision, truncation&#x2F;roundoff error, etc.) to do longer calcs.<p>This eventually led me to skipping a postdoc, and working in the high performance computing industry.  Where I am today.<p>They were&#x2F;are awesome tools.')
