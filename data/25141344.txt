Ever since frameworks became a thing, I stopped doing any web development. I simply couldn&#x27;t get myself to setting up a bunch of tools just to process some byzantine file formats to a usable CSS. It was a really great feeling when I discovered Tailwind. Not only building custom, trimmed stylesheets required a single command, everything about using it just clicked. Kudos to people behind it!')
