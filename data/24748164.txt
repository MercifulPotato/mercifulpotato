Barren islands only potentially visitable for part of the year. The winds and sea in the Southern Ocean sound terrifying. Here&#x27;s the pin:<p>Dropped pin\nNear South Pacific Ocean\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.app.goo.gl&#x2F;PpsVCzE7LXLrZFZe8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.app.goo.gl&#x2F;PpsVCzE7LXLrZFZe8</a><p>We&#x27;re lucky to be able to see some videos of these places on youtube. When I was little, there were only satellite images and the occasional grainy photo or two online if one did a deep search.<p>A short documentary of a place called Kurlis came out recently, you should watch it if you&#x27;re interested. It&#x27;s about conservation.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;kHGarqZFY1k" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;kHGarqZFY1k</a><p>This documentary is particularly interesting for me because I used to browse satellite imagery of the place and to see people walking around it it&#x27;s as amazing as I had imagined. A volcano in the middle of a lake in a remote island???! Thinking about this stuff is also what led me to have a tech career that has been related to conservation of these places (Kurlis from satellite):<p>Dropped pin\nNear Severo-Kurilsky District, Sakhalin Oblast, Russia, 694550\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.app.goo.gl&#x2F;6X54ZqdruRgB5KYW7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.app.goo.gl&#x2F;6X54ZqdruRgB5KYW7</a>')
