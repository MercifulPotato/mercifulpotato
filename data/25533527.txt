For example, who broke the sound barrier first? Of course, it was Chuck Yeager in Glamorous Glennis, the rocket powered Bell X-1 named after his wife. Or was it?<p>The book &quot;Aces Wild&quot; [1] says that it was unofficially broken <i>before</i> that in an XP-86 (The experimental F-86, a jet powered fighter) in a dive, and witnesses on the ground heard sonic booms <i>before</i> Yeager&#x27;s flight that day. But history favors the hero&#x27;s, and in this case, the science: We know 100% for sure, because of science, that Yeager officially broke the sound barrier first.<p>It is quite possible that the F-86 test pilots who stuck their planes in a dive likely did it first. It is well documented that the F-86 was capable of Mach 1 in a dive. Even so, that&#x27;s not what the history books say, so that&#x27;s not what we teach kids in school. I suspect it&#x27;ll always be the same with the F14 computer vs the Intel 4004.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airspacemag.com&#x2F;history-of-flight&#x2F;mach-1-whodunit-180958702&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airspacemag.com&#x2F;history-of-flight&#x2F;mach-1-whoduni...</a>')
