It will sometimes burn spectacularly for various reasons, which would be devastating locally, and so if there are humans they&#x27;ll try to stop it doing that because they don&#x27;t want to die or have their homes destroyed.<p>So - we&#x27;re not talking about Old Growth Forest, these are managed forests, humans are <i>already</i> messing with them, the only question is what management strategies to use. &quot;Let&#x27;s just not manage the forest&quot; is not an option unless you are going to evacuate essentially all the humans from the region. Like, if the only human for 100km is a government official surveying the forest or something, that doesn&#x27;t need managing. If there&#x27;s a <i>town</i> there, you have no choice, you&#x27;re managing that forest now, like it or not.')
