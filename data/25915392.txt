It’s a project that can’t die soon enough.<p>If you’re actually proficient with vim and you’ve tried neovim, than you know that the “shiny” is quickly overcome by the lack of core functions and system integration that makes vim a power tool to begin with.<p>If you want to use neovim, then you don’t understand what makes vim great in the first place. Here’s a hint: it’s not the key bindings.<p>And, the maintainers don’t care. They refuse to fix years-old bugs and feature requests. I believe it’s because they’ve painted themselves into a corner with their inexperience and lack of pragmatism.<p>Because it’s worth giving an example of its glaring mistakes, open up neovim in the terminal and “:!python” ... huh, doesn’t work ... that’s because neovim doesn’t have shell IO from processes it launches. When I googled the issue I found a feature request from 2013-ish. I can’t say anything now, because when I bumped the issue I was told that “ThIS ISn’T a cOre FeatURe, gvim diDn’T haVe THIs uNTil ...” and they closed the feature request at that. No fix, just a “f-u-very much” and the door. I had already posted a few other bug reports &#x2F; feature requests, but promptly deleted them after that response. I’m done with neovim, except for recommendations that nobody use it.<p>Use <i>real</i> vim.
