Losing real money currently in your possession is always going to be more painful than losing out on future earnings that were always theoretical.  Once GME drops back down to some normal levels, which is only a matter of time, the anger of restricting trades will fade.  The anger from people who lost a lot won&#x27;t fade as easily.<p>I don&#x27;t have a Robinhood account either.  They are plenty of reasons why I would avoid doing business with that company.
