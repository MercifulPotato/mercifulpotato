In essence, this is still Google&#x27;s OS and the team has decided to start a fight against Google by taking their opensource and perpetually fight against the main developer by removing their proprietary component.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a fight that&#x27;s sustainable - a giant graveyard of Android privacy forks shows that. In the end, the major contributor to this OS is and will remain Google.<p>In that respect, Purism&#x27;s PureOS seems like a more sustainable effort.')
