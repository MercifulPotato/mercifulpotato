They’re providing proof of what kind of content exists on their servers. It’s the same with child porn and other criminal content.<p>People offended by AWS’s stance, please help explain the differences in aforementioned violations.<p>The only odd part of all of this is why now? AWS should have banned them during formation. They tolerated it because of Trump being in power. This is the only cowardly hypocritical thing I see with the recent bans.
