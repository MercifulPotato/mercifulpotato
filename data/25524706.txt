I live in NYC, however I never eat out, own a minimal set of clothing etc.  I spend on devices or items that I can learn from, especially computers.  Money spent on computers that are fast <i>and</i> work is always worth it.  I also always take uber black to the airport - it&#x27;s fast, efficient and very low stress.<p><pre><code>  Ironically enough, I take uber black to get on my bargain barrel Southwest airlines flight.  Also, services or upgrades that charge $20-30 to automatically assign you a decent boarding number are also totally worth it.</code></pre>')
