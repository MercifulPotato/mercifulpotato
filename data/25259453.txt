G. Wells being so <i>optimistic</i> about the future, merely a decade after WWI and the atrocities therein (does anyone know if he fought in the Great War?):<p>&gt; And what this film anticipates is not unemployment, but drudge employment, which is precisely what is passing away. Its fabricators have not even realized that the machine ousts the drudge.

Modern life <i>is</i> a drudge. People don&#x27;t toil in the fields, but they waste away in office buildings. The internet wasn&#x27;t the harbinger of a new Enlightenment, but often does the opposite: it proliferates ignorance.')
