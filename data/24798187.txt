A very high RWA person might agree the last decade has not been an amazing success, but would not limit themselves to that perception, and instead might claim things took a wrong turn with the Enlightenment[1], and people who behave as they ought not deserve lashing[2].<p>Also, the author has been using the RWA scale since the 1970s, the main primary papers he recommends are from (p.6) the 1990s, and most of the examples he gives in what I have reread are from the younger Bush period. So I doubt he&#x27;s talking about 1997 and especially not anything more recent than 2010.<p>(Finally, I haven&#x27;t a clue if you mean something specific by mentioning this decade? Over here, not much has happened in the last ten years, the last notable event before the pandemic having been the 2008 financial crisis.)<p>Dehumanisation — IIRC, the author doesn&#x27;t dehumanise high RWA groups (otherwise he might be advocating pushing them out of helicopters instead of simply giving them the opportunity to meet, or even engage in shared tasks with, the Other.) If you could point out a dehumanising passage in the book please do.<p>Other bullshit in questions - see the footnote (p.39) discussing question 16:<p><pre><code>    “God’s laws about abortion, pornography, and marriage must be strictly followed before it is too late, and those who break them must be strongly punished.”\n</code></pre>\nthe operative parts of this question are neither abortion, nor pornography, nor marriage, but <i>strictly followed</i>, <i>too late</i>, and <i>strongly punished</i>.<p>Definitions - I was also alive last century[3] and believe the m-w definition is fine for its purpose, but although it shares a strong correlation, it&#x27;s not the RWA[2] definition the book uses (which, the author takes pains to point out, can, and has in the ex-FSU case, applied <i>mutatis mutandi</i> to politically left wing authoritarian followers[4]).<p>Another last-century example, beyond the cousin posts: high RWA 1990s beliefs led to Srebrenica.<p>Normal human attitude - It&#x27;s easy to argue that &quot;Burn the Heretic!&quot; has been normal for much of the last 6&#x27;000 years and probably tens of thousands, but I think in the west[5] it started going out of style after the wars of religion[6]. For some pre-1997 evidence, consult <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_...</a><p>[1] among the behaviours he found correlating with high RWA was acceptance of the notion (p.19) that the US Bill of Rights leads to immorality so it should be repealed.<p>Although this specific example comes from the fictional Ignatius J. Reilly, the idea is seriously presented in Evola&#x27;s <i>Cavalcare la tigre</i>. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24785596" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24785596</a><p>[2] (p.52) &quot;Since followers do virtually all of the assaulting and killing in authoritarian systems--the leaders see to this most carefully--we are dealing with very serious matters here. Anyone who follows orders can become a murderer for an authoritarian regime. But authoritarian followers find it easier to bully, harass, punish, maim, torture, “eliminate,” “liquidate,” and “exterminate” their victims than most people do.&quot;<p>[3] although I am in an area that&#x27;s historically been so strongly catholic (our idea of a cocktail party is centred on bread and wine) that people here are far more interested in following the Golden Rule than in making a tribe of their religion (our muslims also enjoy these same cocktail parties). YMMV.<p>[4] as a literary left wing example, the dogs in <i>Animal Farm</i> are a high RWA group, being content to be servile to the pigs as long as they get to be arrogant to all the other animals.<p>[5] pace twentieth century literal exceptions, and under the caveat: only between &quot;us&quot; westerners<p>[6] which did more to determine who was left than who had been right.')
