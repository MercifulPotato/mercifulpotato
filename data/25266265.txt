So you don&#x27;t necessarily need to agree that it is quality &quot;me time&quot; for me to think that and enjoy it. In general I agree that spending time in front of a phone is not the best time spent, but if the goal is for individuals to enjoy themselves then it may best. I know lots of people that live for movies, shows, content from youtube, and more.
