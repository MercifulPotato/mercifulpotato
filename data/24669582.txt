Only The Daily Dot reported on the allegation, debunking it as a likely smear attempt.[33] On May 2, 2020, the woman contacted Reason Magazine to confess that she and another woman had been paid by Burkman and Wohl to fabricate the allegations against Fauci. According to Reason, the woman contacted Burkman and Wohl and recorded their phone conversation. In that call, Wohl told her, &quot;You did a good job, you got paid. What&#x27;s the problem?&quot; Burkman suggested that Fauci deserved the smear: &quot;This guy shut the country down. He put 40 million people out of work. In a situation like that, you have to make up whatever you have to make up to stop that train and that&#x27;s the way life works, OK?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jack_Burkman" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jack_Burkman</a><p>&gt; On October 3, 2019, Wohl and Burkman held another press conference, in which they claimed Senator and 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren had had a sexual relationship with a 24-year-old former U.S. Marine. At the event, the accuser presented by Wohl and Burkman kept laughing as he described the allegations. The accuser also showed a supposed &quot;sex scar&quot;, which was debunked due to the accuser having previously posted on his social media account a picture of the same scar stating that he had &quot;hit [his] back with a chain trying to take down a swing&quot;. The conference was met with mockery and disbelief in the media, and the claim was widely assumed to be another of Wohl and Burkman&#x27;s false allegations.[21][22][96][97][98]<p>&gt; In August 2019, felony arrest warrants were issued in California for Wohl and his former business partner, Matthew Johnson, for illicit sale of securities that took place in July and August 2016.[1] Wohl pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of selling unregistered securities in February 2020. The settlement hearing that was originally scheduled for April 2020 was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[32]<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jacob_Wohl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jacob_Wohl</a>')
