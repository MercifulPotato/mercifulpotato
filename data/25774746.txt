I see people who code and offer free coding lessons to their friends. Pre-covid there has been multiple meetups where I live in themed like &quot;programming for no programmers&quot; or &quot;build your first app&quot;.<p>At the same time when I look at other high impact jobs, like lawyers or doctors, they seem to be keen on building moats around their profession. There are no &quot;six week law bootcamps&quot; that would give you useful skills or anything like that. I&#x27;m getting a feeling that engineers are unwittingly cutting the branch they sit on, but they will only realize this years from now when it&#x27;s too late.')
