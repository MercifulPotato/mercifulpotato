With an internet connection and free YouTube videos (dance, body weight training tutorials, et al) it is even <i>pleasant</i>.<p>People often make a big song and dance about how they &quot;need&quot; that $400 bike or $1500 running machine, or &quot;need&quot; gym access to do <i>anything</i>. This is all a self-induced fiction (although marketers likely deserve blame here too).<p>There might be limited truth for the top-1% of athletes who require highly regimented training routines; but for the general public nah. COVID didn&#x27;t make you sedentary, you made you sedentary.<p>PS - I too don&#x27;t get enough exercise. I&#x27;m not throwing stones here. My point is that I don&#x27;t blame COVID-19 for my own [bad] choices. I could freely exceed all recommendations if I choose to without stepping foot outside but I don&#x27;t, and I have to live with that.')
