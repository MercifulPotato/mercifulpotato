Things like &quot;Freddie Mercury was gay&quot; when Brian May attests that Mercury enjoyed heterosexual encounters too. The proper definition is bisexual then, it seems.<p>But perhaps the same reluctance to acknowledge those who seek homosexual relationships is present in people who call themselves gay, they won&#x27;t acknowledge people as bi? Which seems like hypocritical bias against people whose behaviours are bisexual.<p>Maybe the behaviour you call out is because people want to have homosexual sex without being &#x27;gay&#x27;. By which I mean without making that sexual activity the focus of their identity (I believe it&#x27;s known as MSM)? It need not have anything particularly to do with societal disapproval.<p>Who one has sex with, and defining oneself by ones sexuality are quite distinct, as too are sexual desire and desire for relationships.<p>I&#x27;m interested in your response?')
