Item(by='ubermonkey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610464739, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25734577, text='&quot;Because they typically introduce new technology which is somewhat incompatible with previous generations&quot;<p>Just to clarify:<p>He doesn&#x27;t meant that each year&#x27;s new kit is incompatible with last year&#x27;s. He just means that major generational changes introduce incompatibilities.<p>11-speed cassettes have been the rule for most new road bikes for quite some time now, but obviously when it was introduced it wasn&#x27;t compatible with 10-speed systems.<p>11 has been around for a while now. Shimano has 3 &quot;serious&quot; tiers of road bike components: Dura Ace, Ultegra, and 105 at the &quot;bottom&quot;. (The bottom here is the bottom of serious cycling, not the bottom of cycling generally; the lowest 105-equipped bike in Specialized&#x27;s road line is $1,400 MSRP.)<p>When I bought a bike in late 2014, Dura Ace and Ultegra were 11-speed, but 105 was still 10. Then, for a while, everything was 11. You could (and can) mix and match within Shimano or within SRAM as long as everything was 11 speed (with the exception that you can&#x27;t mix mechanical derailleurs and electronic shifters, or vice versa).<p>A year or two ago, SRAM introduced a new 12-speed electronic-only group at its high end (&quot;RED&quot;), which has since filtered down to its middle-grade (&quot;Force&quot;). SRAM still makes 11-speed mechanical and, I think, still makes parts for its first electronic setup (&quot;eTap&quot;) which was 11-speed.<p>Shimano is behind, and still hasn&#x27;t introduced a 12-speed system, but there&#x27;s a lot of anticipation for it, which is what OP is referring to.<p>(I should also note for the record that Shimano still makes and sells lower-grade component groups, too; the cheapest road bike on the Specialized web site is intro level Allez at just $900. It comes with an 8-speed Shimano groupset called Claris, which is currently Shimano&#x27;s bottom-of-the-line. They also still make a 9-speed (Sora) and a 10-speed (Tiagra).)')
