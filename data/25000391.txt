When I was a student, people used a bunch of different languages to write software, depending on what group they were in, or what the culture there was.<p>You had Matlab, R, Octave, Java, C++, Lisp, etc. all depending on what type of scientist or engineers you worked with (Statisticians used R&#x2F;SPSS&#x2F;etc., Physicists and Electrical Engineers used Matlab or C++, Computer Scientists used Lisp etc.,  and the list goes on)<p>At least today, most is written in Python - only the libraries are different.<p>Also, sharing code is a breeze today. Back then you&#x27;d have to download or manually transfer the codebase from other users, check dependencies, install software, check licensing, and what not.<p>Today you can fire up a Python notebook, and that&#x27;s it - very nice for smaller stuff. Even larger applications is a easy as pie.')
