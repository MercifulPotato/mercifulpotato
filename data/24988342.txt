If you&#x27;re drawing to a framebuffer like Dear ImGui is doing, it&#x27;s even worse. In some OSs have to use other APIs (like focus management) to take advantage of the a11y APIs, which is kind of &quot;at odds&quot; with the whole immediate-GUI paradigm.<p>This is amazing new for corporation-backed products like Flutter, React Native or even Qt, because it makes the barriers to entry way higher. On the other hand, open source project will lack the resources to do proper native a11y.<p>Asking OS vendors to have proper accessibility in their OSs is IMO the more appropriate step for accessibility advocates, rather than forcing dozens of Open Source projects to reimplement the same thing over and over.')
