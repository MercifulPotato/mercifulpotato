In the last century, you could assume that a) a family had one breadwinner and b) he would expect to work at a single company his whole career. So it would make sense to tell your employees to move to a suburb that is powered by basically a single employer and buy a home there. They could go to &quot;the city&quot; (whichever city) with a 1+ hour commute on weekends or holidays. And employees wouldn&#x27;t semi-expect to change jobs every few years, so buying a home made sense.<p>Now none of those assumptions hold. Even universities, which historically didn&#x27;t care to be located in big cities or near other universities, are now facing the &quot;two-body problem&quot; - so many candidates are now part of a couple who both want academic jobs.')
