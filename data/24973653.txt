No. Is it comparable to any first-class European city? Definitely not. Is it on par with NYC&#x2F;SF&#x2F;DC? Not really. Los Angeles (where I currently live)&#x2F;Seattle&#x2F;Atlanta? Somewhat. Heading in the right direction? Definitely.<p>[1] Unless you&#x27;re talking about DFW suburbs. In which case, once you cross the city line, try not to lose your soul in all the cookie cutter subdivisions.')
