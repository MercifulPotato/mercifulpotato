DoorDash seems to have drivers execute multiple orders concurrently.  If someone else in your area ordered from the Indian place around the same time (or another restaurant nearby), the same driver will likely pick up both orders and deliver one and then the other.  You&#x27;re definitely not buying a dedicated slice of that human&#x27;s time for $3-4.')
