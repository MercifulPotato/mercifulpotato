But it has fallen behind, which makes sense. Why would anybody take the risk of trusting that an alternate implementation when it doesn&#x27;t decide what bitcoin is, in the end? You may have to patch bitcoind a bit to get your desired interface, but that is much less work than maintaining a full P2P and consensus layer.<p>It is also dangerous to use you a non-standard crypto library.
