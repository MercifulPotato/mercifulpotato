The author argued three principle points:<p>- <i>That the only defensible justification of copyright is a consequentialist economic balance between maximizing the distribution of works and encouraging their production.</i><p>- <i>That there is significant historical, logical, and anecdotal evidence which shows that exclusive rights will provide only limited increases in the volume of literary production, particularly within certain sections of the book market.</i><p>- <i>That there was limited justification for contemporary expansions in the scope and duration of copyright.</i><p>A substantial portion of the analysis is directed to the textbook market.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Uneasy_Case_for_Copyright" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Uneasy_Case_for_Copyright</a><p>Copyright at the time of publication required registration, and was for a term of 28 years, renewable for an additional term, so or 54 years, lapsing four years from now in 2024.  <i>Subsequent</i> copyright revisions have extended by 41 years, to a total duration of 95 years, expiring in 2065.
