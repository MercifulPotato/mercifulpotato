I don&#x27;t like this pattern because you can&#x27;t close the channel, which is a useful way of signalling you want the routine to end. I guess you could add a signal channel in that select block too, but the language supports &quot;auto exit loop&quot; on close already, via the range function<p>Instead:<p><pre><code>    for val := range someChan {\n        doSomething(val)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIt might be subjective but<p>1. It reads better<p>2. It leaves the loop when you call close(someChan), which is neat<p>But that&#x27;s just my take. I&#x27;d be curious if anyone has any reasons for the single-channel-read-in-a-select-block approach')
