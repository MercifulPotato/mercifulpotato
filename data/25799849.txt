Newton laws where certainly not &quot;discover&quot; by newton alone. Erasing people from the history and then painting a picture of a lone scientist is an high prospective. There are scientists that work alone and they are  rare and NOT the most productive. And I&#x27;m talking about Physics and Math here. So no you need to shower communities of scientist before getting result from research.')
