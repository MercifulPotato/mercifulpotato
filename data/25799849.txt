Newton laws where certainly not &quot;discover&quot; by newton alone. Erasing people from the history and then painting a picture of a lone scientist is an high prospective. There are scientists that work alone and they are  rare and NOT the most productive. And I&#x27;m talking about Physics and Math here. So no you need to shower communities of scientist before getting result from research.\nBy the way if an hypothetical lone scientist find all the theorems of the world he would still need to spend some time to teach them to others. At the and you still and up funding a large group of top scientist. There is no way around it.')
