(ie, within the last few months I finally blocked it.) I never picked up any of the crazier conspiracy theories that people might associate with the site. But, I was affected by reading all the extremist content. My intuitive sense for the likelihood of country-wide instability, as well as my sense for how bad that instability could be were well skewed. Having finally quit, I feel a bit silly now. I live in a very peaceful, suburban neighborhood, and it&#x27;s the safest town in my whole state. I generally don&#x27;t consider myself as susceptible to misinformation, but I think it&#x27;s clear to me now that anyone can be affected, and everyone has a different blind spot for it.<p>Were I DO believe in censorship is in the home. ie, I believe it&#x27;s ok to determine what media &#x2F; ideas I ingest, since my abstinence won&#x27;t prevent anyone else.<p>All of that said, I completely agree with you when it comes to facts and common ground. However, I believe that technology has fundamentally changed what it means to release and censor information. I haven&#x27;t figured out a good way to articulate this yet. So I&#x27;ll just say that pamphlets in the 1800s are obviously very different from youtube or social media now. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the same issues all over again, and I&#x27;m not sure what the right solutions are.<p>&gt;If the government is malicious, the correct response is voting.<p>No doubt. The recent brush with populism has made me a bit nervous in this regard. It can be argued whether the founders really successfully produced enough bulwarks against populism, however I certainly agree with the intent of their efforts.')
