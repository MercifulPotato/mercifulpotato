So before, it said &quot;For prescription refills, press 1.&quot; Now I have to wait for &quot;For prescription refills, press 1, <i>or say prescription refills</i>.&quot; How on earth does that improve anything? I can just as easily press 1 as I can say a word, and when I press 1, there is a near 100% chance that the computer on the other end will understand my command.<p>Some phone menu voice automation are even worse. &quot;Tell me what you want! &lt;silence&gt;&quot; Then you say something, and it says &quot;I didn&#x27;t recognize that. Please tell me what you want!&quot; Then it fails again and says &quot;I didn&#x27;t recognize that. For prescription refills, press 1, or say prescription refills...&quot; Oh great so there was a menu? Why did you waste my time earlier?<p>Voice is just a terrible, low-fidelity, low-bandwidth way of commanding a computer. You might as well have handwriting input while you&#x27;re at it: You write what you want on a piece of paper, and hold it up to the camera and the computer tries to figure out what you wrote. Just as silly.')
