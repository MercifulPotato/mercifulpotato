Even with good defenses, determined attackers could still keep banging at the gates trying to get in. There are also attackers that have a good deal of sophistication and ‘cyber arsenals’ to go after these bigger orgs - including nation-states and large crime rings.<p>In a meatspace analogy: If someone owned a staffing agency, they might require employee ID badges, set 2FA, and have cameras in a building... but probably have no contingency plans for the Russian government attacking them or criminals with a wrecking ball smashing through the walls.')
