They had great pie in the sky ideas, and the tools did useful things, but they forced everyone to use it for many years and kept defending it for years while evidence kept building up that using the tools made projects take 5 times longer than just writing in C.<p>If they had accepted the evidence and backed off the tool until it could deliver the better than C quality (which it did do) at the same speed of development they might still be around. However in the end we need to ship code to make money and our competitors were catching up on us which isn&#x27;t acceptable to the business.<p>Let this be a lesson when you want to adopt new tools. They might be better but they might have some unexpected downside that means they are not useful.')
