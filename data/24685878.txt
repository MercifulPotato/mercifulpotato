A well written and tweakable GC will most likely perform better than refcounting in such situations.<p>The best way to improve memory management performance is to allocate and free much less frequently, not to write a better garbage collector, faster allocator or smarter shared-pointer and this is also why manual memory management is the right answer to garbage collection when performance matters, and not refcounting (again: only when memory management performance actually matters).<p>I&#x27;m not sure how much this also applies to virtual memory management though.')
