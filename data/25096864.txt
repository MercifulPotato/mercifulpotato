So the play store is basically the only google bit that ocassionally runs on my device.<p>And let me tell you, I almost never have to open up the playstore except for updating my banking apps, because f-droid has a much better selection of apps anyway.<p>For example, NewPipe is a much superior alternative to the official youtube app and it even works perfectly fine without a youtube account. I don&#x27;t have to ever worry about having my google account deleted because NewPipe backs up my subscriptions to xml.<p>I can only recommend this approach of &quot;degoogling&quot; but still having the ability to fall back in case it is really needed. But so far microG has been great, they even implemented the Covid Exposure Notification framework very quickly.')
