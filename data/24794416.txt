Let&#x27;s say you agree that the current Belarusian president is bad news, and is trying to maintain power by invalidating free democratic elections, and suppress other candidates by arresting them on trumped-up charges.  If you don&#x27;t agree with that, fine, but let&#x27;s say for a moment that you do.<p>In that case, Apple&#x27;s requirement of Telegram is in support of a repressive regime.  While I&#x27;m not a fan of violence, I will acknowledge that sometimes it is necessary to apply violence in order to achieve freedom.<p>But the overall point is that what people say on Telegram is none of Apple&#x27;s business.  Strong-arming Telegram&#x27;s CEO into complying with Apple&#x27;s moralizing is an abuse of Apple&#x27;s market position, based on their OS&#x27;s DRM that requires all apps to be approved by Apple.  That&#x27;s not a world we should have to live in.')
