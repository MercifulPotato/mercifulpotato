Item(by='giantg2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609593145, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25610462, text='Ranked-choice will help to a degree (like in a general election where a sufficient number of people think a 3rd party candidate is better, etc). We would still need higher voter participation, especially in primaries. With such low voter turn out in primaries, that gives the most motivated (extreme) factions an advantage. Not to mention, we need to hold the primaries on the same day nationally. Right now the first few states might have 8 candidates to choose from, but the last few states only have 1-3 and would still suffer from bias since some of those candidates still wouldn&#x27;t have a chance to win due to their poor performance in other states (unless the party executively overrides things at the caucus).<p>I think the parties will remain powerful under ranked-chioce voting. People look to them as an authority more than an organization representing their own beliefs. It seems that many people also use it as an identity, which may stymie the benefits of ranked-choice.<p>All this said, I think it&#x27;s a step in the right direction, but wish that more could be done (voter participation and same day primaries for example).')
