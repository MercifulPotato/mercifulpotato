The hackernews link was titled like this:<p>&gt;Don&#x27;t Use Protobuf for Telemetry<p>so I thought I had a shot of reading something relevant to me. So I opened up the article:<p>&gt;Protobuf needs no introduction, but this post argues that you shouldn’t use it for telemetry. The basic premise of this post is that a good telemetry library needs to be lightweight to avoid perturbing the application; inefficient diagnostic tools are self-defeating. Unlike other formats, nested Protobuf messages cannot be written contiguously into a stream without significant buffering. The post doesn’t argue to never use Protobuf, but that the trade-off made by the wire-format itself, as opposed to any existing implementation, is unlikely to work for lightweight message senders.<p>My field is related to robotics, where we actually send, you know, telemetry. Like, over a radio. What I&#x27;m complaining about is that this is arguably the &quot;main&quot; usage of this word, but people in the web space assume that like protobuf, the concept of telemetry needs no introduction: it means sending back statistics, metrics and logs about your web services. When he says &quot;a good telemetry library&quot; needs to be lightweight, there&#x27;s zero preamble here to get me oriented.<p>You saying &quot;did you even read the post&quot; is exactly missing the point. Yes, I read through the post, and through context clues, discerned that this post isn&#x27;t relevant to my interests. I just notice that people writing about cloud service technology never feel compelled to warn you that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re going to be talking about. They make grand proclamations, and you have to play detective to find out whether their claims apply to you. &quot;Microservices are the future!&quot; &quot;Okay, does he mean like... for all of software? Or for SaaS companies?&quot;<p>Imagine if the world was a different place, and the average programmer worked at a robotics company instead of a web tech company. And then you saw an article titled &quot;gRPC is dead - DDS is the future&quot;. And then it jumped in and started talking about all these throughput metrics, and it took you 6 paragraphs to figure out that the reason they&#x27;re done with gRPC is that they&#x27;re shipping around 4K images at 60fps to dozens of microservices that all run on the same computer. And you&#x27;d go oh, well that&#x27;s... irrelevant. That&#x27;s how it feels, all the time.')
