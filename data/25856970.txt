Lots of guys haven&#x27;t really had a shot at finding out what they&#x27;re capable until life shows them otherwise. My bro-in-law was like that. Graduated from a crappy, unchallenging high-school in the sticks.<p>He was about 30, and a highly-skilled mechanic with several kids, when he decided to give it a shot. Spent about a half-year at a community college doing remedial math and writing, then applied at a University. Four years later he was handed a degree in chemistry, <i>with honors</i>. As he would say, &quot;Not too shabby.&quot;')
