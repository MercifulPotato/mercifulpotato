If they want to hire engineers that can start contributing immediately, and they hire engineers that need mentoring, then the hiring process is broken.<p>If they widen their expectations, and hire people that they believe they can mentor into net contributors, then their hiring practices should reflect this.<p>There are many ways a company can make hiring more scientific, including A&#x2F;B testing (ie. hiring people they normally wouldn&#x27;t, have more data around how productive new hires are, etc) but I&#x27;ve never seen it over than &quot;copy Google and we should be good.&quot;')
