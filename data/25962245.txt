For example Tomcat right now is  v9.0.41. We would like to only update our internal stack when  &quot;major releases&quot; occur. Would I wait until 9.1.x? I know some softwares call these LTS, but often that is nowhere to be found on their site.<p>I think this is probably the type of question that could spiral into a bunch of conjecture, but any insight welcome.')
