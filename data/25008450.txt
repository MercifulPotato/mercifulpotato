Partly due to media, partly due to the internet.<p>English seems common in the groups of immigrants you come across too.  I know people who&#x27;ve moved from France, etc, and there are lots of immigrants from various countries - many of whom speak their own language, and English as the second.  Some go on to learn Finnish to a greater or lesser extent.<p>I&#x27;ve ordered food in restaurants, cider&#x2F;whisky in pubs, etc, and had the server just reply back in English.<p>Me: &quot;saisinko omena cidre?&quot;\nThem: &quot;Do you want ice?&quot;<p>On the one hand it is helpful at times, but on the other hand it is deeply frustrating.  90% of the staff at the local newsagents has pulled me aside on a quiet morning and asked &quot;Do you prefer English or Finnish?&quot;  I say &quot;Finnish&quot;, but to be honest the conversations I have with the shop-staff are mostly them reading the total, and asking &quot;would you like a receipt&#x2F;bag&#x2F;anything else?&quot; so it doesn&#x27;t help me in any real sense, but it&#x27;s nice they offer&#x2F;ask.')
