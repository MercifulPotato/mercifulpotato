And nothing is ever erased, there is a txt file containing everything you&#x27;ve written. You can jump-start it with a txt collection of your particular writing style&#x2F;lexicon.<p>For me, the speed is not an issue. I feel like the speed&#x2F;responsiveness of the medium is inversely related to the length of the final text. Speed of light for the poetry, longhand for a novel. There is a reason why old prose is such a lengthy affair, and why it so often flirts with the letter writing trope. (That is probably anchored in the rhetoric schooling of the writers of old.)<p>N.B. I have been using only the desktop version of the Dasher. Nor did I use it to write this reply.')
