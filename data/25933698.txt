Then I used it too much. And then recently I use it incredibly sparingly. I think this is most people&#x27;s experience.<p>However, there are certain situations where I cannot imagine working without OOP.<p>For example, GUI development. Surely nobody would want to do without having a Textbox, Button, inherit from a general Widget, and have all the methods like .enable(), .click(), and properties like enabled, events like on_click, etc.?<p>Similarly, a computer game, having an EnemyDemon inherit from Enemy, so that it has .kill(), .damage(), and properties for health, speed etc.?<p>I&#x27;d really like to know how the most anti-OOPers think situations like this should be handled? (I&#x27;m not arguing, genuinely interested)')
