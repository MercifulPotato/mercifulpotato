It&#x27;s a question of statistics rather... When you have 100 infected individuals and a virus that mutates in 1% of infected people (note: this is a random number, no idea what the actual mutation rate of coronavirus is), you&#x27;ll end up with one mutated version. When you have 100k of infected people, you&#x27;ll end up with 1k mutations that are spreading out and (essentially) self-selecting. And when you hit 1M of infected people... it&#x27;s 100k mutations.<p><i>That</i> is why it would have been important to keep infection rates down until there&#x27;s a vaccine - because it is more than likely now that there&#x27;s a strain of coronavirus somewhere that has a different spike protein and so is not caught by the existing vaccines.')
