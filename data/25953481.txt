For example, the &quot;Google Pay&quot; app in India, which works via the UPI system, shows its own &quot;scanner code&quot; in the app as opposed to the standard UPI QR code. Furthermore, you can&#x27;t discover where the UPI QR code is, if you want to pay using BHIM - an app that works directly with UPI payments. If you&#x27;re using GPay too, then you can access the scanner code. If not, you <i>used</i> to be able to select the UPI QR code from a menu and scan that. However, later updates have hidden that - not eliminated it, mind you, <i>deliberately</i> hidden that. You have to &quot;swipe left&quot; when you see the GPay scanner code to get to the QR code - not at all a discoverble act. My wife discovered it by accident after we were puzzled a few times about where the QR code that used to be accessible went (both of us use BHIM). As a consequence, folks who use GPay <i>do not</i> know about UPI. This is, in my books, <i>malicious</i> design. Hanlon&#x27;s razor would ask me to try &quot;stupidity&quot; first. But no. This <i>isn&#x27;t</i> stupidity. It is downright malicious (the benign term being &quot;dark pattern&quot;) to do this .. at least at Google&#x27;s level.')
