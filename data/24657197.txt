People who can&#x27;t get jobs, can&#x27;t rent a place to live, and have no hope of improving their situation have much higher rates of re-offending. Duh. Why wouldn&#x27;t they?<p>Do you imagine the victim of a violent crime wants to see the offender crushed by society to such an extent that they offend again? Do you imagine the victim wants the offender&#x27;s children to suffer as well? How many generations of pain and suffering should be imposed? How many more victims will that spawn? How much misery should we be willing to impose and on how many people?')
