I gather from your response including Amazon you might have a different perspective.<p>I&#x27;m interested in sales platforms for small business retail. Platforms which let business owners put a store on the web and maintain their own website design. Shopify&#x27;s turn-key solution lets you have a stores without all of the Platform cruff. You can seel goods on Amazon, but you&#x27;re just a another &#x27;seller&#x27; under the branding of Amazon.com (unless there is another competing service I&#x27;m unaware of).<p>Personally, I get to see a lot of small businesses from the Admin side. And Shopify&#x27;s partner platform is one of the most robust. Pricing is competitive (for the businesss) and they&#x27;re very developer friendly.<p>No. I really like Shopify, and I was curious why others _like_ it so much.<p>haha. I understand where you might default to thinking I&#x27;m suspicious. We&#x27;re all suspicious. And I see a lot of businesses who go full-in on a platform (POS, online retail) and when it comes to getting financial reports or API access you might want, they are unhelpful and very costly. (Don&#x27;t get me started on Third-Party Online Ordering Services like DoorDash or Ubereats).')
