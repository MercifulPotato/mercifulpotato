We aren&#x27;t talking about fascism, we are talking about climate change. Could the two be ideologically linked for you perhaps?<p>Your car speeding towards a cliff analogy presupposes your argument. I&#x27;d argue that a bumpy road is coming, not a cliff. I&#x27;d like you to show me why you believe it is a cliff, and that it is coming within 9 years.<p>Facts I&#x27;m in doubt about: that global societal collapse is coming by 2030. You could change my mind here, I&#x27;m practically begging you to do it, all you have to do is show me.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that coral reefs bleach, but I do doubt that it is really that big a deal, and I have reasons why. Here is one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2982020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2982020&#x2F;</a> they are not collapsing. See what I did there? If you could do that, just once, that would be great. You might even convince me that total societal collapse will occur by 2030.<p>I&#x27;m in doubt that climate change will cause famines that create a 200M migration problem worldwide. If you could give me a reason to believe that, and that it will happen by the year 2030, I&#x27;d really appreciate that very much.')
