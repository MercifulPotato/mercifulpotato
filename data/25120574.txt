We are currently not taking orders till July 2022.&quot;[1]<p>Handling fabric automatically remains difficult. One company, Sewbo, took a straightforward approach - they starch the fabric before sewing, handle it as a mostly rigid object, then give it a light rinse after assembly.[2] Chicago Dryer is able to handle sheets, towels, and work shirts if a human feeds in the first edge.[3] Once they grab some part of a flat surface, the machines can take it from there.<p>The home folding machine people from 2019 are still stuck at &quot;sign up for our waitlist&quot;. And, like the industrial scale Chicago Dryer machines, someone has to feed in a leading edge to get it started.<p>Robots are not cost-effective against labor in Bangladesh, world leader in T-shirts. There&#x27;s already much mechanization. If you watch videos of that, mostly what people are doing is grabbing an edge of something and feeding it into a machine that does the rest. It&#x27;s doing that first grab cheaply that&#x27;s the unsolved problem.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwearautomation.com&#x2F;tech-packs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwearautomation.com&#x2F;tech-packs&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;player.vimeo.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;158544539" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;player.vimeo.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;158544539</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7bd900ehE9M" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7bd900ehE9M</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foldimate.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foldimate.com&#x2F;</a>')
