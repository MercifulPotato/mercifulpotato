Garbage. Similarly, this guy is saying that because Python&#x27;s shell doesn&#x27;t have breakloops, it isn&#x27;t a <i>real</i> REPL. Also garbage. 99.9% of the time when using REPLs&#x2F;shells, if something doesn&#x27;t run, I correct the code, copy and paste it into the shell, and run it again. Breakloops don&#x27;t exist in the Python shell because they don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to. Python shell works about as good as Clojure REPL for me.<p>I get really tired of these elitist holier-than-thou arguments. Functional programming is a thing. Procedural programming is a thing. REPL is a historical name... for an interactive language shell. They really are quite equivalent.')
