So, probably more often than not, they are obliged to cobble together a substitute for what they need from the limited toolkit at hand, making a hammer do a screwdriver&#x27;s job, as best they can.<p>You have to feel sorry for them, and even sometimes admire them, making the best of adversity in their impoverished language.<p>Then think of the poor C coders, lacking even that.')
