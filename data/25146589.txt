I remember it reading like a detective novel, as back then the folks writing were mentored by the OG molecular biology folks. It can be yours for only $4 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Unraveling-DNA-Maxim-D-Frank-Kamenetskii&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1560816171" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Unraveling-DNA-Maxim-D-Frank-Kamenets...</a><p>“A genetic switch” is another fantastic unraveling of a single virus. If you like diving into like a framework and learning piece by piece how it all works slowly, that is a GREAT book. For a while this was my favorite book.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Biology-Viruses-Bruce-Phd-Voyles&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0801663911" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Biology-Viruses-Bruce-Phd-Voyles&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0...</a> This book started my career. The first chapter, specifically, started my career. It got me hooked, not sure why. You can learn about other WILD things viruses do there too!<p>On the experimentation side, try a transformation kit <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.the-odin.com&#x2F;colorbacteria&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.the-odin.com&#x2F;colorbacteria&#x2F;</a> it’s $30, and at least you’d be able to tell friends and family you’ve genetically modified life before. That is a nice intro into synthetic biology. This is how I got started.<p>On the bioinformatics side, miniPCR has some nice kits to go barcode environmental strains. I personally hate doing PCR and don’t care about barcoding, so I’m biased here. I’m much more of a synthetic biologist, so bioinformatics study is only relevant to me in context of the things above.<p>I’d probably buy some books + the transformation kit and then see what interests you from there. There are a couple things that are 1 step away from transformation kit plus some learning, which is why I recommend that path.')
