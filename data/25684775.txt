I reckon a typical Senior at a FAANG or other mid to high level tech company is better skilled than a typical Senior at a non-tech company (including myself).<p>So if I throw in my hat for a position at a tech company as a Senior, then I&#x27;m going to be competing at a higher level. So I&#x27;d much rather just apply to a plain ol&#x27; SWE position (or even junior, if possible). The compensation is likely higher than what I currently make anyways.')
