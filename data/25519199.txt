Firstly, if you do decide you want to suggest diverting the vaccine from people at high risk to people at low risk in order to raise revenue then the least you can do is run the numbers on how many more of those high risk people will die.<p>Secondly &quot;this isn&#x27;t political! It&#x27;s either a free-market solution or a tax&quot;. No. It&#x27;s <i>not</i> a free-market solution, it&#x27;s the governemnt setting an arbitrary price for a product they have a legal monopoly on, it&#x27;s also not a tax since it&#x27;s entirely optional for people to pay it.<p>Thirdly, the comparison to Delaney is massively off - Delaney&#x27;s plan would <i>save</i> nearly $100Bn compared to the current solution of selling the vaccine and congress being forced to hand out $2000 stimulus checks. Becuase the checks weren&#x27;t really about getting people to take the vaccine, it was about providing the stimulus checks that are already going to happen, but tying them to something.<p>Finally, if you&#x27;re rich enough to give $100k for a vaccine you&#x27;re probably rich enough to find a way of getting it somewhere else, so really what we&#x27;re saying is that you&#x27;re asking them to make a massive donation for something that they don&#x27;t need fron you.')
