I don&#x27;t find that type of conversation to be productive and all I can do when it&#x27;s directed at me is ask someone nicely to stop. I&#x27;ll repost the other part of my post because I think it gets to the substance of the issue.<p>Re global hotkeys: I still don&#x27;t understand your complaint. You just described two applications that didn&#x27;t work and then went on to explain how one of them was made to work on Wayland. Yes, applications need to be ported, no solution on the Wayland side will ever change that. If the complaint is that the chosen method adds latency, or that the config setting has moved, those are vastly different than your original complaint which is that it doesn&#x27;t work. Is that closer to what you were getting at?')
