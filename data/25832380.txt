A flood of self-replicating machines that took over the planet a long time ago, eating everything. If we introduced a new kind of nanite-based life that actually managed to devour our ecosystem (which is probably more challenging than it sounds, given that there are real thermal limits on how fast such molecular disassemblers can work), I&#x27;m &quot;optimistic&quot; that they would differentiate into another complex ecosystem over time as well.')
