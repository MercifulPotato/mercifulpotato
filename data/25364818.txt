When it comes to echo chambers, social media platforms like YouTube exacerbate the problem with algorithms designed to keep users &quot;engaged&quot; by feeding them whatever the platform thinks they&#x27;ll watch ads on next.<p>Ironically, if YouTube <i>really</i> wanted to help, they could just stop trying to &quot;engage&quot; users based on their political preferences.  As if that would ever happen.<p>Any time I watch a video from CNN, Fox, or NBC, YouTube suggests political crap for weeks afterwards.  I bet political content is one of their most &quot;engaging&quot; subjects, so I doubt Google would ever do the responsible thing and put a stop to that.<p>Modifying the algorithm to show &quot;both sides&quot; instead might help, but I don&#x27;t think that would do much to encourage a middle ground.  I&#x27;m worried both sides would just get more and more extreme.')
