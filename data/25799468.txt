If it weren’t, wouldn’t I be v unable to send or receive a text at all? Which by the way does work with a multiple minute lag.), etc. and then I was told that what the previous support people saw as “full 4G LTE coverage” was <i>actually</i> “virtually nonexistent coverage”<p>When I asked about why those two phrases are interchangeable, they based all contact.')
