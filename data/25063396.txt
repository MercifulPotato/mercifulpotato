Its ad-hoc, Hodge-Podge type system and poor meta-programming is sad to see for such a popular language.<p>I&#x27;d rather write TypeScript then JS, but as soon as there&#x27;s an opportunity to write software that works across all platforms without dealing with JS, and with a type system that&#x27;s actually built on a solid foundation, I&#x27;m taking it.')
