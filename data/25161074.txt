Item(by='tikej', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605884690, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25160115, text='&gt; At the core, both religious people as well as scientific people just want certainty of whatever they believe (also known as &#x27;the truth&#x27;). They just go about it in different ways.<p>There is a tiny difference that you don’t seem to mention. While everyone would like to be right, science people change their views provided with evidence that they are wrong, while religious people don’t, they have dogmas. If someone doesn’t change they only claim to be “scientific people”.<p>Sure, if science is non-replicable than it can’t and shouldn’t be called science. It bothers me too about social sciences and psychology, but the problem in this disciplines is that objects of their study are extremely complicated.')
