It&#x27;s a bit odd to see a serious opensource project without any license specified as it prevents adoption for at least some of potensial users. I for example pay close attention to licensing as a personal user. It&#x27;s just too risky to invest my time learning to use project which can any time in the future become paid or restricted in other way.')
