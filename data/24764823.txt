One of the most important kinds of testing is in the face of errors. With mocks, testing an error case is no different than testing a non-error case. With a fake, you need to add explicit error injection to get the same kind of coverage. It&#x27;s no big deal, it&#x27;s not usually hard to do, but the article&#x27;s focus on only &quot;happy path&quot; testing makes it much weaker than it could have been.')
