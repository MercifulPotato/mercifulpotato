It was larger than you&#x27;d ever get from either BK or McD&#x27;s, but it was still a licensed product.<p>The flavor was pretty good (if a bit too &quot;meaty&quot; as it were), but the texture was very wrong. There were sizable globs of rubbery material in them which was a bit disturbing (think Pearl Tea style tapioca, only 2-3x more resilient). It was as if globules of gristle had made it into the final product, bypassing the grinder.')
