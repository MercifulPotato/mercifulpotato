Item(by='munchbunny', descendants=None, kids=[25765854, 25764016], score=None, time=1610553770, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25763379, text='<i>The question IMHO is, if people want to have a discussion, do downvotes without an explanation help to facilitate it?</i><p>I think they do, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an open and shut case. I see downvotes as dual-purpose. They are a behavioral nudge for the commenter, and they are a signal to everyone else that the comment does not contribute to healthy discussion. I&#x27;m fine if they fail to be the former in some cases.<p>I&#x27;ve met a decent number of high functioning people in real life who are emotionally incapable of introspection and will go down the rabbit hole to defend something they&#x27;ve said&#x2F;done that was clearly an asshole thing to say&#x2F;do in the moment. Responding just gives them a target (you) for the inevitable defensive reaction. There are few people like that, but I&#x27;ve had enough interactions with the internet equivalent of this over my lifetime that I&#x27;ve long since given up on the idea that anybody who clearly comes across as an asshole on the internet will get reformed by a nicely worded &quot;stop being mean&quot;.<p>The other case where I might downvote and not respond is when it&#x27;s a tired debate (usually political, often over diversity&#x2F;equality related topics) and the comment is arguing with common talking points that use incorrect facts or is arguing with common bad faith talking points. I&#x27;ve been in too many of those over the years too. I&#x27;m not going to be the magical person who gets the other anonymous internet poster to recognize the error of their ways.<p>Outside of those cases, I tend to respond after downvoting. Or just not downvote and respond anyway.')
