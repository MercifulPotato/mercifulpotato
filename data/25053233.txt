If I know a classical Democrat is reporting on a trump rally I can expect some heavy bias. Etc. Maybe journalists and news anchors should have scorecards where they personally identify their opinions on issues from foreign affairs to drugs to crime and gender.<p>Ethically, is it okay to be biased towards one party (esp as a journalist) when that partys positions are objectively projective, dishonest, and baseless across senior party members, senior partisan journalists in the parties favor, and dutifully documented over the years?')
