People go to the doctor when they feel sick - or if they actually get checkups, it&#x27;s in the light of some illness like cancer.<p>Usually, there&#x27;s nor any &quot;full&quot; check, meaning that doctors will run every test known to man on you, just to be sure. Tests are done in a holistic way, as they start getting an idea of what&#x27;s wrong with you.<p>And unless you have something really pressing, you won&#x27;t get an appointment (or even treatment) STRAIGHT AWAY.<p>I guess my point is that a lot of Americans would probably feel that they were receiving vastly inferior treatment, but maybe they&#x27;re used to getting overtreatment?<p>In any case - doing all that extra stuff adds up.')
