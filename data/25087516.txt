Wikipedia lists Hong Kong flu deaths in US as upwards of 100,000 with 100m less people in the country.  Even at fifty times more deadly it is not greatest cause of death this year.  Heart disease and cancer have killed far more (over a million collectively).  The response is way out of proportion to what we have seen.  I believe the initial response was appropriate given the projections (which turned out to be a complete fabrication) of millions dead in US alone.  We&#x27;ve seen what this virus is, it&#x27;s not millions dead.  We can&#x27;t cancel life for a couple of years waiting for this to go away, everyone needs to get on with their lives, getting married, seeing people over the holidays.  This continued fearful response is preposterous.')
