There were few CPU cores and the number and types of peripherals. Therefore, the CPU became the center of the computer hardware architecture.<p>Now, with more and more CPU and GPU cores, and the number and types of peripherals, the communication, coordination, and management of cores (or components, peripherals) have become more and more important, They become a key factor in computer performance.<p>The core views of management science and computer science are the same: Use all available resources to complete the goal with the highest efficiency. It is the best field of management science to accomplish production goals through communication, coordination, and management of various available resources. The most effective, reliable, and absolutely mainstream way is the &quot;warehouse&#x2F;workshop model&quot;.<p>So I think Intel, AMD, ARM, supercomputing, etc. will adopt the &quot;warehouse&#x2F;workshop model&quot;, which is an inevitable trend in the development of computer hardware.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linpengcheng&#x2F;PurefunctionPipelineDataflow" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linpengcheng&#x2F;PurefunctionPipelineDataflow</a>')
