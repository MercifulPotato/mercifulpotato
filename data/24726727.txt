Since I&#x27;m never reminded of its existence, I honestly had completely forgotten it existed. Makes things much easier.<p>Sure, other people still see that I type stuff, but this in and of itself is rarely the problem for me. My problem is my anxiety around knowing they get a notification when I&#x27;m typing. That goes away when I don&#x27;t see that others are typing.')
