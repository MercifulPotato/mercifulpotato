But I think it&#x27;s unfair if everyone just complains that this isn&#x27;t open source. First people complained that 1Password wasn&#x27;t on Linux. Then they made a browser extension that works on Linux, and people complained it wasn&#x27;t native. Then they make a native application, and people complain that it&#x27;s not open source. That&#x27;s not their business model, that was never on the table. But it&#x27;s worth celebrating when Linux is gaining support, even from proprietary companies. It&#x27;s good that Steam supports Linux even when FreeCiv exists. It&#x27;s good that Unity supports Linux even when Godot exists. Let&#x27;s give 1Password some credit for supporting Linux - thanks guys!')
