He instructed me to always put the dust cover on it when it was not in use. I interpreted that too literally, so this particular Mac suffocated in its own dust cover while I walked away to eat dinner. It was reportedly smoking when it was found by my sister. Its final act in life was to help me catalogue my rock collection in HyperCard.<p>Anyways...it is still sitting around in its original box, so I’ve always wondered what it would take to resurrect it. I’d be interested if anyone had an intuition for whether such a project is DIYable, a specialist-only job, or a lost cause?')
