If a vaccine is being studied in a population of 40000 and only 100 of those people are black, you won&#x27;t be able to learn as much about the vaccine&#x27;s effects on people of a certain race because of the low sample size. It&#x27;s of course relevant for those in countries where those races are majority and more studies need to be done in those places as well.')
