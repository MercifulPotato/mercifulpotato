Granted, you have to pass some number of levels between each of the mini-games, but they <i>are</i> in the game at this point.<p>That said, I hate these ads. They&#x27;re annoying and not representative of the game that you&#x27;ll be playing in the slightest. I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re banned (in the UK, at least... maybe it&#x27;ll make it across the pond eventually).')
