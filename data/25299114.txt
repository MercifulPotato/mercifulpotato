And no, I could not make the same argument about Planet Money, since that show <i>is</i> produced by NPR.<p>If you say &quot;American public radio&quot;, do you also include Democracy Now? Do you include shows produced by other local stations, including the ones that do not get distributed? NPR is not the totality of &quot;American public radio&quot;.<p>Understanding the structure of public broadcasting in the USA is critical to understand why it works the way that it does. NPR is a distinct organization, even from CPB (Corporation for Public Broadcasting), even if its sensibilities are echoed in other public radio organizations (like MPR&#x2F;APM).<p>As for your points about Adam Davidson, I don&#x27;t find that shameproject.com page particularly persuasive. It&#x27;s clear that Davidson&#x27;s worldview does not align with that of the people&#x2F;person who wrote the page&#x2F;manages the site. I don&#x27;t find this particularly remarkable or even particularly interesting. Davidson&#x27;s worldview doesn&#x27;t really line up with my own either. But there&#x27;s a bunch of stuff on that page (the quotes in particular) which lack context, and a lot of other stuff that consists mostly of deeply subjective assessments and assignment of motive to Davidson without much evidence.')
