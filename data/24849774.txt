They then explore that theory and notice that by implementing ways to avoid this human error the failures to appear are lower. It also explores the theory that by shifting away from punitive attitudes (i.e. not blaming or punishing people) you lower this behavior.<p>Your comment is irrelevant to this discussion as it blames the victims of the system.')
