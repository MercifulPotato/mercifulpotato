I have 100Mbps internet, 32GB RAM, 4ghz i7 processor and suchlike. To make it easy for Jira, I&#x27;m doing this at a weekend, late at night, during the new years holiday so the servers shouldn&#x27;t be busy.<p>On a cloud-based classic software project (which has less than 200 issues) opening a link to an issue it takes 4.8 seconds for the page to complete rendering and the progress bar at the top of the screen to disappear.<p>Opening a Kanban board with 11 issues displayed? 4.2 seconds for the page to load.<p>Click an issue on the board? 2.5 seconds for the details to pop up.<p>Close that task details modal - literally just closing a window? 200 milliseconds. Not to load a page - just to close a modal!<p>In case I&#x27;m being hard on cloud Jira by insisting on using a classic project, I also checked with a &#x27;Next-gen software project&#x27; with less than 2000 issues.<p>I click a link to view a particular comment on an issue. 4.8 seconds until the issue, comment and buttons have all loaded.<p>I choose to view a board? 9.9 seconds from entering the URL to the page load completing.<p>I&#x27;m viewing the board and I want to view a single issue&#x27;s page. I click the issue and the details modal pops up - and just as I click on the link to the details, the link moves because the epic details have loaded, and been put to the left of the link I was going for, causing me to click the wrong thing. So this slow loading is a nontrivial usability problem.<p>View a single issue, then click the projects dropdown menu. The time, to display a drop-down menu with three items? 200 milliseconds.<p>This is what people mean when they say the performance problems are everywhere - viewing issues, viewing boards, viewing comments, opening dropdowns, closing modals? It&#x27;s all slow.<p>And if you imagine a backlog grooming meeting that involves a lot of switching back and forth between pages and updating tickets? You get to wait through a great many of these several-second pageloads.')
