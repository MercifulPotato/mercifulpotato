The experiencer is one of the persistent thoughts we are having these days, and since we are one, i have an understanding and a certain sympathy towards your struggle.<p>im just arguing against the immortality of the experiencer.<p>I say give us longer lives, that may be possible.<p>An immortal experiencer for &#x2F;everyone&#x2F; opens up the very troublesome issue of the quality of that experience.
