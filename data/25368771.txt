It&#x27;s not really taught. As you pointed out later, it&#x27;s not just &quot;media literacy,&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;thinking for yourself,&quot; &quot;critical thinking,&quot; &quot;skepticism,&quot; &quot;reasoning.&quot;<p>Very little of that is taught because the educational institutions who would be responsible for teaching it have curriculums that cannot withstand it.<p>Hand-waving to students that &quot;u shuld do critical thinking&quot; is not sufficient to actually teach critical thinking.<p>Also our educational institutions totally ignore the distribution of intelligence in the population. The curriculum is dumbed down to the lowest common denominator which does an incredible disservice to high (or even average) intelligence individuals.<p>&gt; The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.<p>This is true, to an extent. But, that&#x27;s what journalism is supposed to solve. Instead of spending 1000 hours researching some issue as an individual, have 100 journalists spend 10 hours researching it and collaborate on the reporting. Sadly, we have very little actual journalism anymore, which I&#x27;ll explain next..<p>&gt; people who live on their lies usually have a much stronger incentive<p>This, I totally agree with.<p>Journalism has failed because it was bought out by corporate interests who have a vested interest in a particular narrative. If not through advertising, but by buying the media companies directly. Further, if you give a &quot;journalist&quot; a choice between working for 10 hours to tell the truth or working for 1 hour to tell a lie, getting paid the same amount either way, the outcome is obvious.<p>Moreover, declining educational standards, and especially lack of critical thinking skills, has led to a deadening of the public palette. The market is not incentivizing actual journalism because objectivity is hard, opposes too many special interests, and the public (at large) doesn&#x27;t have a taste for it.<p>The only takeaway from this ought to be obvious. We can&#x27;t rely on the institutions and corporations who created this problem to solve it. Clearly they&#x27;re leading us to &quot;thought police&quot; and censorship. I think, however, the lights should be turned on and the public at large should get a crash course in critical thinking.')
