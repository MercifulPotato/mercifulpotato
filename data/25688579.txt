Whatever they call it, this is censorship.<p>Already due to AI suggesting similar contents on services like Facebook &amp; Youtube and the design of sub-reddits on reddit, we have living inside echo chambers. Atleast users have an option of searching for different contents on the platform. It&#x27;s a bit easier to come out of the echo chamber.
