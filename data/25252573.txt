The reason being that most online chess systems will give you an Elo rating and use that to match you up to similarly rated potential opponents.<p>Anyone that was using a computer to play for them would quickly gain a high rating and so either be matched against really strong players who stand a chance of beating the computer or others doing the same thing.<p>Give online chess a go, it&#x27;s great.')
