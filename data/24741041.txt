Same for the emoji key.<p>2) Whatever the button on the left they threw between Ctrl and Windows destroys my mental memory constantly.  I was hitting it all the time and never wanted it.<p>3) They moved Num Lock off the Numpad.  Every time I need to find it I have to search because the new location is so counterintuitive and stupid.<p>4) Rather than one central location to check for the status of *lock, I have to look at keys scattered across the keyboard (including in non-intuitive locations such as &quot;not on the num pad&quot; for num lock)<p>5) They moved the Print Screen button to another place I&#x27;d never look for it.<p>I wasn&#x27;t a fan of moving F6 to the left hand but would have gotten used to that eventually.<p>I had used the Ergo 4000 for 15+ years (and various older Microsoft ergos before that), but this made enough frustrating changes that caused me to look into alternatives out there.  I ended up on the Kinesis Freestyle Edge.  I didn&#x27;t want to have to learn a radically different layout (Ergodox, Kinesis Advantage) and have to change every time I  moved to a laptop or other machine, and the Freestyle gave me a mostly conventional layout, mechanical keys, and a physical split with enough tilt&#x2F;tent to get to a very comfortable position.')
