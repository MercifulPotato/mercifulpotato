Handcuffs are temporary restraints and a struggling individual can severely hurt themself or defeat them.<p>Also, this scenario does jive with what I&#x27;m saying. Ketamine is generally safe. Would you rather have a shot of ketamine, mechanical disablement (multiple broken bones), or a shot of 9mm? These officers could have moved higher up the force continuum without the ketamine, even killing him in other ways (intentionally or accidentally). Are you saying tasers should never be used also?<p>I believe the vascular restriction (that they shouldn&#x27;t have used) is the reason he was brain dead.')
