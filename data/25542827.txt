It is overly complex (not without reason) and people don&#x27;t put in enough effort to learn the whole picture (and it just isn&#x27;t thought in schools) and just want to use something quickly for their current problem. Which is why they pick JWT and don&#x27;t understand the host of related technologies - OAuth2, OIDC, JWK, JWE - just to name a few.<p>I don&#x27;t see a reason why I would ever want to use auth=none for anything as at that point JWT is just base64 encoded json but I may be too deep in the identity world by now.')
