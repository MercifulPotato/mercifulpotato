(limited use, very hard)<p>Some out of the box thinking is in order here. Duringe the initial lockdown, I signed up to pay for Coursera&#x27;s courses. I found out that what I craved wasn&#x27;t shirking from work, but rather distraction. It didn&#x27;t matter that I had to do some homework for the courses. Since I was _watching_ something, my brain thought of it as the same thing.<p>But I should note that you haven&#x27;t addressed the biggest bugbear of mine either, Google maps. It&#x27;s light-years ahead of everything else, and just does not get replaced easily.')
