I want the raw JS, in one click, so that I can build out a visualization locally, just hacking on HTML&#x2F;JS. Steps to doing this are highly obfuscated when they could be a single button.<p>Overall you can see its evolution from prior sites- someone spent a huge amount of time demonstrating cool visualizations, then tried to make it all &quot;proprietary&quot;.  Nothing wrong with that, but why not make people addicted to the service by giving them the raw drug, rather than making them hate you for dancing through hoops?<p>Again- huge fan of access to many cool visualizations that have greatly improved what I can express visually for presentations etc., but very unhappy that I can&#x27;t do this so much easier for my particular workflow. I&#x27;d love to be shown otherwise, but I&#x27;ve also spent a lot of time looking for answers, reading forum responses, etc., and they seem to all reflect wanting you to go through them, not along for the ride with them.')
