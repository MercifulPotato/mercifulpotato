His bad right-hand technique was fixed within the week, I heard.<p>In a less extreme version of this, trumpet teachers often have their students put a penny between the valve button and the fingertip because too many students unnecessarily lift up their fingers which causes the slightest of delays and unnecessary motion when depressing the valve next time.')
