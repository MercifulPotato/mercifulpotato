It reminds me of this tweet from Senator Ed Markey: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SenMarkey&#x2F;status&#x2F;1101234939058683904?s=20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SenMarkey&#x2F;status&#x2F;1101234939058683904?s=2...</a><p>&gt; Climate change is literally destroying the planet. According to the Trump admin&#x27;s National Climate Assessment, with no action, climate change will result in 10% GDP loss by 2090.<p>That 10% figure is on the high end (see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;how-much-will-the-green-new-deal-cost" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;how-much-will-the-green-ne...</a>, under the heading &quot;10% of GDP?). But even taking it at face value, it&#x27;s irreconcilable with Markey&#x27;s assertion about &quot;literally destroying the planet&quot; or the article&#x27;s claim of &quot;apocalypse.&quot; It&#x27;s like two completely opposite thoughts in the same tweet, and I can&#x27;t decide whether Markey is crazy or I am.<p>What is an apocalypse? The year my dad was born in Bangladesh, the under 5 mortality rate was about 1 in 3 children. That wasn&#x27;t great, but it still wasn&#x27;t &quot;apocalypse.&quot; Will climate change be that bad? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what the science says, but am I missing something?')
