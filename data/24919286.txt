Had quite a busy social life, working in an office in Soho.<p>Since the pandemic I have moved out of the city and into a more rural isolated area (Did not see any benefit to paying high rent prices in a city when all the facilities were shut down). All of my work has moved to remote working using video conferencing etc.<p>Before we would use Slack a lot, but in-person meetings were a common occurence and I would spend quite a lot of time outside of work with friends or colleagues discussing various topics.<p>Since being in this isolated environemnt I feel that because those interactions are far more rare when they do happen I struggle to recall words or phrases that were once commonplace in my vernacular.<p>This is all very anecdotal evidence of course, but it&#x27;s somethig i&#x27;ve observed in myself of a number of occasions now.')
