Indeed, only one of my maths teachers had even used a slide rule, so I had to figure the thing out myself.  One of the first things was that the multiplication scale on a slide rule is a low precision log-table.  The other is why most math and physics problems only asked for solutions to two or three significant figures.  (While physics problems do deal with precision, the consistency of the precision is definitely suspect.)')
