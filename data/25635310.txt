Sometimes you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re looking for, and you will go insane if you&#x27;re not sure if the thing you want is on page 8 or 12 if you have to keep clicking &quot;next&#x2F;prev&quot; to get between them.<p>Another way to put what you&#x27;re saying is essentially that the user should never have more than one page of results.
