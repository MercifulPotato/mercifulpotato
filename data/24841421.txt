The Democratic party has a much greater willingness to engage in regulatory actions against large businesses than does the GOP.<p>The GOP pushing a rushed (and therefore, weak) case now smells of a designed-to-fail effort that will only strengthen Google&#x27;s position by poisoning the well against effective anti-trust efforts in the future.<p>It may also be partisan. Facebook has received considerably less attention from Washington as it has become more cooperative with Republican demands that conservative-oriented fabricated news remain on the platform[0]. Google has made no such commitments and might be in the GOP&#x27;s sights as a result.
