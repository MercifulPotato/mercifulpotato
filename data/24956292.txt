They may be technically correct about the license concerns, but the absoluteness and blaming they do isn&#x27;t worth the outcomes.<p>I just closed the repo I&#x27;m working on to the public and will not be making it Open Source moving forward as I originally intended. I&#x27;ve been through this before myself, and it&#x27;s just best to leave my code unlicensed and copyrighted by me. I&#x27;m grateful this ugly beast reared its head and reminded me how much vitriol non-contributors can deliver.')
