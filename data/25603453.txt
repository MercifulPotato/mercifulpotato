Aliasing doesn&#x27;t just happen when you&#x27;re converting an analog signal to a digital one.  It can also be introduced when you&#x27;re <i></i>manually<i></i> building or converting a digital signal with the intention of it sounding like a given analog signal, or like the ultimate output of another digital signal.  It was this usage I was referring to.  For example, if you downsample a digital signal from another digital signal without filtering out frequencies above Nyquist.  Or in the example I gave, if you draw a square wave with the expectation that it sound like an analog square wave, not realizing that the sharp corners you&#x27;ve drawn didn&#x27;t add in high-frequency odd harmonics, but rather partials with Nyquist-reflected aliased frequencies. It&#x27;s this second case which causes problems for naive approaches to digital wave-design: you can&#x27;t filter out the incorrectly-introduced reflected frequencies after the fact, but rather must build the wave in the first place to not have them.')
