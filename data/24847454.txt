The problem we see currently is humans are terrible at paying attention to boring things.  And AI driving is largely boring.  Right up until something unusual happens, but if the human is asleep&#x2F;watching their phone&#x2F;etc, it&#x27;s already too late.<p>I don&#x27;t see how a remote driver solves that problem.
