Specifically in reaction to how the network convulsed last bull market and correction.<p>Yeah it still sucks and is hardly competitive especially on the layer-2 front, but lets at least be accurate about why it sucks lol.<p>Wrapped Bitcoin offerings are better than native Bitcoin. There is a lot of money being made in helping people wrap and unwrap their Bitcoin for use and trade (not for custody though). It will be very prevalent this cycle. There are a lot of options for people to be unburdened by Bitcoin&#x27;s layer-1 while being able to manage risk and capture alpha with the market gyrations, in unlimited amounts. All comes down to if people want to learn, this time, but the landscape is extremely different.<p>The honest reality is that you will want to watch is if Ethereum&#x27;s capacity can keep up fast enough. If mentioning the Ethereum Network caused a convulsion, then you really need to re-evaluate what is going on. It is acting as a trading portal and center that has almost nothing to do with the Ether cryptocurrency. It has robust Layer-1 trading systems,  10 competing Layer-2 offerings that already work right now which the Layer-1 systems will very quickly upgrade to (bitcoin has 1 Layer-2 system called Lightning, in incremental progress for 5 years and it doesn&#x27;t work very well), while also being in the process of updating its own Layer-1 consensus layer to increase throughput by two-three orders of magnitude.')
