Item(by='Zamicol', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609784118, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25632757, text='I&#x27;m not the biggest Bitcoin fan, but this article is dumb.<p>I&#x27;m not a Bitcoin &quot;believer&quot; in that I don&#x27;t believe the modern Bitcoiner&#x27;s dogma.  But many newcomers don&#x27;t know the history: a significant number of early Bitcoin engineers have moved on to other projects (like Ethereum) that better align with some of Bitcoin&#x27;s early goals, such as a cash alternative and an accessible economic cypherpunk system.<p>There are many cryptocurrency projects that are less dogmatic and more pragmatic.<p>&gt;&quot;Is Bitcoin money? No.&quot;<p>While I appreciate the upfrontness, the problem with this mentality is failing to conceive how the technology itself can easily overcome these minor criticism.<p>&gt;&quot;1. Medium of Exchange.&quot;<p>Even if Bitcoin isn&#x27;t, which you&#x27;d need a very narrow definition, Eth easily overcomes this argument.  Eth has functional, successful, trustless, and distributed stable assets that serve as stable priced mediums of exchange.  I don&#x27;t see how other cryptocurrencies aren&#x27;t money even if Bitcoin isn&#x27;t, which also undermines the intent of the article.<p>&gt;&quot;2. Unit of Account. ... We denominate BTC in terms of how many USD theyâ€™re worth, so BTC is not a unit of account presently.&quot;<p>That is severely ignorant and makes it obvious that the author has spent superficial time in the space.  I cannot think of a charting tool that doesn&#x27;t allow denomination in at least one other cryptocurrency.  The Eth community refers to &quot;the ratio&quot; (denomination in Bitcoin or other assets) constantly.<p>&gt; 3. Store of Value.<p>See point 1.  This is a solved problem.')
