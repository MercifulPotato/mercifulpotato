This belief seems to often short circuit critical thinking and the person ends up diminishing their impact or having an adverse effect.<p>Examples:\nHabitat for humanity - for the cost of sending one incompetent american to build a house in the third world, an army of local builders can be hired. If you really want to make impact, donate rather than going in person.<p>Talented and capable people who end up working low impact non profit jobs at low pay. If you had a real job and donated half your income to the cause, both you and the cause would be better off.<p>Stupid advocacy. People who get excited about feel good slogans like &quot;cancel rent&quot; without considering impact on the medium and long term supply of housing, and thus end up amplifying the problem they believe they are fixing.<p>These are just a few examples where not doing the seemingly good&#x2F;moral thing can be much better than doing it.')
