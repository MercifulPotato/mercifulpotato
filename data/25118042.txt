I&#x27;ve heard variations on a theme around this.  I live in an area which seems to have close to 100% mask compliance for the last several months as near as I can tell, and we still have cases increasing.  I guess I&#x27;m having a hard time believing that it is visitors from Texas (or where ever) coming in and spreading coronavirus.  What it seems to indicate to me, is that public shopping, etc. isn&#x27;t a driver behind the spread.')
