This resulted in many hours of counting without oversight, with hundreds of thousands of ballots counted during this time.  This was in violation of state law:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legislature.mi.gov&#x2F;(S(d3swxbgf3srsrnw20ak5uthw))&#x2F;mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=mcl-168-733" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legislature.mi.gov&#x2F;(S(d3swxbgf3srsrnw20ak5uthw))&#x2F;...</a><p>Evidence:\nList of affidavits here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;18619867&#x2F;1&#x2F;donald-j-trump-for-president-inc-v-benson&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;18619867&#x2F;1&#x2F;donald-j-tru...</a>\nWitness testimonies during the Michigan legislature hearing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;wxyzdetroit&#x2F;videos&#x2F;4110372688977369&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;wxyzdetroit&#x2F;videos&#x2F;4110372688977369...</a><p>&gt; I refer you to this brief response to the &quot;Texas lawsuit&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;steve_vladeck&#x2F;status&#x2F;1337119761902276608" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;steve_vladeck&#x2F;status&#x2F;1337119761902276608</a><p>That link mostly addresses Texas lack of standing to challenge PA&#x27;s elections, which I am in agreement with - Texas does not have standing here.  I would be more interested in a source that addresses the specific claims being made in the Texas lawsuit.  I reference the Texas lawsuit only as a useful document, as it has a fairly well summarized list of complaints for each state.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve seen the quality of such that you provide elsewhere in this thread, I don&#x27;t see the point in you doing this again.<p>No problem.  I am genuinely interested in seeing an honest refutation of the claims being made by these witnesses.  The judges haven&#x27;t provided that.  The media most certainly hasn&#x27;t.  From the replies on HN here, only 1 or 2 people have attempted to provide constructive information.  The rest, very similar to yours, is primarily ad hominem and casual dismissal.<p>If you do have something productive to add, that would correct my perspective in a constructive way, I am genuinely eager to hear it.')
