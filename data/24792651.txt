Filecoin Tech Lead here, I really wouldn&#x27;t take any prices you see for deals as authoritative yet. Things are gonna be pretty crazy up and down until the markets settle.<p>Filecoin miners right now are making about 0.25FIL per day per TB they store. Thats just in block rewards (remember, Filecoin is a proof of SpaceTime network). Any amount the user is paying is on top of that price, so basically, if the user pays enough to cover the transaction fees and bandwidth costs (very small), it makes sense for the miner to accept the deal. This effectively means the block reward is subsidizing the price of storage.')
