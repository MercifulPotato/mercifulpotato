They should be focusing a LOT more on breach of contract. Unless, you know, AWS didn&#x27;t actually do that per the terms.<p>For anyone reading this, Tort law (which is what this is) boils down to this basic idea: Was there a legal agreement between two parties, and did the violation of that agreement cause damage to one of the parties. From what I&#x27;ve seen (IDK the specifics of Parler&#x27;s contract with AWS, and I&#x27;m just guessing based on general understanding of how good a ToS from a mega-corp like Amazon is) the answer is yes there are damages, but they seem unlikely to stem from the violation of the terms of a contract.')
