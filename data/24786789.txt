I don&#x27;t like how everything with German cars is an option. Tesla offers less customization, and also delivers all tech features to everyone. I assume it makes their production line much simpler to handle and also brings more satisfaction to their customers.<p>Also having more customers using their tech pushes them to develop and improve their tech. Other manufacturers have driving assistant techs for years. They never caused hype because only a small percentage of their customers have it with their order. And for the same reason they also didn&#x27;t bother to make it more advance.')
