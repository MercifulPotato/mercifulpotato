My 2015 Macbook (personal, not the one I use for coding) is still running 10.12.<p>I don&#x27;t really want to update it, but am going to have to, as it no longer receives security updates from Apple, as you say won&#x27;t run latest XCode, which also homebrew complains about and says it can&#x27;t support my OS, and increasingly software I want to install won&#x27;t cause the OS is too old.<p>But there are zero features of an OS update i want. I am terrified of what&#x27;s going to happen when I update.<p>However, i still far prefer MacOS UX to Windows, myself. I just a quite fine with it on 10.12.<p>And my 2015 Macbook is still running <i>fine</i>, by the way, have no need of an upgrade for more CPU or RAM or anything like that.')
