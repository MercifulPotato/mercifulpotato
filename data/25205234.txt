Item(by='nl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606270124, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25201240, text='&gt; reporting a bribe solicitation to the appropriate authorities is much less risky than it would be for (say) a random citizen of San Jose.<p>To say the least!

Whether it is what he meant or not, it&#x27;s an ungenerous take.<p>I can confirm I didn&#x27;t mean this! That&#x27;s a stupid idea.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand how randallsquared got that from what I said.')
