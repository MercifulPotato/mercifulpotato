Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602871578, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24802716, text='&gt; Facebook is most definitely centralized. So is Twitter, and so is YouTube.<p>I think it&#x27;s not about technical centralized&#x2F;decentralized but about who decides what can be read. Pre-social-media: journalists are selected by companies based on political alignment and are controlled by their editors, only journalists get published, average people cannot communicate with each other at scale, journalists&#x2F;media companies have total control over information and thereby over the perception of reality.<p>Social media changed that. You can no longer just put an embargo on a story and expect people not to learn about it, as was made very obvious in Germany at new year&#x27;s eve 2015. The news will spread via social media and there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it short of shutting down the communication networks.<p>Federated social networks take that a step further by also removing Facebook&#x27;s centralized control from the system, but that&#x27;s a minor step, because Facebook doesn&#x27;t interfere with their users that much. At least that was true, the Hunter Biden thing might be a taste of what&#x27;s to come.')
