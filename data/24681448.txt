Where did you study differential equations?  From my experience, it is typically taught that way, at least in the european universities that I know.  Even in the most hard-core mathematics departments they may focus strongly on the analysis part (existence, uniqueness, regularity) to the detriment of a bit of modeling or simulation; but I have never seen those hidden.  The &quot;algebraic&quot; solution of the equations is a fringe subject that is most often omitted, (except when it leads to a simple analysis, e.g. linear equations).')
