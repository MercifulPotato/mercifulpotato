As written, this section does not relate to the distribution of the initial doses in Section 5.1, but instead is about where AstraZeneca _could_ choose to manufacture the vaccine. That is why it explains the process by which they might get prior written notice for non-EU manufacturing sites, and discusses how they could be contracted with if they are unable to deliver doses.<p>I think that gives them some leeway to ask AstraZeneca to increase capacity in the EU, but it strongly suggests to me that the capacity has meant to come from EU facilities, particularly for the &quot;Initial Europe Doses&quot;.<p>Somebody also linked to this [1] which implies that AstraZeneca stated that they would have no other contracts that should conflict with the &quot;Initial Europe Doses&quot;, however, I can imagine AstraZeneca will argue that this is achieved by segregating production in the initial doses stage and that the problem is due to low yields in the EU facilities and not due to competing arrangements.<p><pre><code>  [0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;faisalislam&#x2F;status&#x2F;1355120024378335238\n  [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;antoguerrera&#x2F;status&#x2F;1355137923411279878</code></pre>')
