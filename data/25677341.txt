It&#x27;s still enough pay for comfortable living, but 60hrs&#x2F;wk is a lot of work and is decidedly against the lifestyle TFA talks about.<p>[edit: parent says 60hrs&#x2F;month. At $100&#x2F;hr that&#x27;s $72k&#x2F;year pre-tax. I don&#x27;t know how to delete this comment but would if I could.]')
