So if you&#x27;re doing a software development rig, where yes those 12 or 16 cores will be put to good use, you&#x27;re stuck with spending $100+ on a new GPU that&#x27;ll spend its entire life idling or scrounging the used markets. The low-end discretes are crap rebranded from 5+ years ago. Which means outdated display connections and bad hardware video decoders.')
