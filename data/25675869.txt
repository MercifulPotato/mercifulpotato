The author hasn&#x27;t written any posts in 5 years, and has ~15 total since 2010:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.steren.fr&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.steren.fr&#x2F;</a><p>As someone who blogs regularly, I&#x27;m more interested in the toolchain of people who HAVE done significant writing.  I read blogs for at least a decade before I wrote one, and it&#x27;s harder than it seems, and coercing a good result out of tools isn&#x27;t easy.<p>In fact I just wrote a few of my own tools to fix the image problem, e.g. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;blog-roadmap.html#unix-y-web-services-i-wrote" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;blog-roadmap.html#unix-...</a><p>Basically, the author&#x27;s strategy is not likely to last (though it&#x27;s not impossible).  My blog started out very minimal, but as you write, you bump into the need for more automation and tools.  My site looks very simple and minimal, but there is a surprising amount underneath.<p>Funny comic: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rakhim.org&#x2F;honestly-undefined&#x2F;19&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rakhim.org&#x2F;honestly-undefined&#x2F;19&#x2F;</a><p>When I was writing those tools I often wondered if we should just go back to Spolsky&#x27;s CityDesk.  It was a Windows GUI that would FTP HTML and images to a static server!  I remember trying it briefly in the early 2000&#x27;s.  Although his blog also rotted due to CityDesk rotting!  It&#x27;s a hard problem.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;rip-citydesk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;rip-citydesk&#x2F;</a>')
