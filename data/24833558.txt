You can see on the ca.gov website:<p>Fair enough.<p>&gt;In this blog&#x27;s survey ~70% of drivers want to be independent contractors, and ~60% are a Yes on 22. In case you think it&#x27;s biased, the writers ultimate argued for the No vote.<p>My point was not necessarily that the workers should always decide.  It was that there is a huge difference between roughly 0% who support it for journalists and a roughly 30%-40% who support it for rideshare workers.<p>Also that 60% who support Prop 22 is wildly influenced by the money spent by these companies and the underhanded practices that were the topic of this post.  If these workers were given an unbiased account of Prop 22 and the ramifications, I think the numbers would be different.  If this was truly a popular proposal, why would this become the most expensive campaign in history with roughly 95% of the money coming in support of Prop 22?')
