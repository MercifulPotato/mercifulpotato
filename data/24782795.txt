So somehow the Z80 added another generation between 1978 and 2016.<p>Generations are sort of nonsense, but you could say the first generation microprocessors were PMOS processors like the 4004 and 8008 that were barely usable. Second generation would be the &quot;classic&quot; NMOS microprocessors like the 8080 and 6502. The Z80 is a step more advanced so maybe you could call it a generation, but I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d get to fourth generation. Usually 16-bit microprocessors are considered the third generation, which makes more sense.<p>[1] Second paragraph, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitsavers.org&#x2F;components&#x2F;zilog&#x2F;z80&#x2F;03-0027-02_Z80_CPU_Product_Specification_Mar78.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitsavers.org&#x2F;components&#x2F;zilog&#x2F;z80&#x2F;03-0027-02_Z80...</a>')
