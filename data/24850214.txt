As long as people treat it like it has value, then it does have value.<p>The same can be sort of be said for crytocurrency. But it&#x27;s a lot less liquid, mostly the only thing you can do with it is trade it for other cryptocurrencies or sell it. It&#x27;s on much shakier ground that people will continue to view it as having value.<p>My advice, for what it&#x27;s worth, until people find a practical application for it, stay away from it.')
