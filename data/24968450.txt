But I think that most of the time, what looks from the outside like a waste of resources, is born from not knowing many of the details.<p>That&#x27;s why every time some post on HN mentions that $RANDOM_STARTUP has $SUCH_AND_SUCH employees, there are always both comments stating that having so many employees don&#x27;t make sense, and other people with experience explaining exactly why it makes sense.<p>And no offense, but if you think that lawyers and bankers as a class are not necessary, then I think you simply don&#x27;t know much about what they do or why they <i>are</i> doing productive work.<p>And <i>even if</i> you think that the amount of lawyers&#x2F;bankers&#x2F;government is too high, and that we could make those jobs more productive (meaning fewer hours worked to achieve the same result), I&#x27;m pretty sure the way to get there isn&#x27;t to just say &quot;ok, let&#x27;s just turn off these professions completely with almost no preparation. Good luck!&quot;. This is usually a process that happens over many years.<p>&gt; I mean closing schools for 3 months now is something you could easily catch up for in the upcoming year(s).<p>I completely agree, and if we are only talking about 3 months I agree that it&#x27;s relatively simple. But we&#x27;re already what, 8 months into this? And it looks like we&#x27;re going to be in this situation for another half a year, at the very least?<p>To get back to your parent post, whether we can or can&#x27;t organize our economy to have more people not working in general (and I argued that we can&#x27;t!), the economy right now <i>isn&#x27;t</i> organized that way, so for now at least people do need those jobs. And I think your parent post exaggerates just how many people are dying (e.g. seeing dead bodies on the street is an exaggeration, for the most part).<p>Given our current economic system (which I&#x27;m in favor of, to be clear), the situation really <i>is</i> hard for many people. It&#x27;s really true that people are losing their life&#x27;s savings, and much worse, given the current situation. It <i>isn&#x27;t</i> an easy thing to do, even if you agree that these drastic measures are necessary to prevent a worse outcome (which I agree with!) It&#x27;s the very definition of a lose-lose situation.')
