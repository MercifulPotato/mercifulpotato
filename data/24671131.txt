Loose semantics proved a mistake (PL1), loose syntax brings nothing to the party. Semicolons were used in pascal because wirth understood parsing, and they are there to help the parser resync after a syntax error is detected.<p>From experience if you make semicolons optional as in sql, it helps not at all, AND they are (said by microsoft to) become mandatory in future releases of TSQL, AND I and at least some other users of SQL want them mandatory.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand why a non-typical syntax is used. Not at all saying it&#x27;s wrong but it seems to differ from other syntactic conventions only to be different rather than better (I may be wrong!). Why &quot;gte(a: 100)&quot;?
