You then have to convince people to adopt that framework. You can&#x27;t appeal to the objective definition; that&#x27;s a circular argument. So you have to do it on the merits of the tradeoffs, like &quot;bot spam is noise that detracts from a conversation&quot;.<p>To your example specifically, my own opinion is that it depends. I&#x27;m fine with removing bot spam from a comment section. But move down to more &quot;infrastructural&quot; layers, and I become less okay with it. For example, I <i>don&#x27;t</i> think ISPs should try to block spam; they should be entirely agnostic to what content passes through their pipes.')
