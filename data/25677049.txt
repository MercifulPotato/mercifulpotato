Item(by='happyweasel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610051663, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25673275, text='Gumroad is basically feature complete. I use it to support content creators (about 300 purchases or so), and never found the website to be particularily cool or useful. Search sucks most of the time. At least it doesn&#x27;t get in the way, well unless it does: They have this feature to archive an item in your library, and then it disappears from your library, and you have to dig it out again. Funny thing is: when you hoover over an item in your library, a menu appears, and the archive entry is exactly positioned in the middle. So if I try to select an entry by left-clicking it I often hit the archive button. lol. Also download sucked for a very long time (dl from europe was slow and completely downloading everything in one archive wasn&#x27;t supported for a long time). So yeah, it&#x27;s good enough at least it&#x27;s a way to more-or-less-directly support content creators.')
