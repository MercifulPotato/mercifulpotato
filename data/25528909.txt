I think it’s a fun game, but it doesn’t live up to the expectation - it’s not the next Witcher 3.<p>You have a short memory though. Witcher 3 was also deeply criticized for several aspects when it was just out as well before being recognized as a massive game a few months later. I&#x27;d say you should probably wait half a year to evaluate Cyberpunk properly.')
