The first example in go looks something like<p><pre><code>    filtered := []purchase{}\n    for i := range purchases {\n        if purchases[i].buyer == &quot;Sean&quot; {\n            filtered = append(filtered, purchases[i])\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nand it only gets worse as the domain gets more complicated. I don&#x27;t really know what your background is where you feel that static typing and generics are complicated. I write C# every day and spend 0% of my time fighting the language.')
