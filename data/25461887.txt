YC had&#x2F;has a deal with Sequoia that Sequoia gets first dibs on the companies in each batch before demo day. Stripe presented to a bunch of VCs but got picked up <i>before</i> the demo day.<p>Basically they had funding before the demo day.<p>Also they stayed in &quot;beta&quot; all the way until Sept&#x2F;Oct 2011 when they formally launched on Techcrunch. That gave them enough time to hone the basic API, work out a TPPP (Third party payment processor ) deal with Wells Fargo and actually try it out before launching.')
