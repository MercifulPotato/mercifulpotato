But when confronted with them, you aren&#x27;t going to say &quot;oh sorry I was mistaken.&quot; You will respond with whataboutism and other deflection, to preserve your worldview that this wasn&#x27;t a mob and Trump didn&#x27;t do anything wrong, etc.<p>Which was OP&#x27;s point. This isn&#x27;t a good faith discussion. You are either ignorant of the truth (and will respond poorly when confronted with it), or you know the truth and are cynically lying about reality to win a rhetorical game.<p>This is the nature of all bad faith political discussion, which is why I (try to) avoid it all together.')
