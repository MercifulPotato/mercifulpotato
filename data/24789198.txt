My son&#x27;s favorite kid&#x27;s show is only on YouTube so I created a new account, subscribed just to their channel and still inappropriate content shows up.  How hard is this?<p>I also can&#x27;t block it for my daughter because she has school assignments that involve watching YouTube videos.  Sooner or later that&#x27;s going to bite the school in the ass.')
