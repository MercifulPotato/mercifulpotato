The local maxima&#x27;s of the convolved function show where there is the highest average amplitude, so increase the amplitude of those regions a bit<p>3. Repeat with smaller rectangular functions to capture finer details<p>Does this already exist, and if it doesn&#x27;t, does this idea even work')
