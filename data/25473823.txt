This is theoretically impossible. K compiles into C. Every k program has a C equivalent that runs exactly as fast. Yet it is true in practice. Why? Because it is easier to see your error in four lines of code than in four hundred lines of C.”<p>How true is this? I hear this claim a lot but haven&#x27;t seen any real benchmarks. E.g, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;...</a> doesn&#x27;t have K or any related languages.<p>I&#x27;m guessing K is fast due to autovectorization for certain cases, but are there benchmarks that provide hard numbers? The existence of a benchmark prohibition clause in the kdb license makes me skeptical of its performance claims.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.marksblogg.com&#x2F;benchmarks.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.marksblogg.com&#x2F;benchmarks.html</a> has a kdb benchmark, but due to the use of Xeon Phis, it can&#x27;t be compared with other benchmarks there.')
