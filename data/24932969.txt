But generally, for low volume, high value transactions, haggling is almost always worth it for the seller.<p>Hence car sales, land sales, leases, company mergers etc all have a bit of back and forth as opposed to produce at a store.  However, in poorer countries, I’ve seen haggling over vegetables too, but that doesn’t happen in developed countries since it’s not worth anyone’s time.')
