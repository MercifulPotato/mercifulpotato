They aren&#x27;t going to be evaluating your side project, they don&#x27;t care about you as a person. They are there to do a job - find candidates. Yes you should try and be impressive enough they are interested, but if you&#x27;re doing things primarily to impress recruiters that is probably going to work out poorly, as they don&#x27;t make the final decision. And that is true regardless of how privleged you are.')
