With the MacBook Air (and largely with the base MacBook Pro), Apple was able to more than double the processor speed even while increasing processor speed. I&#x27;m not convinced we&#x27;ll see that kind of explosive speed improvements with the 16&quot; MacBook Pro. Battery life will almost certainly trash the current MBP. I&#x27;m just not confident we&#x27;ll see the base 16&quot; MacBook doubling its CPU performance.<p>FWIW, I don&#x27;t see anything Apple has done as a slap in the face. They&#x27;ve been pretty reasonable about not mentioning Intel in their performance numbers. Instead all metrics are based on the performance of previous generation MacBook Air.')
