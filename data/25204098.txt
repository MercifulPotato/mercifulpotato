Item(by='quesera', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606259307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25200262, text='I used the word &quot;tosser&quot; -- intentionally ironically -- because it comes from the same general subculture that allows &quot;cunt&quot; as a socially-acceptable word. However, &quot;tosser&quot; is an equal-opportunity epithet. It does not single out any meaningful group. Note also that I did not <i>call you</i> a tosser, I said that you might come off as one. We all do sometimes. But there&#x27;s a difference.<p>I actually added that word intentionally. To sort of lighten things, but also to make something of a point. Too subtle, perhaps.<p>I don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re from, but &quot;cunt&quot; is not in the mainstream in most of the English-speaking world. I don&#x27;t personally believe that words are magic, but <i>when used as an epithet</i>, that word is an oppressive, offensive, sexist, misogynist projection of some really ugly stuff.<p>I suspect you know that (how could you not?), and don&#x27;t care. Bully for you.<p>Assuming that you are not ill-intentioned, then maybe it&#x27;s worth asking -- is it surprising to you that two words with similar literal&#x2F;denotative definitions might have different meanings and effects in practical&#x2F;connotative usage?<p>Regarding your recitation of guidelines. Come on, I was civil and pointed out that your usage was not appropriate. The only good faith interpretation of your usage is that you might be a member of a small subculture in which the word is not inappropriate. I acknowledged that, and pointed out that you should still be aware that HN is not a part of that culture.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m getting through here, so I think I&#x27;m done. But we&#x27;re not talking about Comodo, so if that was your goal, maybe your approach was imperfect.')
