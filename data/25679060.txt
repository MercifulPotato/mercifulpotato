Did you used to work there and have some insider knowledge?<p>Seems to me the post wasn&#x27;t even claiming to have &gt;$1M ARR either (there was a graph for the <i>creators</i> ARR which I think is different?) and that everyone does work... they just do it using a non-traditional process.<p>edit: There&#x27;s this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25675713" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25675713</a> which might point to &gt;$1M ARR?<p>edit 2: I also realized in a business like this ARR just doesn&#x27;t matter (who cares?

That&#x27;s amazing for a small business with a small number of employees but it&#x27;s not exactly living high off the hog.')
