It&#x27;s hard to put into <i>words</i> what happened to Intel. The simplest way for me to explain it is that the employees didn&#x27;t take risks. A different way to explain it is that most people at the company were too career focused then focused on the actual business.<p>But this is how disruption happens! Major players like Intel can always see where the industry is going, at a high level, but the rules of each generation in an industry are always murky.<p>IMO, the &quot;ARM&quot; generation of PCs is a shift to vertical integration. Intel set itself up for horizontal integration, and the openness of ARM means that the lines between &quot;Computer manufacturer and CPU manufacturer&quot; are going to increasingly blur.<p>Intel&#x27;s business basically treats PC manufacturers like franchises; and Intel&#x27;s a culture focuses more on career, and less on risk and business. This means that they&#x27;re going to increasingly have trouble adapting to the new rules that come in the &quot;ARM&quot; generation.')
