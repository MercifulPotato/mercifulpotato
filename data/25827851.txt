Other more complicated and advanced machines had custom silicon.  Sound, graphics.<p>But, they often lacked utility, and the outcome was Apples being workstations.<p>A whole lot of code and hardware dev for other systems got done on Apples, which offered enough of the basics to cover most bases.<p>80 columns, fast disks, slots, easy interfacing, no interrupts or DMA in base system, 6 color graphics not just 4, etc...<p>The set of tradeoffs is admirable.<p>I use mine today for retro code tinkering and some hardware fun.  I have it running at 16Mhz, (which frankly is stupid fast) with the 16bit 65816 in it just for kicks.  And that is robust.  I can turn a knob and dial the clock up or down never missing a beat.  Weird and fun.<p>Bonus:  Grand kids can experience Oregon Trail.<p>I jumped onto one of these in the 80&#x27;s and learned a ton!')
