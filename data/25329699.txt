What are they trying to do? What changes do they want to make to your laws?</i><p>Well, I don&#x27;t know, because they haven&#x27;t come to me to try to make changes to my piece of legislation, but the word is that they&#x27;re trying to water down some of the enforcement provisions while publicly proclaiming that they are very much against and condemning forced labour. They&#x27;re going behind the scenes and trying to change the law.<p><i>If they&#x27;re against it, if they say that this is not in their interest, then why would they want to change your bills?</i><p>Because it&#x27;s going to impact their supply chains and make it harder for them to profit off of this forced labour.<p><i>Which means that they&#x27;re using the forced labour?</i><p>If they&#x27;re not using it, it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. But, you know, it appears that they are using it. And if they are auditing their supply chains the way they&#x27;re supposed to, this legislation wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.')
