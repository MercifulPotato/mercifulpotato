That is still &quot;addons&quot; territory. The question which needs be asked - did you (developer) made any different decision at all about Google made decision. E.g. Google decides to abandon some protocol, or add support of some protocol, or whey decided to abandon some core option which adblockers depend on etc. Did you (developer) made a different decision at that point, forked code and maintain your decision independently from Google. Until that happens all the Chrome mods are just that - slightly lagging behind Chrome versions with addons.')
