Having usually implies controlling, but it&#x27;s not necessary for that.<p>A hypothetical value system that &quot;demonizes excess accumulation&quot; will can still allow talented people to use massive resources to solve challenging problems.  For an actual real-world example: the US didn&#x27;t have to wait for a SF fan to become a billionaire before it built rockets to travel to the moon.  Similarly, billionaires often don&#x27;t solve any problems with their wealth.  Musk spends millions to build rockets and win government contracts, but other purported billionaires spend millions on money-losing golf courses and vanity airlines instead.')
