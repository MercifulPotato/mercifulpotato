So completely agreed that it is important. That said, I&#x27;ve taught myself some pretty complicated pieces with it and fingering tends to be something that works out over time because there really is only one comfortable way of playing a piece. 90% or so will be obvious, and the 10% that remains will require some hard thinking on how to move your hands and place your fingers so that it feels natural. Bach is pretty brutal: try a fingering that isn&#x27;t optimal and you simply won&#x27;t be able to play it (or even injure yourself).<p>&gt; There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the idea of gameifying piano, but it&#x27;s a really hard problem to solve well.<p>Agreed. So, my previous &#x27;side project&#x27; I babysat for about two decades, I&#x27;m in this for the long haul and fully intend for it to be &#x27;best of breed&#x27; and standard setting. Which is one of the reasons why we are recruiting a piano teacher right now.<p>&gt; The usual result with piano teaching apps of all kinds - as someone else commented below - is kids get up to Grade 1 (maybe 2) and then hit a brick wall.<p>But that&#x27;s already better than nothing at all, and if we can find a way around that brick wall then I see no reason why it could not go <i>much</i> further than that.<p>I don&#x27;t think a piece of software can be a substitute for a teacher, but I do know that if I&#x27;m practicing I&#x27;d rather do that by myself than to have a teacher look over my shoulder for hours on end.<p>&gt; The reality is that playing any instrument with non-trivial competence is really fucking hard. It takes everyone a ridiculous amount of time and effort to get good at it - even those with talent.<p>That we fully agree on. But that doesn&#x27;t mean people can&#x27;t get from zero to fifty before deciding that they need better tools and better teachers. There is room for a multitude of tracks some of which will lead to success. The main objectives for me are: to help beginners achieve a level of immediate success that it increases their interest, to ensure that they can get to some level of proficiency before shelling out a lot of money, to overcome the usual frustration that causes people to abandon their chosen instrument, to ensure that they don&#x27;t learn bad habits.<p>&gt; So there&#x27;s a trade off between trying to offer easy but limited success with some entertainment value, and going the whole way and doing it properly - which all but the most musical kids get very bored by, because it&#x27;s such hard work.<p>This is also very true. But it may be possible to chart a path that includes both of those in one offering, I&#x27;m not sure that we are on that path right now but it definitely is the intention.<p>Think of this as the beginnings of an engine, which can be used in many different ways. I now first want to get that engine perfected and then to create the rest of the application around it.<p>So far, especially the &#x27;auto&#x27; mode which creates small lessons based on your performance so far has been a game changer for me and for the rest of the people that have been playing around with it, it is conceptually simple, a bit tricky to implement but now that it is there I wonder how I did without it before. The ROI of practice time invested in a piece versus my ability to play it has literally jumped up because of that.')
