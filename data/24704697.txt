The author&#x27;s substack earned a unsubscribe based on it.<p>It has become fashionable to argue the &quot;I might disagree with you but I will defend to death your right to express it&quot; to which is appended &quot;in the NY Times, on Facebook, on Twitter, on Youtube and every private channel that exists.&quot;<p>First, the disagreeable opinion part is wrong since every open+democratic society has a section of speech that is curtailed - sedition, libel, incitement to riot, etc. These extents of censorship vary by country. The USA is relatively liberal but the UK has stricter limits on libel. The author demonstrates a poor to no understanding of these limits.<p>Second he&#x2F;she conflates the limits on government prohibition on free speech rights to the right on the property of others - i.e. the right to free speech is the the right to publish on privately owned media channels. The Sulzberger family which owns significant equity in the NY Times (&gt;$1B) and controls it has the right to decide what gets published in the NY Times, which you might agree&#x2F;disagree with. Similarly for Twitter which is privately owned.<p>However I don&#x27;t think it should be flagged ;)')
