I do all that stuff for all my personal projects, but it is much faster because I already have servers and I have done it a couple dozen times now. I&#x27;m getting to know proxypass and caching directives very well. My first time took hours and much futzing. Once it becomes routine, I automate. I wrote my own build server in JS and bash, it handles webhooks, roll-back on fail and notifications. I&#x27;ve been meaning to mess with ansible.<p>It has even come in handy at work. I&#x27;m primarily a front-ender, but a start up I worked for had me continuously deploy my application to my own personal infra so it could be used immediately.<p>It is an ordeal at first, but nginx is so darn powerful it makes me feel like a wizard. If you want to avoid the arcane incantations, I&#x27;m sure Caddy would be a simpler option.')
