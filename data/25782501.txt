It&#x27;s generally a bad sign for an acquisition if staff from the parent company say words like that they are &quot;fighting to impose the parent companies culture and conventions&quot;!<p>It&#x27;s an acquisition, but companies are made of people, and just because a parent company does something one way doesn&#x27;t mean that it will fit the company they have acquired.<p>Take the acquisition of Disney &amp; Pixar. Steve Jobs stated that he wouldn&#x27;t sign up to the acquisition if it meant that Disney culture would be imposed, because “Disney’s culture [would] destroy Pixar and distraction will kill Pixar&#x27;s creativity&quot;. The whole structure of how the acquisition was planned was to ensure that Pixar maintained creative control and autonomy, and wasn&#x27;t bulldozed by Disney Corporate.<p>I&#x27;ve lived through an acquisition too - the real factor to success is to listen and learn from each other, and build a shared way of working. Unless you are buying a failing company, you have to appreciate that they are doing something right and know their own company more than you do.
