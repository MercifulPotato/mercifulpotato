Note the number of capitalist governments coup&#x27;d by communists. Note the number of invasions and constant wars of The West. Look at Vietnam. Western involvement was long-reaching, direct, violent, and generally within other countries fighting grassroots revolutions &#x2F; civil wars or throwing off colonial it imperial influence.<p>When attempting to find similar situations started by communist countries, we find important differences. Dragged into conflicts on their borders. Literally fighting a genocide directed at themselves. Long-standing territorial disputes on their borders.<p>&gt; I disagree that this is a valid generalization<p>Feudal backwaters subject to regular famines became superpowers that eliminated homelessness and hunger. And the fall of those systems corresponded to drops in QoL over and over and over again.<p>What other tests would you want?<p>&gt; This is because the centrally planned economy depleted vast amounts of capital in their desperate struggle to keep the economy moving and competitive with the west.<p>Capital is just stuff or money tradeable for stuff. The stuff didn&#x27;t go away after color revolutions. But public programs were absolutely privatized or abolished by liberal capitalist governments in moves aligned with their ideologies - ideologies you can find throughout this site, in fact.<p>&gt;  Cynically I could offer the same answer a communist would offer when asked why people weren&#x27;t permitted to own factories in the Soviet Union: because that would put &quot;the wrong people&quot; in charge of the means of production.<p>Ah, but in that case there&#x27;s a consistent ideological position: bourgeois democracy and ownership must be curtailed because otherwise it will grow and eat you and those you love. According to liberal democracy, you&#x27;re supposed to be able to seek and form a representative government in a multi-party setting - yet they restrict those parties to force bourgeois options to be the only ones available.<p>The supposedly core ideals of The West clearly bow to capital when push comes to shove and one should question the propaganda that it&#x27;s these ideals that won or were even the actual goal.<p>&gt; Less cynically, its not clear how a centrally planned economy would know how to correctly allocate resources, so there&#x27;s no reason to return to the central planning model in the absence of a solution to the problems that caused it to fail in the first place.<p>But the vast majority of several countries want that return, with support increasing with age - the people who actually lived under communist party rule. They are prevented from doing so by their political systems. It cannot be voted in. Democracy clearly doesn&#x27;t mean that much to The West, right?')
