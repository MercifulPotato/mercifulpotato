Philosophically speaking, I detest the idea of software limiting a user&#x27;s speech in such a way...maybe such a filter would be needed, or maybe not, but I would prefer to see the need demonstrated over time through practice instead of bluntly imposed by software by default.<p>Reminds me of how Mastodon doesn&#x27;t allow quote-toots...but quote-tweets can be highly effective when used correctly.
