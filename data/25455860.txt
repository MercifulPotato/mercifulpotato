GPU support is indeed coming to WSL2 and is available currently in Insider builds along with a special release of the Nvidia driver and some Linux support packages.<p>This, however has nothing to do with graphical applications or GPU acceleration of such. Itâ€™s entirely targeted to machine learning frameworks.<p>I do think Microsoft has said that GUI stuff is on the roadmap. I hope they can continue to force the hand of Nvidia on the ridiculous matter of not providing any kind of GPU virtualization on their consumer cards.')
