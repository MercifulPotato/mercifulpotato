I think I&#x27;ve built at least one calendar app every year for the past however long.<p>I love the idea of a calendar API (another example is Nylas - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nylas.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;calendar-api&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nylas.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;calendar-api&#x2F;</a>) b&#x2F;c it means I could build for EVERYONE and not just a gsuite specific app (which is what I tend to do for simplicity of APIs). The problem I&#x27;ve seen with these is an inability to grow &#x2F; monetize at the rate startups need to, and, while I love this, things I&#x27;m curious about are:<p><pre><code>  1. How big is this market? \n  2. Has anyone innovated on pricing here? \n  3. Are there really well-adopted calendar APIs you need to design for other than Exchange and GSuite?</code></pre>')
