The spread of skill levels has increased with better players getting better, and more and more new players.<p>As well as more structured games that are not 10v10, but rather smaller 5v5 or 6v6 games, where each player can make a difference.<p>Cheaters are better at hiding too. Toggling aimbot for a quick kill or two isn&#x27;t enough to arouse suspicion, and can be passed off as a lucky headshot. Just because you think you&#x27;ve never run into a cheater doesn&#x27;t mean you haven&#x27;t.<p>On the other hand, a really skilled player might be good enough to make you believe he is cheating. Getting vote kicked or banned out for that is not good either.')
