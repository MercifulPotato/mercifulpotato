So much empty space, empty context menus, usually only one way to get anywhere. Notifications for a user can only be disabled by context menu, clicking away a notification doesn&#x27;t mark the message as read, all settings are on a profile basis (no way to disable notifications for mobile only), there&#x27;s no way to just stop Teams on mobile without having to sign out. The chat input editor is horrible when it comes to writing &#x2F; pasting code.<p>Video chat and calendar integration work great, though.')
