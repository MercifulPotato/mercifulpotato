It seems like a way to drag the web backwards, in to the murk &amp; mire that is iconified by big monolithic large applications.<p>&gt; The Grand Unification of Web Technologies is a proposal to unite all web technologies inside a browser creating a new, simple, more powerful and unified system. To achieve this, the functionality of HTML and CSS would be merged into JavaScript, a far superior technology, effectively obsoleting the other two.<p>The most user-hating proposal possible. Takes a huge case full of dynamite to the web being a place of documents, where there is well defined mark up that can be changed, &amp; rebases the web to be hard to change, difficult, confusing javascript.<p>I find this proposal gross &amp; immoral.<p>&gt; We need to realize that the approach to consider every single web page as a &quot;document&quot; rather than an &quot;application&quot;, does not work anymore.<p>&gt; For this, a website should be considered an application rather than a document.<p>Web developers need to do a better job of using routers, such that the single page app does better align with documents, as the user expects. We should make things better, not dynamite documents.<p>Further, we ought be using semantic web technology, to make well defined sub-documents on the page. Documents within documents.')
