We can bet they will continue to suffer from such issues. It&#x27;s not something you can avoid simply by being competent and careful.<p><i>edit:</i> As lmm says, it&#x27;s likely you have UB issues in your code you aren&#x27;t aware of. That&#x27;s not quite the same thing as having issues in your code due to not being a good enough language-lawyer. I&#x27;ve resolved some very subtle issues that found their ways into a &#x27;serious&#x27; C++ codebase, and I didn&#x27;t spend that long in the C++ world. In most languages those issues simply couldn&#x27;t have happened in the first place.')
