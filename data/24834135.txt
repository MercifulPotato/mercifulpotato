It&#x27;s not black and white. I will edit this part to make that more clear.<p>Actually, not really. You seem to be missing my primary point, which is that thinking that things lie along a single scale where on one hand you have &quot;pure, platonic ideal of reason&quot; and on the other end you have &quot;emotional hysterics&quot;. I don&#x27;t think it works that way. I think the sibling commenter put it best:<p>&gt;&gt; everyone argues from an emotional perspective<p>&gt; You kind of have to. If you were not emotionally invested in some way, you wouldnâ€™t be arguing.<p>That is, I think step one is try to understand why you (and your debate partner) are emotionally incentivized to care about the topic in the first place.')
