Basically, even the most personal private information about literally any citizen is just a FISA Warrant away. Things posted in a public forum are a cakewalk.<p>Maybe they aren&#x27;t doing anything novel with this data, whatever, this is beside the point. The point is, we can&#x27;t really count on the State to regulate this stuff, even though, you know, creating and enforcing laws is literally the reason the state exists...<p>IDK, I hesitantly have to side with big-tech on this, but this is a problem that the State either can&#x27;t fix, or will not fix.<p>The internet is a wonderful thing, but it is also very dangerous. Having unfettered access to information, be it true or false, can wield some horrible side effects when such a large swath of the population lacks basic BS detection, critical-thinking and like, base level understanding of civics. Do we need a Vanguard? I wouldn&#x27;t trust one coming from either side of the aisle in the current climate. Seems like &#x27;censorship&#x27; from the platforms is the only viable solution I can see, but that can take a pretty dark turn.
