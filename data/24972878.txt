And while it&#x27;s really hard to have a forest without trees, it&#x27;s really easy to have a bunch of trees but not a forest. The apex tree species in a forest don&#x27;t come until much later. They are in many cases the tree that grows in the space left by the death of a tree that grew in the space left by the death of yet another tree.<p>Your friend had a field full of pioneer tree species. Those trees stopped his field from being a meadow (a badly, badly damaged meadow) but they have to die to make way for the real forest building species.<p>For instance, a pioneer tree dies. A hemlock, which likes to grow on fallen trees (nurse logs) takes its place. When the hemlock grows old and dies, your old-growth species might establish in the same spot, or it may wait to replace whatever grew after the hemlock.')
