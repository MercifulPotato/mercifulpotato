Here&#x27;s you circa 1290: &quot;If you live in a fiefdom with wells, irrigation, castles, etc. -- then your Lord is responsible for everything around you.&quot; See how fallacious that sounds when you transpose it this way?<p>The central issue is that you&#x27;re justifying a thing <i>from the context of the thing itself</i>. You&#x27;re explaining modern capitalism from the framework of modern capitalism. It&#x27;s circular, and you get ridiculous things like &quot;the markets built the roads&quot;. Ahm, no, <i>workers</i> built the roads!<p>&gt;Are the markets all-knowing or perfectly efficient? Of course not. But it&#x27;s literally the only place where you can measure how a global herd of humans are feeling about the state of the world at any given time with a single number.<p>They are a <i>weighted</i> way of seeing how <i>some</i> humans are feeling about things. A number that gives as much weight to 8 guys as it does to 3.7 billion. It&#x27;s a pretty shitty indicator, I&#x27;d say.')
