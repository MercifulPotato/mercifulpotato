Rather annongingly, the team started out due to problems encountered on HMD&#x2F;Nokia phones, since acknowledged and partially fixed (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sleep.urbandroid.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;faq&#x2F;alarms-sleep-tracking-dont-work&#x2F;#nokia-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sleep.urbandroid.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;faq&#x2F;alarms-sleep-...</a>).<p>Personal anecdote: even Google have been wishy-washy between different versions of Android when it comes from battery optimizations (Android 6&#x2F;Marshmallow is the most hardest on this front), but at least it was documented. Imagine the pain of managing other brands (and it seems that all Android manufacturers engage on it one way or another).<p>Edit: in 2018, VideoLAN&#x2F;VLC complained that Huawei agressively kills apps outside of its whitelist (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;videolan&#x2F;status&#x2F;1022033608670961665" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;videolan&#x2F;status&#x2F;1022033608670961665</a>). There is no update on this one unfortunately, but I&#x27;ve heard that it was fixed in subsequent EmUI versions but there is no verification of that from VideoLAN or Huawei.<p>Edit edit: Unrelated to the notfications issue, benchmark scores are allegedly being tricked out by a certain chip manufacturer running the chips out-of-spec in a whitelist (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techarp.com&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;mediatek-benchmark-cheating-2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techarp.com&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;mediatek-benchmark-cheating-2...</a>).')
