Same for the majority of project leads.<p>What users care about is &quot;does this thing do what I need it to do on my OS in a relatively timely manner with not too many bugs and not too steep a learning curve?&quot;. What project leads care about is &quot;is this tech well supported, cross-patform, and battle-tested, and will it be easy to hire for?&quot;.<p>Using established frameworks that are profit centers for enterprise-scale companies (MSFT&#x2F;Google) ensures support will always be around, and the largest cross-platform bugs have already been encountered then fixed&#x2F;documented. Using normal web-tech means performance will be acceptable (people have a good feel for how long things take in web), and hiring&#x2F;on-boarding will be easy (we routinely have folks with only basic web dev experience building vscode and contributing fixes within a matter of hours of encountering the code for the first time).<p>I challenge you to try to mentally-argue one of these alternatives to a superior... I think you&#x27;ll find that you don&#x27;t have much to say but &quot;look a the memory consumption! look at the download size!&quot;, but I&#x27;d be interested to be proven wrong.')
