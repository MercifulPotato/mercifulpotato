It&#x27;s just an example of physical property whose &quot;use&quot; amounts to some number N of people doing something using it, where N is much larger than 1. But N is still based on, and limited by, the physical nature of the property; it can&#x27;t be increased arbitrarily by just making more copies, the way it can for digital &quot;property&quot;.')
