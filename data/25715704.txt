The family and region you are born in determines so much about your life that individual contributions seem laughable in comparison. Even then, your individual characteristics are heavily based on the former as well, in the form of nature and nurture. Even the ideas you might cultivate are the result of happening on the right resource at the right time. Lastly, it becomes harder and harder to explain the successes of outliers without it being mostly about luck and the environment. The notion of free will is under assault from all corners. Not to mention that apparently the brain makes decisions before the thought comes to your conscious awareness...<p>Talking about luck is often instinctively interpreted as a method to avoid responsibility and cultivate laziness, but try as I might, ignoring this aspect of the world feels like a type of wishful religious thinking that is torn apart after even the most cursory investigation and thought. Generally, people will tend to attribute the bad things to luck and the good things to their own efforts, but in reality both seem to fall under the same purview.')
