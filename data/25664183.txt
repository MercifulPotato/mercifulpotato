It starts off by saying this is an analysis of &quot;best&quot; and &quot;worst&quot; case scenarios for continued growth in cases, but later it says:<p>&gt; HSJ understands that the briefing was part of an attempt to get senior clinical leaders to focus on what they would have to do, <i>if current growth trends were not surpressed by the tighter lockdown</i>.<p>So, er, what if the growth trends <i>are</i> suppressed by the tighter lockdown, as seems likely? Will things then be better than the &quot;best&quot; case scenario?<p>It sounds like there&#x27;s a bit of misreporting going on here. The leaked document forecasts demand based on pre-lockdown trends, to highlight the significant risks. But the article is reporting it as if running of beds is totally guaranteed in all circumstances, which doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case, if the lockdown works.')
