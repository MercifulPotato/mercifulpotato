Anything beyond that is technically overclocking, even if it&#x27;s overclocked from the factory and marketed to run at those speeds. Assuming that your platform supports overclocking DRAM, you can also run DDR4-3200 ECC memory at 3600 MT&#x2F;s,  if you feel that the performance uplift is worth the risk of stability issues.')
