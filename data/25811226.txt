Big Tech (which in context is practically shorthand for &quot;Facebook and Twitter&quot; excluding all the rest) didn&#x27;t write the content. They didn&#x27;t even create the groups or channels through which that content is distributed. As the moniker implies, they provided only the tech. In what other context do we blame the tech itself or its makers for how it&#x27;s used? The only example I can think of is guns. Before someone tries to make more of that analogy than it deserves, guns are fairly unique in that their only purpose is to destroy things (even if it&#x27;s for a good reason). Social media clearly have purposes beyond the political (hint: it&#x27;s in the name), let alone beyond the toxic miasma that defines politics today.<p>There are far more examples of <i>not</i> blaming the maker for the use - microphones, TVs, hypodermic needles, cars, etc. Why do we make an exception for <i>one</i> kind of tech? There are answers that are worth discussing and which might inform our responses, but Swisher doesn&#x27;t even try to make one and nor do most who just rush to &quot;solutions&quot; that won&#x27;t actually work.<p><i>Users</i> create the problematic content. They were creating it before &quot;big tech&quot; and will quite likely continue creating it even if they&#x27;re disallowed from using &quot;big tech&quot; products and services. What is achieved, for example, by moving Donald Trump&#x27;s content from Twitter to trumpmaga.com where there&#x27;s <i>no</i> moderation or terms of service to enforce? Would his reach really be reduced that much, at this point? We&#x27;d just get to have the same debate about whether his host or DNS provider or CDN should deplatform him, with even dimmer prospects of an affirmative answer.<p>I&#x27;m not saying tech companies are blameless, by any means, but let&#x27;s blame them for <i>things they themselves do</i> and not for the mere presence of users who create problematic content. That lets the kinds of people who organized the January 6 insurrection attempt off the hook too much, along with many other kinds of miscreants. Going <i>only</i> after the platform providers seems a bit too much like looking for the keys under the lamp-post.')
