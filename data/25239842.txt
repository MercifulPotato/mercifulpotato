The machine was swapping all the time, e.g. when alt-tabbing between Android emulator and Xamarin.<p>After upgrading to 24 GB the machine became very usable.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t ever want to go back to 8 GB. Perhaps 16 GB might be usable for iOS and Xamarin development, especially if the Android emulator can run in some kind of HAXM [0] mode, but for ARM processors ... not sure if that&#x27;s possible right now. I&#x27;m sure the SSD also makes a big difference compared to my Fusion drive right now.<p>Still it feels safer (more future-proof) if the machine has a bit more memory than 16 GB.<p>---<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;intel&#x2F;haxm&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Installation-Instructions-on-Windows" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;intel&#x2F;haxm&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Installation-Instructions...</a>')
