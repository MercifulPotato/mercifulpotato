Resolve doesn&#x27;t offer email support for the free version and the paid version has no trial so I have no way to test if things would get fixed with the studio version.<p>I tested it on Debian (unstable channel at the time), but the same problem happens on Windows too. If I were to try Linux again it would involve setting up a dual boot and maybe trying Arch, or at this point Debian stable maybe (when I tried unstable it was before Buster was available).')
