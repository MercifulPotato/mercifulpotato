In my experience, Intel have a significant performance advantage with their AES-NI implementation over AMD.  I wonder what Ampere&#x27;s cores can do.<p>For some workloads, special things like AES-NI or other optimizations which only Intel (or another vendor) have can make a huge difference in real world performance which generalized benchmarks don&#x27;t cover.')
