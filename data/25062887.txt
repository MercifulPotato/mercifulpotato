Leave it off for whatever amount of time you want to practice for. Same thing goes for the main water shut off. You could leave those two off all weekend and quickly find out what you need. Another good and simple practice run is if you normally drive to get to a local store to plan and execute a route for walking there and back. Vice versa for if you normally walk everywhere, figure out what it would take to drive to a more remote location. Planning and knowing the ground truth of alternate routes is very important in a disaster scenario. For food preparedness you can do something I call the Bean Day exercise, simply don&#x27;t go to the grocery store for an extended period of time and eat only what you have in your fridge, freezer and pantry. You&#x27;ll have to get creative to reach the end, you&#x27;ll realize how quickly you work your way through your stock, and you might discover a whole new set of go-to foods and dishes.')
