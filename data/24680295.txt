Part of the reason is that Walmart has essentially zero interest in building civic infrastructure. They have to just pass health &amp; safety regulations and then they plan to do absolutely nothing more.<p>Public buildings and infrastructure, on the other hand, have other considerations in play. Durability, civic pride, long term safety ...<p>I travel around the US a lot and always marvel at the stuff that was built by&#x2F;during the WPA. It is incredible - absurdly overbuilt by any current standards, but that very fact is at the heart of why they are still standing, still enjoyed, still viable.<p>Nobody will be saying that about any Walmart building in 90 years.')
