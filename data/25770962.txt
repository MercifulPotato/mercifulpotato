They are a strange mix of adventure, history, survival, romance, sailing manual, and comedy.<p>If you like them, also check out the nine book series The Baroque Cycle by Neil Stephenson. It&#x27;s similarly filled with adventure, history, sailing, mining, intrigue, swashbuckling, mathematics, chemistry, science, economics, bloody swordfighting, and cartography. So you know... normal Neil Stephenson books.<p>Also, raise those royal topgallants, what is this, a whaling ship?!')
