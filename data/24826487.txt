Is it really not possible to consistently produce good yields from tightly packed beds with crop rotation on a 1 acre plot [without pesticides&#x2F;herbicides]? I know it wouldn&#x27;t scale up with typical large-scale farming monocultures, but for a mixed family plot?<p>Aside: it seems we&#x27;ve long been able to feed the world (in terms of meeting caloric and nutritional needs) based on American farm capacity alone, it&#x27;s just that nobody wants to pay for it.')
