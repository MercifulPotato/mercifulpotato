It is understandable to think that, if you&#x27;re going to spend a gigantic pile of money on computer equipment, then it needs to be the absolute best computer equipment you can get. I think wanting to squeeze the most value out of your investment could explain why buyers and manufacturers were willing to sacrifice compatibility.')
