They decided to make an offer, but first asked about previous salary. I was reluctant, the manager said something reassuring, and finally I just told him. Context: I was a high-school dropout who&#x27;d just been working at NASA JPL, where the conjunction of government pay grades and my lack of degree meant a salary you&#x27;d laugh at nowadays. Further, I had no real experience with negotiation to help recover from this terrible mistake. So we never got anywhere acceptable from that anchor, and I had to go on to join a different and probably much less educational startup.')
