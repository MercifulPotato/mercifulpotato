How do you keep a cache directory that backs a file with the file if the file system doesn&#x27;t let you put folders &quot;inside&quot; of files?<p>You are worried that if an application has a directory &quot;cache&quot; with files in it, a user will go into that directory and randomly delete the file &quot;cache&#x2F;3F3819A1.dat&quot;, and that might confuse the application.<p>But, suppose instead you had a single file &quot;cache.sqlite&quot;, containing a table &quot;cache&quot; with an &quot;id&quot; column. What&#x27;s to stop a user from opening that file with the sqlite command line tool and running &quot;delete cache where id=&#x27;3F3819A1&#x27;&quot;<p>If a user really wants to muck with your app&#x27;s data by hand, you can&#x27;t stop them. (Unless you go with some DRM-like solution in which your app runs in a secure enclave such as Intel SGX)<p>Whether it is a single file or a directory of files doesn&#x27;t really make a difference')
