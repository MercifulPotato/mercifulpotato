In front-end I mostly code in react, even vanilla JavaScript and know some angular. I have found great zeal in Typescript lately and admire Nextjs too. I would consider myself pretty great in redux-toolkit for advanced state management and managing data in web app.<p>On  back-end I would naturally start with node framework all-loving express, I prefer MongoDB for its rich query mechanism and I am also good with python and Django and SQL databases. I like the docker to handle the deployment and scaling.<p>Thanks')
