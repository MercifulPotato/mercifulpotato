This woman was apparently sucked into Qanon, a cult that targets soldiers &amp; veterans and apparently went from someone who spent more than a decade respecting a strict chain of command in the air force to breaking into the nation’s capitol.<p>While climbing through a window that had the glass smashed out she was shot. Shooting an intruder is like the most protected type of self defense there is, so it’s to be expected when breaking into <i>any</i> building, no? So what happened to make her think this wouldn’t get her killed?<p>That doesn’t make it any less of a tragedy, even more so.
