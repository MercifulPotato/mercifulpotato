Normally, if you fail to prove eligibility, there’s a grace period during which your registrar waits for proof that’s considered acceptable by the registry. I’m not saying that’s what happened here, but that’s what <i>usually</i> happens. You may not be able to use the domain during all or part of that grace period, but you don’t actually lose ownership of the domain until that grace period lapses.')
