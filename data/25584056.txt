The humanists, and the enlightenment. There is some of that in the American constitution (though not quite realised; it&#x27;s not the best example but it is the least unknown around here), and in the successive declarations of human rights, the abolition of slavery, women&#x27;s vote, de-segregation, to name a few. All of this was done, not for revenge or retribution, but because it improved things for some people who were disenfranchised. So, social justice and progress instead of hatred or vengeance.<p>The witch hunts we are seeing are actually from the standard totalitarian playbook, or straight up from Animal Farm. They ape the progressive ideals and turn them into a stick to hit people they don&#x27;t like.')
