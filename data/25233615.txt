Item(by='dnautics', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606520565, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25233542, text='retention is also a problem.  Coming from a place where I gave a shit to a place where I only care about the product, but not in an way tied to my identity, it&#x27;s so much more emotionally liberating.  I check in, do my job, and leave caring to my side-projects.  I was done in by management at the last place (half due to getting the short end of the stick in an necessary reorg, and half due to management incompetence of my new manager), and that is EXHAUSTING.<p>Now, I have competent and organized managers, and they help me push code with high efficiency, which is satisfying, but in a very different way than one that is more tied to my identity.<p>From a management point of view, you really do not want to hire a person who gives a shit if you are a shitty manager, let&#x27;s say top quintile, (statisically, if you are if you are manager, you are), because when that person leaves, and they will, it&#x27;s not going to be any fun for you.')
