I want an internet of specialty sites, browsable curations, diversity of offering, freedom of choice, and full of the quirky&#x2F;unusual. It might have to do with growing up in the 90s and experiencing that kind of world wide web, w&#x2F;o walled gardens.<p>Several years back, perhaps even via an HN post or comment, I came across a blog, hosted on a university network (IIRC, perhaps related to media studies). The page consisted of a group of possibly graduate students contributing some of the weirdest and most obscure media I&#x27;ve ever seen online. Nothing obscene and nothing seemingly new&#x2F;current, so it was rather hipster in that sense, but I kick myself for not having saved the URL.<p>Nothing says I need to use walled gardens or get my news from the big networks, but I often feel I&#x27;m being pointed that way. In the end, I just want something different than what&#x27;s usually being served up.<p>(It doesn&#x27;t escape me that this 90&#x27;s TV site is full of walled garden&#x2F;big network type content of the time)')
