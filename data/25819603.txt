Often they&#x27;ll sell you complex solutions for a non existent problem.<p>Modern life is never calling for bad ideas loudly, but tons of incentives that make you go the wrong way slowly.<p>Bad job -&gt; stress -&gt; comforting with premade meals too tasty due to sugar and additives. No more walking because you want to leverage your car. You delay sleep to work later (bad work practices) to have leisure.<p>When I did simpler but physically demanding jobs, I ate simpler, went to bed early because I was simply cooked but it didn&#x27;t feel like stress, but good fatigue (the kind you have after long swim session).<p>Modern jobs also turn you against each other way too often. I firmly believe there&#x27;s a huge amount of benefits of doing simple chores in team, rather than ruminating in your cubicle delaying answers in mails..')
