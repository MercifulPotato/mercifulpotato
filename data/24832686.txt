By making Uber responsible for the drivers time they need to change their business model to that of a normal taxi service where they have more control over the drivers, since being responsible for something you don&#x27;t have control over isn&#x27;t a position you want to be in. And when they have to work as a normal taxi service then there is no point to Uber, they can&#x27;t survive as a taxi service so they just have to pull out.')
