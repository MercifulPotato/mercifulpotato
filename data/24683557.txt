Sure, some employers might make the assumption that every single employee at Facebook bears responsibility for every single thing Facebook did, none were neutral let alone tried to improve things while there, etc. Most will reject that idea, or the idea that personal morality should be injected into the hiring process. Even among those who subscribe to it, that is likely to be outweighed by the fact that Facebook engineers have experience dealing with a scale and complexity few other employers can match. Facebook engineering has a pretty good reputation (whether one believes it&#x27;s deserved or not) independent of Facebook as a commercial&#x2F;political entity.
