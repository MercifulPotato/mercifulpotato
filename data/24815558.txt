Singapore and large parts of Africa or the ME have seen few deaths. Young populations, low rates of obesity, diabetes and other diseases that probably plague regions like Louisiana will change the outcomes quite drastically.<p>Singapore in particular is probably a high fidelity case. It has one of the highest testing rates on the globe, likely clean data and they&#x27;ve registered 28 deaths on &gt;50k cases.')
