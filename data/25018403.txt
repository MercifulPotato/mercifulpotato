Item(by='p5a0u9l', descendants=None, kids=[25018614, 25018660], score=None, time=1604778629, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25018186, text='&gt; unified Republican elite, along with &gt; 35% of the electorate, is fundamentally lawless and anti-democratic, and will do anything it can to cheat its way into power.<p>This is unnecessary. I am of course relieved that Biden won. I am also appalled by Trump and his enablers in the Republican party. I&#x27;m also extremely disappointed that more people did not clearly repudiate Trumpism.<p>But that 35% of the electorate, which is closer to 48% per Trump vote share, are people and neighbors. This kind of rhetoric only serves to continue the bitter fighting. There may very well be a core of unredeemable, white supremacists behind Trump. But I&#x27;d like to believe that most are misled, misinformed, yet good people. I know my neighbor is one in fact.')
