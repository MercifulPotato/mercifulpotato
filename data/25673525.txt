Since the M1 MacBooks came out, all of a sudden people are talking like every MBP version prior is junk. Top-of-the-line MBP that can&#x27;t run dual monitors? Where were these conversations about poor MBP performance 6 months ago?<p>The 15&#x2F;16&quot; MBP is certainly capable of supporting 4K displays without issue (posting from one now). Most likely some people have something screwed up in their setup and didn&#x27;t realize it until they moved to another system.<p>With the new MacBook Air, they won&#x27;t even know their setup is screwed up because there won&#x27;t be any fan noise. It&#x27;ll just slowly degrade over time.')
