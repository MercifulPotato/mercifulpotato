Item(by='LatteLazy', descendants=None, kids=[25690401], score=None, time=1610138900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25690119, text='Sorry, I should have clarified: I&#x27;m a limey brit so closing our (my) border is almost as easy as it is for the aussies.<p>Similarly, we have no constitution or bill of rights, so a house arrest law is easy and quick to pass.<p>The issue with the .5% figure is that 5% of covid patients would die if they didn&#x27;t receive care. So the death rate is only 0.5% until your last hospital bed &#x2F; ventilators &#x2F; nurse is busy. Then it&#x27;s 5%.<p>We&#x27;ve fucked about letting more and more people get it. Which is fine because 0.5% and because we&#x27;re following the &quot;herd immunity&quot; strategy. Unlike Aus that went for eradication. But now, so many people are sick the hospitals are full.<p>London expects to run out of beds within 2 weeks. Rest of the UK in 3 weeks. Given the 5-6 day incubation period, that means we need to reduce the R number below 1 by Monday in London (where people are densely packed and rely on public transport). You have 7 more days for the rest of the place.<p>Or we accept the 5% marginal death rate. 5% is pretty fucking high.<p>Look around your office, your sports team, your family and fields. Pick 1 in 20 to die. And that&#x27;s 5% across the board. It&#x27;s higher for your grandparents, your sick cousin etc. Plus you have people permanently disabled and &quot;Long Covid&quot; to factor in.<p>So having encouraged people to go out, having let people test the rules and find them unenforced, and having done all the easy cheap shit (office worked wfh), the government finds it has to get very strict, convince people it means it this time, and get them to stay home, all in the next few days.<p>Oh, and the current government was elected by the people most likely to die of this. And the current leader is dumb and lazy. And he&#x27;s spent the last year promising his party no more lockdowns...')
