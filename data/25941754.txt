Anyone being governed should probably be able to voice comply about how they’re being governed. Corporations aren’t some magical thing,and most aren’t the giant entities people imagine.<p>Do I think lobbyists should write legislation? No. Do I think congress should be able to break encryption without ever tech company sending someone to educate them on their stupidity? Also no.<p>I think there are some controls we could put on lobbying but it’s useful.<p>If Congress still allowed floor votes and amendments to bills, lobbying would be far less clandestine and effective. Right now lobbyists just have to target congressional leadership and key committees. Congress in an effort to clamp down on the legislative process and protect its members from controversial ores has made the process more vulnerable.')
