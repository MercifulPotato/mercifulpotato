It makes a few claims of relevance to the description &quot;fake&quot;:<p>1. The videos show plausible cakes and their contents do not need to be debunked.<p>2. The channel is owned -- openly -- by what you might consider a conglomerate which operates about 100 youtube channels.<p>3. This conglomerate&#x27;s website is copied from a web theme example.<p>4. Their various channels offer videos which appear, based on review of the thumbnails, to be repeated across several channels. This contradicts a written policy of YouTube, but not the actual policy. (Which, as stated officially but not publicly by YouTube, allows you to repeat content across multiple channels if you are the owner of the content.)<p>5. On closer inspection, several videos on each individual channel also appear, based on review of the thumbnails, to be repeats.<p>6. On <i>even closer inspection</i>, the contents of a video on one of these channels do not appear to be related to the video&#x27;s thumbnail.<p>7. The conglomerate lists an address in Vietnam. If you look up that address, you can find a building displaying the corporate logo, and they have videos of themselves unboxing the many celebratory buttons they get from YouTube for having so many subscribers.<p>So summing up:<p>A. The video content is not deceptive.<p>B. The people behind the videos operate quite openly and can be found at the location where they say they are.<p>C. They comply with YouTube&#x27;s policies on content repetition, despite some unfortunate wording in YouTube&#x27;s public statement of the policy.<p>D. It is not even obvious that they are repeating content.<p>E. They definitely do use deceptive thumbnails.<p>Why are we calling this &quot;fake&quot;?')
