Reddit is a <i>much</i> different place than it was in 2009. In fact, I think Reddit&#x27;s voting system is precisely why  we see so much manipulation on that platform. It&#x27;s very easy for activists, advertisers, and political partisans to push an artificial consensus using downvotes. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I wanted to share my thoughts on Reddit but then stopped because I knew I&#x27;d be heavily downvoted for going against the grain.')
