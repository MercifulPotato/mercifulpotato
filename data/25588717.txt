China doesn&#x27;t want to be seen as the culprit. It goes against its global ambition.<p>Internally they are heavily pushing the preposterous claim that the virus is of foreign origin, possibly imported via frozen food.<p>Objectively lab origin seems likely. The virus started in the city housing the only P4 laboratory in China. This laboratory is known for its lax security (see the 2018 American embassy cables and the declarations of multiple sources in France who participated in its construction) and research on bat coronavirus transmission to humans were conducted there. You don&#x27;t have to be a conspiracy theorist to wonder if an accident didn&#x27;t happen especially considering that we still can&#x27;t find the missing link which would firmly establish a zoonotic origin.<p>Of course, as China is extremely uncooperative on this question, we will probably never know.')
