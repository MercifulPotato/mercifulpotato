Although satisfaction of the human needs laid out there defy &quot;provision&quot;, they are to be earned and achieved by the person.<p>&gt; Cars, TV, home appliances, and the whole lot of today&#x27;s energy-hungry living isn&#x27;t sustainable, and I&#x27;d argue isn&#x27;t even the thing we should be shooting for.<p>The very things which people invented, and are willing to pay for, to further themselves in the satisfaction of their needs. Which needs are laid out in Maslow&#x27;s theory of motivation.<p>I presume you do realise this. Could you please explain how do you resolve this conflict?<p>A. Provision every human being with <i>complete</i> satisfaction of entire set of needs (bodily, security, society, esteem, knowledge, beauty, self-actualization and transcendence).<p>B. Take away from people, and punish them for having devices which are universally known to affordably address specific and provably existing human needs.<p>How do you propose to do A (at all), and then insist on B?<p>Am I right that you are a communist? Would you like to have a chance to live in the USSR?')
