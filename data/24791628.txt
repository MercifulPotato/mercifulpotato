It&#x27;s true that there might be some fake reviews in there, and that some people are posting in the heat of the moment and will give a biased perspective, but read enough of them and you can get a feeling for common themes that impact certain types of people.<p>Steam is a great example. If you click through to the person who made the review, you can also look at other games they own or other things they reviewed to get a sense the kind of person they are. If they&#x27;re like you, then their review is probably going to be more helpful to you. If they&#x27;re very much NOT like you, then that&#x27;s a useful data point too.<p>I think one of the special challenges with Glassdoor is that reviewers are anonymous, in order to protect them from career-related backlash. This makes it harder to understand if a particular reviewer&#x27;s experience is something that will also affect you. But if you think about it, that is a real indictment of the state of workplace relations - workers are at such a structural disadvantage that they are terrified of sharing candid views about current or even former employers in a way that could come back to bite them.<p>I know i&#x27;ve gone out of my way to try to avoid putting identifying information into Glassdoor, and even toned down some criticism as insurance just in case the employer did figure out who i was. That&#x27;s not a good thing - it only serves to make my review less helpful! This is all the more reason why it&#x27;s so disappointing to me that Glassdoor has openly shifted to be a service focused on corporate branding - employers already had all the power to start with.')
