Nothing to see here.<p>Only the timing seemed rather odd.<p>And of course if I want to use that rationalization, I also have to accept that I live in &quot;Apple ToS land&quot;, which I actually do.<p>Edit: I wonder if apps will start to have vendor specific moderation. Instead of deleting messages, they could just be flagged with &quot;deleted on iOS&quot; or &quot;deleted in China&quot;? I suppose with the China example, they already do that? Certainly news sites already do that, I get &quot;this content is not available in the EU&quot; a lot.')
