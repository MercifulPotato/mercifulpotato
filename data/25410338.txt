Product marketing, sales, and distribution are shared between _all_ businesses so unless you are a marketing, sales, or distribution company I (personally) wouldn&#x27;t consider them part of the core business flywheel.<p>For example, let&#x27;s pretend I have a fictional company that sells a web server.  Marketing, sales, and distribution are all important parts of my business, but my &quot;Core&quot; business is the web server software.  If I am looking to build reinforcing feedback loops that give me an advantage over time (flywheels) it&#x27;s my opinion that you shouldn&#x27;t be looking to build them (at least initially) in marketing, sales, or distribution.')
