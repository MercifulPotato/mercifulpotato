Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[25866006], score=None, time=1611266310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25864698, text='&gt; I am saying the deservedly poor reputation of the NYPost is irrelevant in this case because the reported facts are easy to independently verify. The reputation of a newspaper counts when their reputation is what we must rely on, which is not the case here.<p>That&#x27;s where we disagree.  You&#x27;re saying the the only job of a paper is to report true facts (or at least try its best).  I&#x27;m saying its job is to report true facts <i>and true impressions</i>.  True facts can be used to create false impressions, and the impression created often matters the most, especially when you know your readers aren&#x27;t going to read your story like a careful lawyer.')
