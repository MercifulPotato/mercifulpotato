In the Olympics people are not classified as 1st, 2nd, 3rd until their scores are averaged.  Political elections ought not be any different.  Jumping to cardinality loses a lot of data and is relatively useless for comparing candidates across eras.  Nice diagrams, but I would like to see Score Voting (Range Voting) featured as well.  The hype behind Ranked Choice is strong, even though we would never use such a method to award Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals.')
