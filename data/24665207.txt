Why keep the cow if you can get the milk for free?<p>If someone who can consistently deliver great value to a company is let go, they can go elsewhere and provide their value as a consultant or employee.  You seem to think the company has no competition and doesn&#x27;t need to compete with other businesses in the marketplace. I think you are also overlooking the fact that most interns are hired to see if they will be good to bring on full time. Some of them turn out to not provide substantial value. If an internship is how you are demonstrating your value to an employer, then your contribution is being average across all the interns that don&#x27;t contribute anything or much of anything.')
