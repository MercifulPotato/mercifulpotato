For how long?<p>Let&#x27;s assume the statement is fraudulent. Before the statement was made, Melvin&#x27;s LPs were set to get hosed. Melvin&#x27;s general partners, the ones making the statements, have a lot of egg on their faces. But they didn&#x27;t do anything <i>wrong</i>. They keep their money and houses and yachts. And in all likelihood, after a few months, craft a lessons-learned pitch and raise more money.<p>After the statement, they have engaged in fraud. Not only is criminal prosecution a risk. All those deep-pocketed LPs can now sue the general partners, <i>personally</i>, for breach of fiduciary duty.<p>Add to that the Citadel bailout, which removed the risk of the fund going under, and there is no reasonable explanation for lying about closing out the short. If you wanted to show resilience, you&#x27;d say something like &quot;we&#x27;ve fully hedged our shorts with long-dated puts, reducing our expected profit but capping our losses.&quot;')
