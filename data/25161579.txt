A case which is &quot;asymptomatic&quot; in the study has no noticeable symptoms through the whole course of infection. If you know in advance that you&#x27;re that kind of case, then you&#x27;re less likely to spread the disease. But 94% of cases are not that kind of case, and no test except waiting a couple of weeks can distinguish asymptomatic from pre-symptomatic. Information that&#x27;s not available until 14 days from now can&#x27;t be used to determine who should wear a mask today.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;news-room&#x2F;q-a-detail&#x2F;coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;news-room&#x2F;q-a-detail&#x2F;coronavirus-disease...</a><p>&quot;What is the difference between people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic? Don’t they both mean someone without symptoms?&quot;<p>&quot;Both terms refer to people who do not have symptoms. The difference is that ‘asymptomatic’ refers to people who are infected but never develop any symptoms, while ‘pre-symptomatic’ refers to infected people who have not yet developed symptoms but go on to develop symptoms later.&quot;')
