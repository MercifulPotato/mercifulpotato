It&#x27;s normal to get 6 support reps in a row ask you the same identical question you&#x27;ve already answered 5 times in a single thread they can scroll up to read. Each time you reply, a new rep is assigned the ticket, and they want to maximize throughput so they just use a canned response instead of dealing with the issue. But this is normal. They also ban you by default, assuming, I think, that people who aren&#x27;t legit won&#x27;t appeal, so legitimate merchants need to appeal to bans multiples times just to begin buying ads. They also restrict your account so you can&#x27;t do anything, but they leave the ads running and keep billing you. This bankrupts people who can&#x27;t pause their unprofitable campaigns. My business partner was being billed ten grand daily via a banned&#x2F;restricted account for weeks on end.<p>But this is the game. I&#x27;ve spent millions of dollars on G&#x2F;FB&#x2F;etc and that&#x27;s just how it goes.')
