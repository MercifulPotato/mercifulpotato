Users who have a income based off of activity on social media (and not just sex-workers, but also indie game designers, streamers, social media management folks, etc, etc, etc).<p>You might not think that you want to keep the different &quot;personas&quot; that you have separate on social media, but most people do, and I say this as a person who uses a single username and profile on most social media sites.<p>If you are in the business of designing user facing systems I really hope you take some time to learn about how folks use computer systems and user-centric design.')
