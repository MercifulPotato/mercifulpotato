Or that our notion of what equality is evolves? These are different things, e.g. like the difference between the <i>policing</i> of laws, and changes in the law itself.<p>For the former, then accept a threshold, &quot;reasonable level of equality&quot; such that differences are within the norms of individual diversity. Then equality is achieved.<p>Or focus on &quot;equality of opportunity&quot; which is much simpler to gauge, as it only requires that opportunity be similar e.g. a person covered by fire insurance, whose house burnt down; had the same insurance &quot;opportunity&quot; as someone covered by the same policy whose house didn&#x27;t burn down - same opportunity, if different outcomes.<p>It&#x27;s clear that some I&amp;D initiatives exist because of pre-existing issues. At the very least, some of it depends on the notion of &quot;race&quot;, and that isn&#x27;t guaranteed to exist forever.')
