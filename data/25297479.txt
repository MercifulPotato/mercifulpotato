What was the exact fix? Literally tell me.<p>I&#x27;m not psychic, I can&#x27;t tell you <i>how</i> they fixed it, but you can find a ton of people talking about how redundant sensors would have avoided the same issue.  You could also have it be much more obvious when it&#x27;s adjusting trim, because if the pilots were aware of what was happening they wouldn&#x27;t have crashed either.<p>from your other comment&gt; Saying the control mechanism crashed the plane and just fixing that is like saying you didn&#x27;t put enough duct tape over the real problem.<p>Tape, and the equivalent of tape, is a valid solution to many problems if you have an expert analyze it.')
