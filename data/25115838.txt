As somebody that just defected from OSX to Windows I can tell you that you&#x27;re missing out. Windows became a more stable and usable PC where everything just works. My 2 year old top of the line MBP was replaced by a \n3 year old Dell XPS 13 after 10 years of OSX and I hate to break it to you, but Windows changed.<p>I replaced the MBP since the I had to replace the thinnest keyboard in the world, but I had problems with BT, WiFi, crashes, random external monitor glitches, no support for two external monitors via TB 3.0 (look it up, same hardware works under windows!!). Ask my diehard OSX fan coworker that just had to upgrade OSX just to get wifi working at home. I stayed for Windows since my MBP stopped working a week after I got the keyboard replaced and to be honest I really can&#x27;t bother to move back. Everything just works here.<p>OSX has left the domain of the power user and has been relegated to into the domain of the consumer user that likes the Apple marketing.<p>I am monitoring the situation with ARM CPUS closely and that would be a motivation to switch back, but right now it feels my next computer upgrade will be windows based high end laptop. Better OS and better price performance are hard to argue with.<p>PS: If you&#x27;re a developer and you&#x27;re still clinging to OSX, try it - the whole experience is next level (compared to the whole brew ecosystem). Download WSL for windows, get Ubuntu from windows store and use the Windows Terminal to experience native Ubuntu. Hell if you&#x27;re using VS Code, all you need to do is type &quot;code .&quot; from Ubuntu to open VS Code in Windows and develop in native Linux.')
