Even better if they can also track down organizers - who perhaps weren&#x27;t there - and charge them with racketeering or sedition. It was evil and it needs to be halted.<p>I also think the same thing needs to happen to the antifa flavored anarchists we were witness to throughout the summer. The endless attacks on businesses (big and small), federal buildings, lawlessness, looting, storming police precints, portland city council buildings, and general destruction should also result in as many felonies as possible.<p>Both groups &quot;think&quot; that sheer muscle and raw emotionalism in the street is a legitimate way to bully your preferred changes through. It&#x27;s the same evil mindset and it needs to be called out and punished regardless of what flag they appear to operate under.')
