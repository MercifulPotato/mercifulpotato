First, we show how pirates can use crawling to rebuild BitTorrent search engines just a few hours after they are shut down (crawling for fun).   Second,  we show how content owners can use related techniques to monitor pi-ratesâ€™ behavior in preparation for legal attacks and negate any perceived anonymity of the decentralized BitTorrent architecture (crawling for profit)</i><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;legacy&#x2F;event&#x2F;woot10&#x2F;tech&#x2F;full_papers&#x2F;Wolchok.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;legacy&#x2F;event&#x2F;woot10&#x2F;tech&#x2F;full_papers&#x2F;...</a>')
