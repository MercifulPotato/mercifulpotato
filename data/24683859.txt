(I was a student near the end of Glazer&#x27;s tenure.)<p>As to the latter point, the school has definitely been trending in that direction. In my time, I would wager that around 50% of students had primarily a science interest, 35% had primarily a technology interest, and the remaining 15% had no strong inclination between the two. (From what I have heard, in more recent classes the tech has become more popular than the other sciences.)<p>At the end of the day, though, as long as the curriculum still requires sci-tech rigor, it&#x27;s entirely beneficial that the school also have strong humanities and arts programs. 13 year olds are applying to this school, and people&#x27;s interests change throughout high school in unpredictable ways.')
