They call it externalized services where I work.<p>Tbh if the company where I am would pay the same no matter where you&#x27;re located I&#x27;d go live in a flat Bucharest for 1&#x2F;3 of the cost I have now and probably buy 10 2 bedroom flats there in 10 years and then retire. If my wife would be able to do the same we&#x27;d retire in 6-7 years tops.<p>OR<p>If I still have to be in the same country I could leave the London area and move up north for a fraction of the cost.')
