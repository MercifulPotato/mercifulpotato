Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=[25468275], score=None, time=1608304641, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25467353, text='I&#x27;m enjoying the game too and I was defending it in a thread the other day. but now that I&#x27;ve gotten past the intro arc, I&#x27;m noticing a lot more issues. mostly just little stuff like NPCs warping around in the background, a suitcase levitating in place when it should be in jackie&#x27;s hand, objects clipping through walls that can&#x27;t be picked up. doesn&#x27;t break the game, but it does take away from the immersion.<p>I did encounter one more serious issue. there&#x27;s an early main story mission where you have to get a key off the body of a guard you just killed. unfortunately, I killed the guy while he was standing in an elevator. his body fell through the floor and (presumably) out of the map. at least the game managed to showed me a waypoint to his body, 1 km below my feet. this just seems like bad judgement by the devs. if you have to have moveable ragdolls, please don&#x27;t put items on them that I need to advance the game. stuff like this will inevitably happen.<p>anyways, I&#x27;m still enjoying the game but I&#x27;m debating whether to shelve it for a month or two while they patch more bugs.')
