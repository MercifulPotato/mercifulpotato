The net result was the shutdown procedure for the server does not complete. As far as I can tell, this is a bit inherent to Kubernetes: it wants to be high-available and doesn&#x27;t like shutting down the last node in the cluster, which is what a home server is.<p>Edit to add:<p>I&#x27;m having great fun with Podman instead. I don&#x27;t need all the orchestration stuff or the autoscaling: one of each service is fine for a home server. Systemd can be the supervisor. I did a little fiddling to get service discovery with dynamic DNS, this could be improved. Using static routes on the router, I can route right into the right container network. This too could be improved: with IPv6 prefix delegation I could potentially route into the container from anywhere in the world.')
