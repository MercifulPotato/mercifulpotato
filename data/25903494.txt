Interesting. I&#x27;ve read that most of the false negative for a PCR test actually come from sample collection (makes sense, PCR is super reliable) so it could be that you would miss people with high viral load where the sample was just not taken in a perfect way. Especially early in the infection it could be quite localized.')
