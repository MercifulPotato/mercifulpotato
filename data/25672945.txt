Just because no police&#x2F;staff were harmed doesn&#x27;t make it ok - after all, destruction of federal property and buildings carries a potential 10 year imprisonment penalty.<p>So not only he&#x27;s encouraging criminal actions, but after these actions occurs he tells these criminals that he loves them. And yes, tells them to go home - great, but that&#x27;s not a redeeming factor here.<p>So......is it still not clear why he&#x27;s banned?')
