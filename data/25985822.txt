If you are thinking about taking it out now, are you really sure you&#x27;ll be able to stay in when the market drops 40%? If not, better to cut your losses now, reduce your equity holdings, and probably find someone to manage your money for you.<p>I self manage for the most part, but I also have at least some discipline and an awareness that the market could drop at any given time. It&#x27;s only over the 5 year plus time horizon that I actually expect to make money.')
