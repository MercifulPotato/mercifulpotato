For some, finishing the mountain without having to overnight on or near it is more convenient, but others might overnight so they can go faster on summit day without getting altitude sickness.<p>Side note (I&#x27;m not saying this applies to above comment): I&#x27;d caution anyone to take 12,000 feet seriously, it&#x27;s a serious altitude and you want to think in terms of turnaround times and eventualities, not &quot;I&#x27;m getting to the top no matter what&quot;.')
