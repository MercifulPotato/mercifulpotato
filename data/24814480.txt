Firstly I couldn’t figure out what CircleUp actually does as a “tech startup” from reading their website.<p>On further reading they used to do something (a marketplace to connect investors and consumer companies needing funding) but they pivoted into being a plain old investment company (ie what the founders used to do themselves).<p>They make some very dubious claims about using machine learning, what huge dataset are they pulling from when the pool of companies is tiny and their marketplace doesn’t exist anymore?<p>How is a VC meant to get VC returns from a company that is itself simply raising money and investing it in early stage companies.<p>This feels like clever self marketing (tech founder vs financiers!) when really it’s a pissing match between VCs')
