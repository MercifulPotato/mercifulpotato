What makes you think TCF can be so easily pushed out or that the other founder has significantly more leverage? It isn&#x27;t clear to me that they have different deals.<p>Honestly, if non-technical thought he could fire this guy, he probably would have already. That&#x27;s why TCF is being bullied into resigning.<p>What is non-technical going to tell the investors when he fires the guy who keeps everything running, built everything, and did all the SEO?<p>Think of it this way, take the deal and you get 3% of nothing because it&#x27;ll get driven into the ground.<p>Don&#x27;t take the deal and either you keep working on it, and get 40+% of something decent, or you get N% of nothing because other guy drives it into the ground but you got a better buyout.<p>There&#x27;s very little downside for TCF in actually sticking to his guns, and it&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s going to look like the asshole here.')
