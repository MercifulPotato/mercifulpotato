I was trying to appeal to others experiences of Austin when mentioning conferences. I assume more people visit than live there on this site. For me, Austin would be pretty awful to live in year in and out by comparison to Silicon Valley even with having to wear N95 masks during fire season.<p>Also just wait for Analog Devices to buy Cirrus and relocate them back to SV.
