New sessions from a source IP which shows elevated rates could be dropped X-1&#x2F;X times (e.g. X=5) because a legitimate client will retry and obtain an STK in, on average, X attempts.<p>Firewalls can&#x27;t block this because then you introduce a denial of service vector. If I can block anyone on the Internet from accessing a CDN because the CDN&#x27;s firewall blocks the source IP... this is why this isn&#x27;t a solution for dns and other udp protocols, either. Otherwise we&#x27;d block offenders and be done with the problem of amplified DDoS attacks really quickly.')
