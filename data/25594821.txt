Made it boring. Then I got a math teacher who was a guy with deep voice. Dude talked too much political stuff but he taught too good, it was like he had my attention. I didn&#x27;t even study for the exam except for the last 10 minutes and aced it, his lectures were enough, I got everything in a single class, no revision. We used to have internationally accredited exams and everyone taught by him used to do well for some reason.<p>Before him I didn&#x27;t care about math at all. I only learn when it&#x27;s a guy teaching me for some reason. I can&#x27;t focus on a woman if she&#x27;s teaching, I get bored and started thinking about what to app to make.<p>But not every guy teacher was the one I could focus on. He was the guy with the deepest voice, for some reason it didn&#x27;t let my attention drift away.<p>Before that, I sucked in Chemistry, until some guy taught me. I don&#x27;t know how that worked but did.<p>Then some guy taught me physics but his voice wasn&#x27;t manly, and I started sucking at physics after that.<p>So I&#x27;d say as a guy, I was almost always better taught by men. Women (young or middle aged) bored me away from the subject. And that used to reflect in the batch performance for almost every guy.<p>Girls weren&#x27;t impacted by it at all. They got good grades either ways man or woman.<p>I realize now how horrible it all sounds, but trust me I tried.')
