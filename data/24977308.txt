Item(by='brigandish', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604388767, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24974349, text='I suppose I&#x27;m destined to wander around my small(er than most other places in the world) Japanese flat, with fittings made for someone much shorter than I am even though I&#x27;m average height in my own country, and ponder on the existence of downvotes for a fairly innocuous musing.<p>Perhaps I should leave comments like &quot;Japanese people just like things smaller because when I was there everything was so small&quot; and not notice that they have a lack of space and are on average, smaller, hence the <i>need</i> for space saving measures and smaller fittings, or is that just one more, in my opinion, fairly innocuous musing that must not be stated… maybe it&#x27;s just me?
