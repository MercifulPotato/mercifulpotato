It&#x27;s a free interpretation license card.<p>I think out-of-context interpretation is the major issue of our times: we got used to the idea that it&#x27;s perfectly fine to report the most damning combination of words in a sentence as if it were the original full sentence; that a joke made on twitter is the same as a political manifesto sent to the press; and that a hand gesture can get the meaning it would have in its worst possible case. This has to stop.')
