To some extent. Other demonstrations <i>did</i> have such flags.<p>This is an example of a more general pattern that&#x27;s been bothering me recently. It seems like a contradiction to claim that something is a heinous offense, while simultaneously claiming it doesn&#x27;t matter whether a given person or entity is really guilty or not. This is saying that guilt is and isn&#x27;t important at the same time.')
