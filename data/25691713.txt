Inside the building, when they are about to breach the chambers of congress -and- there are legislators inside, I support the use of deadly force.  When they attack democracy, they are attacking all of us.  And I don&#x27;t care what their ideology is.<p>If the building is empty, then I think deadly force is unwarranted.')
