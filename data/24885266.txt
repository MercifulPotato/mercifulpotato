You can certainly accuse them of not having tried hard to translate it to simpler language, but it&#x27;s an unwarranted accusation to say they&#x27;re &quot;trying very hard to sound smart&quot; when they&#x27;re using language that is similar to their own thought processes, and hence is probably easier to write in.<p>Reminds me of a scene in &quot;I, Robot&quot; (the movie):<p>Del Spooner: So, Dr. Calvin, what exactly do you do around here?<p>Dr. Susan Calvin: My general fields are advanced robotics and psychiatry. Although, I specialize in hardware-to-wetware interfaces in an effort to advance U.S.R.&#x27;s robotic anthropomorphization program.<p>Del Spooner: So, what exactly do you do around here?<p>Dr. Susan Calvin: I make the robots seem more human.<p>Del Spooner: Now wasn&#x27;t that easier to say?<p>Dr. Susan Calvin: Not really. No.')
