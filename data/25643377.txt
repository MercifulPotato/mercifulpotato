I&#x27;m in a part of the UK using copper laid in the 1950s, my maximum speed with VDSL is about 30mbit. Upload struggles to beat 5mbit. For that I pay £30&#x2F;month.<p>4G is a little better, I recently got a contract for £37&#x2F;month and can get 35&#x2F;10mbit down&#x2F;up.<p>Incredible to think that I pay quadruple what you do for an inferior service.')
