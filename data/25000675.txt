The fact is, NAT still exists and will for a long time. It&#x27;s so commonplace that almost every house and office in the modern world that has internet uses a NAT gateway. People <i>generally</i> understand what a LAN is and can differentiate between a LAN and a WAN (or &quot;the internet&quot;). Even high school kids can set up LAN parties with little difficulty.<p>Telling people that &quot;Hey, all that stuff you&#x27;ve know about the internet, well, it&#x27;s still going to exist, but also we are going to throw a new standard on top of it that is suuuuper non-intuitive to work with but it makes things awesomer because, just take my word for it!! If you don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;re just closed minded&quot; is extremely closed minded...<p>Also, try telling your friend over the phone, &quot;The IP for my Minecraft server is ff01:119c:19f9:aaaa:8ade: NO 8a DEEE EEE. Not C E... Ugh....nevermind&quot;<p>IPv6 <i>is</i> awesome in many ways, but it comes with a lot of frustrations to work with. Which I believe the author covered pretty well.')
