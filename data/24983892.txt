One potential benefit is that you can run fuel cells, which are silent and quite a bit more efficient than a two-stroke driving a generator. OTOH, getting similar energy density is challenging, as others have said. Although you can come quite close with liquid hydrogen, if you can live with a fuel that&#x27;s not storable for long times at small quantities in the field.')
