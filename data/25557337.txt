Compilers as far as I know are made to generate code for different extensions. The CPU also contains registers to check what extensions are present.<p>ARM is what it is because license holders are required to implement the whole ISA. RISC-V is kind of the opposite. You are required to assume extensions are optional.<p>And OS is supposed to trap instructions not implemented and jump to a software emulation of them.<p>I don’t know all the details. But the point is they are planning for this from the start and building their tools around this. That was never the case for ARM or x86. Hence it is premature to assume it will end up the same.')
