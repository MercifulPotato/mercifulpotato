I know just as many people who don&#x27;t use those in the React world. IMO what React did was push forward the single data flow paradigm.<p>What should a developer do that needs to share state across a Forgo app?<p>It would be awesome if browsers just had a real template language like JSX, we&#x27;d see more &quot;web components&quot; which are just a little bit of JSX&#x2F;or whatever templates and some DOM APIs. Developers are tired of managing binding and unbinding events. React does that well. I assume Fargo does too.<p>So putting aside the redux&#x2F;flux paradigm, what else is the real hurdle being solved?')
