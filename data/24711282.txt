It seems reasonableâ€”if Google was explicitly trying to enable compatibility, that should be allowed, whereas if they were just trying to save a buck, that should be illegal.<p>Of course, in reality Google&#x27;s decision was probably a little of both, right? They selected a technology based on a wide range of factors, including development costs <i>and</i> compatibility.<p>I&#x27;m still concerned that a decision in Oracle&#x27;s favor would have a massive chilling effect on everyone else. All companies want to limit their potential liabilities. How can you prove in advance that you selected a language or API for the sake of compatibility, even when that is in fact the driving factor?')
