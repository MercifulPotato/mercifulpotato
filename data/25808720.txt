So, if the party fails to convince you when it changes, you stop being a party member rather than become a dissenter on the one issue.<p>That&#x27;s less true for religions (especially religions with certain features: you aren&#x27;t going to find a Church like the Roman Catholic Church <i>including</i> it&#x27;s view of the papacy and it&#x27;s historical descent, but differing on the moral parameters of abortion.)<p>It&#x27;s also less true of parties in a system which isn&#x27;t a robust multiparty democracy, which is why both major parties in the US system are big tent parties with stark internal divisions that sometimes try to paper over them to present a united front.')
