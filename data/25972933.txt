If they stopped both buying and selling then GME would not have dropped the way it did.<p>RH CEO’s denial said they made the move to protect the firm and their customers, but blocking buying and selling would’ve given them the protections without the risk of causing a change in the price. So it’s hard to believe that RH’s intent was anything but pushing the price of GME down to cover their customer’s short position.')
