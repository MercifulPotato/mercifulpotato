The buffer can be freed when they burn or rot, both of which happen naturally.<p>The best way to permanently take away CO2 from the atmosphere is to cut off the trees and somehow store them where the CO2 cannot escape (and to free space for new trees to grow). Some of the carbon from dead plants is stored in the soils, but this takes a lot of time to do.<p>In the long run biofuels + carbon capture can be carbon negative.')
