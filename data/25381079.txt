For example, if Facebook violates Apple’s privacy policy now they can’t be on iOS. In a world of multiple stores Facebook can just move themselves to a 3rd party store. The current set up makes it so that Facebook is available AND they are limited in how much information they can siphon off from you.<p>If it becomes the norm to use app stores that enforce no standards, then a lot of the privacy protections for using iOS will be gone.')
