If It goes the way of unreal engine model. that would be great. projects not generating revenue will use the product, and projects with revenue will fund for development. everyone wins. and if you wanna see source code, you pony up some cash. I&#x27;m not too hung up on seeing the code, but rather would&#x27;ve something that works and performs. reason, linux lags behind on desktop is cause usability is not given priority, but code being open source is.')
