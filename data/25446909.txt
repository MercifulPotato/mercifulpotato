The work certainly pays better than a grad student stipend. I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to entry level &quot;science&quot; jobs that are basically manual factory work such as transferring liquids from one tray to another using a pipette.<p>The good thing is that public universities tend to post jobs with salary ranges, so you can get an idea of what labs are looking for what, at what pay rate. The pay tends to follow the expectation of having a somewhat less competitive and intensive work environment, more flexible hours, etc.')
