The economy has moved forwards. People either moved to cities and upskilled (hence the hate for a mysterious metropolitan &quot;elite&quot;) or they sat in rust belt towns complaining their disability cheque is late again and worrying someone poorer than them might get the money instead.<p>That&#x27;s Trumps whole platform really. That&#x27;s where the racism fits in. That is all the bs about draining swamps and elites. That&#x27;s &quot;make America great again&quot;. That&#x27;s rolling back climate change rules (even the tiny ones the US actually has). Bolt on anti-abortion single issue voters and tax cuts for trillionaires to keep the senate on side.<p>This whole thing is what happens when you have 25 years of social and economic progress and people get left behind and refuse to make any effort to catch up...')
