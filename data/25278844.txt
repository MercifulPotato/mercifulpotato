As shown in the below chart, by adding somewhere between 5 and 50 additional peptides to a particular dose, the team says that preliminary tests show that they improved the vaccine’s effectiveness to nearly 100 percent in all populations.<p>Is adding peptides to a vaccine something that has been done before, or is this new? And how do you add peptides to a vaccine?')
