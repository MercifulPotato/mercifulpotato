First of all, this is for the 2 doses 4 weeks apart regime, there is already some evidence to suggest that a 1.5 dosing regime results in a higher efficacy, along with other evidence about a theoretical 3 month wait time between the two doses for a higher efficacy rate.<p>Secondly, this vaccine already prevents hospitalisation and severe illness! That&#x27;s already a game-changer in and of itself. If you vaccinate the 20m or so who are the most vulnerable to COVID-19 and the most likely to require hospitalisation, then you immediately solve the hospitals-may-be-overflowing problem out of the pandemic (which is the only reason we go into lockdown in the first place). This will allow life to return to normal!')
