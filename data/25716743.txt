I don&#x27;t believe comparing this to deplatforming from the internet is a good faith argument.<p>Without getting into the point of the conversation[1], taking the most extreme interpretation of someone else&#x27;s words and argue against that would be the no good faith argument in this case, IMO. The HN guidelines encourage to steelman the other person&#x27;s point and argue against that; you seem to have done the opposite.<p>In other words, the other person didn&#x27;t argue that removing access to social media was akin to killing you (like it would be for a few people if they didn&#x27;t have access to electricity), but that it would be a huge inconvenience (like it would be for most people if they lost access to electricity).<p>[1]: I&#x27;m starting to not see the point in discussing the merits of free speech or what constitutes free speech or censorship. I believe free speech is fundamental, and for that reason it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s prerogative to think otherwise. Getting into that discussion at all is also a bit ironic.')
