This wasn&#x27;t just an idea, but an implementation.<p>The same thing might make sense as a value-added feature in a more comprehensive health service (so the &quot;idea&quot; might be good when put in that use).<p>But as an idea for a service based entirely on it, it failed hard. What exactly twist do you have in mind to save it? Or are you just saying &quot;we&#x27;ll never be sure&quot; with more words?')
