C# wins these comparisons easily.<p>I haven&#x27;t found a comparison of JVM vs CLR GC but I know the .NET team has intended to introduce a ZGC style collector for a while.<p>The need is not as severe in CLR because it produces less garbage.<p>But CLR stop the world pauses are long and it&#x27;s definitely a problem for some uses cases. Many companies focus on their P99 latency these days and a 1 second GC pause will ruin those metrics. And stuff like HFT just can&#x27;t be done in C# without turning GC off')
