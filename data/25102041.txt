I used to come across unmaintained projects that I&#x27;d be willing to merge some PRs for (they&#x27;d usually have them pile up), that&#x27;s how I came up with the idea.<p>I think most people expect that they&#x27;d add their project and get immediate help, when the project is more a backup plan to straight up abandoning a project. I think you&#x27;re the first person other than me to get excited by it, so thanks!')
