Moreover, you&#x27;re looking at this with a clearly US-centric perspective, in many other countries we don&#x27;t need to know about retirement schemes, school loans and health insurance policies (you seem to have forgotten that insurance IS finance, but this might be just another example of the reason why this is hairy).<p>So, if tomorrow all of this changes, you&#x27;ll have millions of people with really useless knowledge. And who changes these things? Politics. This is politics. Won&#x27;t it be better that people learn about politics, philosophy and history so that they have the tools they need to actually understand and change the world around them?')
