Only way to get them constantly going manually is <i>A SWIPE</i>  and button press in a <i>moving</i> car when visibility has already dropped.<p>That&#x27;s just two of the worst, I won&#x27;t go into the problem with their new UI (last big update) which has completely ruining the minimal ergonomics that existed for figuring out your speed&#x2F;regen&#x2F;etc.')
