Practice interjecting, and if other people are talking over your interjection, just keep talking until everyone shuts it. It will feel uncomfortable for you, but it&#x27;s an important skill to have.<p>2. Is there some kind of a leader in these meetings? As a PM, I was often facilitator of discussions, and I would make sure to engage the smart but quiet types. I&#x27;d always talk to them about it first so as not to make them uncomfortable, and we could decide on what&#x27;s best - maybe they make eye contact when they want me to interrupt on their behalf and ask their opinion, maybe I just ask them what they think at some point during each new topic we&#x27;re discussing, or maybe they Slack me when they have something to say (this works well during Zoom&#x2F;conf calls). Sometimes I talk to them for five minutes before the meeting to understand their general thoughts&#x2F;questions about the topics at hand, so I know when to ask for their opinion. If there&#x27;s anyone playing a formal or informal facilitator role, talk to them about this and work out a way they can make sure you&#x27;re included.<p>3. If there&#x27;s no facilitator but you&#x27;re comfortable with some or all of the people in the room, talk to the people you&#x27;re comfortable with at some point casually and mention that you find it tough to break into group discussions. There&#x27;s a strong likelihood they don&#x27;t even realize they&#x27;re keeping you out of things, and when they do, they&#x27;ll consciously try to include you. I come from a family of interrupters - none of us mean it rudely, and because we all do it equally at home, it&#x27;s totally fine. When you put me in a room with non-interrupters, I make a very conscious effort to shut the hell up and let others talk even when I have something to say.<p>4. If none of these work, try communicating your thoughts outside of the meeting. If you have something important to contribute on a topic that&#x27;s going to come up, just casually bring it up with other folks who are going to be there beforehand. Alternatively, send a follow-up email afterwards that opens with something like &quot;Hey guys, I had a couple of thoughts I didn&#x27;t get a chance to mention in the meeting because we ran out of time...&quot;<p>But seriously, I do stress as someone whose natural instinct is to interject constantly that a lot of people who are like me either don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s a problem or do but have trouble controlling it. I&#x27;d never take offense if someone pulled me aside and pointed out that it&#x27;s causing an issue.')
