And employees who aren&#x27;t very good at their job.<p>Yet Slack isn&#x27;t really the answer.  Frankly, Slack is inept management&#x27;s attempt to fix their own, and employee&#x27;s, shortcomings.<p>Having a new on-board use some search function on Slack, to look through 100s of hours of conversation for &quot;random important things&quot;, isn&#x27;t going to fix that.  Nor will people sifting through that junk, help when some bonehead didn&#x27;t backup, or document key vital parts of a config.  Or code.<p>If it&#x27;s important, it needs to be documented.  Not be stuck in a deluge of endless blather, random docs, zero real version control, the list goes on.<p>Ah well.')
