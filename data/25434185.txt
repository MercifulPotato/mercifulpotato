If you believe that our society is irredeemably racist, then a vanilla reputation system will optimize for racism. Basically, the reputation system can&#x27;t dictate what is valid--that has to be determined outside of the reputation system. In other words, set a clear, objective standard for &quot;valid&quot; content and use a reputation system that holds moderators accountable to that external definition of &quot;validity&quot;.')
