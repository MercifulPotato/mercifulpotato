Item(by='dalbasal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606663604, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25245026, text='We have long reached the point where, if we want to keep making analogies between social media and analogue media (pun intended), then we need to compare social media to a publication with an editor.<p>Demonetization, age-gating, recommendation engines, bans, shadowbans and their subtler varieties are many-2-many media&#x27;s equivalent of an editor. Every one impacts the distribution of a video on youtube. Every one of these also impacts what content gets made&#x2F;posted, because views are like currency.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s algorithmic, and it doesn&#x27;t matter if there are other reasons  for (eg) demonetisation to exist. It&#x27;s still an editor. You need to make the editor happy to succeed on youtube. The single difference between an editor and a censor is scale. If you edit all the magazines, magazines are censored.<p>The innocuous type example for censorship is (as usual) pornography. IDK what the consequences of posting pornography and its juniors (nudity, etc) on youtube, but they&#x27;re obviously sufficient to make youtube mostly nudity free. It&#x27;s not because no one wants raunchy videos. The same toolkit can be used (and is) to make any kind of content more or less prevalent on youtube.<p>It&#x27;s funny that &quot;section 230&quot; is being mentioned by so many under informed politicians and pundits. Changing 230 is unlikely to &quot;fix&quot; the problem, considering that most politicians obviously don&#x27;t even understand the problem. But section 230 at least captures the main part of the problem. Youtube is not &quot;dumb pipes.&quot; Youtube is a content business, and they have a lot of control over content. It&#x27;s not direct, &quot;delete this segment&quot; control like they have at FOX, but it is editing nonetheless. At youtube, twitter or FB scale, editing is censorship.')
