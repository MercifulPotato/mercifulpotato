The article explains this nicely.  (I thought of 2&#x27;s complement when reasoning through this, but you don&#x27;t actually need to assume 2&#x27;s complement to follow the reasoning).<p>So, `-n % n` computes `(MAX - n + 1) % n` efficiently, without needing to worry about corner cases.<p>I suspect this is useful when you want to generate random numbers with a limited range, where the range doesn&#x27;t cleanly divide UINT_MAX.  You need to cut a bit off the top from your underlying random number generator.')
