Can&#x27;t get much simpler than a CC.<p>The Wheel as a strategy doesn&#x27;t scale well, though.  A good stock for the wheel has relatively low volatility, but with high volume of option interest.  These two things are kind of opposed to each other, though.  If a stock isn&#x27;t very volatile, then there isn&#x27;t much need for large option interest.<p>Of course there is a lot of overlap where things get interesting.<p>I think the reason why there aren&#x27;t a lot of institutions running the wheel et. large. is because it just can&#x27;t work at the scale they want to operate on.  You can probably run the wheel pretty successfully at a million in capital (much larger than I&#x27;m used to), but at 10, 100, or 1 billion, it just doesn&#x27;t work.<p>And what are they going to do? Pay some guy 200K to generate maybe 200K on a million in capital?')
