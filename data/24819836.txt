Item(by='bserge', descendants=None, kids=[24819922], score=None, time=1603044389, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24819749, text='I really hope that works for already functioning small business, because I did write and apply everywhere I could.<p>I have a British friend who would work with me on this idea of an appliance reuse&#x2F;recycling factory in NRW (because it&#x27;s the closest state to the best suppliers from FR&#x2F;DE&#x2F;BE&#x2F;NL). We&#x27;ve done the research, there&#x27;s little competition and we could be profitable within a year.<p>To summarize the idea: take broken&#x2F;used&#x2F;returned electronics like washers, fridges, dishwashers, dryers, TVs, laptops, smartphones. Fix whatever can be fixed and sell as refurbished, break down the rest and sell for parts and scrap.<p>Seems simple? That&#x27;s because it is, at least the basic idea. The hard parts are securing suppliers and selling everything for a profit. But we believe it can be done, because there&#x27;s a huge market for refurbs, and especially <i>spare parts</i>.<p>There&#x27;s a myriad of small repair shops all over EU that are starved for parts. I used to get them for cheap from my previous employer and sell them at a profit. I <i>never</i> had enough parts to satisfy the demand.<p>The UK has several big companies and a whole lot of small ones. Mainland EU is lacking, there&#x27;s a few big recyclers in the Netherlands, everywhere else it&#x27;s just small companies that don&#x27;t seem to aim for scale.<p>I could publish the business plan if anyone&#x27;s interested. At this point, I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s me or anyone else who does it. But it has to aim for scale, it&#x27;s a must have for the environment.')
