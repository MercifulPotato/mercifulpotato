Confidence in their Prophet was not misplaced. Between 1829 and 1836, under the supervision of Joseph Smith, many early Mormon converts enjoyed heavenly visions and spiritual raptures.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;It appears that soon after the Church was organized in New York and later in Ohio, members partook of wine in sacrament meetings which occasioned visionary states and strange behaviors not typically associated with alcohol consumption or intoxication...&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;However, after Joseph’s death in 1844, the great visionary period of Church history came to an end. ... So stark was the dearth of visionary experience that in 1864, twenty years after Joseph Smith’s death, members would ask Mormon Apostle George A.
