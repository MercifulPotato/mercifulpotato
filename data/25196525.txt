And somewhere along the way, I learned that a lot of elementary school teachers are <i>women</i> who weren&#x27;t doing well in math and got encouraged to go become an elementary school teacher because, basically, sexism is alive and well and the world goes &quot;Oh, I know what a woman who can&#x27;t cut it in college is qualified for: Dealing with small kids all day!&quot;<p>So a lot of elementary school teachers are women who suck at math and were also never told &#x27;Get over it and get a degree you want.&#x27; Instead, they were told &#x27;Oh, go teach kiddies. That&#x27;s what you are qualified for.&#x27;<p>And I know this is a gender difference in terms of the world treating men and women differently -- a social difference, not a biological one -- because I&#x27;m a woman who is good at math (or was at one time) and was married to a man who was terrible at it. No one ever told him (a career soldier) &quot;Oh, go become an elementary school teacher!&quot;<p>Instead, he got his wife to tutor him in college math even though he found it so difficult he threw his pencil across the room one day when I showed him the right way to do it and then I told him &quot;You can be nice or go find another tutor.&quot;')
