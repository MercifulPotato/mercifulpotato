From what I understand, the funding for that is drying up very soon, which is really unfortunate.  Supposedly the plan is to get people into more permanent housing, but I can&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s going to happen on such a short time scale, so I expect that sadly many of the people in hotels now will end up back on the street.<p>Since you mention that some people in your area have managed to get themselves into a better situation just because they&#x27;d been housed for a bit, I wonder if that&#x27;s true for any number of people here.  But I&#x27;m also afraid that any gains will be quickly erased with our new lockdown that&#x27;s going into effect Sunday night (which essentially winds us back to March with most businesses closed0, which could take away any newly-found jobs.')
