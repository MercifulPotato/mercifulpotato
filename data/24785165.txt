We caught those accounts months ago and their patterns were within the range we understand.<p>I haven&#x27;t had a chance yet to look at Troy&#x27;s latest report to see if there&#x27;s more that needs cleaning up, but that&#x27;s a question of inbox load, not smartness.<p>Edit: it would be interesting if anyone found recent submissions by these accounts that made HN&#x27;s front page. If anyone does, please let me know at hn@ycombinator.com because I&#x27;d like to look at whether and why we missed something. HN has anti-abuse measures that do not show up publicly (because we don&#x27;t want abusers to observe it) that ought to have prevented most if not all of that.')
