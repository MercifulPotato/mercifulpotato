Item(by='LukasReschke', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607989063, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25424717, text='&gt; So what do you think is going on in this piece (5 years old), where Alex Stamos characterizes the issue as &quot;trivial and of little value&quot;?<p>I sadly wasn&#x27;t there at the time, and Stamos post doesn&#x27;t refer to it at all. So I can&#x27;t comment on this.<p>I guess the truth on this is just known to the researcher, their boss, and Stamos.<p>&gt; But what I&#x27;m describing above are ways for the company to screw the researcher without really being motivated by stinginess. Fairness is not a concern.<p>That&#x27;s a fair point, and I can see how representation can cause a significantly different payout decision, especially if there is no technical payout panel with a security background.<p>Phrasing something as &quot;Reflected XSS&quot; vs. &quot;Account Take-Over via XSS&quot; sounds undoubtedly different. But it is impact-wise probably the same.<p>The problem is mitigated at Facebook by having engineers in the payout panel that understand the tech stack and security implications. But I think many companies don&#x27;t have that luxury, and you undoubtedly may end up with inconsistencies.<p>Thanks for sharing your perspective. Much appreciated!')
