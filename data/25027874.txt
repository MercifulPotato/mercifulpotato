DaVinci was originally developped 30 years ago on very expensive SGI hardware, with very expensive dedicated controller hardware.<p>Back then and for many years, DaVinci booth was a must-see both at NAB Las Vegas and IBC Amsterdam. You could see the marvels or real time color correction using more than $300k of RealityEngine Onyxes and huge gleaming control panels that looked like they just fell from the starship Enterprise.<p>They switched to Linux in the early 2000s and made Windows&#x2F;Mac versions. The software and controller hardware remained horrendously expensive, though.<p>The high price of the software made the rare people who were proficient with it stars in the cinema industry, high-flyers that grabbed big money and drove expensive cars on Hollywood boulevard.<p>BlackMagic has been the bane of high-end boutique hardware makers for a long time. Apparently at some point they planned to buy 3 or 4 DaVinci Resolve complete systems for some project. Then they realised that they could buy the whole company (a very low volume company indeed) instead for about the same price.<p>Since then, they made (as they usually do) the software and hardware less and less expensive every year, until they completely broke the market: for the past five years or so you&#x27;ve been able to hire color grading experts working from their room in India on the net. Hollywood specialists aren&#x27;t amused.')
