Item(by='jiggawatts', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605957019, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25153133, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t want this to sound like a criticism, but I would like to understand your point of view: do you really consider this a reason for choosing a language over any other?<p>Absolutely yes.<p>I no longer consider a programming language finished unless it has <i>at least</i> tab-complete and proper debugging support. Inline popup doc-comments are nearly mandatory too.<p>Not designing a new language <i>for</i> modern tooling is a cardinal sin. It&#x27;s giving up decades of progress for... what exactly? Some sort of ascetic purity?<p>One disappointing design aspect of Rust specifically is that it has a tendency to &quot;hide&quot; functions unless explicitly imported. This makes things difficult for IDE tab-completion. It gives the false impression that some functions are <i>missing</i>, when in fact they were simply not imported into scope.<p>The language seems to be designed for developers that know <i>ahead of time</i> what they will or will not use, to the finest detail, before they even start typing code.<p>I&#x27;ve only ever met one programmer that could do that: start at the top of the file and type continuously, left-to-right and top-to-bottom without editing, without pause, without having to go back and fill in anything he had missed. Let&#x27;s just say he was a &quot;special sort&quot; and leave it at that.<p>The rest of us are much more productive with IDEs and debuggers.')
