You&#x27;re going to be able to find the most help, discussion, and stuff for Terraform. Terraform and it&#x27;s ecosystem is the safer choice, especially when the CDK is an option.<p>On the other hand I can say that a bunch of Pulumi&#x27;s stuff is built on terraform underneath the covers so I&#x27;m not sure how far behind they are but it probably isn&#x27;t by much. In my limited use (for example deploying SES stuff) I found it a pleasure to use and didn&#x27;t find anything that terraform did that it didn&#x27;t (again, likely due to pulumi being able to utilize terraform providers under the covers).<p>&gt; I just inherited a mess of terragrunt at a new gig and was plannning to rewrite it anyway<p>Hope you&#x27;re really sure this is where you want to use your effort tokens -- I&#x27;m not sure how much of a mess with it, but these tools are so new, it might be worth seeing if you can de-clutter it without a complete rewrite. Or maybe it&#x27;s small enough that a complete rewrite is relatively low friction... Either way, there be dragons.')
