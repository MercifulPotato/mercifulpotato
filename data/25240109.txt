You ask, “ Are all optimization problems specifically created and taught in the context of machine learning?” but this has no logical or semantic connection to my comment in any way. It fails to be a valid response or question.<p>Instead it seems you falsely believe you are writing with some sarcasm that endows rhetorical flair to undercut my comment. It’s very rude and juvenile in addition to being wholly ineffective.')
