It turned out that if you add CO2 to water, you get carbonic acid.  This melts calcium carbonate at the bottom of the sea.  The buffering makes the pH of the oceans relatively constant no matter what CO2 levels happen to be.<p>Unfortunately that buffering takes place on the order of thousands of years.  Which is fine when CO2 slowly increases in level.  But when it rises suddenly, as it is doing right now, the oceans turn into a mild acid.  Mild, that is, except for corals and shellfish whose shells dissolve. And anything that depends on them.  Which, given how ecosystems connect, is pretty much everything in the ocean.<p>Already, 3&#x2F;4 of coral reefs in the world have experienced bleaching event.  Similarly mass die-offs of shellfish have been widely reported in fisheries.  Future projections are..bleak.<p>All of this from a level of change that would have been fine if it was spread over 10,000 years rather than 100.')
