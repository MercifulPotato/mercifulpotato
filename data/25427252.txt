Item(by='nunya_bidness', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608009186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25417685, text='This is what happens when you suppress complaint and disagreement internally.  The truth will come out. It always does.  You can choose to ignore that truth or justify your position which this post certainly does.  Take any substance and press down on it and does it stay contained within it&#x27;s original shape as force multiplies or does it expand outward?<p>Lambda School made 2 promises to students when I joined. 1. They promised that students would always have access to the most up to date curriculum that was offered.  This is no longer true.  2. They promised a network that connected students to alumni in an ever expanding community.  They started separating alumni from the student workspace in Slack months ago. That community doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>These are the 2 most fundamental promises that Lambda School made to students and it has broken both.  Add to this incompetence or indifference the damaging changes that have been made to the curriculum and no one can reasonably accept the same price tag, $30K, for the diminished service, unaccountable support and lower quality curriculum product.<p>Students aren&#x27;t the only population at Lambda School who are unhappy with these changes that Allred claims, &quot;some of the changes that a subset of students did not like are unquestionably for their benefit&quot;. If this is true why is Lambda School losing or in the process of losing key instructors further degrading the quality of the product.<p>Lambda School can no longer rely on student referrals for driving growth in enrollment. Lambda School current and future instructor departures will continue the downward spiral.  Allred seems to believe he can will the bleeding to stop. A bit of humility and self awareness would be a better path for him to consider over his protestations. Those on the inside at Lambda School recognize his words as nonsense.')
