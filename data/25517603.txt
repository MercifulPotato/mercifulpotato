That&#x27;s not only * a lot* more than any public servant gets, it&#x27;s more than you can earn at top DAX companies.<p>The GP was wrong in claiming they&#x27;re being paid under the same scheme as public servants, but they weren&#x27;t wrong in calling them out for earning insane amounts of money.<p>Now if only we&#x27;d actually get decent stuff in return, instead of 15 different talk shows that all have to be broadcast at the exact same time.<p>Some of the stuff they produce is absolutely useful and of great quality, but that&#x27;s maybe 5% of their entire program (across TV and radio) at best. I&#x27;d much rather pay for quality content like the BBC puts out, than Tom Buhrow&#x27;s 400k Euro salary and &quot;journalists&quot; that ignore and fabricate facts just to have a sensationalized story[0] and then don&#x27;t even face any repercussions for it.<p>[0] German: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mitteldeutsches-journal.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;28&#x2F;recherche-skandal-um-swr-reporterin-judith-brosel-der-fall-erinnert-an-claas-relotius&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mitteldeutsches-journal.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;28&#x2F;recherche...</a>')
