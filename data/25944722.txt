When the bubble invariably bursts, they will be left penniless. We will see people making actual, huge losses that they very much care about.<p>Sure, there are also the people to whom this is a game&#x2F;collective action, and who can afford to lose a few hundred bucks to make a statement or have fun. But let&#x27;s not pretend that that&#x27;s the case for everyone. There will be painful outcomes here, with lots of people spending more than they can afford on stocks that they will only be able to sell at a tiny fraction of the current price. Stock price manipulation can be enjoyable, but it shouldn&#x27;t be confused with prices going up because the business behind the stocks actually does better.<p>This is such a weird situation: On Twitter I see several of the same people who are usually like &quot;Bitcoin is a scam, it&#x27;s pure speculation without fundamentals&quot; now applauding the GameStop situation just because <i>this</i> time the speculation without fundamentals <i>also</i> hurts hedge funds (but ignoring that it will hurt lots of individual investors as well).<p>&gt; a repeatable strategy that will work over and over.<p>As long as the people playing along have the real money to put into real stocks that are not worth that real money. It would be more sustainable&#x2F;repeatable if people had stopped driving up the price once a reasonable ceiling was reached.')
