I wish I could say it was playing rugby or football or mining or something but it was disc golf (?!?!?!). Was on hydro for weeks, I think. I don&#x27;t remember much about it. I do remember that stuff making me feel way better than any human really should.<p>I also remember the day I sat in the surgeon&#x27;s office and we had the weekly &quot;what&#x27;s your pain level?&quot; conversation. And I knew good and well that the pain was basically gone. And he knew I knew it. And he knew I really, really wanted more of those pills. And he asked if it might be time to switch to Tylenol and sort of gave me a certain, probably well-practiced, look. The one where an eyebrow does that thing.<p>I remember taking stock of the situation, looking longingly into the abyss, and turning back. That doctor fixed my knee, but, more importantly, probably saved my life with a 2-minute conversation.<p>Thanks doc!')
