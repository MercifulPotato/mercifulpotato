Intellectual curiosity is an <i>emotion</i>. The joy of solving a problem, doing something with some slick and elegant logic? <i>Emotion.</i><p>&gt; We often act against our own best interests and health purely because we&#x27;re afraid, for example.<p>Best interest? The very concept fundamentally depends on caring about <i>something</i> - being alive, the good of humanity, whatever. Caring about absolutely <i>anything?</i> An emotion :).<p>We actually are able to control a lot, but not all of our bodies. Once we accept that we are inherently emotional beings and work on being more conscious of our feelings and mindful ;).<p>FWIW while it’s a lifelong effort, practicing to neutrally observe our feelings and treat them more as data to analyze, <i>without divorcing ourselves from them or denying them</i>, is a powerful tool to counterbalance the ease of confusing a transitory feeling with one’s self and the counterproductive behavior or decision-making which often stems from that. AKA practicing mindfulness.<p>Lol which I’m not really doing, writing such a heated comment ;).<p>Laughter? <i>Emotion</i>.<p>I don’t know if you’ve noticed but computers are perfectly logical and have no emotion and they’re not fucking <i>alive.</i><p>Take a page from Commander Data’s book and try to appreciate the fundamental nature of humanity :).')
