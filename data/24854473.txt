I&#x27;ve increasingly found that if it&#x27;s hard to explain clearly and precisely what a paragraph of code is doing, you probably don&#x27;t understand the goal of the code itself well enough and should rethink the code.<p>If you can explain clearly and precisely but it&#x27;s a long explanation, then do so. The longer the explanation, the more it&#x27;s needed. If it&#x27;s that complicated to explain the first time round, it&#x27;s gonna <i>suck</i> when you come back to that code five years later.')
