The recognizable part of Bootstrap isn&#x27;t the fact that errors are red, it&#x27;s the shape of the buttons, inputs, etc., and the fact that all errors are the exact same red as other Bootstrap sites.<p>At the end of the day &quot;good&quot; UI doesn&#x27;t have a lot of room to be different -- it actually needs to be recognizable -- but you don&#x27;t need to change much to avoid being generic. Using different shade(s) of red for errors is one way.')
