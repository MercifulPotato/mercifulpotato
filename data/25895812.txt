The &#x27;streamfields&#x27; feature makes it really easy to offer editors plenty of flexibility without offering them the opportunity to butcher the site.<p>The development experience means I love it too. I never did find a simple Wordpress workflow for managing staging and live sites in git. With Wagtail&#x2F;Django keeping the configuration in code, a git workflow works.<p>Edit: Apologies if you were actually asking about a solution to allow non-technical people to create a site, rather than manage it.')
