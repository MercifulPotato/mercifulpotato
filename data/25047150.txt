The first one started getting a bit wonky after 9 years and I replaced it; the new one has been fine.  We do a middling amount of printing (~10,000 pages over those 9 years, iirc).<p>I haven&#x27;t tried non-first party toner; the B&#x2F;W high-capacity HP toner cartridges for my current printer, for example, are ~$200 and last for ~10,000 pages, which works fine for me; my total cost of ownership ends up at $45&#x2F;year or so, and there&#x27;s zero hassle involved, which is worth a lot to me personally.')
