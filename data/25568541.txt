I worked more hours than everyone else combined. Fine with me, you couldn&#x27;t tear me away.<p>Ron Howard hired Apollo 15 astronaut Dave Scott to consult on Apollo 13. He finds reality more interesting than anyone&#x27;s imagination, he wanted to get textures right, verisimilitude. I was hired at first with a short list of specific goals, such as the problem Nash writes on his calculus blackboard. I know too many mathematicians who claim to have solved the Good Will Hunting blackboard while it was onscreen; we wanted everything we did to survive &quot;freeze framing the DVD&quot;.<p>A film is like joining the circus. Once you&#x27;re in, you can be asked to do anything if there&#x27;s a way you can help.<p>After watching art make 200 panels digit by digit for the Pentagon scence, supposed to be random enough to pass as encryption, I wrote a C program overnight to generate similar panels with a simple settings file they could play with. My childhood anti-drug literature included photographs of spider webs under various influences; the storyboard artists used this to draw the &quot;Mad Shack&quot; scenes, as seen in the film. For the writer Akiva Goldsman, I&#x27;d make strange phone calls for example to the CIA to discuss terminology.<p>I was a go-between to strong go players for the game sequences. I proposed a go consultant but they said I&#x27;d do. After one rehearsal where no one could act and position stones at once, Ron Howard said to just act, we&#x27;ll fix it in second unit. We break for lunch, I pronounce &quot;This is why we don&#x27;t have a go consultant. A go consultant would commit ritual suicide right now.&quot; Russell Crowe responds they&#x27;ll put my phone number in the credits. Then everyone in the room recites verbatim their most scathing reviews ever, to enormous peels of laughter.<p>Day to day, the props department always wanted more scribbled paper, or a blackboard needed scrawling. The actors were entitled to ask me anything before scenes; I&#x27;d often be around hours for a one minute conversation. There&#x27;s a Time magazine cover with Nash as one of four faces. Held in an actor&#x27;s hand one can barely make out the backgrounds on Blu Ray, but Russell Crowe wouldn&#x27;t pose for that still photograph till he&#x27;d found me to confirm that the blackboard was my writing.<p>Facing a writer&#x27;s strike, and with second unit costing a fraction of first unit, there were body doubles whenever Russell Crowe&#x27;s face didn&#x27;t show. I wrote all the math, so I was his hand double for everything. He got the idea of making his fingers longer with acrylic nails, so I had acrylic nails for six months. I loathed them but it certainly established my loyalty. Try having your friends in a bar tell strangers about this; I&#x27;d admit I was a Barbra Streisand impersonator and that they&#x27;d believe.<p>I had my nails done at the same shop in New Jersey that Edie Falco used on The Sopranos. The woman who&#x27;d promised to do the work was on a cruise in the Caribbean, so she phoned in. She asked me if I was doing anything else for the film besides being a hand double. I said I was also Russell&#x27;s love double (a story he later enjoyed):<p>&quot;Will you be needing an extension for that too?&quot;')
