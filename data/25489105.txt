You&#x27;ll know if all the fuss about Net Neutrality was empty rhetoric if the Democrats don&#x27;t propose any legislation in the next session. It&#x27;s my controversial opinion that most of the debate around this issue at the policy level is political theatrics based more on partisanship and personalities than material differences in proposed and enforced law or administrative policy.')
