Microsoft seems to really hate just saying &quot;Do this standard thing&quot; and prefer to say &quot;Do this special Microsoft thing â€ &quot; with an asterisk explaining somewhere that it&#x27;s basically the standard thing but with a Microsoft logo and also your Microsoft Certified Partner will charge extra.<p>For example Microsoft used to tell its customers they need a &quot;Unified Communications Certificate&quot; for SSL&#x2F;TLS. And some companies would advertise specifically that phrase. What&#x27;s special about UCC? Nothing, it&#x27;s just an ordinary PKIX compliant certificate using SANs, which is what all the providers are always required to do anyway. But I guess in principle Microsoft felt this way if you bought something else somehow, that&#x27;s not a &quot;Unified Communications Certificate&quot; so that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work.<p>In the case of WebAuthn Microsoft <i>really</i> wanted to do RSA PKCS#1.5 even though that was obviously at best a weird choice and arguably a bad choice. So the standard says you can do RSA PKCS#1.5 and as I understand it a pure Windows system does, but nobody else wanted that, it&#x27;s slower, it&#x27;s clumsier, there is no formal security proof that it&#x27;s even safe. Everybody else does an elliptic curve signature, I think either ECDSA or EdDSA.<p>I&#x27;ve built a toy WebAuthn implementation and I literally have no clue whether it works with Microsoft&#x27;s clients because I was not able to test that yet because they are different from everything else. It fails closed, so if it doesn&#x27;t work I guess I locked out all Windows users. But all the widely available popular solutions should work.')
