There were several incidents where she appears toxic (and we only know about the ones made public).<p>1. Absolutely refusing to update her paper with feedback from a colleague - the whole purpose of the internal review<p>2. Demanding that Google reveal who gave her critical feedback - presumably to attack them in some way<p>3. Sending an e-mail to her superiors&#x2F;colleagues, making ultimatums and threatening to leave if her demands were not met<p>4. Sending a message to a group at Google, telling them to abandon any attempts to help Google with diversity initiatives and instead start attacking their co-workers<p>5. Publicly blaming Google and saying that she was &quot;fired&quot; for an e-mail. She was relying on information assymetry, knowing that Google would be hesitant to respond fully to all allegations')
