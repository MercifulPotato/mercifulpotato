No one seems to know, even today, how long <i>after</i> exposure you become contagious.  That&#x27;s especially the case for asymptomatic spreaders (as we assume the child was, <i>if</i> the child was the source for the parent).<p>Everyone seems to say &quot;1-2 days before symptoms start&quot;, although some sources say &quot;2-3 days&quot;.  And yes, as you say, the 2-14 days for becoming symptomatic seems to be much more agreed upon.<p>That&#x27;s where it seems to me to be a very rapid spread (below average) from the wedding to the LTCF.  But not impossible.<p>I was also curious about the situation around the LTCF in the days leading up to that outbreak.  I was expecting to find that perhaps there were other community cases around there that could have contributed to the LTCF.<p>However, looking at the MeCDC website for Somerset County (where the LTCF is reported to be located), the county seemed to be pretty &quot;under control&quot; in the days leading up to this event.  The most recent confirmed cases had been over 2 weeks prior, on July 24th.  It&#x27;s actually the longest they had gone without a new case in almost 3 months.<p>Given that, I&#x27;m more likely (as the CDC concluded) to suspect the contact tracing from the wedding to the LTCF as being the cause.  It&#x27;s not an absolute link, but it&#x27;s probably more likely than I originally assumed.')
