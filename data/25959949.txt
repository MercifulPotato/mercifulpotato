Dianne Feinstein’s role in a controversy over a Civic Center Plaza flag display that included the Confederate banner<p>This is ironic because in the resolution that the School Board adopted in 2018 that started this renaming business (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.boarddocs.com&#x2F;ca&#x2F;sfusd&#x2F;Board.nsf&#x2F;files&#x2F;AYV7FN7557A3&#x2F;$file&#x2F;184-10A1%20Rename%20Schools.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.boarddocs.com&#x2F;ca&#x2F;sfusd&#x2F;Board.nsf&#x2F;files&#x2F;AYV7FN7557...</a>), Feinstein is listed as one of the schools that they “proudly, confidently and with the advocacy and support of the community” renamed schools <i>to</i>! But now, the School Board has decided that it is time to rename the school <i>away</i> from her name.<p>&gt; One school was found to be named after a street that was named after a South Carolina county that was named after an English politician who was impeached by the House of Commons in the 17th century.<p>They’re talking about Clarendon Elementary School, which is named after Clarendon Ave. The committee member claimed&#x2F;speculated that this street is named after Clarendon County, South Carolina, but I haven’t found documentation proving this (it started showed up in maps of San Francsico around 1890). Clarendon County is named after Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, who owned the Carolinas and who oppressed people by violating habeas corpus in the 1660s.<p>Given the manifest stupidity at the school board, I wonder whether there will be increasing interest in creating new charter schools or interest in converting existing schools to charter schools (which must be approved by a majority of teachers).')
