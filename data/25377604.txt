They were having leadership difficulties before the pandemic, which halted all growth and even shrinking of existing business. I think my manager is doing his best but that the organization is going to let the team atrophy and be absorbed by another, or at some point down the line when there&#x27;s more money available reconstitute it. I&#x27;m leaving because that&#x27;s what I see as the most likely future, people who disagree with me are staying and I am wishing them the best and washing my hands.')
