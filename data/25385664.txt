The results reminded me of search engines a decade ago - when keyword hacking for SEO placement had caught on, but search engines hadn&#x27;t learnt to work around it. (I can&#x27;t access that history now, but one of the searches I tried was &#x27;rec file viewer&#x27;, and the results were dominated by the many crappy &quot;file extension info&quot; sites riddled with ads and &quot;Is This A Virus&quot; FUD.)<p>Btw I&#x27;m not a native English speaker and mojeek seemed  like a great name to me immediately. Definitely easier to remember than metager and YaCy, on par with qwant (I&#x27;ve been looking into alternate search engines recently). There were (and still are) people who thought DuckDuckGo is a terrible name - and even if that&#x27;s true, they&#x27;ve shown it&#x27;s not a significant obstacle at all. Good luck with your results,  those are the only thing that really matter.')
