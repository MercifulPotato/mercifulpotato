It was the City Beautiful movement and the existing examples of grand boulevards in imperial capitals.<p>That main boulevard he envisioned lined by monuments and institutions of great importance was a German equivalent of basically Philadelphia&#x27;s Franklin parkway or Paris&#x27; Champs-Elysees. Philadelphia razed entire city neighborhoods only decades earlier to build it.<p>In fact, an almost identical vision to Speer&#x27;s Berlin already existed. It was Washington DC.<p>On a smaller scale, dozens of other cities had already embarqued on similar projects, Brussels Parc du Cinquantenaire is another on, or Budapest&#x27;s parliament building and Heroes&#x27; Square.<p>Germany was playing catch-up to what was fairly mundane practice. The only thing that gives pause is perhaps the Volkshalle, which has a little too much of a mine-is-bigger vibe when putting it next to DC&#x27;s congress building.')
