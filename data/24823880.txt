Do you want the iterator to be efficient, or consistent?<p>The thing is, what cppreference says here is that this innocent-looking code might either not compile or cause undefined behavior in whatever part of the program. In my case on GCC 8, it caused memory leak warnings with address sanitizer. For larger programs and especially for programs which have hard requirements on real-time latencies, safety or robustness, this is not acceptable.<p>And yes, an experienced C++ developer will initially need a little more time to write the same code in Rust, compared to C++. (I do not think this is true for developers new to C++ because C++ is a very large language). However, in any larger program, the time spent for testing and debugging is very likely larger than the time spent for typing in the first code. And in this metric, Rust&#x27;s strict approach to correctness is far better.<p>And if you get to debug undefined behavior in large multi-threaded programs, the time you can spend debugging code is basically unbound if you were were not both experienced and careful with writing first.')
