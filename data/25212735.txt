A couple reasons:\n1. The act of keeping the secret makes the tech useless. If it&#x27;s not incorporated into equipment that could use it (e.g. a naval vessel, an isolated firebase) then what good is it? And if it is incorporated and there&#x27;s a bunch of 20 year old techs working on it, it&#x27;s going to leak. \n2. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re that bad of people. If they could save us from global warming with fusion tech, not doing so would be a great tragedy. And historically at least the US military just isn&#x27;t that selfish. For example, they opened up GPS even when they didn&#x27;t have to. I think they get that a richer&#x2F;stronger public means a richer&#x2F;stronger military.')
