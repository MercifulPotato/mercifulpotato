I just think it has enough cost savings potential that companies will be open to it going forward.<p>I especially like the &quot;employees can access any company..&quot; part, as it gives me a lot more options.  Up till this now, it was basically only SV companies and small startups that were open to it.. So I&#x27;m looking forward to being able to cast a wider net next time I need to look for work.')
