BandCamp&#x27;s terms of use state that they take non-exclusive rights to sell and distribute works on your behalf, but they do not grant those same rates to buyers.<p>DRM is not Licensing, but a mechanism to enforce a license.<p>I think OP is implying that the sharing provided in funkwhale is likely violating the typical license terms of any purchased music, therefore is preventing a musician from making money from streaming services which have appropriately licensed the music for streaming.<p>Buying a license doesn&#x27;t mean that you own the work, just that you have the right to play it in specific circumstances (most of which nobody pays attention to anyway). I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all played a song on a loud speaker for others to hear, but again that&#x27;s against typical license terms.')
