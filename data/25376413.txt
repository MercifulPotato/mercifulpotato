I&#x27;ve got plenty of project ideas, but when I start thinking about working on one of them I invariably get to the &quot;What&#x27;s the point?&quot; stage.<p>Now, normally I&#x27;d say we need to push through this. But I think instead we need to give ourselves some space given the current circumstances: We&#x27;re in the middle of a global pandemic and in the US we&#x27;re in the middle of some political and epistemological upheaval that&#x27;s actually making the pandemic worse for us than it is for many other countries.

Maybe take a break. Don&#x27;t try to force it - it&#x27;s like falling asleep, the harder you try, the more impossible it becomes.')
