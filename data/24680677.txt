This is its first outing. I just put it there without accompanying explanations, so it may seem a bit obscure. And it is clearly unfinished, if finishable. It is more a moral code in the sense of the ten commandments. And I am not native english speaker. So here it is:<p>Do not make computer programs that force humans into repetitive tasks. Computers are made for automating tasks, not enslaving humans.<p>Do not pass onto users a responsibility that is on the program side.<p>When the user has a responsibility, make it clear. The computer program must warn users when their input could cause a valid output for which they would be held responsible.<p>Programs must never silently fail.<p>Once users have used a computer program, you must not remove it from them, render it useless or make it available at a price higher than agreed beforehand. Once users have used a feature of a computer program, you must not remove it, hide it from them or make it available at a price higher than agreed beforehand.<p>Programs must not override users inputs solely based on a probability of them being wrong.<p>Users can always override program outputs that are based on probability or incomplete information.<p>You must document all the features of the computer program accurately and make the documentation available to all users. Documentation is written in good faith.<p>Documentation must at a minimum describe the program inputs and the valid program outputs. If the output is based on probability, the documentation must explicit the probability for the program giving a valid output, and the probabilities of giving whatever invalid output.<p>When the program performance varies between users, any user can obtain the program performance in his&#x2F;her particular case.<p>Every citizen is a user of a computer program used for law enforcement. Every citizen is a user of a computer program operating in the public space. Every citizen is a user of a program collecting its inputs.')
