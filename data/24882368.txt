The CCP govt moved Han chinese into the region and took away employment and other things that Uighurs used to enjoy turning them into second class citizens. Some people out of frustration committed the attacks which is exactly what CCP wanted to fully go in and start clearing and fully occupying them.<p>You sound like a Han Chinese. Imagine yourself in their shoes. There&#x27;s lots of Chinese diaspora in other countries. What if one of the countries decided to do that with the Han Chinese?
