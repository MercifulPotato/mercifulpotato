You wouldn&#x27;t be able to burn a CD-R backwards without some extra steps; a &quot;blank&quot; CD-R contains some data in the pregroove to identify it as a recordable disc and specify some parameters to the burner. A reverse-rotating drive wouldn&#x27;t be able to read that data, since it&#x27;d be backwards. :)')
