E.g. &quot;I&#x27;m a great visionary CTO of a 100 person dev team and I use Vercel&quot;. A developer doesn&#x27;t care that Vercel raised $40M, all they want to know is &quot;if I push code to your stack, will it host my JAMstack&quot;.<p>NOW, I would argue that a good press release for a devchain based company can talk to BOTH audiences, and I think the criticism there is fair.')
