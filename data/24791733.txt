Item(by='vlmutolo', descendants=None, kids=[24792320, 24792675], score=None, time=1602785436, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24791621, text='My best guess:<p>Filecoin is hovering at around $65 USD &#x2F; FIL [0]. The rolling 24-hr reward for storage on the Filecoin network is currently about 0.25 FIL &#x2F; TB, or $16.25 &#x2F; TB. Backblaze says that they manage around $36 &#x2F; TB [2], and they have incredible knowledge and scale, so that leads me to believe something is wrong in this calculation I just did. Maybe the reward isn&#x27;t a good measure of the price of the storage?<p>EDIT: I think the issue is that I didn&#x27;t take into account storage duration. Not sure how to do that. Storing a blob for two years will be more expensive than for a month, and I know that the Filecoin network accounts for this. After a brief exploration of their site, it seems like you actually make bids to store your data at a certain price. I wish there were an obvious place that showed the most recent offers so people could get a good idea of how much it costs.<p>Also, I had a thought that a smart miner will just create a thin layer between Backblaze B2 and Filecoin to earn some FIL basically for free since no one is going to out-price B2. And then we&#x27;re just back to storing everything on B2 and S3, except in a less efficient and more opaque way.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kraken.com&#x2F;prices&#x2F;fil-filecoin-price-chart&#x2F;usd-us-dollar?interval=All" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kraken.com&#x2F;prices&#x2F;fil-filecoin-price-chart&#x2F;usd-u...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;filfox.info&#x2F;en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;filfox.info&#x2F;en</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;open-source-data-storage-server&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;open-source-data-storage-serv...</a>')
