It&#x27;s about collecting the money (and not getting layed off coz you&#x27;re the guy that makes the most). This will depend on the company. Some companies do stack ranking and you can tell me whatever you want but I bet being at the top of your salary bracket gets you out more easily. But if you have a company that values you, doesn&#x27;t do that sort of stack ranking and you&#x27;re fine with only getting the standard inflationary increase, then collecting the extra money for multiple years is worth it if you ask me.<p>That said it feels kinda nice if the company gives you a raise without you even asking but it does mean you were basically underpayed vs. what you might have gotten.')
