I am a successful backend engineer, but boy I have been struggling with CSS too for many years. It helped that this year I took up a full time role which needs me to do CSS and I have a mentor guiding me. You should also find a mentor for it.<p>What we really need is some kind of &quot;logger&quot; for how the browser interpreted CSS and made its decisions.<p>For example, if two boxes are overlapping even if you said margin is 10px, the browser should say something like &quot;calculated box a to 500px wide. Box b is set to width of fixed width of 300px and is aligned to right. Hence its placement will be 0px from the right. Ignoring margin 30p,&#x27; Then you can reason that since screen is only 700px wide, there will be overlap. (I am making this is open obviously).<p>My point is, the browser almost never gives any feedback like a compiler would. It makes us think&#x2F;guess based on &quot;inspector&quot;.')
