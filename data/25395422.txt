The idea that women are oppressed when they cook for their families, but free and liberated when they work as a wage slave for their boss, is very very sad. You talk about choice, but never consider that men have very little choice either. Either be a wage slave, or by looked down on for &quot;not providing&quot;. Spending time with your family and on the home front is one of the most rewarding things a human being can do. It is a great loss to society that this now looked down on as a lesser choice because there are &quot;better&quot; options available to women now.')
