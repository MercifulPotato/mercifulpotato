It presupposes that approaching the problem like a game or “capture the flag” is good or somehow better than supervised learning based on attributes that are known to correlate quite strongly to user preferences.<p>Given the very widespread complaints about this type of recommender system - eg modern YouTube and FB Newsfeed rankings are widely panned as reinforcing biases, optimizing for pure engagement which leads to reinforcing outrage, both by ML experts and general users who don’t like the experience &amp; feel it is manipulative, what is your take on how we can steer the conversation in the other direction - that this is NOT a reinforcement learning problem, and that we shouldn’t reward people looking to pad their ML resume with solutions in search of a problem that facilitate their ability to brag about scale &amp; complexity over a solution that very demonstrably serves users poorly?')
