I don&#x27;t believe comparing this to deplatforming from the internet is a good faith argument.<p>&gt; It may not be exactly indispensable now, but they want to become such.<p>So they&#x27;re not now, but they want to be, so we need to treat them like they are? That&#x27;s like saying we should apply monopoly laws to every company in a market because they&#x27;re trying to grow. When Twitter has a monopoly on the distribution of speech, I&#x27;ll agree with you. In the meantime, even without social media, there are more ways to deliver a message than there ever have been in the history of mankind.<p>As has been mentioned over and over the last few days, freedom of speech means you have the right to say it, not the right to broadcast it.<p>&gt; In that light I think in ten years when they are your bank and whatever else<p>I say this semi-sarcastically, but when I can&#x27;t spend my money because I&#x27;ve been deplatformed from twitter, I screwed up more than them.')
