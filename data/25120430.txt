Obviously, you can write your application in Cython and have decent performance.<p>&quot;Decent&quot; is a weasel word, which suggests that the performance hit of following this approach is tolerable or acceptable. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn&#x27;t. It really depends on where you place the glue code, and where you expect the hot path to be.<p>In the case of a self-described &quot;Redis clone&quot; which ends up being Redis itself glued back together with Python, I&#x27;m not sure you can make that case.<p>&gt; The entire purpose is to demonstrate that you can build a reasonable performance application built on high performance libraries and stick with idiomatic Python code.<p>I&#x27;m sorry to say but that isn&#x27;t much of a demonstration. I mean, Python is already widely used as glue code to hold together high performance libraries, and it&#x27;s already widely known and understood that gluing together code with Python brings in a significant performance hit. And that&#x27;s ok, because people do it as a tradeoff between performance and some other kind of value-added.<p>But in this case I fail to see what value-added is being proposed, other than the personal portfolio side of things.')
