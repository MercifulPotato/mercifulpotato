This ends up costing a lot of development time to developers who mostly work for free, who struggle to reverse engineer or debug what happens on MacOS&#x2F;iOS, and (like Wireguard&#x27;s case shows) it harms the reputation of their software because people tend to blame the application rather than the OS when things don&#x27;t work as intended.<p>If people want to use FOSS software, then they should be able to do so on systems that support the FOSS ecosystem, that provide developers with appropriate tools to debug what&#x27;s going on (ON ANY PLATFORM) and sufficient documentation for them to understand how a certain component of the OS is supposed to behave.<p>I know that in the past 15 years lots of tech-savvy people have opted for Apple products because &quot;they&#x27;re still UNIX under the hood, and unlike Linux they just work out of the box&quot;. But being Unix-like DOES NOT mean to be developer-friendly! Apple is still an opaque developer-unfriendly company even if it provides you with a native bash!')
