Fortunately, we don&#x27;t actually care what the information looks like when flipping coins. We usually just want &quot;some random message&quot;, so no need to decode in this application!<p>------<p>Cryptographers assume hash-functions are perfect random codes (they aren&#x27;t in theory, but they are in practice... at least until they&#x27;re cracked. Kinda funny how that works out). As such, the cryptohash(message) methodology should also reach the Shannon-limit, as long as your cryptohash remains secure... and you stay within the blocksize restrictions of the hash.')
