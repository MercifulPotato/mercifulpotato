I think the NHS was the organisation to trial having the nurse run the checklist, which had the effect of empowering the &quot;lowest level&quot; person in the operating theatre. Studies showed that even just having everyone in the room speak once increased the chance of subsequent communication, and ultimately improved patient outcomes.<p>Atul Gawande was one of the key people in designing and rolling out these checklists and wrote a book about it that I&#x27;d recommend â€“ The Checklist Manifesto.')
