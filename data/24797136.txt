The entrepreneurship ecosystem is full of narcissists, blowhards, and self-important people who believe that since they are managing other people&#x27;s money they therefore have more wisdom and insight than anyone else. Board members who feel that their role as board member grants them instant authority and credibility on all topics. CEOs who believe that their title means they deserve respect. And a range of hangers-on and wantrepreneurs who want to be part of the scene but have no real idea or knowledge on how to build a business.<p>Some startups are built to grow. Some are built to flip. Some will never go anywhere but fill people&#x27;s pockets and egos. But many many more just fail.<p>There is little relationship between the alternate reality that is the startup world and the more mundane, sedate, and less interesting traditional business world.<p>Tweet storms and email chains like these read like the startup version of Jersey Shore or Housewives of OC.')
