They just won&#x27;t be employees of Google for much longer after Google finds out.<p>A distinction without a difference, the intended effect is still the same: discouraging people from speaking out.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t like that any more than you do. Corporations have far too much power in the US, and way more control over the lives of ordinary citizens than they should. But, there&#x27;s nothing against the rules here.<p>Then surely the focus should be on changing the rules and pushing back what little we can, not making excuses about how it is technically not illegal.')
