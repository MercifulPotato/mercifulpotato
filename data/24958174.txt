Item(by='lifthrasiir', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604221270, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24956384, text='&gt; Almost 95% (or even more) of characters have never been used and no one know how to pronounce it.<p>This is absolutely false. KS X 1001, the primary character set for Hangul, contains 2,350 out of 11,172 (modern) syllables, which is definitely much larger than 5%. And that&#x27;s not enough (KS X 1001 itself was heavily criticized for this), there are multiple secondary character sets got into Unicode; Unicode 1.1 had 6,656 arbitrarily ordered characters that were finally replaced by 11,172 neatly ordered characters by 2.0. They are real characters people use, my very old personal research [1] indicates that at least a half of them has legitimately appeared in the chat log for example.<p>Pronunciation-wise, multiple consonant clusters in the final position indicate conditional pronunciation. &quot;갅&quot;, for example, comprises of ㄱ g + ㅏ ah + ㄴ n + ㅈ j which is <i>normally</i> pronounced &quot;gahn&quot; by its own but &quot;gahn-j&quot; when followed by a vowel (e.g. &quot;갅이&quot; is pronounced &quot;간지&quot; gahn-ji). Phonetically Korean only has 7 possible codas and other final consonants exist because Korean orthography is a compromise between phoneticism and ideographicism and some words had to be adjusted to show their morphological roots.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;j.mearie.org&#x2F;post&#x2F;24348147729&#x2F;hangeul-usage-in-irc-chatting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;j.mearie.org&#x2F;post&#x2F;24348147729&#x2F;hangeul-usage-in-irc-c...</a> (in Korean)')
