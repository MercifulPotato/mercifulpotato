Sure we have things like NVENC for accelerated H.265 encoding but that is an additional hardware expense and means only the machines you have that hardware in benefits. This will literally be <i>all</i> Macs from a $699 Mini and up.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about Intel QuickSync to compare but it clearly isn&#x27;t used on the iMac in that video for some reason (perhaps the software does not support it? I don&#x27;t know)<p>That is pretty exciting for video professionals IMHO.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it is world changing but being able to pick up a MacBook Air for $999 and get performance similar (or maybe better?) than a PC that costs two or three times that with dedicated hardware is very cool.')
