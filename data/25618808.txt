Life is easier with less commuting.<p>4) Pro: no commutes. Helping the environment by not driving, and conserving precious fossil fuels for future generations. Con: physical distance does increase the time to copy files here and there, but overall not a big deal.<p>5-A) I wonder if this blessing may be a curse in disguise. Will high salaries in job centers start to drop off when physical location is no longer a factor? I choose to live far away and commute specifically to get the best of both, low cost of living and high salary. Could international competition bring down salaries? Could any laws preventing this be changed? New laws written?<p>5-B) I think having a big monitor and a good keyboard are key. Working on the laptop directly sucks and is uncomfortable. Basically have a real desk&#x2F;workplace. I notice some of my coworkers sitting on the couch with the laptop in their lap. They don&#x27;t seem to mind.<p>6) Yes for myself. Yes for most programmers. I do wonder if there could be issues with new fresh programmers being thrown into the world with a monitor as their only view port to the team. But that&#x27;s how the open source world works, and many people have learned much with that remote style of interaction.')
