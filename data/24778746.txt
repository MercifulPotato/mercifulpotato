First it allows the project to optimize for its goals (dev latency), this allows the team to have more local control and autonomy.<p>Second, it puts _less_ pressure on LLVM to have both a low latency version and a highly optimized version. If the LLVM IR could be more of a common format, I think it would provide a medium for tools to compose better. Eventually we will get there, compiler gods willing.  I think LLVM should be the place for the massive-engineering-effort optimization passes.<p>Lastly, it provides for differential testing of both backends, this makes Zig&#x27;s homegrown one AND LLVM better.<p>Thanks for sponsoring Zig!')
