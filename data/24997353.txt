I have to be honest, I was always scared off the sheer amount of protocols and ressources around IPv6. It felt that I have to deal with anycast, self-organized networks, anonymous embedding of MAC addresses, some NAT-replacement, etc. when I touch IPv6. It&#x27;s probably not true and one can start with IPv6 also in a simpler fashion. Maybe I&#x27;m also just too much used to ifconfig and nat tables that the switch feels hard.<p>The comparison of HTTP1 vs. HTTP2 is in fact only valid on a level of complexity.<p>As an hobbyist, I&#x27;m actually quite excited of finally abandoning NAT and being able to reach my Raspberry at home from anywhere in the net.  This dream is still far away, given that many places don&#x27;t have access to IPv6 (without a tunnel).')
