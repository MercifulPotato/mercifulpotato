Item(by='caconym_', descendants=None, kids=[25866012], score=None, time=1611270756, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865496, text='&gt; This is the whole point of open source.<p>What is? Because I don&#x27;t think the point of open source is to have big companies make money off code that other entities—in many cases individuals—made available for free. It&#x27;s certainly something that happens, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s universally <i>bad</i>, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the <i>point,</i> either. I&#x27;ve heard of several high profile cases of the people who maintain high-profile projects supporting $billions worth of commercial products struggling to make ends meet, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the point. That&#x27;s not a system working as designed, because nobody designed it and there arguably is no point—it&#x27;s simply a dynamic that emerged organically from the factors that drive people to contribute to open source, and those that drive businesses to maximize their profits.')
