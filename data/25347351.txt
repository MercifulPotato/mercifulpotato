Worked at a startup, money was tight and the product had to be developed. It was stressful, but it felt great after it was done. Granted, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily try it again and not for a large corporation to that level, but I think this is typical for any R&amp;D project, maybe software in particular.<p>It is just difficult to determine how long things will take in the end.
