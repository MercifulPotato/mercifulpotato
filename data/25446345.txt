Possible issues are that I don&#x27;t know if the Dreamcast will inspect multiple boot images to find an appropriately labeled one, and I don&#x27;t know if the other platforms will accept a bootable disc that&#x27;s prepared for Dreamcast (must have at least two sessions, first session audio, second session data with el torito for booting)')
