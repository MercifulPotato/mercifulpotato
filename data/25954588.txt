This explanation is wrong.  Someone lied to you, and they probably lied to you to make this look like a sure bet so that you&#x27;d buy (and thus pump) a stock that is otherwise going to crash, so that they can unload their position before it does.  You got scammed, and the person who did it is guilty of a crime.<p>FWIW: Short leverage higher than 100% is <i>not</i> naked selling.  It just means (as an example) that you borrowed a share, sold it, then later on that buyer loaned the same share back to you, and you sold it again.  This is not a good idea, but it&#x27;s not naked selling (which is itself securities fraud).')
