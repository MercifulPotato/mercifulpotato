That&#x27;s a fairly large part of the ecosystem to give up on!<p>I think it&#x27;s still a relatively low effort way (just need to write a scraper) to create a benchmark on a diverse set of algorithmic tasks that have clearcut criteria on AC&#x2F;TLE&#x2F;WA. PyPy is often 10x faster than cpython on these problems (and just 2x slower than equivalent C++ solution) so it will be a much nicer headline too if you can achieve similar performances!<p>Though I can also see how it can be completely irrelevant for server workloads. Pypy&#x27;s unicode is so slow, some people on codeforces still use pypy2 over pypy3 just to avoid it. And c extensions is so bad on pypy, you can often get better performance on cpython if you need to use numpy.')
