So in our case, A, B, &amp; C would all be coming up together from snapshots in that other region.  But there are still consistency concerns as you mentioned.<p>We do everything we can to snapshot servers in quick succession (as much as we can with AWS), but they won&#x27;t be fully consistent across nodes.  We&#x27;ve found, though, that clustered systems like this have built-in capabilities to deal with these inconsistencies.  It&#x27;s kinda similar to if you lost power to all 3 systems and then brought them back up - they might not all be at the exact same point in time, and the application would need to sort that out.<p>If you&#x27;ll tell me what application this is (is it a database platform?) I can do some quick research for you.')
