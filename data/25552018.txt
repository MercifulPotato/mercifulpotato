Many of these accidental Americans really weren&#x27;t aware of this. Why would they? They never received a US passport or any other official US documents, never lived there, didn&#x27;t go to school, and had no reason to be aware of their unintended dual citizenship until the US started bugging them for taxes.<p>Also, renouncing this accidental citizenship is far from trivial. That requires jumping through a lot of bureaucratic hoops. They never received any benefit from it, and if they knew at all, they ignored it.<p>And they have no problem paying taxes, they just pay their taxes in the country in which they live and work. They don&#x27;t want to have to fill in tax forms for every random country that chooses to bestow unwanted citizenship on them.<p>Make no mistake, the only reason this is an issue at all, is because the US is too powerful to ignore. No other country does this (except maybe Ethiopia or Eritrea, I think), and no other country would get away with this. Only the US does.<p>It&#x27;s rather odd that for a country where so many people question Obama&#x27;s citizenship, the country is so eager to claim ownership over people who don&#x27;t want it.')
