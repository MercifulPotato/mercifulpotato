Go at 6am and hike to the top. You won’t be able to see anything because of the fog.<p>When the fog disappears and you see the world.... it’s like 4K oled meets virtual reality. Except the your peripheral bounds span beyond imax.<p>That + color. There are so many micro world vibes that will blow your mind. The different shades of green based on where you are the park will lead to different emotions.<p>Unforgettable.<p>For another trip; Berkeley’s botanical preserves (if you can get access) are a completely different vibe.
