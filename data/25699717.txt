We encode plans and specifications as types, and now have formal proof that a certain class of bugs is eliminated. Excited, we want to use this strategy to eliminate more bugs.<p>A larger part of the programming task is moved over to this higher order type layer. As it becomes less trivial, bugs and antipatterns start to manifest.<p>We do not have any answers about the objectively best division of labor between static and dynamic aspects. This is a research project that&#x27;s bigger than any single person, community or language, and I&#x27;d argue we need more of Haskell, Rust, Idris and their ilk rather than less. To merely argue that they did not result in a dramatically better OS or a word processor is beside the point.')
