Almost no social safety net (barely enough to prevent you from starving or dying in the street, and not much more, and most of that won&#x27;t even come from the government but from faith-based charity), but yeah if you&#x27;re a software developer you might be able to make an extra $50-75k&#x2F;yr compared to Europe. But how much are you going to have in student loans? I graduated in &#x27;08 with about $22k and that was a lot back then.
