Item(by='0xbadcafebee', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607024690, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25286579, text='&gt; HTTP&#x2F;3 is not running over TCP port 80<p>Yes, obviously it&#x27;s not TCP, and obviously not that port. I explicitly stated &quot;<i>UDP</i>-&gt;QUIC-&gt;HTTP3&quot;, which is only inaccurate because HTTP3 is an implementation of QUICv1.<p>But it <i>is</i> still running over port 443. So my point is exactly the same. They refuse to change the port so that nobody has to agree to implement something <i>crazy</i>, like a new L4 protocol, or worse. (HTTP&#x2F;3 <i>does</i> supports the ability advertise <i>additional</i> ports besides 443, but so does HTTP&#x2F;1.1, in <i>&quot;Location: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;someurl:442&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;someurl:442&#x2F;</a>&quot;</i> redirects, and still nobody has ever used anything but 443 for production)<p>&gt; Look, we’re dealing with people here. You can’t just say “we’re dropping this thing you’ve been using for years, effective immediately”.<p>But we <i>are</i> saying &quot;All the clients [that effectively 2 companies control] will be using this new thing, so unless you want to be left behind, grandpa, get on the bandwagon.&quot; There is <i>plenty</i> of muscle to start the process of upgrading legacy crap. Over 5-10 years we could get 90% adoption of an entirely new network stack. But we have to actually start going there by writing the standards with that intent.<p>QUIC is a good start, but from the protocol stack&#x27;s perspective it&#x27;s a hack. 10-15 years ago, it simply would have been a new revision of SCTP. But the design is being pushed by an advertising company that just wants an 8% reduction in traffic so they can increase their shareholder dividend. They don&#x27;t give a crap about evolving the stack to actually improve computing as a whole, which is what the standards are really intended for.')
