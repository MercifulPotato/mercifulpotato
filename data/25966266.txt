Gained lot of knowledge (tech, product, business etc) through trial and error with multiple attempts over the years in my career. Finally am at a point when I can bootstrap almost any idea as a solo founder and fill gaps with contractors as needs arise.<p>One of my tech companies (solely owned by me) makes 10+ millions (USD) in profit every year. This help me lead a good lifestyle in one of the most livable but expensive cities in the world (and it is not a tech center). I work from home and spend a lot of time with family. I love how much time I can spend with my wife and kids. This is the biggest benefit.<p>I have some ideas which have a strong chance to be a unicorn. But I have de-prioritized them, mainly because Covid has been really challenging and I want to focus on supporting myself and the family during this difficult year.<p>If I was still in Bay Area, there is a good chance that peer pressure might have pushed me to prioritize work more. One one hand I would have had a higher chance of making a lot more money, on the other hand sometime you think what&#x27;s the point of it if I can&#x27;t spend time with my family. So it might be a Pro for some and Con for others.<p>One thing which did help is that I made this move after I already had reasonable success!')
