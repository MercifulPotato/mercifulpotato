However the latent heat of vaporization for LNG is very low, it will vaporize quickly as it spreads out, unlike crude oil. You certainly won&#x27;t get a flaming tsunami - you can actually extinguish a flame in LNG.<p>Transport of oil through populated areas is quite common. Local governments that have restricted its transport are welcome to do the same for LNG.')
