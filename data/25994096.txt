Item(by='genewitch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612214279, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25991221, text='&gt; The only gripe I have is the possibility to introduce ASCII diagrams, which usually aren&#x27;t accessible.<p>CAD software exports .stl files which can be processed into instructions for machines. That is, there is already software that can take lines on a screen and convert it to instructions for a machine. There&#x27;s probably a way to annotate ASCII images of drawings (schematics, architectural) and output text &quot;text* drawing of an object 14 centimeters by 5 centimeters, ...&quot; Stuff like vinyl cutters (and even the proprietary cricut) can take vector graphics and convert them to instructions for a machine. so it, in theory, might be possible to just paste the ascii drawing text into some software: render ascii as .svg&#x2F;vector, convert to 2d stl (&quot;a layer&quot;), convert stl to descriptive text. Since the software renders, you don&#x27;t need OCR for the annotations, which are mostly instructions.<p>if there&#x27;s no annotation, assume the &#x27;-&#x27;, &#x27;_&#x27;, &#x27;|&#x27;, etc are to scale, and just use &quot;units&quot; as the dimensions instead of centimeters or whatever. |----| = &#x27;two verticals separated with a 4 unit line&#x27;<p>Am i crazy?')
