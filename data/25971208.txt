With a debit card or an app in the phone, it&#x27;s almost as good. The real question is why they need a new currency instead of using the current one?<p>[1] I don&#x27;t know the name. Here in Argentina we have a &quot;National Bank&quot;, and also the &quot;Central Bank&quot; that is somewhat like the Federal Reserve, and a few other national banks that are privatized and nationalized back from time to time.
