Then users can choose the license that&#x27;s best for their purposes.<p>This approach is currently playing out with some for-profit software companies that want to offer open source to end users, yet don&#x27;t want to enable direct competitors (e.g. Elastic vs. Amazon) or do want to enable for-pay customers to bypass sharing work (e.g. I write GPL software, and one of my regulated-industry customers prefers to pay for a proprietary license rather than use GPL).')
