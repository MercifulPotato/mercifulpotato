The transfer of power from Obama was smooth and cooperative. Hillary Clinton did not filed dozens of court cases with made up claims that ended up thrown away from those courts. Hillary Clinton did not tried to stop the vote counting either.<p>Hillary Clinton camp pointing out that they won popular vote is completely within their free speech rights and is not an attack on election system itself. Comparing length of lines in various district and fighting with id mandates or so that students can vote in school and dont have to travel are completely valid too.<p>What Trump and Republican party did this years is completely incomparable.')
