Remaining small percentage of objects is freed via reference counting.<p>The developer doesn&#x27;t need to change anything in their code. &quot;It just works&quot;, like in Python, Go, or Java, except there&#x27;s no heavy GC tracing everything or expensive RC for each object.<p>taken from vlang.io')
