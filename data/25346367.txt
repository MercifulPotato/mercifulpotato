We all have flaws though and it&#x27;s unrealistic to expect perfect opinions from anyone. Who decides what perfect is anyway?<p>I absolutely think there is something to learn from his approach, though I think he has much in common with other highly successful people. My old boss actually had a similar attitude and she accomplished amazing things in her life. In the same way the person you replied to was describing, she would say she was going to do something and people would go &quot;yeah sure.&quot; And then she would do them. It seemed like bullshit, then it was real.<p>First and foremost, it&#x27;s not about money or opportunity, those are just amplifiers. Without the money it wouldn&#x27;t be Mars, it would be a local bike co-op. The magic is in an attitude that is low on fear, high on hope, unconcerned what others will think, and always reaching for the most awesome outcome, right on the edge of what seems possible. My old boss had a moment where her son had just started working mall retail, then suddenly he was meeting the CEO and becoming a brand ambassador. She said &quot;he&#x27;s starting to realize he can do awesome shit,&quot; like she was Obi-wan teaching Luke about the force. Most people have set an artificial cap on their potential and accomplishments by believing that the world is a harsh and shit place and that something truly good happening is an impossibility. And then all the opportunities to change their world in big and small ways sail right on past them.<p>Put another way, I think it&#x27;s about learning how to be a creator of new realities and not just living in other people&#x27;s realities.')
