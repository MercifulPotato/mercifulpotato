M1 is just the beginning. New Axx chips are going 5nm too.<p>I would trust Charlie over at SemiAccurate before I trust TrendForce.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this isn&#x27;t true or accurate, I&#x27;m saying that Apple&#x27;s manufacturing demands are enormous just for iPhone &#x2F; iPad chips, and now M1 has invigorated demand for desktop &#x2F; laptop Mac products, at least amongst nerdier types like us, but wherever we go, the mainstream inevitably follows. Once &quot;normal&quot; people start using MacBook Pros and realize they now have 2-4 day battery life (or even longer for light users), then its only a matter of time until demand rises. I think Apple has anticipated this to some degree.<p>Not to mention, 2021 is supposed to be the Year of the Mx iMac &#x2F; Mac Pro.<p>Ultimately, this is just a terrible time to be Intel. They&#x27;re at least 2-3 years away from any worthwhile new product on their <i>own</i> nodes. 10nm is still a shitshow and 7nm isn&#x27;t faring much better.')
