I’m at a point where I’m ok with that risk. At some point you would be too: 85%? 90%? 99%? Clearly we agree Jeff Bezos doesn’t need 6 months cash on hand at all times. So the limit is somewhere. I think a total market collapse reducing the Dow Jones to like 3,000 is pretty unthinkable at this point. Or rather, if it did happen, there are bigger problems than my cash, like the zombie apocalypse which caused this horrific stock market collapse.')
