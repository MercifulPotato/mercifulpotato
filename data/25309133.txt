Take random amino acid sequence, maybe bias pulling out of the bag of letters in a reasonable distribution, then pick sequences that AlphaFold2 thinks will collapse into a volume in any way smaller than their expected free chain radius; then start mutating this sequence, selecting for sequences that decrease the chain radius.  Sort of a GA descent on chain radius.<p>My question are as follows:<p>1. Does AlphaFold ever converge on structures in this fashion at all?  As in, is the heuristic able to identify partial folds, or, is foldability somehow encoded either through evolutionary history?<p>2. If it does, are the structures that it identifies truly compact (measurable through sedimentation centrifugation) and solvable using conventional techniques?  I suspect if the first than definitely the second because of sample bias.<p>3. If it does identify compact structures, are they novel sequences or sequences homologous to existing structures?  If the former, then AlphaFold is truly extrapolating.  If the latter, then it&#x27;s only interpolating.<p>It would be super cool if AlphaFold discovered a &quot;new fold&quot; (for those who are unfamiliar with the jargon, a fold is a family of homologous sequences that create defined structure, novelty is gauged by homology, not the end structure; you can have the same structure created by wildly different sequences).  It would be even cooler if AlphaFold discovered a new motif (besides alpha helix, beta sheet, and the known turns&#x2F;chains).  But I think that is rather unlikely.<p>4. If you change your bag distribution by using a primitive aa set (delete histidines, tryptophans, enrich for leucines and serines) how do your search dynamics change?')
