A quick websearch and I found that currently they seem to be 10 x better than oil and coal etc:<p>&gt; Making solar or photovoltaic cells requires potentially toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury and cadmium. It even produces greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, that contribute to global warming. Still, the researchers found that if people switched from conventional fossil fuel-burning power plants to solar cells, air pollution would be cut by roughly 90 percent. Although manufacturing solar cells requires heavy metals, the researchers noted that coal and oil also contain heavy metals, which get released during combustion<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;2324-solar-power-greenhouse-emissions-measured.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;2324-solar-power-greenhouse-emis...</a><p>&gt; Mining the material to produce them ...<p>I think everything is off the table then, also your laptop or tablet -- websearch for &quot;minerals laptop environment&quot; for example.<p>It seems you don&#x27;t like solar panels?')
