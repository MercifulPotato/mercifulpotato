[...]  That&#x27;s not age speaking. They are just two fundamentally different things.</i><p>The iPhone was just one example. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether the new thing is Android, or Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or latest FPGA from Xilinx&#x2F;Altera.  Even though all of those can do much more advanced things than the toy computers I used to play with, none of those spark me with the same excitement.  I <i>could</i> pass it off as being too worldly-wise (i.e. disillusionment) to play with Raspberry Pi and Arduino -- or I can just admit that the best explanation for my apathy about new tech is that I&#x27;m simply older and lost interest.<p>With a TI-99 toy computer, playing a primitive Space Invaders game and typing BASIC code like <i>&quot;10 PRINT &quot;HELLO&quot;; 20 GOTO 10&quot;</i> to giggle at the &quot;HELLO&quot; infinitely scrolling up the screen was fun.  Today, I can type Javascript by pressing F12 in a web browser and it <i>objectively has more power</i> than TI-BASIC but it&#x27;s not as fun.  That contradiction of power-vs-fun just means I simply older.  There are lots of folks out there genuinely having fun exploring what Javascript can do and it would be silly for me to claim that I previously had fun because TI-BASIC was &quot;superior&quot; to Javascript.')
