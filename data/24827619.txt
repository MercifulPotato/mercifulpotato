All we know is that there exists a laptop, the source of which is unknown. It could have been Hunter Biden dropping the laptop into the repair shop. It could have been Vladmir Putin dropping it off for all we know. We certainly don&#x27;t know if the laptop is Biden&#x27;s. All we do know is that the story told by the repair shop guy is highly suspicious - including the explanation for why exactly he looked into the contents and why exactly he got into contact with Rudy Giuliani, or indeed whether he got in contact with Giuliani at all.')
