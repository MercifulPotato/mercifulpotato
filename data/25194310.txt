They&#x27;re not primarily driven by differences in access to or effectiveness in health care. He also makes the case for a few other very unintuitive points:<p>* Health care spending is a direct function of national wealth. If a country gets richer it spends more on health care, and every country at every time in modern history spends about the same amount on health care as a function of its wealth.<p>* The US looks like an outlier in health care spending because GDP is not a perfect measure of wealth. Actual Individual Consumption is a less well-known but much more relevant measure of national wealth. AIC shows the US is more of an outlier in wealth, which makes its high health care spending less remarkable.<p>* There&#x27;s no magic bullet. Single payer nations pay less than the US mostly because they are less wealthy and health care spending is a function of wealth. Other countries have better health outcomes mostly because of demographics and culture, which can&#x27;t be fixed by the health care system. And even though finding obvious waste and inefficiency in the US health care system is easy, at a macro level it doesn&#x27;t look like the US is remarkably less efficient than other rich countries, and most spending goes towards things that patients want.')
