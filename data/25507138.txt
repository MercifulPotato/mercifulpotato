Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608651005, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25503541, text='Buses are under-utilized, but walking and various forms of wheeled transportation (motorized longboards, those one wheel things, bikes, scooters, etc) are popular.<p>San Francisco is only about 7 miles wide.  You can walk from one side of the city to the other in about 2 hours.  When I lived there, I walked almost everywhere.  The only times I did otherwise was when it was a really long walk (over 45 minutes), or I needed to be somewhere fast.  The bus will not get you anywhere fast, it&#x27;s only about twice as fast as walking.  I think that&#x27;s why a lot of people use Lyft.  The buses are actually quite nice inside imo, they&#x27;re just slow.  Plus the stigma that only poor people ride the bus.')
