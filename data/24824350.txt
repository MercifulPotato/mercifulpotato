This runs each individual equation through LaTeX so the equations you see are not some rough approximation of the PDF but very literally what you&#x27;ll see. You can also manually make preview environments to wrap around ERTs like your TikZ diagrams. In both cases, when you actually edit the equation or ERT you&#x27;ll still get the classic editor. Apart from that, it makes it feel like you&#x27;re really editing the PDF directly.<p>* Another useful well-hidden feature is math macros. These are a lot like LaTeX&#x27;s \\newcommand, except that in LyX a math macro has three parts: the command name (plus any arguments), what literal LaTeX should be output, and a visual approximation to show up in equations that you&#x27;re editing. That means that if there&#x27;s some command in a package that LyX doesn&#x27;t recognise (e.g. \\foo) then you can make your own name for it (e.g. \\myfoo), map its real LaTeX to \\foo and its LyX display to whatever LyX-recognised features look vaguely like the real thing and then use that macro in your equations. Admittedly, this does require more upfront effort than using the LaTeX package directly but I think the payoff can be worth it.')
