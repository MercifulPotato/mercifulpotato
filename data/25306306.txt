Those can be overcome and eventually will.<p>The really serious problems are organizational in nature: the overgrowth of bureaucracy, the jungle of policies and &quot;sort-of&quot; policies that can be weaponized, the emergence of an inner clique skilled in navigating the quagmire, and the resulting impossibly high barrier to entry for new contributors.<p>The experience of contributing to Wikipedia these days is inherently adversarial. People come and write something genuinely useful or at least do so in good faith, and then realize they unleashed on themselves a whole lengthy process when they have to defend what they did on numerous talk pages over an extended period of time, or succumb to deletionists. Even if they prevail, the experience is hardly pleasant, so they eventually leave and never look back.<p>An artefact of the above is also that the editorial base suffers from an overrepresentation of people with vested interests, as they will always be the most highly-motivated to stay. There are of course many great editors too but the way things are going, the project is not sustainable, and its quality is being compromised due to an organizational failure.<p>What Wikipedia needs is not Markdown (not that I have anything against it) but courage, fresh air, and less of the siege mentality.')
