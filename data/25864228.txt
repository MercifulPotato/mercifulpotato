There has been at least one outage per month for the past several months. And what&#x27;s worse is that I&#x27;ve never seen a postmortem published. It&#x27;s hard to maintain confidence in a service that isn&#x27;t being transparent about why they keep having outages, or what they&#x27;re doing to prevent future outages.')
