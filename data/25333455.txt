When you use tap&amp;pay from your device, you&#x27;re paying with a DPAN (device&#x2F;digital primary account number), which was generated when you add the card to your phone (the number on your card itself is the FPAN (f = funding)).  You can see the last-4 for this card within the App or when you pay at a store the the receipt shows you your last-4 of your card (it&#x27;ll be different than your normal card.<p>I feel like the networks don&#x27;t want new PANs per transaction, so you can get new ones, but the address space may not be large enough to high card # turnover.')
