Regarding her list, I believe at the time twitter users were citing a law saying what she was recommending was getting close to being illegal. They called it citizen intimidation, yet with more formal wording.<p>AOC wasn&#x27;t the best example. The best examples were people saying it was good Rand Paul had been injured by his neighbor and the professor saying Mike Adams suicide was good.<p>I hadn&#x27;t seen the AOC tweet you linked. It does appear uniting at first, yet when I looked closer I saw a familiar persuasion trick. It seems like she&#x27;s applying the argument that anyone who has certain beliefs is a white supremist.<p>One of the most divisive things these days is labeling all people with conservative beliefs racist. It seems racist has become a catch-all term for anything postmodernists disagree with.<p>Calling someone racist means you don&#x27;t listen to them and you can cause them to lose their reputation even if the claims don&#x27;t have merit. The parody account Titania McGrath helps outline how the definition of racism has changed.')
