Every tutorial goes through these exact same motions for learning a new language. It sucks! Programmers can figure out what a variable is, or how to use an array or a map. Those things really don&#x27;t change a whole lot between languages. What about how to import code from different modules? Best practices for organizing code? How your language differs from its competitors as far as usage. Testing practices (which often influence how your code is written), etc...<p>Learning Elixir was tough for me until I found Dave Thomas&#x27; &quot;Elixir for Programmers&quot; where he skipped all of the basic stuff that every programmer is assumed to know and went right to what makes Elixir unique and how to leverage it correctly.

I am hoping to find a &#x27;Go for Programmers&#x27; one day. I asked on Reddit a while back and was pretty much handed the &quot;what are variables&quot; document.')
