I would not be sure you can extrapolate that for immunity after a specific vaccination. The vaccine from Mainz &#x2F; Mayence for example trains your immunity by introducing just parts of the shell &#x2F; shell dna &#x2F; rna. Could work even better for immunity or worse,  one has to study that for every vaccine seperatly, I think.')
