We could write everything in terms that are completely unambiguous —- like some awful formally-verified programming language —- so people on HN couldn’t possibly adopt an absurdist interpretation and spend time knocking it down. Or alternatively, we can just use common sense and the world can be a slightly more interesting and mysterious place.')
