Item(by='heimatau', descendants=None, kids=[24737845], score=None, time=1602259452, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24728473, text='&gt; especially libertarians are not aggressive<p>Depends on the subgroup.<p>&gt; As for the belief that the left are intellectually superior, that&#x27;s not specific to tech firms.<p>IMHO, I feel this is an organic collusion of messaging. Like the boomers felt a little envious to Leftist ideas and it shows in how boomers are teaching future generations. I don&#x27;t think this is intentional but there does seem to be an implicit shift in the writings that teach the youth. I grew up in the public education system and various books almost <i>assume</i> that Leftists are more critical thinkers. It could be a phrasing of a topic or a popular narrative that has taken root in the culture. Compound this overtime, you have a new generation that assumes the indirect messaging that they&#x27;ve been conditioned on.<p>In conclusion, I think you&#x27;re getting a lot of downvotes for two reasons. 1. You&#x27;re making grand&#x2F;general statements without supportive points. 2. You are contrarian to the current zeitgeist. I happen to agree with your main points (sheep are sheep and wolves are making sheep frantic). I wish more people were critical thinkers.')
