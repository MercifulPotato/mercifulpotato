I feel like in an era where it&#x27;s easier and more prolific to crucify a person because of their words than in the known history of mankind, the distinction between &quot;grenade&quot; and &quot;stun grenade&quot; should be made.<p>Does that make this okay? No. Not even a little. But let&#x27;s err on the side of clearer communication.')
