You had said that they public health care listened better, I wanted to refute that.  I also recognize that in private health care your insurance and ability to pay impact the health care you receive.  I don&#x27;t think that is the best mechanism to provide good care for the entire population.<p>All I am saying is that if they can&#x27;t explain things better than take this pill, than I wouldn&#x27;t trust them.  Like I said, I trust their education (which is the certifications) but I will certainly run questions up the flagpole if I have them.  They shouldn&#x27;t be given &quot;god like&quot; carte blanche status in terms of no questions.<p>That last question is a tough one - I would wager it is because everyone knows someone who has had some bad experiences, and there have been many a story about seriously effed up medical experiences. Most people can&#x27;t do statistics and then get deeply concerned that the likelihood that they might have bad experience then spills over into lack of trust.  That&#x27;s my two second hot take.')
