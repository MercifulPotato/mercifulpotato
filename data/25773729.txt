Who gets what is defined through various public policies, grants, subsidies, procurement. Maybe a chunk of your taxes will be allotted to social programs, another chunk to NASA and maybe another chunk to various endowments such as the Humanities and the Arts.<p>Moreover, the issue isn&#x27;t just how tax revenue is spend. The issue is just as much in how taxes are levied. Income taxes for individuals vary from taxes on financial instruments, corporate taxes, value added taxes and various other taxes. Or even the taxes that get tacked on your various utility bills, the estate you inherit from a loved one and so on.<p>&gt; Or is it just pocketed by someone who already has more money than you?<p>Money is often seen as a store of value. The more you have of it, the better of you are. But that&#x27;s only part of the story.<p>Money only gains real value when it is exchanged. That&#x27;s how wealth is created. Money acts as &quot;oil in an engine&quot;. If money doesn&#x27;t get exchanged, you have an economic crisis.<p>The big issue is today is that 50 years of complex global policy making have generated dynamics that pushed holes in the engine, causing that oil to leak away. Where to? The financial markets. Where money is exchanged for debts.<p>If you want an equitable economy, you have to address fiscal and monetary policies first. Not this &quot;who gets my money&quot; argument.')
