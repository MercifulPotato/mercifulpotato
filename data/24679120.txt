I don&#x27;t know, the system I hate so much, because of the ones that&#x27;ve always betrayed people like Aaron.<p>Such great documentary if you haven&#x27;t watched already and know about this amazing human being.<p>His website (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaronsw.com&#x2F;weblog&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaronsw.com&#x2F;weblog&#x2F;</a>) is still online if you also want to read what he was thinking and making, before they cornered him, forced him, feared him, took his hope and killed him.
