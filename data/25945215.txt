And higher management comes more naturally to people who have spent their childhood in an ethical framework that divides people into manageable units, too.<p>My working class &#x2F; middle class parents just didn&#x27;t have room in their worldview for having employees, nor would they feel comfortable delegating their household aspects to maids and the like. When we had kids my wife and I couldn&#x27;t imagine having a nanny (despite being able to afford it) while many of those around us didn&#x27;t blink at it.<p>I remember working at a startup in the 00s and having to peel out of the office every day at 5:30 to get my daughter from daycare and my (silver spoon raised) boss saying something like &quot;we need to pitch into get you a nanny&quot; and it struck me then how that kind of thing was really tied to &quot;entrepreneurship.&quot; I didn&#x27;t _want_ a nanny, I liked my daughter&#x27;s daycare, and I very much enjoyed picking her up and getting my hug at the end of her day of play and learning with a group of kids.<p>Connections, money, yes, but also a managerial&#x2F;directive ethic, no qualms about telling other people what to do and paying as little as possible for it.')
