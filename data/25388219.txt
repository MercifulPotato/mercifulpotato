Android blew all of that wide open, and now the most popular phone OS in the world is an open source Linux based OS. This is what we were all dreaming about back then. I feel like this is an incredibly underappreciated fact.<p>Yes, some carriers lock down their Android phones, because it&#x27;s an open platform, so carriers can do what they want with it, but since the dawn of Android there have <i>always</i> been high end Android phones that were trivial to put into developer mode and install whatever wacky OS mods you want.')
