It really shook me at the time. I wasn&#x27;t traumatized or anything but it made a strong impact on me.<p>These days I expect that most teens experience this at like 12yo on their smartphones. Last week I was linked a reddit video of some guy dying in absolutely gruesome circumstance due to an industrial accident. And then there&#x27;s the constant influx of disinformation. Did you know that Hydroxychloroquine cures HIV? I saw a Youtube video claiming just that yesterday.<p>Leaving a kid on the internet is like living them on a shaddy part of town for hours at a time. I&#x27;m old enough that I only had internet at home when I turned 18, in hindsight I feel like I dodged a bullet.')
