It&#x27;s that they insist on injecting mystery box plotlines and ending seasons without resolving some of them. They do this to keep you bingeing, but the end result is a lot of annoyed fans who put in the time and invest in the show without any resolution.<p>Instead of they shift to a one-and-done model with room for more seasons, then it wouldn&#x27;t matter.<p>Now Netflix has a vast library of content, yay for them, but full of half unfinished stories. Imagine going to the library with the back half of the books missing. Would you want to read the first half of the book?')
