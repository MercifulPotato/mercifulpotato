Write the contents of the vote totals on the outside of the box containing the ballots (total must reconcile to number of ballots placed in), then total all the box totals at the end for a single constituency. Constituencies then report back.<p>We get results back within a day and the validity has never been seriously questioned. The process can easily scale linearly too.')
