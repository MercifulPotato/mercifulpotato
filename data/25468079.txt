I&#x27;m just over 30 and I&#x27;ve felt that way for a while. I have a lot on my plate but other than that I live alone so I do have the time and energy to focus on learning the bleeding edge and I do enjoy it. But the truth is, the exact things described in that post kill my motivation. And here&#x27;s an interesting fact: I spent almost 9 years working in one company. The only reason why I stuck around for so long was the absence of all the ridiculous reporting, filling jira tickets and all that dreadful crap. We had a relatively small but very solid team with simple rules and procedures: everything that needs to be done is done with well-described and documented gitlab issues, each issue gets it&#x27;s own branch, do what you have to do, push, open a merge request to the lead developer(me for the past several years). Simple and straightforward, releases were always ready well before the deadlines, developers staying with the team for 5+ years on average, even when offered double what they were making. What changed? The exact thing that the reddit post described: new management, endless bureaucratic crap, endless made up acronyms, pointless meetings with tons of questions not worth discussing(ex: &quot;Apple doesn&#x27;t allow this so we can&#x27;t do it&quot;, followed by 3 hours of discussions as to who should we talk to to get it up anyway) and to top this off: &quot;hey there&#x27;s this other team that doesn&#x27;t do anything, we&#x27;ll mash the two together so they have something to do&quot;. As a result all the most senior members(myself included) decided to quit, non-negotiable. it really pains me to see how much ego, bureaucracy and arrogance I see everywhere. Needless to say, I had to make some compromise with all that but it is insanely frustrating.<p>I feel like most of the software engineering world is going through a Steve Ballmer crisis: the industry is dictated by people who know nothing about the inner workings. As a result unnecessary solutions are pushed down our throats: &quot;We should use X technology&quot;. Fine, but why, it will be slow, unmanageable and will leave us pegged to the company that developed it? &quot;Nonsense, it is the best, everybody is using X&quot;. And 6 months later...')
