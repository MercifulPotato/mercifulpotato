All of which are obvious and based around domain jargon - all very hard to copyright.<p>However what interests me about this case is how fast it all unravels<p>Is this about the math.sum part of about the lang.java part? It cannot be the math.sum because then every other language from Rust to Python gets clobbered.<p>If it is about the lang.java then hey maybe Oracle has a point.  But it only means &quot;you cannot copy lang.java.math.sum and that surely is an accident of language design - for example in Python the same call is math.isinf.  That&#x27;s the part used in the code that I write, that&#x27;s the import signature.  The API.<p>So from my pov this should be a very narrow ruling - if the import signature is not obvious and is unique (lang.java.x) then yeah fine Google, they stole your developers.<p>I also wonder about how transferable the obvious part is - math.ist_unendlich is fine for german speakers. Is that obvious if the rest of the manual is in English?<p>And if Google had gone for lang.gava.math.sum (don&#x27;t tell me it was not at least discussed :-)?<p>It does overall seem a big fuss over a small hill of beans.  If the supreme court rules in a narrow and well defined manner they just move the industry in favour of open and free, in a broad and badly defined manner they move the industry off US shores.  Neither side is that bad for the software world')
