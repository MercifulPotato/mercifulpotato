And that company thanking him for meeting with his father.<p>If Donald Trump Jr. did this exact thing and his father was the person in the email, would he get a Twitter removal?  Would there have been an army of Twitter moderators in the wings to protect his privacy?  Would they ban the Biden campaign from even mentioning the article existed?<p>And yes, you know what I&#x27;m going to say.  &quot;Yeah right.&quot;  Because the reasons Twitter gave for the takedown happened quite a while afterwards and they had to change their policy to justify it.<p>Currently, acquired knowledge of Trump&#x27;s taxes is PII, and it&#x27;s illegal.  That hasn&#x27;t stopped Twitter from doing absolutely nothing about it, along with hundreds of other high-profile examples over the years.')
