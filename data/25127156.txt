It&#x27;s clearly optimized for backend services assuming they are the only app running trying to squeeze all performance out. But a desktop app needs to be lean, and currently I&#x27;m not sure the JVM is tuned to those use cases, and Java is missing a few features for lightweight objects that could help as well with memory usage.')
