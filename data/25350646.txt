These are two bluetooth devices on same audio stream.<p>Does your solved problem bluetooth headphones RELIABLY connect to your current device (without having to unpaid with another device). That is game changing.<p>The problem is, folks have listened to folks like you so many times and gotten BURNED so many times. Oh, it &quot;should&quot; work you say.
