There are a ton of disempowered neighbors who don&#x27;t have the time or the wherewithall to politically organize the way NIMBYs do.<p>&quot;Why does this situation invite pejorative terms and scorn from people who have no skin in the game?&quot; Because the large balance of data we have shows that pretty much everywhere NIMBYs are a minority of the population, and this is once again an example of the minority rule issues that the US is struggling with. Also, pretty strange to throw in the &quot;skin in the game&quot; comment there. Who has more skin in the game, a renter who is paying 1800&#x2F;month for their housing or someone who inherited a house and does not pay a monthly fee to have a place to live?')
