Everyone here is talking about the problem as if we can actually make positive changes. But I don&#x27;t think we can. I don&#x27;t think obamacare was an improvement for most americans.<p>Congress is bought and paid for by the lobbies, and no matter who we put into office, nothing about healthcare is going to get better, and it will probably get worse.<p>First we have to understand the problem and admit what the problem really is.
