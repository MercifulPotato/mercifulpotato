I have a color card but it only gets used in very complex lighting situation when I need some help understanding what the lighting was to resolve some color issues. I may use SpyderCube when working with indoor light that I do not control.<p>My understanding of is that brain works in a different way when interpreting moving and still images. In a moving image the differences from reality are much more easily picked up by the brain and so color or image distortion problems stand out much more.<p>Also, I think, brain is trained to some particular standards of how the moving image is shot and processed. We can easily recognize &quot;movie&quot; or &quot;television&quot; shooting and processing methods and this is starkly visible when somebody is messing with it. For example, The Fellowship of The Ring looked very strange to me the first time I watched it because of how smooth it was due to higher framerate, but at the same time I did not find it out of place for television.')
