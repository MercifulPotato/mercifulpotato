I love it, I usually order mine with mayo on top, wrap them with paper and let it soak in on the drive home. Makes the fries delicous. And I order an extra packet of mayo on the side because they usually don&#x27;t put enough on top.<p>But, in any other situation if mayo is involved I&#x27;m grossed out to the point of puking. Even when I just smell the mayo (from the same brand) someone is putting on their plate of vegetables or whatever.')
