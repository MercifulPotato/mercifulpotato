There&#x27;s a great Mexican podcast that talks about this &quot;accident&quot;.<p>The outrageous thing is how incompetent,  corrupt and lazy our Mexican government is. That this radioactive material was used for construction.  And there ARE still radioactive houses all around the country.  And of course nobody is responsible.
