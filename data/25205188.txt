Apple&#x27;s ARM processors are unlike anyone else&#x27;s, and everyone else&#x27;s ARM processors are not particularly impressive. The power&#x2F;performance isn&#x27;t really there, and scaling performance up is not linear, either. You can&#x27;t just &quot;make it bigger&quot; and retain the same power&#x2F;performance ratio you had. The 1W power draw that the &#x27;big&#x27; ARM cores target, like the Cortex-A78, isn&#x27;t even that special. You can run x86 cores at 1W&#x2F;core all day long as well. How it performs at the power level is the question, but the ARM cores don&#x27;t really perform all that well. See for example the slaughtering that is the 64-core Graviton2 vs. the 64-core Epyc Rome: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=article&amp;item=epyc-vs-graviton2&amp;num=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=article&amp;item=epyc-vs-...</a> (spoiler, the x86 chip has an overall performance lead of 50%, and they really aren&#x27;t targeting that different of a power budget)<p>But even the M1 isn&#x27;t an order of magnitude ahead on power&#x2F;performance ratio. It&#x27;s the leader, but it&#x27;s sure as shit not 10x faster for the same power draw.')
