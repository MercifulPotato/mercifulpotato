Alcohol is sneaky and before you know it, an alcohol habit that starts out as a &quot;occasional drink to unwind&quot; after a long, stressful day of work becomes a daily routine or focus of your existence.<p>I never fell into the spiral of alcoholism, but there was a point after college where I realized that I was drinking more than I wanted to for my own personal standards. And I found it was surprisingly more difficult than I initially anticipated to &quot;moderate&quot; the habit. Moderation didn&#x27;t work for me. I had to make the conscious decision to forcefully flip the switch back off and I made a commitment to never play with that fire again.')
