Motel paintings are often printed - you can tell by the CMYK dots if you come close enough.  Ross at least seems to use actual oil paint on canvas supported by real solvents which seems a lot higher quality than the usual school process using acrylics or temperas.  (Although granted using liquid white seems a bit dodgy).<p>So what is Ross missing.  Not enough detail?  Does not take enough time to paint a painting?  Not enough paint on the canvas?  Not photorealistic enough?  Too photorealistic?')
