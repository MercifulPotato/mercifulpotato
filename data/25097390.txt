Item(by='luord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605404636, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25088396, text='This resonates with me far, far more than most, if not all, articles, essays, think pieces, etc, about getting things done and procrastination I&#x27;ve ever read. Indeed, I have a serious problem with wanting to have something be perfect when I do it, so often I don&#x27;t feel like doing it. Ironically, that attitude has the result of sometimes making my work worse, since ultimately I end up having less time to do the work which can lead to sloppy results.<p>I&#x27;ll now have that nitpicky attitude in check and remind myself that not completely perfect merge&#x2F;pull requests are still work that my clients can see, and the feedback loop within them when they&#x27;re not perfect from the get go doesn&#x27;t necessarily have a downside, and can in fact improve communication and the flow of work. After all, a request is by definition not necessarily the work completed, but literally a request for feedback, and possibly iterating on the work already done.<p>I can even use a trick to mentally tell myself it doesn&#x27;t have to be perfect: I can start work everyday with the expectation that, at the end, I only need to create or update a <i>draft</i> merge&#x2F;pull request. That will get me even more easily into the mindset that I&#x27;m working to ask for feedback, not to deliver the final piece. Who knows, maybe by the end of the day the work will be good enough for a finished request, so it&#x27;s a win-win situation.<p>And that&#x27;s just one idea, that I need to put in action. I&#x27;ll see how it goes.')
