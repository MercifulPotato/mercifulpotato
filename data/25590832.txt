Sorry in advance for the novel.<p>I hate the name too, but the flag was a necessary compromise to get past an impasse.<p>The problem at the time was that fullscreen WebGL in Firefox was an absolutely terrible experience on some machines, because they did a readback of the full framebuffer from the GPU to the CPU every frame. This didn&#x27;t just make that tab slow, or even just the whole browser. It actually bogged down the entire computer. It made the mouse pointer skip. It was beyond unacceptable.<p>My preferred solution was that Firefox should disable WebGL on these machines. But the Firefox team did not want to do that, because it sort of worked OK as long as the canvas was only a small fraction of the screen. They also didn&#x27;t want to expose any way of specifically detecting or disallowing readbacks. But no fullscreen WebGL application could be launched to a wide audience when a significant fraction of users would have their entire computer bog down and mouse pointer start skipping just loading the page.<p>So why couldn&#x27;t you &quot;just&quot; detect that the framerate was low and turn off WebGL yourself? The problem with that is the first few frames at page load time are often slow for various reasons, some GPU related and some not. You have to render frames for a couple of seconds before you can reliably measure the steady state performance, and during that time the user&#x27;s mouse pointer is skipping and they&#x27;re already having a really bad time. If you then decide to disable WebGL, all that loading time and bandwidth was wasted and you have to start again loading your fallback content. So yeah you can measure performance but it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem. Users still have a bad time.<p>As for the name, it was suggested (perhaps jokingly) by a Mozilla engineer and I decided to go with it for the proposal because they were the ones that needed convincing, and I figured they were more likely to accept a name that they suggested themselves. Bikeshedding the name could easily have derailed the whole thing.<p>I still wish that Firefox had just disabled WebGL on those machines, or at least agreed to provide an explicit way to detect and&#x2F;or disallow readbacks. Then we wouldn&#x27;t have needed the vaguely specified compromise solution.')
