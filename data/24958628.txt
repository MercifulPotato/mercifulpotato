What is being questioned is the rest of the so-called email dump.  Emails that actually suggest damaging claims and which would be worth looking into.  How strange it is that people like you cannot seem to come up with answers on those.  It is so easy do to, just provide the full emails so that we can all continue to see the content and context of the entire conversation.<p>I could easily send you an email from my gmail account asking if you have managed to get burn all of the films Epstein made of you and those little kids on his island.  It too would have a valid DKIM signature.  Now show me the follow up from Hunter, or even proof the message was actually seen by him.  If an actual hard drive was possessed as claimed then this would be trivial.  The fact that it is not available is damning in this case.  As has been noted repeatedly in this case an equally likely source of this data is an iCloud hack for some pics and the known hack of Burisma a while back.  Mix in some fake messages and then add useful idiots who are willing to believe anything if it supports their cause.<p>Thankfully this story will return to obscurity along with the partisan hacks trying to push it.  It was a lame attempt at an &#x27;October surprise&#x27;, it was executed poorly, and thankfully this time the means of viral distribution of same was limited while everyone looked into the story and then had a good laugh.')
