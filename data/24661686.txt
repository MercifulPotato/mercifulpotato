Courts\nimposed the death penalty more and more often and, by the late Middle Ages, were\ncondemning to death between 0.5 and 1.0% of all men of each generation, with perhaps just\nas many offenders dying at the scene of the crime or in prison while awaiting trial.\nMeanwhile, the homicide rate plummeted from the 14th century to the 20th. The pool of\nviolent men dried up until most murders occurred under conditions of jealousy,\nintoxication, or extreme stress. The decline in personal violence is usually attributed to\nharsher punishment and the longer-term effects of cultural conditioning. It may also be,\nhowever, that this new cultural environment selected against propensities for violence.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;147470491501300114" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;147470491501300...</a>')
