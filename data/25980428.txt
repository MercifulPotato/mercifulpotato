When the exchange itself halts, they (necessarily, mathematically) halt buts and sells. But there&#x27;s no correct answer <i>possible</i> for just one brokerage.<p>So now we go meta and ask &quot;should it be legal to be a brokerage without a much larger cash cushion than current rules? Or should clients be warned about the possibility of freezes like this? Or should buyers take responsibility and not put their money in discount low-quality brokerages if they want to day-trade run hedge-fund style manipulation plays?<p>All in all, if you hate sleazy hedge funds, you should have any sympathy for day traders and squeezers either, as as they intentionally are playing the same no-holds-barred game, not doing investing as the market system intends.<p>If you want to hold Melvin accountable <i>by law</i> for alleged misdeeds, it&#x27;s silly to say the law should <i>require brokers to aid in market manipulation activities against their own solvency interests</i>, instead of the law should require (and enforce) that Melvin do whatever they are doing wrong.')
