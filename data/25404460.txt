There are 800 backgrounds in the demake.  You want to fit this on a reasonable number of floppy disks, in this case it fits on 3.<p>If you use &quot;hi-res&quot; (140x192x6 colors) the graphics are 8k, 8 times bigger, so you need 24 disks which is a bit much.<p>Also with double-buffered hi-res graphics you waste 16k of RAM which is 1&#x2F;3 of all available RAM on a II+.  Double-buffered lo-res only takes 2k.')
