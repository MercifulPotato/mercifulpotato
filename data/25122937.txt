I don&#x27;t get one thingâ€”why can&#x27;t Twitter set up a system that alerts to such changes to verified accounts? Can&#x27;t they do a match on the name&#x2F;profile image that could alert them of a possible hack? I&#x27;m stumped as to why they don&#x27;t have such a system in place already considering not everyone has a verified account.')
