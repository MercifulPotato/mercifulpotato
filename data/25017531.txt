Sampling isn&#x27;t the only source of error in election polling - people also change their minds. In this election, people decided who they were going to vote for historically early - the lowest portion of people in the history of exit polls indicated they decided in the week before the election. In theory, this effect should reduce the width of the probability distribution, and yet, the polls were off again, in the same direction as they are always off, by a little bit more than average.<p>A little scrutiny here is worthwhile. In 2016, for example, the polls were off in part because pollsters weighted the black demographic in proportion to their voting behavior in 2008 and 2012 (when a black candidate was running, boosting turnout). The actual 2016 black turnout looked more similar to 2004 or 2000 - other elections where a black candidate wasn&#x27;t running. Though I haven&#x27;t dived into the 2020 polling data, it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if a similar effect were at play.<p>It&#x27;s also become noticeable harder to do polling. Once upon a time, everybody had a landline, so random dialing worked really well. Now, some people have more phones than others, and people are increasingly less willing to talk to pollsters, increasing the error rate.<p>These are all important things to talk about - when you dismiss it as &quot;oh yeah, polls are never perfect,&quot; you prematurely shut down the conversation. Don&#x27;t let perfect be the enemy of the good. The polls could be better and it&#x27;s important to talk about how.')
