(censorhip in air quotes to be light-hearted, not get off my free speech hatred), So many people have become accustomed to &#x27;google it&#x27; to find truth.. but there are many pages on the internet that won&#x27;t show in google results.<p>Sure I agree that with most of those (being ranked out for bad things), the world may be a better place without - but people should know that there are thousands of results on the web that they are not seeing for many searches.<p>I think for much of the world it is assumed that what is not on fbk or ggle does not exist - and people should be educated more about this.<p>search &#x27;sex chat&#x27; and when you get to the end you click for omitted, and get 360 results. I don&#x27;t think people typing that term are looking for google books the official chfi study guide - so they are clearly keeping many actual sex chat sites out of the results - and people should know that - and should probably be told why.<p>That&#x27;s without getting into the issues of why two sites take up four positions in the top 10 - and why most of the top 20 are there because they can afford to slip a few thousand dollars to writers to place a story about some (usually made-up &#x2F; fake) BS in a high PR site.<p>That too should be brought to the surfer&#x27;s attention - these things are influences not by what the average surfer is looking for - other ranking factors are at play, and these factors push down some results that aren&#x27;t as high brow as others, which may help sell ads.. not that that is what&#x27;s driving that.<p>Disclaimer - I have a few sites that I want to rank in the top 10 so with a dog in the race, ymmv yada yada.. of course I&#x27;ve also been keeping track of those results for many years, although much less the past few I&#x27;ve just given up trying to get the attention of big G.')
