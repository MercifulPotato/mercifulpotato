Item(by='arcticbull', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610591141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25771032, text='I don&#x27;t remember Dem politicians lying for years about how the police had children locked up in pizza shops (Republicans get to own this now that they ran and had elected a full-on QAnon congresswoman, Marjorie Taylor Greene), how much police hate America, how much the police are stealing from you, how much the police want to destroy America, how the police are un-American, how the police are socialists trying to turn America into Venezuela. And then suggesting they take a stroll to downtown Seattle. You know, for some peaceful protest.<p>Frankly if they had, I&#x27;d agree with you wholeheartedly. I&#x27;ve watched a ton of Fox over the last few years, and what the Republicans and also very explicitly Donald Trump are saying, is genuinely terrifying.<p>I <i>wish</i> the Democrats would speak out about how 0.7% of America is in prison right now - the world&#x27;s leading jailer per capita, how the long-term recidivism rate is over 80%, about civil asset forfeiture turning small-town cops into literal highway robbers to fund their departments, about how private prison contracts have <i>minimum</i> occupancy clauses, about how socioeconomic dysfunction leads minorities to interact with police 7X as much as white folks. How police shoot 10X as many people per capita in America as in Canada. They didn&#x27;t say a thing early on. If anything, some of this anger towards the police came from Democrats <i>not</i> saying what they need to early on. <i>Not</i> doing what they need to early on.<p>From that perspective, I do believe Democrats share some of the blame.')
