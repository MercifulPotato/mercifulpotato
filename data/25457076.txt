At its core ethics is about balances and tradeoffs: something creates some problems for one person, but creates some benefits for another person, is it moral? Is it right?<p>As a consequence her paper made a lot of points that came across as absurd like railing against models due to the electricity cost of training them, even though those costs are small relative to completely ordinary things everyone takes for granted, like driving to work and back.')
