Key reasons why Smalltalk lost so quickly:<p>IBM buying and redirecting OTI to Java yielding eventually Eclipse at the same time boosted Java and pulled the rug from under Smalltalk.<p>IBM starting to hire Smalltalk programmers from universities and redirecting them to Java.<p>IBM providing networking stack parts to Java to interoperate in the banking industry.<p>It all happened over a relatively short period of time. Java was not just cheaper but thanks to IBM the tooling and networking - still way behind the combo of Smalltalk&#x2F;Envy - was starting to be good enough.')
