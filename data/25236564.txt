The running time of our R estimation calculations for all regions is around 1.5 hours on a $10&#x2F;month Digital Ocean droplet.<p>Sometimes strange looking results on our site picked up by guests can be fed back to the maintainers of the datasource resulting in a correction of the data.<p>On our website, R value estimation is done by my father, a retired computer science professor with a long history of mathematical modelling experience. This is hacker news right? :)')
