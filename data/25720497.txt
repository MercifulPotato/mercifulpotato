The directors solution was to have mandatory 8 hours of sprint ceremonies a week where we would review the definition of “bug” and “epic”, every week. We also were required to sit in on all team meetings regardless if it was your team. We had two full time scrum masters for a team of six engineers.<p>I suggested instead engineers get looped earlier into the process with stakeholders. The director said it was a bad idea as we couldn’t possibly hope to understand the business side of things.<p>Very glad I got out')
