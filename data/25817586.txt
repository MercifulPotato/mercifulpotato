Naming a variable while listening to your favorite songs&#x27; lyrics may result in cognitive overload. You are more likely to name a variable after the singers&#x2F;songs name than what the variable is supposed to reflect (true story).<p>This point in the article lost me pretty quickly. My flow state is drastically improved by music, and I have never ever named a variable after the song name or song artist I&#x27;m listening to in my life.<p>Edit: Nor have I ever seen a variable named after a song name or artist.<p>Edit2: NotoriousViewController.
