That&#x27;s likely just a sign that &quot;examples&quot; is now examples of using the API, not examples of integrating with some GPU API.<p>One of the main reasons&#x2F;goals&#x2F;points of Dear ImGUI is being able to ingrate it into existing projects. It&#x27;s deliberately API agnostic. It generates a very simple command list that you can then trivially render yourself in your own engine.<p>Everything else, all the platform specific code in the repo is entirely there to help people understand how to use it or to get started.<p>It&#x27;s a mistake to think otherwise because it incorrectly limits Dear ImGUI&#x27;s perceived usefulness. If you believe you have to take a backend or use one of the APIs provided then you&#x27;ll mistakingly believe it would be hard to put in your existing game. If you understand what it&#x27;s really about then it&#x27;s trivial to put it in almost anything. That is by design.')
