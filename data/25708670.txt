It explicitly removes agency from those who commit crimes. The rioters&#x2F;insurrectionists were all bad people who made bad decisions on their own accord. The concept of incitement dilutes their responsibility. Trump didn&#x27;t hold a gun to their head and make them storm the capital. Hell, he didn&#x27;t even suggest it.<p>IMHO, incitement isn&#x27;t real. It&#x27;s just spreading blame to people who just made sounds come out of their head. It&#x27;s barely different than a thought crime.')
