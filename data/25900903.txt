Coil whine is obnoxious, fans spinning up constantly, headphone jack blew up. It&#x27;s just shit. Screen is nice tho and generally is fast. Hoping the replacement battery lasts longer now that I have capped the maximum charging to 80% capacity and only have a slow charger via USB-C.<p>Running NixOS on it.')
