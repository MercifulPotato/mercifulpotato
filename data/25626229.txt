The problem often is they don’t look beyond aggregates ( as Google&#x2F;Facebook flood marketers with dimensions, this one is easy to overlook). So it the overall ROI may be passable, but specific segments are over-analyzed (did YOU place the right message?) and others ignored. The platforms have never ever in any amount of years been willing to hand over raw clickstream logs of ad data, so marketers are forced to rely on misleading aggregates.<p>I’m sick of engineer elitism. Try harder to see that brilliant folks exist in every department. You’ll be a happier person and learn a lot more. Marketing analytics is fascinating and full of puzzles. Marketers were driving engineers to make multivariate testing scale 20 years ago.')
