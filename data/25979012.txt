Itâ€™s not for you or majority to decide how that community should live.<p>I agree with you on general gist but not this. Seriously? You don&#x27;t think muslim women are oppressed by these medieval age laws and need to be changed? You don&#x27;t think bringing religion into laws was a horrible idea, and live jihad is just the other side of the picture of triple talaq laws? You can&#x27;t just hate one side and turn blind to the evils of the other.')
