There haven&#x27;t been any new deals or increased partnerships announced to make this look less like they&#x27;re just giving up on the idea, and anyone thinking about partnering with them has to be wondering about the odds of getting much return on their investment relative to the risk of Google changing direction again.<p>Google is good at infrastructure but they&#x27;re not uniquely so and all of their competitors are better at building platforms. They have competitors from both of the dominant console vendors, dominant cloud service, and nVidia. Whatever technological edge they believe they have is going to be a tough sell, especially since both AWS and Microsoft can match or exceed their cloud infrastructure <i>and</i> all three services are available to any publisher who wants to roll their own.')
