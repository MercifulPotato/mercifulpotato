Heck, you can even take some proper notes that you will actually understand!<p>Ok. That&#x27;s a win for remote.<p>Now my turn: how easy is it to gauge the mood of your entire class, turn to the person next to you and whisper a question or look at their notes? Go for coffee with classmates afterwards to discuss? Pull the lecturer aside or knock on their door later that day if you&#x27;re stuck? Meet older students and grad students who can help you and inspire you?<p>People made the same &quot;it&#x27;s the future&quot; argument for remote education when MOOCs launched.
