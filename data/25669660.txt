I&#x27;m just clicking buttons to be able to use the app. Often I don&#x27;t even read the text on the button. And I think most people behave this way.<p>On the other hand as tech savvy person I have no expectation about what happens to the data that I enter into the app beyond expecting it not to be immediately published for everyone to see unless that&#x27;s what the app explicitely does.<p>I know data I entered might be viewed by unspecified number of people all over the world during normal operation, and that this data might be published at some point in the future. I&#x27;m hoping none of the unknown people that can view my data knows me personally or uses this data against me.<p>There&#x27;s no end to end encryption hosted service I currently trust to do what they say. If I were to transfer information that I don&#x27;t want under no circumstances to go public I&#x27;d have to research what wikileaks is now using for communication.<p>That&#x27;s the contract I&#x27;m operating under.
