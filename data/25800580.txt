Like when people say &quot;I&#x27;m calling my lawyer&quot; while referring to a firm with multiple names at the helm...<p>And the rest of your comment... did you actually read the comment? I said if you leave 10 million for the cost of litigation they got 50 dollars each.<p>See how there&#x27;s numbers between 110 and 0?<p>-<p>50 dollars is not pocket change for the average person, maybe for people on HN since we work in tech, but I bet relative to the worth of the average person represented, 50 dollars is worth more than the bonuses about to land where the majority of the 100 million that would otherwise benefit them is going.<p>It&#x27;s nothing like talking about the McDonalds CEO because the numbers involved are not pocket change if you apply critical thinking, 50 dollars from a one-time payout vs pocket change has very different dynamics for the recipient..')
