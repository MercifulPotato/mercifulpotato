A quick google suggests ReasonML is for targeting <i>native</i> platforms? But I used it for the web at one point?<p>Anyway, there was already a problem with like three different standard libraries (which had super annoying differences like swapping parameter orders, presumably in an attempt to be friendlier etc.) or something when I first messed around with ReasonML (Bucklescript? Whatever the Facebook one was in 2019? I dunno.) and I hope this isn&#x27;t also increasing that problem ?')
