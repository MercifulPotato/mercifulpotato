Then photosites measure intensity of light, which means that sensor only knows that the incoming photon is &quot;roughly green&quot;, but doesn&#x27;t actually recognize its precise wavelength.<p>So e.g. when the light is pure orange, it falls down into red wavelength range and is counted as red.<p>Based on this I would expect that cameras would often produce pretty incorrect colors, but they are usually pretty good (after correcting for stuff like white balance).')
