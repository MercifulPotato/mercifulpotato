If my city&#x27;s government installs ticket readers in every subway station and is then perpetually beholden to a single private company to upgrade&#x2F;maintain&#x2F;improve them, that feels like a problem.<p>Note that this doesn&#x27;t have to mean that someone with temporary access to the device should have full control over it! There&#x27;s still a place for secure boot-style systems; it&#x27;s all about who controls the keys.<p>&gt;a payment terminal taking card payments in a restaurant - as a diner I&#x27;d quite like some assurance that someone couldn&#x27;t tamper with it to record card details for example<p>This one is maybe a bit more concerning since it&#x27;s a card issued by a separate authority, you don&#x27;t have the ability to confirm transaction amounts on a device you trust, etc... but sure, in this case, I&#x27;d be fine with the hardware vendor or payment processor controlling the hardware.<p>(Though long-term I think this is a bit silly in the first place considering approximately everyone is walking around with computers in their pockets that would be perfectly capable of letting you confirm transaction amounts on a display you trust. Card payments currently are effectively handing someone your account details and saying &quot;pretty please only take as much as you say you will.&quot;)')
