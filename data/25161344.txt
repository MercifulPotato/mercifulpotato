It&#x27;s not fun but I see it as a minuscule sacrifice for me to wear a mask to the grocery store if it saves even one person a trip to the hospital. The sad reality is the grocery store _is_ a contaminated danger zone, and will be until we get this thing under control.<p>The sliver of good news is that lowering the growth rate just slightly from above 1.0 to below will cause the epidemic to shrink dramatically. It&#x27;s not like we need to reduce transmission by 100%.<p>Not that you asked for it but my advice to you is to find more sources of joy in your daily life that aren&#x27;t so affected. If you&#x27;re bored shoot me an e-mail, I have plenty of extra projects :)')
