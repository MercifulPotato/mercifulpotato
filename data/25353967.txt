I use CentOS for my home lab &#x2F; self-hosted development setup and there&#x27;s no way I would switch to RHEL.  It doesn&#x27;t matter because I don&#x27;t spend any money, but I&#x27;ll probably swap to Ubuntu next time I re-build my server.<p>Here [1] is an example of what I dislike.  That page doesn&#x27;t explain if a subscription is for 1 host or all my hosts and it doesn&#x27;t explain if it needs to be renewed annually or if I get a perpetual license after the first year of support.<p>I currently have 11 (extremely light usage) CentOS VMs running, but almost everything is Docker containers.  I could likely consolidate it onto a single, bare-metal host if I wanted.  It would be worse for me, but I could get a single $800 license instead of $8800 for 11 licenses.  It&#x27;s a moot point though.  $800 is already too much for the value I&#x27;m getting out of it.<p>I could use the developer program, but I use an issue tracker to track work I do and I back up the whole system nightly.  Technically that&#x27;s production (to me), and I&#x27;ve seen IBM bait and eviscerate someone for licensing using extremely unethical tactics, so I&#x27;ll never use something that isn&#x27;t very explicitly free for production.<p>I think RHEL is technically superior to Ubuntu, but Ubuntu is a far better product when it comes to support lifecycle, licensing, and support.  I can spin up an Ubuntu server and unlimited VMs with the promise of a reasonable lifecycle and the option to click a button and buy support.<p>Where is that in the RedHat world?  If RedHat would have released a product like CentOS Stream, but with RHEL branding and a dead simple way to go from a free, community supported version to a paid, commercially supported version then for people like me it makes sense to be the &quot;beta&quot; tester.  I think it&#x27;s a fair trade.  Downtime doesn&#x27;t have a huge impact on me and I&#x27;m willing to spend time bug hunting &#x2F; reporting bugs.<p>TLDR; The licensing is a massive hassle and is a terrible value proposition for small users.  You&#x27;re not winning any mindshare unless it&#x27;s as simple as Ubuntu makes it.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redhat.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;store&#x2F;red-hat-enterprise-linux-server#?sku=RH00005" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redhat.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;store&#x2F;red-hat-enterprise-linux-ser...</a>')
