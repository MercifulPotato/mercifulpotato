And why Intel or others can&#x27;t just come up with a similar design, if it&#x27;s clear from the specs&#x2F;die images what&#x27;s being done?<p>Is it years of work to figure out the placement of CPU&#x2F;GPU&#x2F;memory units on the die, routings, and come up with new instruction sets?  I imagine this wasn&#x27;t new physics, Apple was just using contract fabs, right?<p>What&#x27;s the secret sauce that let them pull this off, and fend off others?<p>Edit, oh, this is somewhat answered below in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25093313" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25093313</a>')
