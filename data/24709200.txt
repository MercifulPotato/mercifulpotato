(I.e. the sort of terms a NASA program is budgeted in, when you have to consider the costs of potentially propping up your suppliers in the face of them collapsing, training your future employees to pass on institutional knowledge, etc.)<p>Or, to put that another way: is the total profit per Lamborghini sold really higher than the total profit per Corolla sold, after the CapEx and OpEx of any maintenance + spare-parts supply logistics + recall costs + training + supply contracts + etc. are taken into account? (I would assume, if it were, Lamborghini would have a higher market cap.)')
