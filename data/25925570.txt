I have a profile but I haven&#x27;t logged in or used it for a long time. My experience is fine.<p>There sure seem to be a lot of people, though, who have the cesspool experience I mentioned. It&#x27;s great that you and I don&#x27;t have this experience with Twitter. It&#x27;s also anecdotal and not really relevant to my comment which was about people who aren&#x27;t you and me.')
