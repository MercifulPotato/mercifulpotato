The DOJ has limited time and resources, so will always go after the &quot;big fish&quot; and the cases that give them the best PR.<p>If you had two scenarios:<p>1. Great OPSEC, high profile<p>2. OK OPSEC, minimal profile<p>You&#x27;re still at greater risk for scenario #1.  When Ross Ulbricht did his Forbes interview and basically said &quot;I dare the gov&#x27;t to shut me down&quot;, he pretty much guaranteed they&#x27;d go to the ends of the earth to shut him down.<p>The only thing worse than committing multiple felonies is making the gov&#x27;t look stupid or weak.')
