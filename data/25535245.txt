There is merely a statement made (entirely implicitly here) without logical reasoning. And a statement, asserted without evidence or reasoning can easily be dismissed without it.<p>There can be no tu quoque fallacy when there is no argument made. For instance, if I were to say &quot;I&#x27;m at the beach&quot; and you were to say &quot;But you are not. I see you downtown in front of me.&quot; that&#x27;s not tu quoque just because it references the guy making the statement.<p>Make the argument and perhaps we can see.')
