If not, do they come out of the box? If so then is it really api only? Where does it fit in with a single page app architecture?<p>Is there an example of where a real website has used it and I can see how they implemented it? All I see is either too conceptual in the screen cast, or haven’t seen any real websites.<p>Do I still have to build all the emails for forgot password etc.')
