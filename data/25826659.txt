And when something is so badly <i>defined</i> not to serve the purpose it&#x27;s named after, I can&#x27;t like it. :)<p>If it was called the &quot;indent&quot; character which was ignored anywhere but at the start of the line, it would at least be sane and consistent.<p>Incidentally, Emacs can do the right thing in most modes by turning tab <i>key</i> into the (re)indent command.')
