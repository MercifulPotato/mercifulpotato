I deal with stuff by not thinking about it, tuning it out. If someone tries to &#x27;help&#x27; with suggestions, they&#x27;re forcing me think about it and the huge chunk of my life I&#x27;ve lost to it. That hurts deeply.<p>So, find out first. If someone wants to talk they will, if not, don&#x27;t bring it up.<p>Generally speaking, don&#x27;t offer fucking stupid suggestions (&quot;have you seen a doctor?&quot;).  Don&#x27;t tell me repeatedly doing X is the right thing to do when I know it will make things worse (happens rarely but is very annoying).<p>Don&#x27;t offer me psychic healing, or offer to pray for me (unless you&#x27;ve found that that person is open to that. I am not and it will infuriate me).<p>HTH!')
