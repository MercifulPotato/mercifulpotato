I have a long list of failed ventures and it sucks.<p>Thinking about this recently, I&#x27;ve attributed some of my failure to my youth.  I use to be in such a hurry to be successful.  Maybe it was ego or ambition or a twisted sense of competition with all the other 20-something founders, but building because you&#x27;re &quot;behind&quot; definitely wasn&#x27;t the right approach.  And because I was in a hurry, I never stopped to really invest in an idea.  I&#x27;d build something in 6 months and if I didn&#x27;t see any traction, I&#x27;d move on to a totally unrelated idea instead of pivoting - truly throwing away my efforts.<p>I&#x27;m in my 30s now and life&#x27;s slowing down.  To some degree, my dreams of uber-success have died and I don&#x27;t really feel that same hunger I use to.  Maybe it&#x27;s complacency, maybe it&#x27;s just my age and refocusing on things that make me happy.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still work on side-projects, but I&#x27;m approaching it from a place of building on my strengths, rather than reinventing the wheel every 6 months.  So I&#x27;m not changing ideas anymore, but pivoting to semi-related ideas where my work builds upon itself.  I&#x27;m also focused on an industry I&#x27;ve been working in for the last decade.  I&#x27;ve been able to reach out to my network to brainstorm and discuss the value I&#x27;m bringing to the table.<p>Who knows what will happen, but I&#x27;m not in a hurry anymore and I&#x27;ve found enjoyment in work, life, and my project.')
