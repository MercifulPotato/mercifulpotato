At-risk people in some cases do not respond fully to vaccines, and the reaction can be stressful to their systems.<p>Last I heard, the recommendation for influenza was 100% vaccination for nursing home staff and a strong recommendation for visitors to also get vaccinated. The bubble of protection from this strategy has, apparently, lower overall risks.<p>Doctors and nurses, especially urgent care, will likely be first in line (or perhaps due to an abundance of caution, half of them first in line, half later). I&#x27;d like to see the people we have labelled &#x27;essential workers&#x27; up next.')
