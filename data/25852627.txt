There may be no legal ground for a state to do this but technically it sure is possible.\nThere is also no need to ever attack the network itself. All that matters is the price. By buying BTC and creating a bubble a state could crash the price so dramatically that it would be very unlikely to recover. Imagine if the price would just go up from no on until lets say 1 million USD per BTC that&#x27;s +3000% maybe over the span of 1 or 2 years.\nThen sell and let it crash probably -99.9%\nI&#x27;d still be worth 1k USD but at the same time no one but the original crypt anarchist would care anymore.\nWould that cost a shitload of money? yes millions, but technically a state could print that money so it doesn&#x27;t really matter something like tether could do this basically for free. Also since they know when they let it crash they can recover a huge chuck of what they put in simply by shorting the top.\nWay simpler and cheaper than building mining farms that would be worthless after successfully destroying BTC.\nRemember the goal would not be to technically turn it off just render it irrelevant. Thats what people got wrong. They think the state would want to shut it down but putting it back to where it was 10 years ago would totally be sufficient.')
