When going slow, you need to control the motorcycle with your whole body and it&#x27;d be really hard to use your hands to signal - much easier on a bike.<p>Above 20-30 mph (32-48 km&#x2F;h) it gets easier, because the bike balances on its own and you don&#x27;t need to hold the handlebars at all (you should though, for emergency braking and saving yourself from potholes etc.).<p>Keep in mind that most motorcyclist don&#x27;t support the bike with their feet unless they&#x27;re standing still - it&#x27;s a good practice to keep your feet on the pegs as much as you can. It&#x27;s way better to tip over than to lose your foot to the chain.<p>TLDR: I&#x27;d pick using hand signals on a bicycle over using them on a motorcycle every time.')
