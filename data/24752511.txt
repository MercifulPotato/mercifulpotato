A dependency is code you usually have no control over and has to evolve with your code base during the years.<p>Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re using Python and you depend on library A, if over the years library A is no longer maintained now you need to either own it or drop it.<p>It could for example delay your python 2 -&gt; 3 migration because the author never made it compatible to python3.<p>There are also the transitive dependency, say library B locks to a version of library C that has to be &lt;1.0 and library E wants to use library C &gt;1.0, how do you resolve it?<p>Or library B requires a specific tool chain to be build (say gcc4) but now you want to use gcc6 and it isn&#x27;t compatible.. (sort of the same example of py 2-&gt;3 but for C++)')
