In stead of wondering how to build a search engine we should just build things that are compatible. A bit like <i>The output of your database is the input of my filter.</i><p>Take site search, it is easy to write specs for with tons of optional features and can easily outperform any crawler. Meta site search can produce similar output. Distributed diy cralwers can provide similar data.<p>Arguably top websites should not be indexed at all. They should provide their own search api.<p>The end user puts in a query and gets a bunch of results. It goes into a table with a colum for each unique property. The properties show up in the side bar to refine results (sorted by howmany results have the property) Clicking on one&#x2F;filling out the field&#x2F;setting a min max displays the results and sends out a new more specific query looking for those specific properties. New properties are obtained that way.')
