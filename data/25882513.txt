Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25885993, 25890886], score=None, time=1611412772, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25881664, text='Ok, I was asking specifically for data that shows that people buy hybrids <i>because</i> they don&#x27;t have somewhere to charge(rather than, for instance, that they get a nice tax discount by doing so). In my other comment I pointed out that on my street there&#x27;s someone else with a PHEV and I have never seen him charge it, even though he could easily do so - private driveway, plenty of space, if he wanted to then he could.<p>And while I agree with you in general, I think you obsess with the official numbers a little bit too much. In my previous mercedes AMG the official numbers were something like 6L&#x2F;100km, in normal use it was hard to get under 12L&#x2F;100km. Those numbers just don&#x27;t mean anything.<p>And if you see somewhere that the fleet average for the XC60 T8 is just 7L&#x2F;100km then that&#x27;s frankly fantastic. It&#x27;s a 2.2 tonne SUV with 400bhp. That&#x27;s an incredible fuel consumption(as in - low) even if it&#x27;s above the official numbers. Do you happen to know what the fleet average for the XC60 T6 is? That&#x27;s the same petrol engine without the hybrid system(not the PHEV T6). Because I imagine that fleet average will be closer to 12-14L&#x2F;100km than 7L&#x2F;100km.<p>My point is that for most people who ever charge the car the PHEV is an improvement. It&#x27;s those who don&#x27;t charge it who are the problem, but I&#x27;m confident this is a problem of legislation and&#x2F;or tax rabates.')
