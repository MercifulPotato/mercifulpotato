Item(by='bigwavedave', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610119165, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25678503, text='Another interesting idea would be to make a mobile game (even a very basic re-skinned asset flip would work), allow for loot boxes, loot crates, or even just an ingame store to straight up &quot;pay $x to get item y re-skinned with z color scheme&quot;. Give your customer a digital receipt and have them produce the confirmation number when meeting up to take possession of the illegal goods. This doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of giving two otherwise disconnected parties a legitimate and believable reason to meet up, but it would make a fairly flexible payment system for dealers. The type of loot box&#x2F;item bought could correlate to the desired product and the number purchased could correlate to the desired dosages.<p>There are probably all kinds of other issues with this; I haven&#x27;t fleshed the idea out much, it&#x27;s just something that struck me when reading your comment :).')
