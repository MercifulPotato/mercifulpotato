Mental breakdowns over pronouns... pronoun police<p>To my eyes, in this thread, the person who is harping on pronouns the most, seems to be closest to having a mental breakdown over them, who can most accurately be described as &quot;pronoun police&quot;, and who shows the greatest explicit tendency to control others&#x27; use of pronouns, is also the person who in the first place corrected an in-the-wild usage of singular &quot;them&quot; to &quot;him&quot;.<p>Like, can we step back and look at the thread and say that yeah, sometimes maybe it&#x27;s the people who are pushing back against singular &quot;they&quot; that are blowing the thing out of proportion?<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve never seen the pronoun police display actual concern for anything other than their ability to control people.<p>If you&#x27;re open to a real example, the &quot;pronoun police&quot; at my workplace suggest that when writing about hiring candidates, we use singular &quot;they&quot; instead of &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;, in order not to call too much attention to the gender of that person when those evaluations are read by decision makers. The intent is to reduce any possible gender bias in hiring.<p>This to me reads like an actual concern for something other than one&#x27;s ability to control people, namely a concern for being more objective and unbiased in hiring decisions. (Or at least, if you want to be cynical about it, for <i>seeming</i> more objective and unbiased in hiring decisions.)')
