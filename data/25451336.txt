Seems like a “pseudo” four cycle engine in a two cycle form. I can definitely see this being used in a drone&#x2F;aerospace application. Even without the efficiency benefit of four cycle vs two, not having piston heads is already a huge plus (moving parts are a pain when you have nothing to ground to but the air). Though I would guess the engine will have to run at a much higher rpm since the air displaced seems lower.')
