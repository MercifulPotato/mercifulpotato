Treat it like weâ€™re starting to treat drugs<p>I&#x27;m all for the direction that drug policy is going (towards more treatment, less prison time - I live in Oregon and we&#x27;re on the forefront of this in the US) but I&#x27;m not sure how this would work in regards to misinformation. How do we get conspiracy theorists into treatment? Won&#x27;t they just figure that&#x27;s part of the conspiracy to re-educate them? And a lot of this disinformation is coming from bad actors with intent to harm.<p>The epistemic gap is, I think the most serious problem we face now. We can&#x27;t address other serious problems like climate change or even getting COVID vaccines out to people because there&#x27;s disinformation. We seem to be completely unprepared to deal with this. The immune system offers an analogy - we need a societal immune system that attacks disinformation in some way. No idea how we get there, though.')
