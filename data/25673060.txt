As an example, in Seattle, we have had BLM and antifa groups encouraging, inciting, and participating in all kinds of criminal acts - illegal assemblies, failure to follow police orders, property damage, physical violence, blockading of highways, arson, and of course the infamous CHAZ&#x2F;CHOP autonomous zone incident. Why aren&#x27;t all those accounts also banned when the damage they have caused is much more consistent and much more clearly an act of violence? Why weren&#x27;t &quot;journalists&quot; streaming coverage of CHAZ banned from Twitch, Twitter, and Facebook for amplifying the message of those criminals? To this day, the &#x27;Everyday March&#x27; group in Seattle (who blocks roads&#x2F;highways) has used Instagram and Twitter to promote and coordinate dangerous, illegal acts <i>daily</i>. Every single day. And yet no action has been taken by big tech to censor them.<p>The second reason this doesn&#x27;t make sense to me, is that I don&#x27;t see clear evidence of Trump &quot;inciting&quot; people to break the law and storm the capitol. I may just be ignorant and unaware, so if someone could share the evidence I&#x27;d appreciate it. But as far as I can tell, there is no tweet or Facebook post where Trump explicitly tells people or encourages them to storm the capitol. Even claiming that Trump &quot;condones&quot; this act is a step too far, putting words in his mouth. I agree he hasn&#x27;t condemned it explicitly, and that is despicable. But I am not seeing how Trump&#x27;s posts incite violence, condone the storming of the capitol, or would materially encourage further violence. I get that he doesn&#x27;t have to be explicit to have that effect, but that is not enough for me to feel that big tech is justified in censoring his posts.')
