In Canada laws are approved by all elected member of parliament and senate. Maybe I&#x27;m not following what you&#x27;re trying to imply? Also, so many other things just work very differently in Canada, there&#x27;s a series of readings, committees are put together to review and ammend bills before they are presented, etc. And at any time, a vote of no confidence can take place dissolving the current government. There&#x27;s also more than two parties. The prime minister has no special powers (unlike the President), and the Senate has no party affiliation.
