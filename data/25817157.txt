Item(by='TacticalCoder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610932721, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25815455, text='&gt; A good website will ask for 2FA again if a user tries to do something destructive (like change password, email, or disable 2FA). They wouldnâ€™t be able to do those things.<p>The page mocking the login page where you need to answer the 2FA will simply phish your 2FA then, after a little delay pretending there&#x27;s some lag, would say &quot;wrong code, please try again&quot;. Now the person enters a second 2FA (which, due to the delay, would be different than the first one).<p>As I&#x27;ve just commented in a top-level comment: I&#x27;ve seen sites using a 72 hours delay before any destructive change can be made, coupled with the sending of an email containing a link allowing to unilaterally prevent the change.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen sites using two 2FA (TOTP style), one for login, one for any setup&#x2F;destructive change. And there are sites using both techniques.<p>It&#x27;s not 100% foolproof but it&#x27;s better than &quot;one 2FA phished and it&#x27;s game over&quot;.')
