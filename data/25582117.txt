Item(by='tremon', descendants=None, kids=[25584737, 25584690], score=None, time=1609339758, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25581628, text='<i>we see wrong, we try to change it.</i><p>Exactly! But that&#x27;s predicated on &quot;we see wrong&quot;. What Snowden and Wikileaks (and the various paradise leaks) showed, is that there&#x27;s a lot of wrongs we don&#x27;t see.<p>Maybe I didn&#x27;t specify this explicitly in my earlier post, but my core position is this: attacks on Wikileaks are attacks on the ability for the voting population to see the wrongs, and as such are attacks on democracy itself. It&#x27;s ironic for the CIA to claim that Wikileaks &quot;works towards the decline of liberal democracy&quot;, when the CIA itself is working to suppress democratic checks and balances.')
