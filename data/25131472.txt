They cover both. That&#x27;s the whole point, health insurance today is a bundle of all of those things.<p>While FICA taxes (partially) pay for senior citizens&#x27; healthcare, your health insurance premiums both pay for your annual physical (especially on Platinum PPO plans) as well as care for sicker people that are not eligible for Medicare&#x2F;Medicaid. I assure you that there are <i>plenty</i> of sick people that are under the age of 65, and actuaries price them in when computing premiums for private health insurance.<p>And as a minor point of order, even Medicare isn&#x27;t &quot;free&quot; for seniors — the FICA taxes only cover Part A benefits, and seniors still need to pay monthly premiums to Medicare to cover Part B benefits. And even those benefits aren&#x27;t 100% covered — Medicare only covers 80% of outpatient care.')
