It&#x27;s frustrating to hear people making comments who don&#x27;t have the fundamental understanding of why&#x2F;how the markets work and are just upset about not being able to join in on the melee and assume it&#x27;s nefarious behavior. My POV is that it was obviously a risk RH took to not make it more clear what the behavior of people&#x27;s accounts would be when market volatility is high. But I worked for a Commodity Risk Management Company on their custom derivatives platform and 90% of what we did was around properly valuing customer positions so we could make sure margin requirements were met. This was a huge deal to everyone involved because the counterparty risk was so high for our company.')
