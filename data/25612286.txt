Item(by='k__', descendants=None, kids=[25612404], score=None, time=1609589845, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612155, text='<i>&quot;I don&#x27;t understand why b=a; c=a; &lt;-- doesn&#x27;t work because a is &quot;used up&quot;???&quot;</i><p>Had the same issue a few months ago.<p>The pointer can only be referenced by one variable at a time.<p>If you &quot;move&quot; the pointer from a to b then a is figuratively &quot;used up&quot; because a is now blocked from doing anything with the pointer anymore.<p>I guess, for Rust itself the pointer is still referenced by a, Rust just blocks you from using it. But thinking you moved it to another variable helped me a bit.')
