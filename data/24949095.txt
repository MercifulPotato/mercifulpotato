They are regulated more than most industries, but make their own decisions on profits and investments. Which is why SoCal Edison and SDG&amp;E are so much better off, better corporate boards.<p>The state owns no share of the company, like say Norway does from its national oil company. California is prohibited from owning a portion of a company (outside of things like CALPERS), so it really cannot impose a true socialist model without violating the state constitution. It must own 100% or 0% only.')
