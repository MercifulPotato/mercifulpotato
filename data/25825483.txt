If you are concerned that the IT department is going to decrypt executives&#x27; laptops and leak confidential information, then this isn&#x27;t a good model.  But if you&#x27;re merely concerned that someone leaves their laptop in an airport, it&#x27;s fine -- whoever picks that laptop up and resells it won&#x27;t hack your directory system and be able to decrypt it.<p>A long memorized passphrase that only one person knows is the best possible way to prevent unauthorized access, but that isn&#x27;t necessarily the problem that you&#x27;re trying to solve with disk encryption.')
