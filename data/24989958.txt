You dockerize an app prior to running non-unit tests tests, and that image needs to be stored by a container registration service.<p>With this change, Docker Hub&#x27;s ceases to be that service.<p>&gt; You do your building and testing and all that entirely on your &quot;own&quot; infrastructure and then you push once test succeds.<p>Nope, the point is that Docker Hub ceases to be relevant as a container registry. As long as you start to do all your work outside of Docker Hub, you won&#x27;t need Docker Hub to do any of the work. You just get your base images from where you store your own container images and suddenly Docker Hub stops playing any role in your workflow, thus losing al relevance.')
