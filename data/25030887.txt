Mandatory rootkits [1]. Piracy Protection and DRM that did way more than advertised and caused nuisance for paying customers. Rootkits on music albums.

But until then then Apple has provided the best solution to toxic developers.<p>Sure you can say &quot;you can&#x27;t just not install the app from the toxic developer&quot;, but then why isn&#x27;t it ok to use the &quot;you can just not buy an iPhone&quot; argument?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25030660" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25030660</a>')
