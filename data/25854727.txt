I&#x27;m challenging your assertion that critics of Trump&#x27;s supporters and OP are just &quot;brainwashed by the TV&quot;, and your framing of this dynamic as just &quot;both sides&quot; seeing &quot;themselves as the victim and the others as the attacker&quot;.<p>My experience was not some one off event, or story that applies to just my family, it reflects a culture of racism common in this country, particularly the South. We are talking about well documented multi-generational harm perpetuated by communities, businesses, and government.<p>&quot;There are shitty people of all walks of life,&quot; is not sufficient to explain away the harms of institutionalized racism in the United States.<p>So, you do not need to call people &quot;brainwashed&quot; for recognizing the attitudes espoused by many Trump supporters. They have earned their reputation for good reason, though &quot;some, I assume, are good people.&quot;<p>As for &quot;the key question no one is asking is why did people vote for him in the first place and why did so many vote for him again?&quot; In fact, many people have asked that question, have studied it extensively, and have found that racism and anti-immigrant attitudes were the strongest indicators of support for Trump (e.g. [1]). Yes, you&#x27;re right that &quot;because they&#x27;re all racist&quot; is a cop-out, there are other factors at play, but to say that &quot;racial attitudes&quot; is not a significant factor is to ignore the evidence.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;2016-election-race-class-trump&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;2016-election-race-class...</a>')
