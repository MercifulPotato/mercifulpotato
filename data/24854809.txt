Computationally, it&#x27;s relatively cheap to verify the entire transaction history.<p>The real energy consumption comes from miners who use a crazy amount of computer power to <i>secure</i> the network. Bitcoin&#x27;s transaction history is immutable because changing it would require an even crazier amount of computing power - too much for any malicious actor who tries to attack the network.<p>The amount of energy used is a feature, not a bug. There are no alternative designs known that could replace proof-of-work while keeping its security assurances, permissionless participation, fair distribution of coins, unforgeability, etc.')
