Nature doesn&#x27;t really have clearly defined classes, just rough clusters of similar organisms. It&#x27;s the humans that like classifying things because it&#x27;s easier for us to think about them and make predictions when we see them as classes rather than as individuals or even the whole global ecosystem as a single integrated super-organism. The more common features we can find in a class, the less thinking we have to do but it&#x27;s OK if there are exceptions as long as it&#x27;s not so many that it makes the classes useless.')
