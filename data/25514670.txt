With a carjacking attempt 75&#x27; from my front door (foiled by returning with a pistol before they could restart my car) I miss that time not at all.<p>Yeah, I remember the Valley in the 90s... a lof of it looked a lot like downtown LA which I&#x27;m was never exactly a fan of.<p>But being in San Jose back then in the 90s looked and smelled like Chinatown when it was buzzing, Sunnyvale and Mountain View had a certain feel that is completely gone now it felt electric for reasons I didn&#x27;t full understand and would only come to realize how significant what was happening there was a decade or so later.<p>I never went to the East bay until recently, but that feels like a very watered down version of what it was back then to me.<p>I guess it&#x27;s survivor bias guiding my words, especially since I had close encounters with stuff like that growing up too; but having a choice of which one to deal with I&#x27;d stay with 90s CA to raise a family then somewhere like modern Geneva with all its amenities and manicured existence.')
