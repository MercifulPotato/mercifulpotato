Asian people have long accepted a strong state apparatus. The idea that this is something new for Asian people is pure propaganda. The current governments of Japan, Korea, China, &amp;c were preceded by governments ultimately rooted in the Qin bureaucracy of 2200 years ago, which many scholars will argue is the first bureaucratic, impersonal state.<p>A strong state apparatus without accountability or a principle of transcendent law -- that is a far &quot;bigger&quot; government than any in Asia currently.
