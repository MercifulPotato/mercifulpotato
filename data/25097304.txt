Item(by='wolverine876', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605403823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25096685, text='&gt; America weighs the question of &quot;what force should be used, where, when and for what purpose&quot; constantly.<p>Yes, but I think every country makes those decisions and uses its military from time to time, at least every major country (kudos to Costa Rica for eliminating its military!) including all the NATO countries. The U.S. is a different case; it has been the guarantor of the post-WWII order and so uses its military more than some others (that doesn&#x27;t justify the actions).<p>&gt; 30% of recruits have parents who served, 70% have a relative who served<p>I&#x27;m surprised those numbers aren&#x27;t higher for the population as a whole. For one thing, people were being drafted as recently as the 1970s. I&#x27;d expect that almost everyone has a relative who was in the military. I don&#x27;t come from a military-oriented family in any sense, and I have at least three living ex-military relatives and of course many deceased ones.<p>But of course there is some continuity from generation to generation. That applies to any profession, locale, etc. People aren&#x27;t surprised that the engineer&#x27;s child becomes an artist, but the child is more likely to become an engineer than most people. Does that mean there is an &#x27;engineer class&#x27;?<p>&gt; a significant portion the leadership of the military is absolutely a distinct beast. While yes, they are nominally just another citizen, they have part of a distinct culture (how could you not if you spent 10+ years in service of an institution) with a distinct way of seeing the world.<p>The GP was talking about a sort of caste (my word), trained and treated distinctly from generation to generation. Every profession, community, ethnicity, etc etc. creates a distinct way of seeing the world. Look at people in SV! Y Combinator does the same. Other parts of government do the same. There&#x27;s nothing special about the military in that regard.')
