First was fighting tyrants, second was becoming tyrant.<p>First there was  February Revolution  that overthrew  autocracy and provisional government and  Russian Republic were formed. Bolsheviks had  &lt;24% of the votes and seats. moderate socialists, national parties, cadets had the rest.<p>Then there was October Revolution aka Bolshevik Coup where faction of communists led by Lenin and Bogdanov  took over, killed everyone other kind of socialist and supporter of  provisional government  and formed autocracy.<p>Both the The French Revolution and the Russian revolution are examples of &quot;Revolutions devour their own Children&quot;.
