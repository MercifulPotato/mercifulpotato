This was then the only work-capable hardware in the house. So I couldn&#x27;t just send it back when I noticed the problems, because it would have meant literally not being able to work for a while. Although with the time I spent trying to make it work on linux, then the nerves&#x2F;mental health I&#x27;ve spent on using Windows on it, that would have been the better call in hindsight.<p>Anyhow, given that on-premise work is still not exactly around the corner, I&#x27;ll build a ryzen workstation as soon as parts become available here, and be done with this. And I&#x27;ll avoid Dell&#x2F;Intel from now on.')
