Apparently NIST even calls out regular hash functions as being unsuitable for hashing passwords [1]. You’d need to use PBKDF2 although maybe this advice has been updated since?\nMaybe they were being recommended PBKDF2 because that too is more susceptible to GPU attacks? Really should be using scrypt rather than bcrypt anyway.<p>All that being said, using sha2 isn’t necessarily “wrong” if you can force your users to use longer passwords. My understanding (could be wrong - I’m not a security algorithms expert) is that all these “hard” hashing algorithms are trying to provide guarantees even if your user has poor security hygiene. If you can force your user to use a randomly generated 20 digit password then you can significantly reduce your server load and reduce latency by using a faster hashing algorithm.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;11624372&#x2F;best-practice-for-hashing-passwords-sha256-or-sha512" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;11624372&#x2F;best-practice-f...</a>')
