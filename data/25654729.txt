They&#x27;re cheap enough to power projects, and they can communicate with each other.<p>I also really like Makecode with the Micro:bit. It seems a lot nicer than Tynker.<p>Doesn&#x27;t really do it for me.<p>What would do it for me is a Micro:bit-compatible device with a basic touchscreen. One of the limitations of the Micro:bit is limited input. If I have Micro:bits controlling lights, or robots, or whatever, it&#x27;d be helpful to have a single &quot;master&quot; controller where I can control things from.')
