It’s just text-files, you don’t have to share them with any service, they are not in some weird binary format, and you can use standard tools like git to work with them if you want. You can also collect all the information from every financial service you interact with (banks, credit unions, credit card companies, brokerages, whatever) in one place and get reports on all of them at the same time. It’s the bee’s knees!')
