Just having a word for that implies familiarity with creatures similar to animals on earth, and it&#x27;s not believable that a super advanced space-faring species would have missed the fact that animals can have (possibly extremely primitive, to their eyes) intelligence.<p>&gt; Of course, this absurdity works largely because of our own human associations towards meat. Replace &quot;meat&quot; with &quot;cells&quot; and the humour fails.<p>Yes, in a way that&#x27;s exactly my point.')
