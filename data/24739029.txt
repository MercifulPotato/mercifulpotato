Item(by='svara', descendants=None, kids=[24739383], score=None, time=1602338107, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24738945, text='&quot;Flesh&quot; wouldn&#x27;t work either, though. Just having a word for that implies familiarity with creatures similar to animals on earth, and it&#x27;s not believable that a super advanced space-faring species would have missed the fact that animals can have (possibly extremely primitive, to their eyes) intelligence.<p>&gt; Of course, this absurdity works largely because of our own human associations towards meat. Replace &quot;meat&quot; with &quot;cells&quot; and the humour fails.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s actually a great way of putting what rubs me the wrong way about it. If the story expressed a great idea, it should work with &quot;cells&quot; or &quot;tissue&quot; just as well.')
