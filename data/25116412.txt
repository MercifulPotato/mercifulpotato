I have seen those kinds of things offered, but never in my life come across some similar offering to be on a boat and do some work as a &quot;vacation&quot;.   I love the sea and would jump at that chance.<p>But I guess, that&#x27;s also called, &quot;just working on a boat&quot;.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d love the free labor.
