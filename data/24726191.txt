Some key findings; error rates per DRAM module and per technology cycle (DDR2, DDR3, and so presumably DDR4) have similar failure rates.  Higher altitude has higher failure rates.<p>FIT (failures in time, or failures per billion hours) are about 20-30 per DRAM (18 per DIMM in the study) at a <i>fault</i> level, which may not rise to an <i>error condition</i>.  ECC corrects many faults, if present, which don&#x27;t become errors.<p>So expect a (4GB in this study) DIMM to have a fault once per 200 years on average.  Of course, this is server-class hardware running ideal conditions.<p>This is, notably, in stark contrast to Google&#x27;s results (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.google.com&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;archive&#x2F;35162.pdf&amp;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.google.com&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;archive&#x2F;35162.pdf&amp;</a>) of about 20,000-70,000 FIT per Mbit, but closer reading suggests that there were a fairly large number of high-fault DIMMs affecting the mean and Google historically bought the cheapest hardware available.  Even at this fault rate an average DIMM wouldn&#x27;t fail in any given month, for example.<p>Personal gaming, browsing and light document work PCs do not need ECC.  Video&#x2F;photo editing&#x2F;development PCs might be on the threshold for not wanting to produce or store corrupted work.<p>Multiply the risk out for any organization with many people doing the same kind of work where corruption on a single workstation could cause annoying trouble for everyone else.')
