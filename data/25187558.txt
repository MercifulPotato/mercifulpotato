There&#x27;s really no other possible way to put it in that metaphor. You&#x27;re not jailed.<p>The only thing keeping you there is your own desire to retain the things that are...inside the garden. The Apple software. The services. The user experience.<p>The one thing I can see being upset about is losing access to the software you&#x27;ve purchased. But switching <i>to</i> Apple (or even Linux) from Windows&#x2F;Android means giving up exactly the same things. That&#x27;s not about a &quot;walled garden&quot;: it&#x27;s just a consequence of the fact that software has to be written, or at least compiled, for a particular platform, and significant extra effort has to be expended to make it functional across platforms.')
