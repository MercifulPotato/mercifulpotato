The Democrats eliminated judicial filibusters because Republicans were attempting to prevent Obama from getting any judges on the bench in the two years the Democrats had the Senate. Then they lost the Senate and the Republicans simply stopped allowing Obama to get judges on the bench, creating a huge backlog which they could fill when Trump took the presidency. Then they eliminated the blue slip rule to further weaken any control the Democrats might have over the process. And they have expanded state courts, a.k.a &quot;packed them&quot;. All of this has the same practical consequence: controlling policy outcomes you can&#x27;t win through elections by nullifying them in the courts.<p>Sure, this is a lesson about democracy. It&#x27;s a lesson about how to subvert democracy.')
