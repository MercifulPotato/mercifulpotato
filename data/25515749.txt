Sure some havenâ€™t starved to death or been crippled by random acts of violence by humans.</i><p>In some parts of the world, unowned dogs seem to flourish; for example India has more than 30 million street dogs.  However this is not a good thing, since dog on human violence happens too, and 20,000 people in India die of rabies every year.  Street dogs are well known for attacking people, so even if the dogs can survive on their own it&#x27;s still irresponsible to allow that.')
