But if you perform or listen to a song, it&#x27;s still there for others.<p>OK, that&#x27;s good for you and the &quot;others&quot;, but what about the person who spent time and energy to write the song and perform? Just because it&#x27;s &quot;still there for others&quot;, it&#x27;s ok to steal it? You are only thinking from the consumer&#x27;s point of view and neglecting why people produce things of value in the first place. If they don&#x27;t get rewarded, they will simply stop producing value.')
