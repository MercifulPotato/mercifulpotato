Companies are notoriously incompetent, yes, even domain registrars or whatever you categorize GoDaddy as.<p>And what if they used better language? What then? Would you simply move the goal post to another way to victim blame?<p>I know to avoid a lot of things because of experience, I know a lot of legitimate things act like illegitimate things. And a lot of illegitimate things can masquerade adequately as competent legitimate things.<p>For example: I know to look at the DKIM and SPF headers in an email, specifically because email clients do not show you when someone is spoofing an email address with the <i>exact same domain name</i>. Not a phishing domain name, the exact same one. This is a real, ongoing UI problem.<p>And there are other flaws out there too.')
