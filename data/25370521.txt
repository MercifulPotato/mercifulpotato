The systems are designed and layered in such a way that a person gets a bit of information,  that information is highly compounded in their world view,  other ideas are not in their funnel.  Even if they go and try to validate it (which they may not because everything else in the funnel on their information streams supports&#x2F;compounds the view) there are whole markets of pseudo news that are entertainment channels masquerading as news supporting the same insane ideas.<p>These systems act as badly as a schizophrenic thought process slowly detaching the participants from reality as the information they see compounds their world view.')
