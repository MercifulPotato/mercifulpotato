It&#x27;s too ingrained in the culture. As evidence tipping still exists and hasn&#x27;t declined in the areas where those laws are already in effect.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are bartenders making 6 figures, but according to the BLS, the 90th percentile make $40k with tips.<p>The median pay is $10. That&#x27;s lower than minimum wage in a lot of places, so I doubt that many bartenders are against minimum wage before tips (none of the ones I know are).')
