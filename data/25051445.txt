Interesting how it stucks with thinkpads and dell XPS that will still cost a fraction of those mac with 16gb and 1tb ssd<p>* &quot;2x faster ssd than previous macbook air&quot; 2018 macbook air had 2GB&#x2F;s but 2019 only 1.3GB so that would be around 2.6GB&#x2F;s - nothing special comparing you can get faster SSD very cheap today e.g. 1TB 3500 &#x2F; 3000 MB&#x2F;s nvme SSD you can get for just $135<p>* keep in mind those 8GB or 16GB will be shared between GPU and CPU - have fun connecting your macbook pro 13 that starts with 8GB to 4k display<p>* &quot;16x faster ML&quot; seems likely only affects inference and 16x only related to previous macbook air&#x2F;pro (instead of PC or macbook 16 with discrete GPU)<p>* tensorflow seems only accelerated for inference - seems unlikely can be used for training but let&#x27;s see.<p>* price still the same, didn&#x27;t get any &#x27;bone&#x27; like making it cheaper or starting with higher SSD or RAM as a base<p>* macbook pro starts with just 8GB ram and 256GB SSD<p>[edit: formatting]')
