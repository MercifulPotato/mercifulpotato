I just applied the dictionary definition of the term.<p>I never said that racism was white&#x2F;black, but I <i>was</i> writing specifically in the context of European racism against Aboriginals in Australia, which happens to be fairly black and white. I’m happy to discuss racism in other countries, but that wasn’t the topic at hand.<p>Of course it matters what white people think about racism. But it doesn’t hurt to get the opinion of those who are actually harmed by it, does it? I mean I have never had the misfortune of experiencing racism first hand, so if I say something that an aboriginal person considers racist, that’s something I would want to take very seriously.<p>I never said “we” aren’t qualified to say what <i>is</i> racist. What I’m not so confident about, when specifically talking about aboriginal people, is claiming that my statements are not racist.<p>Overt racism is pretty easy to spot, but just because I try to be considerate doesn’t mean that the things I say in good faith can’t nevertheless be racist.<p>Keeping an open mind and listening to how others feel is more important than my biased opinion.')
