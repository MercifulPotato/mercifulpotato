The shortest stint on my career was at a certain Fortune 500 company. There I was expected to chronometer my coffee and bathroom breaks, as well as all other activities I undertook while on company premises. This as an IT worker (tech support, required programming but no full software development), which is a sort of protected species in terms of the workforce.<p>Since this was self reporting, there was a lot of wiggle room; and I&#x27;d even say most of it was not due to employee dishonesty but just fatigue. It is hard to remember to keep score of the exact times when you start any given task when you have urgent and actually productive duties to fulfill, so sometimes you had to give an estimation. But I am sure that company would jump right at the chance to use Office 365&#x27;s surveillance tools to refine their record keeping, and maybe root out some lying slackers as the icing of the cake.')
