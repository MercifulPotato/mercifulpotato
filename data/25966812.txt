Anything with high reward is inherently high risk. It sucks that some people just don&#x27;t get that, but that line of thinking is why opportunities on every axis systematically disappear from the middle class. Can&#x27;t invest in early stage companies unless you&#x27;re an accredited investor with $1M+, can&#x27;t use social media because some people can&#x27;t handle it, maybe we should  ban driving too because some people crash their cars, ban podcasts because some people get radicalized by listening to the wrong ones. The end of that road is permanent social immobility and a very boring life.')
