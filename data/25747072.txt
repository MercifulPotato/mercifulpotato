Back about 7 years ago when I spent more time online with friends in school, we tried to use Teamspeak multiple times, but the audio quality was always awful. We didn&#x27;t like Skype either, but the audio was still better, so we dealt with the bloat. Discord is king in my mind, without question. Being electron based makes it a bit heavy, but I can spare 200MB on my machine for some damn good chat and call.')
