When I finally realized it was the same show in a different time, place and with different characters I was like OK, that’s it, I gave it enough of a chance, time to stop watching.<p>But just before I tapped the menu button, Doc and Bean drew me in enough to watch longer, and longer, until I reached the end.<p>By the end I decided A Dark Quiet Death was one of the best tv episodes I’d ever seen. I wasn’t crying, you were crying! my eyes were just very, very dry and tired, and sad.<p>And even though the story returns to present day in the very next episode, every episode after A Dark Quiet Death was imbued with a great deal more meaning. And an understanding that making games isn’t just a fun way to make a living. Sometimes it’s an expression of things you really care about, and an attempt to communicate those  feelings to others.')
