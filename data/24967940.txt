Every client, no matter how small, has been sold the spiel and had some guy come through and build a boutique cloud infrastructure, CI pipeline and development VM. As if traffic will increase 1000% by next week with no prior warning. It just doesn&#x27;t happen like that.<p>I spend half my time debugging Hyperscale Bullshitâ„¢ that the client never needed and that failed the moment the devops guy left.<p>If you want this stuff, you need a long term tech team, and a devops member on hand. Every time you hand your project around this stuff costs you hours. You also need to tell your devs to use the devops guy like tech support. They built this rickety tower of obtuse config files, make the devops guy fix it and don&#x27;t let your devs spin their wheels for 4 hours before their assets compile on the Super Cool Distributed Docker VM microservice stack of teetering jenga blocks.')
