During the year I got to spend lot of time with my family, was able to catch up and bond with my sister after spending almost a decade apart, spent so much time in nature, national parks and took couple of road trips. Started working out and gained some muscle, learned new concepts and made new friends. It was a good year for me even though it had some downs, scares and definitely changed who I am. Brought new perspectives to the life and forced me to reprioritize things.   I am looking forward to learn, teach and help my community by spending more time with them and also grow professionally. Looking forward to take more risks and finish things that I start. What are you looking forward to?   Thank you HN. -AD')
