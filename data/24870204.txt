I met a few people early on in the pandemic who thought themselves very smart for paying attention to the news and getting their money out of the market before the first big drop.<p>Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t talked to them since, but they didn&#x27;t seem to expect it to bounce right back up again.  I wonder how many people out there did something similar.<p>I remember back in 2008 one of the older voice engineers I knew, who was in his 60s and getting ready to retire, panicked and moved his money out of the market (it&#x27;s a separate question why he still had so much in stocks) near the low point.  He quietly canceled his retirement and worked another 5 years.  Whoops.')
