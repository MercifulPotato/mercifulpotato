But it&#x27;s not some other entity saying stuff.to be honest, if someone told me they hear voices in their head I would assume they are not 100% alright mentally, which is totally okay of course but I&#x27;d suspect perhaps they should seek treatment. Now that I&#x27;m seeing so many commenters (probably a biased self selected sample though) saying they hallucinate all the time,see entities and hear voices, I&#x27;m less sure and perhaps it&#x27;s normal?')
