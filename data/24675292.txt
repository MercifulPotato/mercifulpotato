Some may use ionising in combination or UV.<p>So I foresee a whole raft of legislation and requirements for office spaces ahead.  Which will only help drive the work from home long-term as cheaper office space.  But also help shift us away from open plan offices that I&#x27;ve never met anybody who liked.<p>As for herd immunity - that really is best effective against viruses that do not mutate that quickly.  Corona-viruses from my understanding, do mutate.  Though it is often the case that mutations of a virus over time lean towards mutations that make them less impacting upon the host.  Which may be down to natural selection in that those with no impact can spread it more and no virus really wants to kill the host.  Impacted&#x2F;dead hosts tend to be less effective in transmission.  So may very well be down to that aspect in why they tend to become less impacting.<p>On the UV aspect <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-020-67211-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-020-67211-2</a> a UV wavelength of 222nm that is effective against the virus and safe for humans.  Though how stable current UV output is and by that if you had a 222nm light, over time would that drift and become less human safe is something I&#x27;d want to check.<p>There again - flu&#x27;s and colds are more prevalent during winter months when we have less sun and less UV.  Can&#x27;t ignore that pattern.')
