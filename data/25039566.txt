Item(by='jaymzcampbell', descendants=None, kids=[25040195, 25040538], score=None, time=1604954228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25039115, text='I recently set up a pihole at home with the whole Covid situation and as soon as I noticed the donate link threw them £5 thinking <i>&quot;the least I can do is buy a London priced pub pint - I&#x27;m not exactly spending it elsewhere&quot;</i>. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so different with software - I should really know better but even to this day my gut reaction is to, initially, balk at an app charging £5 - yet I&#x27;ll walk into a pub (well, used to) and have no problem spending that and more on one beverage... I&#x27;ve since managed to snap out of that and will, if I think I&#x27;m going to enjoy it, spend the £1, £5, £20 or whatever it is within reason.<p>This may be partly due to seeing in my day job customer feedback which in answer to <i>&quot;what would stop you using &lt;essentially their business account + invoicing + tax reporting&gt;?&quot;</i> - <i>&quot;if you charged me money&quot;</i>. We basically run <i>for businesses</i> and even that cohort to a non-trivial proportion isn&#x27;t prepared to spend (&lt;£10 monthly) on software. We have other avenues and mechanisms to work work around that but it&#x27;s a little demoralising when you see it so black and white. Makes me feel like I personally should at least be less inactive in my supporting of projects I like or just buying an app or subscriptions. I think the whole industry needs a reality check on how much &quot;free&quot; really costs.')
