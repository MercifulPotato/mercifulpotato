I know on my example that even though I got through school with good grades, I was still full of misconceptions due to a few key errors fed from teachers, bullshit pseudo knowledge I picked up from ufo+mystery magazines and TV edutainment.<p>So first, there is nothing special about life. Life doesn&#x27;t break the normal laws of physics we use to describe everything else. Our naive concept is often along the lines of a game engine with inputs coming &quot;from outside&quot;, from spirits or something. But there&#x27;s no evidence of that. Living material is ordinary.<p>Physics teachers will explain that heat doesn&#x27;t go from cold to warm places. If you ask how fridges can exist, they may say &quot;well, heat doesn&#x27;t go there <i>by itself</i>&quot;, invoking some kind of magic explanation. Now I know there are more precise phrasing in physics, but that&#x27;s beside my point. We grow up with a concept that there are things that happen &quot;by themselves&quot; and there are things that happen due to living creatures&#x27; actions. In this implicit naive view that many, including past me hold, a fridge does an exceptional thing because it vaguely obeys our effortful engineering intentions. We <i>make it</i> do that, it doesn&#x27;t do it out of its own nature.<p>Actually in primary school physics class when we learned the concept of forces, we learned different categories: magnetic, gravitational, &quot;holding&#x2F;mounting&quot; force, friction force, muscle force... And we had to label the arrows in different everyday cartoons, like a kid pulling a sled in the snow: muscle force towards the kid, gravity down, holding force from the ground up, friction force backward. As if muscle force was some irreducible special magic phenomenon in physics. While correctly teaching basic school-level vector calculus skills they failed at teaching fundamental world view skills.<p>Because there&#x27;s no distinction like this. Life doesn&#x27;t violate the second law of thermodynamics.<p>Of course this article also doesn&#x27;t claim that, but as I said, it&#x27;s important to first arrive on the same page, in the same ballpark before the high resolution discussion.')
