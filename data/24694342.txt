Like always things look great in simple examples where it doesn&#x27;t matter but fail when it gets tricky.<p>The main benefit of dedicated, encapsulated types is that they can preserve their invariants. Without that each function operating on &quot;data&quot; has to check that those invariants are kept. It&#x27;s fine in trivial cases e.g. where this validation boils down to checking if a value is present or not - which might even be supported by the language. But I don&#x27;t see this working in more complex cases.<p>In my experience many (most?) bugs are caused by the implementation assuming something incorrect about the shape of the data and I feel like this principle only makes it more likely to happen.')
