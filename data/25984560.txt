Confluent has put a lot of effort dragging kafka&#x27;s architecture to the present, but some major features are missing:<p><pre><code>  - Auto-scaling:  Confluent finally introduced &quot;elastic scaling&quot; a few months ago but it only allows you to scale up and must be triggered by the admin (no threshold-based auto-scaling).\n\n  - Multi-tenancy:  Planning for a multi-tenant kafka cluster is not for the faint of heart.  Achieving isolation tends toward liberal usage of topics of which starts to become unmanageable in the low thousands.  This isn&#x27;t crazy when you&#x27;ve got a few hundred microservices and several tenants to keep isolated.\n\n  - Decoupled brokers and storage:  Any broker scaling or failure can lead to downtime while event storage is redistributed.\n</code></pre>\nConfluent&#x27;s Cloud service reduces operational overhead but isn&#x27;t always feasible due to cost, resource limits (like service accounts or schemas for instance), data controls, etc.')
