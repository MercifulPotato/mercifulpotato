If the repeater started now, to be useful it would have to be similarly large to the big radio telescopes used to receive the signal.  It would need to have the same speed as the probe it was following to keep up the signal.   But the Voyagers each were massively accelerated by their giant planet encounters.  Launching a much-more-massive repeater at much higher initial velocity than the original probes is nonsensical.')
