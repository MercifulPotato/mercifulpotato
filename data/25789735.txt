I have had a hobby in embedded programming and FPGA programming, compiler design and distributed deep learning.<p>All of which used &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin and $PATH.  Every system, regardless of programming language across python, C, C++, java, go, erlang.<p>Saying &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin and&#x2F;or $PATH &quot;has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with programming&quot; is total rubbish. Programming as a field doesn&#x27;t just include domain and syntax knowledge of a programming language, it includes ALL of the system implementation details below it, and YOU ARE EXPECTED TO KNOW THEM.<p>Saying something so basic and fundamental &quot;has absolutely nothing to do with programming&quot; only shows a terrible lack of systems knowledge, this is used in unix, linux, bsd, embedded and massive server scale deployments.<p>Acting like this stuff is somehow below you, just shows intellectual laziness, this stuff both BASIC (easy to learn) and FUNDAMENTAL (applies almost universally in many systems), and if you acted like this during an interview or working at anywhere with non-trivial setups you&#x27;d be laughed out of the room.')
