Whenever we had an outage, our director and senior manager would take a call on whether to update the dashboard or not.<p>Having &#x27;red&#x27; dashboard catches lot of eyes, so people responsible for making this decision always look at it from political point of view.<p>As a dev oncall, we used to get 20 sev2s per day (an oncall ticket which needs to be handled within 15 mins) so most of the time things are broken, its just that its not visible to external customers through dashboard.')
