There&#x27;s something deeply wrong with peer reviewers in this field because they often write long, detailed reviews that completely ignore glaring problems in the papers, problems that jump out to &#x27;lay&#x27; readers on the first glance through. My guess is that there are very complicated sets of unwritten rules about the sorts of problems that are and are not legitimate to criticise in peer reviews, and problems that are a little bit <i>too</i> fundamental, of the form &quot;this entire paper should be rejected out of hand&quot;, don&#x27;t get given when a paper has 25 authors at prestigious universities, even if the methodology or conclusions are absurd.')
