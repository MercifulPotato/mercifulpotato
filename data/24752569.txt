I can tell you what day of the week it is, but not what the day of the month it is. Sometimes day of the week even takes extra cycles.<p>Relative time tells me the order of magnitude since last update. Was it today (I can assume they have complete context) or yesterday (they probably need a little background to catch up).<p>Order of magnitude since last update is generally more useful to me than knowing the time since last update.')
