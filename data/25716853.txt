I only have a Teflon wok, and my biggest problem with it is that it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. The other problem is that Teflon really doesn&#x27;t like very high temperatures, so I&#x27;m lucky if a wok lasts a year before bits are peeling off. I&#x27;ve always been put off a carbon steel wok though, because of all the faffing about with seasoning, but reading some of the comments here it might be simpler just to wash and oil it after every use.')
