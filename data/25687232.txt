I initially thought that petroleum extraction&#x2F;carbon emissions would slow the planet ever so slightly because we&#x27;re taking stuff from underground and moving it into the atmosphere. But water&#x2F;ice are much heavier, and reducing the range of elevations where snow is trapped would do the opposite (less water at higher elevations and more at lower), plus there&#x27;s way more snow&#x2F;water than petroleum.')
