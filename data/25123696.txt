I had the same need, and the same confusion solving it, before I had ever used github, when I used a locally hosted git server of some kind for my team.<p>Do you mean it&#x27;s a problem only if you are &quot;git push&#x27;ing&quot; to a remote shared by those working on a software project?<p>OK, maybe. Even before github, most projects I knew of using git used that method. You can suggest nobody should, and try to educate people in a completely distributed workflow if you want, I suppose.
