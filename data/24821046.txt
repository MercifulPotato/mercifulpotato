The author is not trying to make the best word counter, he is comparing two languages by implementing the same algorithm on both and giving us his conclusions.<p>Using a different technique, for example by not using regexp is a bit like cheating in that context. You are not comparing two languages, you are comparing two different solutions to the problem.<p>That&#x27;s what I meant with my previous post. Either you do it as specified in the article, with regex and maps, which require pulling libraries and working in a way that is much less convenient than with the C++ and Rust example for no good reason. Or you reimplement it using different techniques and this is not the point of the article.<p>Or to put it simply, the example in the article is not good for C.')
