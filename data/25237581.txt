I feel like Apple is making macOS increasingly abstract and taking away more control from the user with every update. For example, you used to be able to turn off auto-mounting of external&#x2F;internal disks with a few command-line entries, but as of several versions ago, that feature was mysteriously removed and no one in the mac community seems to know how to fix it. Itâ€™s the kind of thing that makes me drift towards *nix OSs for personal computing and side projects. I still use and prefer Mint for such things.')
