I doubt very many Americans think Trump is a sleeper <i>agent</i> in the literal sense of that term.<p>There is, however, considerable circumstantial evidence that he may be <i>compromised</i> by the Russians. The fact that Trump has been less than wholly forthcoming regarding his connections with Russia has only deepened this concern.<p>Multiple people in the Trump orbit--including Trump himself--have had repeated communications with Putin, Russian oligarchs, or their proxies, and have gone to considerable lengths (such as by conducting meetings in private and confiscating the translator&#x27;s notes) to hide the contents of these communications from official records  and lawfully constituted legal investigations.<p>Given that Trump is believed to be deeply in debt (see the recent NYT series on Trump&#x27;s tax records), has had business dealings inside Russia (e.g. Trump Tower Moscow), and has benefited from Russian state-sponsored criminal hacking[0], hidden communications between the Trump orbit and Russia are cause for grave concern over whether Trump has inappropriate ties to the Russian government.<p>Read the Mueller Report and pay particular attention to what could not be proven because the necessary evidence had been destroyed or was otherwise inaccessible.[1]<p>Unlike the current flavor of Republican conspiracy theorizing, the Trump-Russia story is not a bunch of lunatics deluding themselves into thinking that the Democratic party is keeping children captive in the basement of a pizza restaurant. It&#x27;s something backed by actual evidence and has lead to multiple prosecutions.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;15&#x2F;what-happened-trump-counterintelligence-investigation-house-investigators-dont-know&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;15&#x2F;what-happ...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crossfire_Hurricane_(FBI_investigation)#Conclusions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crossfire_Hurricane_(FBI_inves...</a>')
