I don&#x27;t get the impression Hewson is super technically inclined the way, say, Matt Gemmell -- a software engineer turned novelist who&#x27;s also a huge Ulysses fan -- clearly is. Some of the appeal for non-nerds is, I think, part of what grognards like George R.R. Martin and Robert Sawyer argue gives WordStar for DOS a big appeal: it&#x27;s just you and your text with very little else to distract you. I&#x27;ve personally found that a bit overstated (most word processors have some kind of &quot;draft mode&quot; that, while perhaps not as minimal as just You And Your Plain Text, gets the job done), but it&#x27;s clearly a thing, and I admit I enjoy writing in Ulysses more than I would expect.<p>Ulysses does, it&#x27;s worth noting, have the capability to compile and export documents to Microsoft Word format. It&#x27;s not as flexible (or overengineered) as Scrivener&#x27;s compilation tools, but that&#x27;s really something you should be saving until you have what you think is the final draft -- Ulysses and Scrivener, and for that matter NovelWriter, are ultimately composition tools, not editing tools. (Once you&#x27;re in a &quot;dialogue&quot; with your editor sending Word documents with embedded revisions and comments, your manuscript is almost certainly going to stay in Word.)<p>I&#x27;ve written two novels with Scrivener, but I am slowly moving toward Ulysses for a variety of reasons -- but they are, indeed, technical reasons. I don&#x27;t find the &quot;detritus of special characters&quot; to be particularly annoying with a well-chosen Ulysses theme; the underlines&#x2F;asterisks are faded out and the italics and bold are, well, italics and bold, and for fiction that&#x27;s virtually all I need.')
