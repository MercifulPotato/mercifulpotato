I pay for both Notion (it&#x27;s good, thanks!) and Cypress, and have literally described Cypress this way: &quot;Cypress is to Selenium as Notion is to Confluence&quot;... :-O<p>So, I am very surprised (but interested) to hear your tale. It is literally the first time I have ever heard of somebody going back (I assume it is back?) to Selenium from Cypress.<p>When we used Selenium (until mid-2018) our tests were hard to write and hard to parallelize, so they took like an hour on a beefy machine. Now they take 5 minutes (across 16 medium-ish VMs, admittedly, but parallelized &quot;for money, not for free&quot; by the Cypress dash board service.<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear more about your experience moving off Cypress â€” did your test suites take longer to run? (Or did you perhaps move off of it before they introduced auto-parallelization?)')
