In a traditional vaccine, the immune system is exposed to the entire viral protein coat, and therefore may learn to target multiple different proteins from the same virus, not just the spike protein. I suspect OP&#x27;s suggestion is that it&#x27;s possible providing the entire virus may provide additional or more robust immunities against the same virus that we don&#x27;t get from the more targetted mRNA vaccine.<p>I&#x27;d be getting very outside my lane to speculate on whether inducing immunity against multiple proteins would potentially apply to other viruses also carrying those same proteins - I don&#x27;t know how specific or how contextual the immune system&#x27;s response is in this case.')
