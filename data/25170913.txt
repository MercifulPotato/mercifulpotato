But I didn&#x27;t get the impression that Kevin thinks that it&#x27;s the best tool imaginable but rather the best tool that is currently available.<p>But that wasn&#x27;t the point: He&#x27;s right in that constructive&#x2F;intuitionistic mathematics is so niche that it can be safely ignored when discussing formalization of the mathematics he and almost every other mathematician or scientist is interested in.<p>Kevin gets attention because he&#x27;s an accomplished mathematician who tries to formalize his work, or at least what it&#x27;s based on. I find it ridiculous to dismiss his opinion the way you do.')
