Pulp plantations are not forests in the ecological sense, but pulp plantations are not the entirety of modern forestry. Current forestry practices lead to a new increase in tree counts (and eventual carbon capture...) and due to these practices the amount of trees in the USA has been trending upwards since we stopped using trees for charcoal.')
