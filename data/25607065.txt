They have icons and filenames. Windows also hides extensions by default.<p>As far as I recall, extensions became a thing with DOS. They actually had meaning to the OS, e.g. naming a file .exe would make it executable, as there was no other concept of file ownership or permissions.<p>In Unix&#x2F;Linux systems, filename extensions have always been for the user. Before GUIs and icons, they were a convention that let the user know something about the file contents. As far as the operating system is concerned, &quot;.&quot; is just another character in the name and extensions are meaningless. Note that most binary executables don&#x27;t have an extension at all, and other files have more than one (e.g. .tar.gz)')
