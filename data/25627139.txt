I’ve not watched every episode but those I’ve seen have been profoundly impactful.<p>It’s a brilliant showcase of Britain’s National Health Service, showing the absolute brilliance and dedication of its staff even in the most trying of circumstances as well as sharing really moving stories from patients too.<p>If you can find it, episode one of the second series is incredible, focusing on the aftermath of the Westminster terror attack from 2017 and how St Mary’s responded to the gold incident.')
