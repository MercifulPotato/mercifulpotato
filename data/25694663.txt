I am democrat, but I feel this is deeply disturbing.<p>I can see how apple doesn&#x27;t like parler in its app store, and they have every right to remove it.  It is a private company, and it shouldn&#x27;t be forced to host apps that promote violence&#x2F;whatever they feel is wrong.<p>But, the fact that you can&#x27;t download an app, or side-load an app, on any iphone without it being on the app store, makes this decision very worrying.<p>Tim Cook and apple are being the arbiter of all speech&#x2F;content, and this is very similar to autocratic countries where they ban entire sites (Like Erdogan did with youtube and twitter).<p>One rich corporate exec should not have this much power...<p>The solution is that all computing device makers, should have a away for their devices to be able to download&#x2F;side-load apps, without having to go a centralized store.\nThis is better for those countries that are ruled by autocrats as well, where the government suppresses free speech.')
