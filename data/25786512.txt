It will likely be replaced by something like ARM which also incorporates instruction compression for basically free (since memory latency matters more than computing power more with each passing year).<p>So I&#x27;m sad to see them remove MIPS support since I think next-gen 16+ core processors will probably use it. But, after reviving more failing projects than I can count, it&#x27;s not a huge deal to use old commits to re-implement functionality. Most of that work is probably around stuff like endianness issues, atomic instructions, protected memory, caching, etc etc etc. If it helps them to set it aside for now, great, but I hope that MIPS support returns someday is all I&#x27;m saying.')
