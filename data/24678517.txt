Item(by='cies', descendants=None, kids=[24678722], score=None, time=1601814735, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24678474, text='&gt; Child abuse is a physical act and isn&#x27;t speech.<p>I say movies of such acts. That&#x27;s not the act itself. See Japan where comics that show sexual abuse of &quot;young looking individuals&quot; are freely distributed.<p>&gt; These are all different things with their own problems.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re mixing up a lot of things.<p>No, they are all current limitations to free speech encoded in law. I mean to say (please re-read my comment) that &quot;true free speech&quot; already does not exist (just like &quot;truly free markets&quot; dont).<p>&gt; Recruitment and instructional videos are speech.<p>Try massively sharing those to the wider public: I&#x27;m curious how long you stay free or your endeavors remain uninterrupted. Lol.')
