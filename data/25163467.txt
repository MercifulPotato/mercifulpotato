(and that&#x27;s not including songs that have always been missing from spotify&#x27;s library)<p>im very close to going back to using a local library again and i think it would actually work pretty good these days with software like syncthing and musicbrainz, docker, cheap and easy to set up VPS&#x27;s etc etc... that weren&#x27;t a thing when I started using spotify')
