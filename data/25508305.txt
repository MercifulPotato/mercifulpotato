I upgraded many years ago from a 72% sRGB to a 99% sRGB Dell IPS and everything looked much better. I just got the LG 27GN950 which is 95% DCI P3... I was mainly getting it for the 4k&#x2F;144 with the P3 as a nice bonus (I already had 4k&#x2F;60 on the Dell). Looking at the Dell, I was thinking that P3 might be nice to have but it wouldn&#x27;t really matter much aside from photo editing - the colors on the Dell already looked great.<p>I just unboxed the new monitor 2 days ago. The richer color was immediately noticeable, and when I looked at some random photos I took with my phone recently I was blown away by just how <i>red</i> and <i>green</i> and <i>yellow&#x2F;blue</i> things were. Like a completely new realm of color.<p>It&#x27;s one of those things that you can&#x27;t appreciate until you experience it (same going from the original 72% to 99% sRGB).<p>The Dell was $450 for 4k, 2.5 years ago. The new LG was $800, but you can find 60fps P3 4k monitors for around $500 these days iirc. If you&#x27;re on Hacker News you probably use your computer a lot. Unless you&#x27;re running low on cash, upgrading to a great monitor is worth it.')
