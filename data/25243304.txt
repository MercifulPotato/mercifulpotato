I am not a financial advisor.<p>You can follow one of two stock-based strategies:<p>1. Invest 100% in an S&amp;P500 index fund, returning 8%&#x2F;year [1] and growing to $11M in 30 years [2], minus withdrawals.<p>2. Invest 100% in bonds, or a high yield savings account, yielding 0.6%&#x2F;year [3] and growing to $1.2M in 30 years [2], minus withdrawals.<p>You want to do as much of (1) as possible, while doing (2) as little as possible in order to pay for things (mortgage, rent, food, kids, etc.). You can&#x27;t rely on (1) for day to day expenses, since stock returns are super variable (recessions, depressions are inevitable over time).<p>To balance the two, you can think of it as: consider retirement when MIN(1, 2) &gt; expenses. The exact mix of 1 and 2 depends on your personal risk tolerance.<p>EDIT: Numbers for (2) were off, as suggested by multiple people in the comments.
