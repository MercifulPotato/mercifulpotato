You can just skip over it, if your not interested in its work.<p>If your function does an unexpected side effect, thats a problem with the code. Not with the idea of writing functions that do a specific thing.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think people who complain about this, are just bad at creating functions at the correct level of abstraction.<p>It&#x27;s also why i&#x27;m a functional fan, because it makes it more difficult for functions to do unexpected things.')
