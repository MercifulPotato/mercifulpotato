Item(by='bhupy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602197496, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24722858, text='&gt; A problem arises when the appetite for &#x27;bad ideas&#x27; aren&#x27;t merely trivial things like whether Rust is better than C++ but rather consist of ideas over which of ones neighbors should be discriminated against, persecuted, imprisoned, or killed.<p>Sure, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s useful to argue about the extremes since a lot of contemporary contention applies toward  arguably <i>non-violent</i> ideas. For example, is being in favor of Brexit beyond the pale? How about campaigning for it? How about anti-immigration messaging? How about anti-gun control or anti-abortion? The reality is that the vast majority of the divisive targeted ads on FB are around those hot button issues. Almost nobody sees Holocaust-denial or outright genocide advocacy.<p>&gt; Submerging people in sealed bubble of misinformation that only reinforces their prejudices--as Facebook does through a combination of advertising, recommendations, and control over user timelines--does lead to radicalization and that radicalization can be weaponized in ways that are fatal to others.<p>That&#x27;s not a Facebook problem, that&#x27;s a human problem. You either let people consume the ideas they want in a society where information flows freely, or you force people to &quot;eat their vegetables&quot; (so to speak), or prevent people from reading&#x2F;seeing things that we think are &quot;too dangerous&quot;.')
