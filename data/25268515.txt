But marketing isn&#x27;t really known for being technically accurate, why would Apple&#x27;s be any exception?<p>&gt; It strikes me as odd that so many people claim there is zero benefit.<p>That&#x27;s not the claim at all. The claim is that unified memory isn&#x27;t new, and there&#x27;s a decent chance <i>you already had it.</i> For example, every Macbook Air of the last few years has been unified memory. The M1&#x27;s unified memory is therefore a continuation of the existing norms &amp; not something different. The M1&#x27;s IPC is something different. The M1&#x27;s cache latency is something different. The M1&#x27;s 8-wide decoder is something different. There&#x27;s a lot about the M1 that&#x27;s different. Unified memory just isn&#x27;t one of them, and unified memory still just doesn&#x27;t improve CPU performance. All those CPU benchmarks that M1 is tearing up? It&#x27;d put up <i>identical</i> scores without unified memory, since none of those benchmarks involve copying&#x2F;moving data between the CPU and a non-CPU coprocessor like the GPU or neural processor.')
