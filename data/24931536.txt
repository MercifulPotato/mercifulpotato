I pay ~$10&#x2F;month for their smallest cloud sql postgres instance and the rest of the usage pretty much falls under their free tier.<p>For that $10, I get database backups, custom domains and no idea what team projects are, but I can add others to my project. On top of that, I also get everything else that firebase offers... task queue (PubSub), log analysis, hosting, realtime database, analytics, ability to hire someone who knows firebase&#x2F;gcp, google&#x27;s entire devops team.<p>In order to get a bit closer to that level of features, I&#x27;d have to bump up to the $39&#x2F;mo plan. While I appreciate the competition, this doesn&#x27;t compete for me yet.')
