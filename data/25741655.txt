To use land as an example, if someone rents your land you cannot subsequently create restrictions or actively moderate unless they are violating the law. The nature of most social media has been “anything goes” and then we moderate... Given social media is often viewed as a form of free speech for laypeople it doesn’t seem unreasonable to have strict standards for removing content. I could see social media sites requiring much more personal information, real ID, bank&#x2F;CC accounts to provide these services in the future similar to how rental contracts are governed. I can’t even use real candles in my apartment without violating my rental agreement.')
