I meant, discussing inside the workplace issues that are relevant to their lives inside and outside work.<p>&gt; As for your question, everyone is of course allowed to ask for more pay. This is not what I&#x27;d call politics, but simply salary negotiation.<p>OK.  Let&#x27;s take it a few steps further?<p>Are women allowed to say, &quot;you know, women are paid less than men for most jobs in this country, let&#x27;s advocate that this not be the case at our company?&quot;  Are they allowed to say, &quot;you know, our company shouldn&#x27;t be supporting X politician, because they&#x27;re not in favor of equal pay for equal work?&quot;  Are they allowed to say, &quot;you know, just as our company advocates for laws and regulations that we think are beneficial to our core technical business (software or whatever), we should also advocate for laws and regulations that are good for our people, like paid maternity leave.&quot;<p>And, just step back: Does it give you any pause that we&#x27;re having a conversation about what what women are allowed to say?')
