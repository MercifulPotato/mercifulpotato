There are legitimate questions about the use of police funding for militarization, and those questions have been raised by people all over the political spectrum.  There are also serious problems with the differences in how the police handle calls, patrol work, and arrests in black neighborhoods and with black suspects versus white neighborhoods.  Since the 90s the alarm has been sounded about the infiltration of police forces across the country by white nationalists and neonazis.  Those concerns can be addressed by well-planned police reform, which is what people have actually been calling for.<p>As for 20th century Europe, we are already there when armed terrorists invade the Capitol in an attempt to, as they themselves said, overthrow the government.')
