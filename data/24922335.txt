I had to set my prices based on the highest rewards card fees, and if someone paid with a lower fee card, I just kept the difference as extra profit. (My agreement with the CC processor explicitly required me to give everyone the same price regardless of how they paid.)<p>I think 5% is a special case that&#x27;s limited to specific vendors or products, I&#x27;m not aware of any general rebate higher than 2%.<p>I know Stripe and Square and other companies have come along now that charge the same fees regardless of the type of card - but note that they&#x27;re all above 2%.<p>I think the only difference now is that Stripe&#x2F;Square&#x2F;etc. keep the difference as profit when someone pays with a non-rewards card, instead of the vendor. (But, in their defense, they&#x27;re able to negotiate lower rates than I was ever able to get on my own.)')
