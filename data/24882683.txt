We might even say that their goal is an ethnocide. But calling it a genocide is using a definition of the term that is controversial (and not accepted by a majority of scholars). The core of the debate is on what &quot;intent to destroy&quot; means:<p>&quot;The specific intent element defines the purpose of committing the acts: &quot;to destroy in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such&quot;. The specific intent is a core factor distinguishing genocide from other international crimes, such as war crimes or crimes against humanity.<p>In 2007, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) noted in its judgement on Jorgic v. Germany case that, in 1992, the majority of legal scholars took the narrow view that &quot;intent to destroy&quot; in the CPPCG meant the intended physical-biological destruction of the protected group, and that this was still the majority opinion. But the ECHR also noted that a minority took a broader view, and did not consider biological-physical destruction to be necessary, as the intent to destroy a national, racial, religious or ethnic group was enough to qualify as genocide.[29]&quot;<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Genocide" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Genocide</a>')
