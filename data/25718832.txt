Here&#x27;s a very similar bit of code that can be tweaked easily: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openprocessing.org&#x2F;sketch&#x2F;494102&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openprocessing.org&#x2F;sketch&#x2F;494102&#x2F;</a><p>Setting the particle speed to more than about 0.5 (on line 46) results in &quot;aberrations&quot;. The dynamics are quite interesting and I&#x27;m not sure exactly what&#x27;s going on, but I think wetmore&#x27;s answer is correctâ€”when the steps are small enough, everything remains as smooth as the underlying scalar field produced by Perlin noise.')
