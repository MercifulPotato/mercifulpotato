Especially the lower wage ones. Living costs are rather similar in the us and in the eu. That mostly depends on what city you live. You can’t fire people easily so there is a huge risk involved into employing people. Especially low wage jobs. High taxes for companies and high income taxes add to that and you generally have less money to spend at the end of the month.')
