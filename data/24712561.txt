The ones that did told me that I didn&#x27;t have enough experience.<p>12 months later, I finally got a job, at some small startup that has its good and bad points. The first thing I&#x27;m noticing: university was felt much harder and I felt I was learning a lot more there.<p>I feel completely demotivated that most companies (and all big companies) weren&#x27;t considering me when I applied to them (and probably still aren&#x27;t). It crushed my motivation and now I am simply performing to expectations. It does mean my work is quite relaxing :)<p>Example:<p>At my work, I recently learned a bit more about React hooks. I knew they existed, but never used them and this time I learned a bit on using them.<p>In my final university course I learned how to perform Meltdown&#x2F;Spectre, read security papers and even more advanced attacks.')
