Like &quot;speed limiters&quot; in cars. We could also trust car drivers &quot;when it comes to observing the speed limit&quot;, but in many cases we don&#x27;t, do we? And that&#x27;s a mechanical limit imposed on top of fines for speeding and so on...<p>&quot;But here they only hurt themselves&quot; is not necessarily true. If you have family private data and they&#x27;re stolen because you&#x27;ve installed a malicious extension, doesn&#x27;t it also hurt your family? If your own data are then used to phish your friends, doesn&#x27;t it also hurts them?<p>&gt;<i>Which certainly sounds like preventing the end user from &quot;running any code Apple didnt sell to you in the first place&quot;.</i><p>Not really since:<p>(a) you can run many kinds of code (JS, etc) still in your web browser, can you not? Just not extensions with extra capabilities for sniffing, etc. So &quot;only thinks Apple sold you&quot; is not really accurate.<p>(b) the core reason is not profit, as the &quot;Apple didn&#x27;t sell you&quot; part implies.')
