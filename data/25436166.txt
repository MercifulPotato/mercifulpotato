What I see a lot of is people pointing out that the definition of &quot;journalist&quot; is very very loose in 2020, and that has an effect on the arrest stats.<p>This itself is an authoritarian tendency that is increasingly alarming me lately (a feeling that started after 9&#x2F;11.) I think we&#x27;re going to see &quot;journalist&quot; becoming a licensed profession within the next 20 years, which is a commonality amongst all authoritarian dictatorships. When people start talking about who is or isn&#x27;t a journalist, and identifying ideological opponents as not journalists, the only outcome is a media that is defined as legitimate by how loyal it is.')
