Most businesses will end up with negative profits. At best, no profits. Imagine being an employee for a year or two and then having to <i>pay</i> for the luxury at the end. It is no surprise that it is avoided, usually. It is definitely an option, though, for the workers who like the risk and think the chance of winning the lottery is there.<p>Instead, workers usually prefer to estimate what the profitability will be up front and determine what they want out of the pie based on that assumption. Then they lock in at that price regardless of what happens. If the business fails, they still get their agreed upon amount. If the business thrives, they might only end up with a small piece of the pie, but it was worth it given the risk of ending up with nothing. It&#x27;s essentially a futures contract.<p>It seems a little much to get to have it both ways â€“ to be guaranteed the estimated piece of the pie when the business fails, but also all the upside when the business succeeds beyond imagination. Why would anyone agree to that? Those rare moonshot wins are what pays the workers for the times that there are losses. If the workers got the proceeds from the moonshot wins <i>and</i> the proceeds from their futures contracts, the math would stop adding up and employment would grind to a halt.')
