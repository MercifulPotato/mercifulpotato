I was responding to the OP. This thread began with:<p>&gt; I have different idea about essential complexity and accidental complexity. I think examples in the article are all just accidental complexity.<p>I was elaborating on that different idea. Everyone seems to be just reverting back to the text book and rejecting the difference not on merits, but for simply not matching.<p>But complexity is complexity. If we really want to talk about complexity and where the unavoidable part is coming from, then it&#x27;s from the layer underneath also. When speaking of complexity reduction, you cannot ignore the complexity imposed.')
