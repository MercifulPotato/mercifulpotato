For some reason, while in a dream, we are incapable of doubting what is going on. Everything feels incredibly vivid and real. Then we wake up, and we go back to doubting: &quot;Ah, must&#x27;ve been a dream!&quot;<p>Edit: Perhaps immersive psychedelics (LSD, ketamine) are similar actually. Speculatively, one could define &quot;real&quot; as our ability to doubt, &quot;fantasy&quot; as the suspension of doubt.')
