I am not going to discuss the details of the meaning of the words &quot;sexual abuse of children&quot; with you, because for what i have to say it is irrelevant how much you want to bend and weaken this once meaningful phrase. This is going to be about your willingness to relentlessly exaggerate to fuel your own cause: it has made you the one harassing people based on their opinion. And we don&#x27;t like your kind of people here.<p>Tell me, why don&#x27;t you go and fight someone whose actions endanger women and children? Maybe go after the rich friends of sleazy playboy Epstein, who was very charming with the ladies and ran a criminal brothel. Or go after the prophet who married girls as young as seven and wrote about that in a holy book followed dogmatically by a major religion. Or go and protest actual child labor and marriage in Nigeria. And when i mean &quot;go&quot; and don&#x27;t mean &quot;talk more&quot; i mean please go.<p>And take your agenda with you. Your &quot;more welcoming to women&quot; is nothing but some self-absorbed narcissism, you are like a chauvinistic minstrel knight, who is claiming to make the road safe for the weak sex by the might of your sword, yet does nothing but bicker and bitch about your chosen enemy, the &quot;creepy nerd who voiced opinions you don&#x27;t agree with&quot; - oh what heroic deeds you do. Such macho behavior would not even impresses some giggling girls of first semester gender studies, and it will surly not impress the honorable ladies of the community, who wrote code that sent people to space, power aircraft carriers, nuclear plants and the internet, who followed for generations in the footsteps of women like Rear Admiral Dr Grace &quot;Grandma Cobol&quot; Hopper. They neither need, nor want your twitter drama style vigilante protectionism.<p>Oh and on your way out, take that &quot;smearing people for great justice&quot; and &quot;the accused should prove innocence&quot; garbage you spouted in your comments here out with you. You overstepped, you are far out of line, and your opinions don&#x27;t speak well for the community, so by your own logic, get out! Am i being clear? You are done, you are canceled, you f&#x27;d up and are not welcome anymore.<p>So say, how does it feel, when people go after you for some stupid thing you said?<p>Again, i am not defending rms opinion about a topic of your choice, my point is: every community the SJW enter with their agenda of what they say will bring positive change long term turns into a toxic swamp of social drama. They are a splinter group of totalitarian socialists, believing to mold the people into ideal humans by means of social pressure, and are willing to  harasse or even terrorize people, while demanding every aspect of society must follow their orthodox philosophy, because only then they can get rid of all the degenerates. I sure don&#x27;t want those radicals as leadership, either. I see them as a danger to the very foundations of democracy and freedom. But they are very successful because they imagine themselves as the righteous guardians of morality and grant immediate feelings of power and social cohesion when they vigilante mob someone.<p>So tell me, who should lead the community? Because for me it looks a lot like it is soon going to be a duma selected to match quotas of race, age, gender and sexuality, but limited to a strict and orthodox set of believes not about the communal subject matter, but about everything else. This duma will be plagued by constant infighting, bickering, and their tries to socially assassinated each other, like a bunch of crabs in a barrel. They will focus not on source-code but on code-of-conduct, not on merit in the subject-matter  but on the flaws of the person. They will establish no inclusive infrastructure, but systematic precedence for canceling access, denying bug reports and even merge requests because of things like arbitrary twitter drama. For this astonishing communal work they will be paid by the corporations that wish for nothing more then to embrace and expand the community, throwing around buzzwords like welcoming, diverse and inclusive to justify such involvement. How is it a welcoming community that tells people that their technological and intellectual commitment is not welcome, because their opinion on an unrelated matter in a different context is not in line? These very corporations already try to rebrand &quot;free and open source&quot; as the feature-incomplete version of &quot;enterprise edition&quot; and their next step is to exploit: participating in such communities will become a job requirement: you want to be a programmer? work for free, prove you not only have technical skill but can stay in line in behavior and opinion, and then we will maybe see about some gig work. It is young adults, barely legal, who are most vulnerable to such promises and they will comply willingly.')
