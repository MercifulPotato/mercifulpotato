That seems like such a strong calling convention change that it wouldn&#x27;t really bother me if you had to recompile all your software in this situation.<p>I mean, let&#x27;s even imagine that there would be a way to make this change somewhat transparent and automated. You still end up with some types magically now taking 256 bits instead of (probably) 64bits before that. If you use this type a lot the performance implications are pretty huge, both in terms of actually doing maths with a 256 bit integer, but also for RAM and cache usage.<p>If you suddenly changed int to be 64 instead of 32bits you&#x27;d have a similar problem for instance. I don&#x27;t think anybody would expect such a change not to require a full recompile. So what&#x27;s the difference here?')
