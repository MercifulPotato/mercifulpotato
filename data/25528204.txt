Fair enough.  Neither do I.<p>Lots of people advocate trying to make peace, or ignore the train running down to where you&#x27;re tied on the tracks.  Might have been the best move anytime before a few centuries ago.  Now, though?  We might have medicine good enough to halt aging within the next few generations.  You might be too late to save yourself, but you might be able to save your kids.  So donate money to anti-aging organisations, or change your job- use your resources in the most efficient way you can figure out to help on the task of solving the problem.  Long term, that&#x27;s the only solution.  Even if it&#x27;s too late to get yourself to &#x27;longevity escape velocity&#x27;, being one of the million cuts that beats back death seems worthwhile.')
