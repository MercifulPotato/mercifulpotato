Item(by='viraptor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602480106, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24750950, text='&gt; 3) It undermines artistic intent: Giving people the ability to remix a song that is outside of the artist&#x27;s control would probably run counter to their vision of what the song should be.<p>I&#x27;m conflicted about that point. On one hand side I understand they want to control the end product. On the other, the two &quot;albums&quot; I love just for their sound are DMB&#x27;s Lillywhite Sessions and some barely mixed Deep Purple garage recordings. I suspect it&#x27;s mainly due to lack of compression, since I also prefer the older raw records to modern remasters, but there could be something more I can&#x27;t consciously identify.')
