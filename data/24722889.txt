Item(by='wahern', descendants=None, kids=[24722980], score=None, time=1602185555, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24722616, text='I think Cloudflare is a different kind of &quot;edge&quot; service than what EPYC Embedded targets, and I would think Cloudflare uses regular EPYC chips. The &quot;edge&quot; that EPYC Embedded, Xeon D, etc target is, I think, more about the hardware configurations (smaller enclosures, minimal number of drives and other devices) and the type of facility (usually not a colocation facility, so power and heat are of significantly more concern). But the workloads are still very much server-class.<p>EPYC Embedded chips are competitive with Intel&#x27;s offerings (Xeon D, etc), but as I said Intel&#x27;s ecosystem is richer--for example, more, better motherboards. It&#x27;s not enough that AMD&#x27;s chips are competitive with Intel&#x27;s. AMD has a huge ecosystem handicap, and so either they need to improve the ecosystem or sell chips that are <i>dramatically</i> better than Intel&#x27;s, and for EPYC Embedded neither is the case. Long term a better ecosystem is necessary for AMD to survive because a broader product and customer base brings consistent income and mindshare--staying power. I would hope and assume AMD is working closely with cloud vendors on their proprietary hardware, but the results are opaque; judging by traditional channels (Supermicro, etc), AMD hasn&#x27;t even begun to close the gap.')
