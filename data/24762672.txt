All without any Virtual File System? Just real device level mounts?<p><pre><code>    #&gt; mount HTTP:\n    #&gt; COPY HTTP:hostname.tld&#x2F;~user&#x2F;index.html TO folder&#x2F;\n</code></pre>\n...like...having a hypertext standard, which can cross-reference all your includes, combine them with system documentation and have them appear on hover in your editor?<p>And so much more...<p>Yes, you can do all these things, the one way or other, on today&#x27;s systems (except the mounting example,afaik). But with the Amiga these things were built-in. Which means, that, instead of system administration and time wasted on setup and tooling, you would just use the things and enjoy more productivity.')
