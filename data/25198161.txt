(Note as far as whether or not to reverse one of the functions, multiplication in base-b agrees with &quot;convolution&quot; and not with &quot;sliding dot product&quot;.)<p>Elsewhere in the thread you seem to be suggesting that convolution is a way to convert between a frequency domain and a time domain, which suggests that you are confusing convolution with Fourier transforms. There&#x27;s some nice relationships between these things, so they are often discussed together, but even then a single convolution happens either entirely in the time domain or entirely in the frequency domain, not as a way of going from one of those domains to the other. E.g. the pointwise product (in the frequency domain) of the Fourier transforms of two functions is the Fourier transform of the convolution (in the time domain) of those two functions.<p>There&#x27;s also a chance you are focused on the difference between functions with a discrete domain and functions with a continuous domain. The term &quot;convolution&quot; is often applied to both.')
