If you let programmers have namespacing they will invent enterprise software frameworks where every class is six layers deep in a namespace of random tech buzzwords they thought up.<p>&gt; Hence, I ask the question on behalf myself and others who did not appreciate the language and did not give it a proper chance... what did I miss and what are its top appeals?<p>It implements message-based programming, which is &quot;real&quot; OOP and more powerful than something like C++, where OOP just means function calls where the first parameter goes to the left of the function name instead of the right.<p>In particular it implements this pattern: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?AlternateHardAndSoftLayers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a>\nwhich is great for UI programming and lets you define the UI in data rather than code. Although iOS programmers seem to like doing it in code anyway.')
