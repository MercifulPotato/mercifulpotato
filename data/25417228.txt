These price engines (every one I&#x27;ve seen) are all affiliate hubs; they list only products that pay for the click.  Any reviews on such sites are biased in similar ways to the gaming in reviews in major sites like Amazon.<p>Now, one could say, &quot;so what?  Most folks know that, useful info still, and it&#x27;s better than ads!&quot;.  But is it?   At least the ad is an overt block of color, but affiliate links are hidden behind redirects and tiny disclaimers (in the few regions that require disclosure).<p>It&#x27;s fine (and easy) to complain about display ads or video ads, but there&#x27;s a lot more. Product brand shown or mentioned in tv or movie:ad.  Movie trailers: yep, ad.  Public media mentioning a sponsor: ad.  That tiktok or insta person who always has branded product in the frame?  ad.<p>In fact, most product discovery comes from ads.  Is there another way?   Probably, but ads have worked better than any other approach for so long, we haven&#x27;t beaten it yet. I hope we do, but til then, for every 100 ads I despise, I&#x27;m still happy I found that one thing I actually liked.  Can&#x27;t say that defends all ads, but it gives me hope that we can find a good middle spot.')
