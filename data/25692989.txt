The library then converts that number using a formula to work out a date&#x2F;time. If it is decided a leap second is added or subtracted, and the library&#x27;s formula doesn&#x27;t account for it, then the time will be calculated incorrectly.<p>For most software it is unlikely to matter too much, but this sort of thing can lead to unpredictable emergent behavior in complex networked systems.')
