Even India and, theoretically, even Russia, too.<p>So, it&#x27;s not surprising the average Chinese person has a decent understanding of how a basic democracy works.<p>In some ways, China is also not THAT much different, either. But it is more different than pretty much every other major economy in the world.<p>I mean, for one, it does not even put on a charade of being a democracy. It pretends to be communist (economically), but in a lot of ways it is more capitalist than a lot of the West. And the scale of the government is enormous. It&#x27;s much more different, and there&#x27;s really not much of a reason for many people in the US to have a decent idea of how it works.<p>China&#x27;s government does not affect our daily lives that much - at least not yet. And Americans (like most people) are mostly concerned with themselves.')
