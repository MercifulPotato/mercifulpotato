The concern was that due process could not be applied fairly since the definition of obscenity was so subjective.<p>There was a number of cases where works of literature or art were charged with obscenity, and it became an embarrassment to police and the judicial system since the criteria was so arbitrary.<p>So it wasn&#x27;t so much a question of pro or against porn, it it a question of justice.<p>The discussion mostly concerned &quot;obscene&quot; literature since photographic porn was not widespread. But the repeal of the law combined with technological advances made Denmark into a powerhouse of pornography magazines and movies - probably not what the conservative government had expected.')
