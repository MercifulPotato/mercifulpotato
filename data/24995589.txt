Essentially, our state has an online-to-offline process to convert digital votes to a PDF that can be emailed or faxed, then printed and processed like any other vote.<p>We could immediately open this system up to every American with a small number of technical &amp; legal changes.<p>Most of my thoughts about a more complex system are probably not unique, but thinking about this generated a few details that may be interesting.<p>The obvious final conclusion (for me) was that we could digitize our entire system in a few election cycles, without throwing out the entire system and starting over.<p>Just 1. Set minimum requirements federally for voter registration systems, 2. Create digital tools for creating and tabulating votes (form to PDF software, public ledgers), &amp; 3. Allow everyone to cast a digital vote which can be converted to a normal paper ballot.<p>Then, at some point in time, you reverse the system, and make your digital ledger your source of truth, instead of your paper ballot counts.')
