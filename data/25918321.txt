But I’d argue that one of the primary reasons folks avoid types is that it requires additional learning.<p>I’m speculating here, but as a software engineer who’s dealt with many different languages, I (personally) find types to increase my productivity, because it reduces errors at runtime. This is a huge benefit, and because I’ve spent a lot of time learning the target language’s type system, it doesn’t come at the cost of productivity, and like I said, I find it to improve my downstream productivity.<p>I’ve read that scientists have had significant mistakes in their findings in papers due to bugs, which I know is anecdotal, but it seems like adopting typed languages would reduce those errors and increase confidence in studies.<p>I wonder if they were able to recognize the downstream benefits of types, if they would shrug them off as irrelevant to their work.')
