Figuring out what stuff gets called is really hard in something as big as Chromium, where there are so many components that in some spots have their own domain-specific language to link stuff together.<p>For others, no, they do allow the minifier to break some sites: they analyze the Alexa top 1000 and check which functions get called and how often by those sites.')
