I think it will be great when self driving works, but for driving it’s hard to try to touch parts of a flat screen.<p>Here’s an example of various controls I fiddle with while driving: temperature control through a little knob that sticks out; Heated seats through a button with sight curve around borders; Apple CarPlay through a knob.<p>There’s also no heads up display to present speed and nav onto the windshield.<p>All these things are good for me to look at the road and not have to precisely touch something with at least a few seconds of focus.<p>I have friends who love their Tesla and love the touch screen so it may just be my control style that doesn’t work.<p>I suspect Apple would get this stuff better.')
