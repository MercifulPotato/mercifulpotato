It looks like this: [image] Those paragraphs are so wide! Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t constrain the container width at all. This leads to lines that are hundreds of characters in length.<p>NOOOOO! Please, please, please, please stop second-guessing my choice of browser window width! I bought a nice 27&quot; monitor, and maybe I just want to use the whole thing. Why is your opinion about the amount of space I should be able to use for text more important than mine? I honestly don&#x27;t care what your research says about optimal character lengths. I deliberately stretched my browser window to be this wide. Please don&#x27;t override me.')
