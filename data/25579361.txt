Item(by='gwillen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609312025, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25575799, text='I suspect I know the cause of this -- there was a change to Google Maps not long ago, related to how it computes destination points when your destination is a large area (such as a large park.) It used to try to take you to the official address, or some central point; these days, what I observe is that it takes you to _some_ point where the road hits the edge of the destination area. I&#x27;m not sure how it chooses what point, but it looks like it missed.<p>(Note: I don&#x27;t work for Google, and haven&#x27;t for many years. I mostly noticed this change because it finally fixed a longstanding directions issue that I first reported ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO, involving directions to the Pittsburgh International Airport.)')
