There&#x27;s a <i>ton</i> of one-stop &quot;install this app &amp; start coding!&quot; apps out there. Someone wants one of those for node.js, sure, knock yourself out, go for it. It&#x27;d be just one of a dozen such apps, not a new concept, and not unexplored territory.<p>But the authors request that this is built into the browser seems insane to me. Why would we bloat browsers with unnecessary stuff just to avoid hitting an app store, which is also extremely user-friendly? It&#x27;s literally a request for bundled bloatware. No, hell no.')
