There’s nothing more pure than math, and that’s digital PCM audio. Sure, it’s stored as discreet samples, but that’s not how it comes out of speakers. The digital-&gt;analog converter will give you 1:1 perfect representation of the original waveform as long as you sample at 2x the highest frequency desired and there’s a low-pass filter in place.')
