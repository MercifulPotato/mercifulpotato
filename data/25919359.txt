I can appreciate the difficulties you must be facing in organising something of this scale, and I&#x27;m impressed by how you&#x27;re handling it so far.<p>That said, would you be able to clarify how many spaces there are still available on the paid tiers? By choosing to allocate those spaces to people who have $20-$100 to spend to attend a Zoom meeting, I&#x27;m sure you appreciate you are prioritising the input of those from higher income brackets over (e.g:) working class people, students, etc. I do think it&#x27;s important that this is something that is clear to people who would consider giving money to an ideological effort such as this.')
