Peasants did not entered Russian politics in meaningful way at all. Simply, being illiterate to the point where you cant even improve on super behind farming also makes you pretty crappy at anything politics. Peasants attacked local rules here and there, then being bloodily suppressed wherever things got tight. That was it.<p>The monarchy, the military, the civil service, they were all &quot;intelligentsia&quot; too. &quot;Liberal bourgeoisie&quot; and capitalists were &quot;intelligentsia&quot; too. There were freaking 5 armies in Russia civil war. All 5 were led by people able to read and write. You all make it sound as if &quot;intelligentsia&quot; were uniformly Leninist or something. They were not, that is just the army that won. And I would be even super surprised if communists were the most educated of them all.<p>Yet also, the Russia monarchy was not exactly stable democratic functioning place until Lenin started revolution by the end of WWI out of nowhere.<p>I honestly hate when people who are supposedly against communist somehow adopt communist framing in completely absurd ways, down to blaming &quot;intelligentsia&quot; for whatever they perceive bad and down to attributing whole of Russian civil war to communists. I would really like to see someone use the term intelligentsia for like American journalist, teachers, or programmers. Lets all assume that all college educated people in American hold the same opinions. It is that stupid term.')
