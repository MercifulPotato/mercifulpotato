Once one is entangled in the legal system, they are more likely to be called in for questioning, have their fingerprints possibly match a partial set left at a crime, have a possible DNA match turn into a warrant that leads to arrest on an unrelated crime. This is true because the web of laws, in the US at least, means that everyone breaks dozens of laws a day. So AI becomes a self-licking ice cream cone. Even worse, it is one that comes with a plausible argument of simply being an unbiased mathematical conclusion.<p>Of course math doesn’t have an agenda, but we aren’t talking about the actual algorithm having a human bias. We are talking about the application of math by humans to human problems using data sets curated by humans. Using math doesn’t purge the biases of all those humans from the system.')
