Even the substructure where the &quot;program&quot; runs changes properties (like a CPU changing material properties mid-execution).<p>Fourth, the &quot;program&quot; is self-modifying constantly, as opposed to a static program or different reprogrammings of an FPGI.<p>Fifth, there&#x27;s no manual or clear schematics.')
