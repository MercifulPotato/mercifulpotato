It&#x27;s not a very habitable place but the introduction of European crops and animals has irrevocably improved this. You&#x27;re still looking at the likely death of nineteen out of every twenty Australians in this scenario.<p>(actually, having thought about this, the &quot;collapse&quot; scenario I&#x27;d be most worried about in Australia is average temperatures above human survivable levels plus wildfires. Not so much a collapse as a thorough incineration)')
