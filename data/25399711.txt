Well done. Also during the squabble between Trump and Kim-Jun-Un, the CCP just send 4000 troups in 16 different location around the Indian ocean, to &quot;secure their investment&quot;.<p>TBH i&#x27;m glad there is a little competition to the US, and that the CCP successfully outplayed the US on a diplomatic standpoint, but please don&#x27;t conflate foreign policy and war. War is such a small part of foreign policy overall.')
