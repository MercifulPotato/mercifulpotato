I certainly <i>could</i> create my ideal text editor, from a technical point of view. It would probably only take me a few days to get the essentials covered.<p>But then it would probably take another month or more to polish it and fix a few annoying bugs. I&#x27;d want to integrate things like themes for when I feel like a change of style. And language servers for when I want more powerful integration, obviously. Oh, and integrated Git support is all the rage right now. But best make it modular in case my next client prefers Hg.<p>Then there would be a fortnight when I got obsessed with fuzzy string matching for search and replace and how it might interact with multiple selections to create a highly efficient quasi-macro system. That would inevitably lead down a rabbit hole of reading a dozen papers and watching several conference talks. OK, at least I might have got a nice speaking gig at the end of this one, at least if there were any local meet-ups actually happening by then.<p>But by that time it&#x27;s mid-2021. I still haven&#x27;t actually got a better editor overall than half a dozen choices I could have used the day I started. I also haven&#x27;t made any money for the last three quarters, and the bills are coming due.<p>Just because I <i>can</i> fix something for myself, that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean I <i>should</i> or <i>want to</i>.')
