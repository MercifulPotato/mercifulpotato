Item(by='quantamiser', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611475384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25890268, text='OP here. A few months ago I changed jobs. The last time I gave an interview was as an entry level engineer 7 years ago. Since then I had become a manager and hired many engineers but I had no clue what questions will be asked when I interview for EM+ positions. I interviewed with a dozen different startups of different kinds. EM positions are vague and vary from company to company. With each interview I got better and I realized it would have been much easier if I knew what to expect in these interviews. I have collated the questions I was asked and this can evolve to a repo of all kinds of software engineering leadership interview questions.<p>Please share feedback, open issues, participate in discussions and I will try best to improve this')
