Didn&#x27;t you also do it because you HAD to, because it was THERE and you wanted to see it become real?<p>Drift about a bit, enjoy life and don&#x27;t worry about stuff.. Follow what seems interesting, if that&#x27;s nothing, then don&#x27;t follow anything for a while and wait until something comes around that needs doing.<p>I&#x27;ve often been asked why I didn&#x27;t patent FinalKey or made it into a company.. If I don&#x27;t regret that because maybe I could have become wealthy. My answer is always the same: I was done with it and I had no interest in continuing it, something more interesting had come along.')
