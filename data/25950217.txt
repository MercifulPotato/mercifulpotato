Item(by='injb', descendants=None, kids=[25951157], score=None, time=1611872238, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25947105, text='When I first moved to the US I was struck by how certain makes of car that were synonymous with bullet proof reliability in Europe were widely regarded as &quot;over complicated, overpriced, unmaintainable crap&quot; etc. in the US.<p>There&#x27;s a difference in the culture of car ownership and maintenance for sure. In the US, people seem to expect a wide margin of over engineering. I can&#x27;t count how many times I&#x27;ve encountered people driving cars with timing belts and interference engines, and <i>no idea</i> that they have to change the timing belt periodically. Or people who &quot;upgrade&quot; their cars with aftermarket stuff and then complain when it breaks. They expect it to just work unconditionally.<p>The video seems to be based on the complaint that a gasket failed (20 years old) and was hard to get to. Well, there has to be some parts on a car that are hard to get to. They can&#x27;t all be easy. The E46 is a great car in my opinion, and one of the easiest cars in it&#x27;s class to work on.')
