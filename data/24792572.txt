Thomas has a penchant for gratuitously giving his personal opinion when nobody is asking for it. If I had a nickel for every time Thomas wrote to suggest the court should pick up an ancillary issue in the future, and then proceeded to write his future opinion....<p>Sometimes I wish the court <i>would</i> pick up an issue. Many years ago Thomas wrote in a cert denial regarding developer exactions (i.e. making a developer pay for something as a price for project approval) that the court should find a [better] case to make clear the boundaries of unconstitutional exactions. But of course the court has yet to do that, and even if it did I have little reason to believe (unfortunately) the rest of the justices shared Thomas&#x27; disdain for exactions.<p>The same is likely true here: I doubt most of the other justices have a pressing desire to step into the middle of the Section 230 debate, and even if they did I doubt even more that they would share Thomas&#x27; peculiar interpretation of the law. Note that just because Thomas (or any justice) says that their interpretation is the obvious &quot;plain text&quot; meaning, that doesn&#x27;t actually mean it is.')
