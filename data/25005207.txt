Since it&#x27;s a gui app, I don&#x27;t think you can run it inside of wsl. You can use a plugin to connect to wsl, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s quite the same thing, and I wouldn&#x27;t expect it would allow clipboard sharing.<p>The general point is right though. This is an issue with any terminal program that either doesn&#x27;t allow selection of text, or has a system for selection of text that&#x27;s separate to that of the terminal emulator.')
