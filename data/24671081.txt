If you can send the computation through multiple universes and get back a &#x27;YES&#x27; or &#x27;NO&#x27; answer, depending on whether the &#x27;YES&#x27; or &#x27;NO&#x27; is quantified existentially or universally on the leaves of the computation tree, you get NP or co-NP. Intuitively speaking, imagine you have a 3-SAT instance; you can send one assignment of truth values to the variables to each parallel universe for computation. If the multiverse answers you &#x27;YES&#x27; if there exists one universe that says &#x27;YES&#x27;, that solves NP problems in P-time. If the multiverse answers you &#x27;YES&#x27; if <i>all</i> universes say &#x27;YES&#x27;, that solves co-NP problems in P time.')
