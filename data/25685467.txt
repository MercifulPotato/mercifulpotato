From what i got, it was NYTime &gt; Wapo = FoxNews &gt; random Tabloids, do you have an issue with this?<p>Do you think in general, Fox News is more reliable than the New York Times (when one is a televised source with article covering their shows, and the other a newspaper with limited editorial content)? In fact, in a nutshell, would you trust a random editorial on science and technology from the NYT or a random editorial on science and technology from Fox News?<p>I know i trust the scientific doing vulgarization work for the NYT more than scientific ones factchecking the &quot;science&quot; on Fox News, but this is just because i don&#x27;t know who Fox News hired for this, do you have information on him?<p>By the way, the man writing science articles for France NYT equivalent (le Monde) is really biased and i don&#x27;t trust any of his article by principle, so its no a &quot;mainstream media good!&quot; position, i just read articles, compare what i know for sure and the articles, and if its more wrong than right, I throw the man and whatever he ever wrote after that in field i don&#x27;t really get (so not physics and not compsi). I can&#x27;t do that for Fox News (its not often signed sadly, and its often shitty pseudoscience). If you have a method that tells you that Fox News is factually better than the NYT (and not an arbitrary one), could you share this method?')
