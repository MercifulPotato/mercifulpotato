By law you cannot be both. The price paid by retail providers to wholesale providers is currently set by the commerce commission because the infrastructure being built and managed by the wholesale providers was heavily subsidised by the govt. The (4) wholesale providers are effectively regional monopolies but importantly cannot set their prices, and the retail providers compete on value-add services and price for which there is fairly healthy competition.')
