It sounds like coming at it from the perspective of someone who hasn&#x27;t used it in over a decade. Modern PHP with frameworks is just about as good as it gets for web development.<p><i>hard</i> disagree, but I&#x27;d love to learn more of the things that PHP is good at when compared to other frameworks and languages. Rails &amp; Django are the frameworks to beat in terms of completeness and productivity, Flask&#x2F;Sinatra for python&#x2F;ruby flavored micro frameworks, NodeJS for massive concurrency and parallelism (Node <i>does</i> support threads as well as subprocesses) and large (sometimes sketchy) ecosystem and ease of contributions. There are the compiled languages as well with various advantages -- single binary deploy, speed, error avoidance with compile time type declaration&#x2F;inference, etc.<p>What does modern PHP and a framework (like Laravel? what is popular in the space these days?) do better than it&#x27;s contemporaries do? IIRC HHVM which seemed to be a bright spot (?) was abandoned by FB... Would love to hear about PHP&#x27;s bright spots from a PHP enthusiast.')
