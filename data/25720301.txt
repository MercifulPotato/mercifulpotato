You offer better choices to people than they currently have, such as access to good education and tools they are free to use to manage their personal life (e.g condoms). As a side-effect it is expected that the number of birth per woman will reduce over time.<p>People are free to use or not birth controls if they want or not children, same for the education. People aren&#x27;t tricked in reducing the amount of children they have. Data in developed countries seems to point that when people are better educated and have the tools to decide for children, they get them later in life and in less quantity (without considering other factors, such as religious communities that have more children per woman than average).')
