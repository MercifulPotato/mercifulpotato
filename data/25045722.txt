According to others it&#x27;s wrong to eat meat. Who are we to say which is worse? Which ultimately causes more harm and suffering in the world? It&#x27;s great that you&#x27;re not a fussy eater. Now try to show some respect for people who make different choices than you. And speaking of righteous indignation, you are showing a good deal of it in the face of some imagined restaurant incident; everyone else has simply pointed out that you can&#x27;t sell non-vegetarian food as vegetarian.')
