To solve that, you find a benign site with existing business purpose (like GitHub or a wiki or a pastebin), and you insert your desired IP address. So maybe you add it as new file in a repo under your cool new fake GitHub account, and the file just says “1.2.3.4”. Now you can tell your bootstrapper to make an HTTPS request for that file, which looks boring to any introspection because outbound requests to GitHub are normal, and to use the resulting IP to request the payload.<p>Your compromised payload host gets shut down? Spin up a new one, and update the file on GitHub with the new IP.')
