If an issue is widespread, there&#x27;s also a recall program.<p>But there are no issues of the kind &quot;machines keep bricking themselves&quot; that can be a &quot;broad trend&quot; in general (as in &quot;it&#x27;s not a production run issue that affected a number of units, Apple just keeps churning machines that brick themselves across production runs&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s just isolated incidents magnified by the media (where also Apple complains sell more than complains about some Dell or Asus machine, that might or might not sell 100K-200K units).<p>Case in point, you say: &quot;I&#x27;ve been using MacBooks of various models for close to 10 years and have never experienced even so much as a hardware hiccup. The machines were perfect for lack of a better word&quot;.<p>And yet, if you read the press those 10 years, people&#x2F;media complained for all kinds of issues for those machines too - and indeed some people had them. But they were a small minority of the 50-100 million people who got Macs in those 10 years.')
