I do judge technologies for most use cases (not niche) by how easy it is to shoot yourself in the foot - the easier it is the less I rate the technology for broad usage.<p>The article assumes simple schemas as well - a parent with many child relationships in this article could lead to some complex resolvers. Unless I misunderstand the article many of the strategies here are in ORMs (e.g. lazy subselects) which often don&#x27;t perform as well as a crafted query given the still multiple roundtrip&#x27;s to the db. They also require more code, and exhibit branching which means that performance is a function of the users query. If you know your user that&#x27;s fine, but then again I don&#x27;t see the advantage vs a straight REST or RPC call which would result in simpler code anyhow. It seems to work IMO in cases I guess when service isn&#x27;t critical, your model&#x2F;schema is simple, or you prefer flexibility of data access over reliability&#x2F;predictability.')
