I got fed-up with consumer-grade wifi gear when my old TP-Link AP+Router combi crapped out after ~20 wifi clients connected. Initially I kept the router but disabled its wi-fi AP and started using Ubiquiti APs - just one to begin with, but it handled 50+ simultaneous wi-fi clients like a champ - 6 years later I now have a UDM, PoE switch, LTE failover, three APs, and I&#x27;m considering moving-away from Google Nest to Ubiquiti for home-automation now too, because Google&#x2F;Nest&#x27;s video service makes no sense considering they don&#x27;t let you access the video locally or save the video locally (what&#x27;s the point of a video surveillance system that can be defeated simply by snipping the Internet coax connection outside?!?).')
