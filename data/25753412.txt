Bernie Sanders and other members of the progressive caucus immediately condemned the lone wolf attack in very clear terms. The reaction of the president to the Wednesday attack was far different and will likely encourage future acts of violence.<p>Twitter didn&#x27;t ban Bernie Sanders because he 1) never encouraged the attack and 2) responded appropriately. Twitter banned Trump because he played a part in encouraging the attack and then didn&#x27;t genuinely condemn the attacks. That&#x27;s why these two scenarios are very different.')
