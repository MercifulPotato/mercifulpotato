Spinning up a one or dozen user VPN on a data-center IP where they definitely keep logs gives you none of that.  Any complaint will immediately be forwarded or linked to your credit card.  To see this in action go make one and then bittorrent some hollywood movies.  You will get the scare letter emails forwarded to you within a month.<p>Want to get a data center account that takes crypto only?  They are often shady, bad, unreliable and expensive, probably run by another gang that have their own issues.')
