How is taxing the people working from home going to create a full economic life the people who aren&#x27;t? Seems like we would be dragging more middle-class people down than actually elevating the poor (the rich make most of their money through capital,  so this won&#x27;t have a big impact on most of them). You would have to restructure how we treat labor and capital in the ownership and compensation models in society if we want to actually address inequality. These short-sighted taxation ideas are only addressing symptoms, not the root problems. It will only get worse.<p>&quot;The report says the tax should only apply outside times when the government advises people to work from home&quot;<p>They only want this to apply when not under the current conditions of today. Sounds like they are using today&#x27;s data and problems to propose a &quot;solution&quot; that won&#x27;t actually be in effect when needed most. To me this sounds like they didn&#x27;t have data to support this tax under the prior conditions, but now they have the right data to cherry-pick.')
