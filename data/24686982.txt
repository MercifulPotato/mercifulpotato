One of the main rule when using git (or any other VCS I guess) is that each commit should be atomic.<p>IMO squashing commits is something that you should do locally, not remotely. For example I&#x27;m currently debugging a fairly large C application on an embedded system. Each bug has it&#x27;s own branch. When debugging &#x2F; testing &#x2F; trying to fix it I tend to do a lot of commits. When the bug is fixed I do an interactive rebase to pick &#x2F; drop &#x2F; squash commits in order to have only a clean one at the end (and then push it).')
