Item(by='powersnail', descendants=None, kids=[25420470], score=None, time=1607966787, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419977, text='&gt; the general idea that a life spent alone, consuming pornography all day is unfulfilling should not be controversial<p>1). I don&#x27;t see why that&#x27;s not controversial. It doesn&#x27;t seem self-evident. If a person can fulfill the need by watching porn, then by definition, it is fulfilled. If a person finds it unfulfilling, well, such a person will be motivated to branch out and start doing something else.<p>2). OP claimed that regardless of whether you watch it all day for a few times a week, porn hinders you down from pursuing females. I&#x27;d argue that the latter doesn&#x27;t.<p>3). Not forming a family doesn&#x27;t mean a life spent alone. The only people I know who&#x27;s determined to not ever get married, has a very active sex life and parties all the time. The idea that one can&#x27;t be happy without a family is fairly outdated.<p>4). Addiction is a real thing, but one has to recognize that there is a wide gap between pathologically addicted to porn, and just enjoying watching porn.')
