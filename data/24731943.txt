This is still an abberation: most EU countries generally have immigration systems that favor well-trained economic migrants, and the flow of migrants from the Middle East to Europe will regress to the mean (if it hasn&#x27;t already). Japan used to explicitly refuse work visas without a college degree, and has generally been very difficult to immimigrate to, but has softened on this because they&#x27;ve ran out of workers. Canada and Australia are similar to the EU in that they favor educated migrants on work visas, though their points system also explicitly favors English and French speaking migrants that can pass strict language tests.<p>The US is also an abberation: our immigration system favors family reunification (&quot;chain migration&quot;) from a diverse pool of emigrant countries over economic migration. Most other countries heavily restrict immigration on the basis of family reunification. Diversity of origins is enforced through both per-country quotas as well as literally handing out green cards to people from countries that don&#x27;t send us lots of migrants (&quot;the visa lottery&quot;). However, the primary effect of this is to make it very difficult for Mexicans to immigrate. I don&#x27;t have detailed enough statistics to know if most Middle East emigrants immigrate to the US on work visas or through family sponsorship, but I would suspect that all of the above factors are a wash, as most of our immigrants come from Europe or the Americas.')
