I don’t want them promoting falsehoods.  And most falsehoods only survive be being more interesting, more salacious, more engaging than the truth - so unless the system has some bias against them, it will prefer them.<p>If there’s a magical solution to not promoting falsehoods without deciding what’s false - there’s probably a lot of money waiting for you.')
