Are all other countries doomed to failure because they don&#x27;t have the Green New Deal?<p>GND is not the only way to address it, but it definitely seems like the most politically palatable option right now inside the US.  In terms of options that will have an actual impact and are also legislatively achievable, GND seems to be it.  It also doesn&#x27;t really &quot;address&quot; it so much as slow it.<p>Other countries HAVE already passed legislation and have taken substantive action, so they would not need to pass a GND.  Though the ones that haven&#x27;t passed anything would need to figure out what they can do that is palatable, yes. The US hasn&#x27;t, and lately has been rolling back rules and regulations such that we&#x27;re moving in the opposite direction.')
