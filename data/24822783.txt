What were you doing when the error occurred? How can I reproduce the error?<p>These sorts of one-sentence questions with no context are the worst, because when you come across them and decide to help out they force you to fully engage with someone who pretty much just wants to be given a fish rather than be taught how to catch them. I&#x27;ve even participated in communities where the expectation seems to be &quot;give me the code I need to solve my problem. now.&quot;, and I&#x27;ll be honest after awhile of experiencing this I got burnt out and now just reach for RTFM responses and get back to what I was doing when I encounter (what I perceive to be) low-effort questions.<p>I guess my point is that, if we want to tell people who give their time for free how to properly answer questions such that the feelings of the asker are respected, we need to have some discussion of what to do when that&#x27;s evidently not the case. When I read this article, I find myself wondering why I should have these sorts of expectations unconditionally placed on me by someone who is asking me to make time for them. I feel like a discussion about respectful knowledge exchange aught to encompass both parts, lest either side come off as entitled to a free lunch.')
