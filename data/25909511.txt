He does not act in good faith, he works backwards from a conclusion. If Steven Miller made a similar video about immigration I wouldn&#x27;t trust it either without an in-depth review of the sources he relied on. I do not mean for this to be some ad hominen policy, I am not saying Adams and Miller are by default wrong because of who they are, but they don&#x27;t deserve anyone&#x27;s trust.<p>If I have missed some nuance because I couldn&#x27;t watch the Adams video for myself then you have my apologies for this misunderstanding.')
