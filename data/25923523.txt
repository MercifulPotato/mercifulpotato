Ultimately I decided I wanted a split keyboard, but didn&#x27;t want to learn a new ortho layout or spend $300. I ended up buying a Kinesis Freestyle 2, which is one of the few &quot;normal&quot; split keyboards. I liked it so much I bought a second one with the Mac Meta keys, so I still ended up spending $300 anyways, but got two keyboards. What I didn&#x27;t do was spend an extra $50 on the tilt kit; a few chair leg pads as spacers was enough for me.<p>I have wide shoulders, bringing my heads together to type all day makes my chest tight and my back hunch. Getting a split keyboard has been my best ergo improvement since a decent chair.')
