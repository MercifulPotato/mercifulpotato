The courts and legislature in CA went out on a limb to force Uber and others to do the right thing, and prop 22 erased all their work.<p>If you don&#x27;t live in California, you may not know - they added a $1.50 fee to every order, in addition to all the existing service fees and delivery fees, which often add up to 20-30% of the order. (Also by the way, uber and grubhub already artificially raise the prices of items on the menu and keep the difference, and restaurants can&#x27;t do anything to stop it). They can blame it all on Prop 22 even though they spent millions to pass it.<p>Now obviously people are paying all these fees, so it appears that drivers are being paid a lot, so no need to tip. But most drivers don&#x27;t even qualify for the money! We are paying money on orders that probably won&#x27;t even go to our own driver.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve decided to stop using these food delivery apps. I can&#x27;t stop using Uber, but I can pick up my own food. It is depressing that so many delivery drivers didn&#x27;t understand what they were voting for and did nothing to stop this')
