Either because you could have paid off a loan sooner, or bought a T bill, or whatever.  If the bet takes a year then at the end of that year you could either have (principle + opportunity) cost if you don’t make the bet, (principle + winnings) if you make the bet and win, or nothing if you lost.  Therefore the cost of making the bet in 2010 that paid out in 2020 isn’t the money you put upfront, but the money you could have had in 2020 without making the bet.<p>However, the winnings are calculated based on your initial payment not the payment + opportunity cost.  So let’s look at a bet that pays 1$ after fees and costs you 1$ worth of opportunity costs.  In such a bet the fees reduce your winnings to zero because you could have the same amount of money without the risk of the bet.')
