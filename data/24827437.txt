It’s a pretty standard curbside system: you book a slot online and go pick it up at that slot. Only thing that has changed is that you now only need 3 lb minimum of meat instead of the previous 5 lb. It’s also even more eye-wateringly expensive (but of course I happily pay it anyway, because it’s Franklin’s).')
