The fact that he moved from the CIA back to an NSA supported role without this being disclosed is ridiculous in of itself.<p>Edward had a childish reaction to release documents that had nothing to do with Xkeyscore (of which the media claim as the reason for his release), particularly those of Tailored Access Operations [TAO]. This was the action of a petulant individual lashing out at the system however he felt he could. Don&#x27;t let it be ignored that he was specifically working in a capacity supporting operations in China.. then fled there before moving on to Russia. No one talks about or acknowledges that Edward was in a support role and not an &quot;Operator&quot; at the agency either. He was pissed because he applied twice and was denied, in part due to his horrible support on operation plans.<p>He wanted to act out and damage the NSA and their mission.<p>The hero worship of Snowden is deplorable. I only wish the american public had a real understanding and grasp of what goes on to keep their &quot;bubble&quot; safe and sound. Edwards actions have had an outsized impact and unfortunately it won&#x27;t be mad public in a nonclassified space for many years to come, because of further operational impacts.<p>He was 100% a traitor.')
