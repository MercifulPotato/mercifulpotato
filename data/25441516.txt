However the bug here is even all camera is disabled (either via a daemon, turning them off individually, or shooting them down, or even in area with no cameras, e.g. Nash part in Ghost Town quest) they can Overheat you from behind a solid wall or even in a different room.<p>My guess is this is similar to enemy sniper sometimes can see you through walls. If they&#x27;re close enough to a wall, then their line of sight is calculated as if they were in front of a wall.')
