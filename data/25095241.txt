Architecture still matters.<p>The same architecture on a smaller process will use less power and use less silicon (usually making it cheaper: but yields make that equation complicated). A 100mm^2 design using 50W will only be 50mm^2 using only 25W on a smaller node.<p>Since 300mm wafers are always 70,000 mm^2 in area, you now produce twice as many designs in 50mm^2 instead of 100mm^2.<p>-------<p>Now what made Intel get stuck on 14nm+++ is that Intel got really good at increasing 14nm++++&#x27;s clock rate. Dennard scaling is dead: a larger process may offer better GHz these days.<p>But if you can solve the yield issues, the march towards tinier and tinier transistors is a winner. Less power used, less chip-area used, and therefore cheaper and more-efficient chips.')
