And it’s estimated the new variant is 70% more transmissible.<p>&gt;You are wrong on principle because you stopped thinking after you calculated the death rate after week eight. The virus doesn&#x27;t stop spreading in either of the hypothetical cases and the population is a finite number. Keep calculating!<p>This only applies if the plan was to let literally everyone get infected. That wasn’t the plan. We have vaccines now. It should be possible to end things by the end of summer, so excess deaths now are needless deaths.<p>Also you’re ignoring speed. 200,000 hospitalizations in a week is much much worse than 200,000 in a year. Get too many people needing to be hospitalized at once and the death rate goes up because you can’t treat them as well. You also get more deaths from other conditions as hospitals can no longer serve cancer patients, heart attack victims past a certain point etc.')
