Built like a tank (seriously, you could bludgeon someone to death with it) and the smoothest, most pleasurable keyswitch out of the dozens I&#x27;ve tried. The F keyswitch makes all cherry clones feel like cheap Chinese crap, sadly this is why I had to part with my ergodox. The only downsides are the loud typing and the nonstandard layout, which you might prefer once you get used to it (ctrl key to the left of a).<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a serious keyboard to last you the rest of your life, I highly recommend the F.')
