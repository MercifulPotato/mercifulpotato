Do you think it&#x27;s really all about taxes? It&#x27;s not.<p>From your initial post, I just thought it was about over-development. I didn&#x27;t expect to be about demographics and ethnicity, specifically maintaining your idea of CA&#x27;s racial &quot;purity&quot;. Consequently, I was very confused when you asked me to leave CA.<p>&gt; The prevailing rhetoric of California being &quot;bad&quot; is mostly political and has racist anti-liberal roots. By shutting down counter views you&#x27;re allowing those racist viewpoints to prosper<p>Let me get this straight, by calling you out on your racist viewpoints, I am allowing racist viewpoints to fester? That totally makes sense.<p>Who cares if other racist viewpoints have white, conservative roots? Racism is bad, period, regardless of its origins, the ideology of the people holding those ideas, and whether or not it&#x27;s systemic. As shown by your own comments, conservatives do not have a monopoly on racism either.<p>&gt; And by the way, none of your rhetoric counters what is historical fact.<p>That&#x27;s great counter-argument with no details or facts, other than the slivers you&#x27;ve previously provided that I&#x27;ve quickly shut down. I guess your newest comment isn&#x27;t rhetoric either?<p>&gt; The plurality of California are not Hispanic by pure accident.<p>Yes, CA promotes diversity, yet you lament not having a more homogeneous population. The only difference between your views and &quot;America First&quot; proponents&#x27; view is the ethnicity being supported.<p>&gt; Lastly, it should be possible to have a rational discussion about demographics on this site without people over reacting and name calling.<p>Forgive me for pointing out thinly veiled racist comments on HN. It&#x27;s a natural conclusion to assume that racists comments are made by a racist. I am not over reacting. I initially assumed good faith and gave you the benefit of the doubt for too long. You&#x27;re just downplaying your BS<p>Let&#x27;s revisit your BS before you delete it:<p>&quot;_You_ go to Idaho and Wyoming.<p>California is our state.&quot;<p>So apparently according to your view point, California is only for &quot;Californios&quot;, Hispanics who originated from Mexico?<p>&quot;My qualms are more with the demographic changes these massive migrations brought.<p>Just very greedy overly ambitious and pretentious people.<p>To me they make terrible neighbors and have zero regard for the land, nature or the people here.<p>Some I assume are good people but I haven&#x27;t met any.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t even have to comment on this one. It speaks for itself, especially the last line.')
