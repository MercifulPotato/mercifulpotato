If you had a magical oracle that was able to solve any one specific NP-complete problem in O(1) time, you could turn that into a O(n^k) solution for all NP-complete problems.<p>That&#x27;s the idea behind DNA-computing, for instance.<p>The question is whether it is actually possible to do so at a reasonable cost and at scale.<p>Regardless, what &quot;nature&quot; does has 0 to do with P vs NP, computability or anything else. P vs NP is a statement strictly about mathematical objects, there is no notion of &quot;nature&quot; anywhere in it.')
