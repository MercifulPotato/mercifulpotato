I don&#x27;t want to try and guess which app has broken their copy&#x2F;paste or back button and have 20 different slightly broken UI&#x27;s and experiences.<p>The advantage of the web is a consistent U.I. interface, with all the basics working (copy&#x2F;paste, back button). This means there&#x27;s a much higher chance of those working for the user, I don&#x27;t see how you can say that&#x27;s bad.<p>Even ignoring that, which do you think would be better, a platform that they put 3* the amount of time into or 3 separate platforms (if the devs are forced to build the same thing 3 times)?<p>There are many user benefits.')
