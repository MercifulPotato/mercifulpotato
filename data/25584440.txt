I floated this idea before:<p>Why as people do we not just add an extra day to the week between Saturday and Sunday?<p>Who cares about official calendar?<p>Make all months 4 days longer.<p>All work weeks still 5 days.<p>All monthly : 30 day contracts stay the same.<p>People who need cash or work hard can use the extra day to get ahead.<p>3 day weekend society - I would vote for it.')
