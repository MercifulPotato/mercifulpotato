There have been a couple of times where I received something that had to be printed, signed, and scanned back in... my printer, which I don&#x27;t use much (and thus didn&#x27;t bother setting up in CUPS when I installed my current distro) was not working with CUPS at all. I really didn&#x27;t want to troubleshoot it at the time so I booted a Windows machine and installed the drivers.. got it taken care of. Sometime later the same kind of situation cropped up but I didn&#x27;t have ready access to a Windows system.. I ended up printing the document from my iPhone (using AirPrint, didn&#x27;t have to configure anything), signing it, and then using a document &quot;scanner&quot; app to scan it and email it back. I&#x27;ve since gotten CUPS to behave in that it can print, but scanning has never worked out for me there.<p>This however is not to be taken as an endorsement of Windows&#x27;s printing prowess. Without going through the hassle of getting the specific drivers from the manufacturer Windows 10 will give you the impression that everything is stellar.. finds the printer, makes it available to print to.. and even prints!... with colors inverted. A text document with black font printed a black document with white text... just light my toner on fire why don&#x27;t you?')
