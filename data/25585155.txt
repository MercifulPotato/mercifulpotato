Item(by='Shared404', descendants=None, kids=[25585375, 25585495], score=None, time=1609357184, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25584940, text='&gt;  &#x27;the DMV&#x27; seems an even popular day out!(?)<p>Definitely not.<p>It&#x27;s often said along the same lines of &quot;I need to go to the mechanic&quot;, where it&#x27;s something that you need to do, but is miserable.<p>The DVLA does appear to fill the same role, but more efficiently. Many of the things it appears you can do online require you to go in in person (Well, pre-covid at least. I don&#x27;t know about now.), even better, the DMV got caught selling data about people who had to use it.<p>For a comparison, last time I got a license change I waited in line 10. freaking. hours. On a Saturday.')
