The immune system is incredibly dangerous and destructive, and you really don&#x27;t want to trigger it without reason. So injecting something unknown might not be enough to get the immune system fully alarmed, that&#x27;s why some vaccines add adjuvants to produce a stronger response. RNA can be an adjuvant by itself, as it&#x27;s also a typical component of viruses and the immune system reacts to that.<p>So the trick really is to design the RNA and the delivery system so that it produces an immune response of the right magnitude. Too weak and it doesn&#x27;t work, too strong and it&#x27;s harmful.<p>Antibodies that bind to your own proteins are filtered in an earlier stage in antibody production. Real viral proteins are also produced by your own cells, so that is never a factor by which you could distinguish friend from foe.')
