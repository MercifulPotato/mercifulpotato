I know from like a dozen years of consulting experience, and from 10 years of vuln research prior to that, that putting a different set of eyes on a target tends to get you a different set of bugs. Finding vulnerabilities is as much an art as a science, which makes sense when you think about what hunting for software vulnerabilities actually entails. If you could do it deterministically, you&#x27;d be saying something big about computer science.<p>I think we&#x27;re on firmer ground saying that there are <i>ways of delivering software</i> that foreclose on &quot;obvious bugs&quot;. But when we talk about fundamentally changing the way we deliver software --- in secure-by-default development environments, on secure-by-default deployment platforms, with security as a primary functional goal prioritized over time-to-market --- we&#x27;re actually into real money now, not just another $250k on pentesters.')
