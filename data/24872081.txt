Item(by='lastofthemojito', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603475849, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24871982, text='I think I visited Wisconsin once on a day trip when I had some family in neighboring Illinois back in the 90&#x27;s.  I definitely don&#x27;t know a ton about the state.  Again, I certainly don&#x27;t know which way Wisconsin will end up voting.<p>But I guess my point here is that it seems like the NYT feature was based on an honest analysis of data from something called IPUMS, which Wikipedia tells me is &quot;the world&#x27;s largest individual-level population database&quot;, not a just &quot;schmuck reporter&quot; with a baseless hunch or something.<p>It&#x27;ll be interesting to revisit pieces like this on November 3 (or whenever all the votes are tallied) to see if any of them turned out to be good predictors or not.')
