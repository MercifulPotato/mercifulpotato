The same is true now if you consider the other ways you can spend your capital.<p>a -1% rate on a mortgage with 20% down payment is effetely a 4% annual return on investment.<p>If you can make 10%&#x2F;yr in the stock market. and your mortgage is 3%&#x2F;yr you should be maxing out the loan already and putting your cash back into stocks to make the 7% difference, not another house, if mortgages are 0%, you are making 10%, If mortgages are -1% you are making 11%, ect<p>The downsides to this strategy in a negative interest rate scenario are the same as they are today: If all your capital is locked up in down payments, you are missing out on stock gains entirely. If all your capital is in the market, you are vulnerable to bubbles and swings there.')
