I&#x27;m specifically against subordinate relations like master-slave. In a typical firm there is a boss that commands managers, workers etc. The boss has the most power. But he is still accountable to an agreement between him and workers. He can&#x27;t do &quot;whatever he wants&quot;.<p>In a very centralized government systems you can&#x27;t make top management accountable. Moreover, in such systems top management actually support master-slave relations between people, like between men-women, rich-poor, etc. It&#x27;s then easier to hold power.')
