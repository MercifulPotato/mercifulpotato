These distros seem to have provided a good, current, stable out-of-the box experience (Out-of-the-Box + RPM Fusion and Packman for the former two.)<p>I just don&#x27;t enjoy constantly fixing issues on my personal systems, in fact, after work I just want my computer to work. I get some people enjoy tinkering, I simply want my device to work AND provide me the freedom to do what I want if I feel adventurous. I don&#x27;t distro-hop, and I don&#x27;t like rebuilding my OS if I can help it. I&#x27;ll spend a week getting everything the way I like it and expect it to last me at least a couple of years. I use Linux for everything: gaming, writing software, web browsing, you name it.<p>For as long as I have looked into it, GNU&#x2F;Linux phones are an absolute nightmare for someone like me. I remember reading an article full of workarounds to get a dialer app to work on some project phone. I just want a phone that works, and could allow me to access root, setup my dot files, and tinker to the degree I&#x27;d like. As of now, my only solution has been LineageOS (Android fork) which has a proper terminal emulator with root access by default. As nice as this is, I&#x27;d love to support a GNU&#x2F;Linux Android-alternative, as it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess how long LineageOS or other forks will be compatible to the degree they have been in the past.')
