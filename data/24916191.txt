Which is what they are doing here, and you are labeling “absolutely preposterous”.<p>Maybe not the best usage of the word scraping.<p>CA had access to the data without having to scrape the front end.<p>For this extension, it is by consent of the user<p>For scraping, I agree. Facebook should try their best to stop people accessing personal data of people they don&#x27;t know. They do make reasonable attempts, it&#x27;s less than trivial to set up fake accounts on scale but not impossible. Their &quot;bulk uploads&quot; feature is designed in such a way that it doesn&#x27;t link email addresses to profiles (or at least as easily), unlike LinkedIn and Twitter.  Saying that, it&#x27;s up to the user to set their privacy settings but I would much prefer the defaults (if they still aren&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t use FB) were automatically set to non-public. I&#x27;ve seen an implementation that used headless browsers and thousands of FB accounts to scrape millions of profiles.')
