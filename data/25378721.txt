Maybe take a look at what are common traits for customers in each plan and see if you can come up with a one word persona for each plan that way.<p>The product tours after signup are really clear and crisp well done. I&#x27;ve found that getting users to Wow fast is key to drive conversions, and that tours aren&#x27;t enough. They show me how to get to wow but don&#x27;t bring me there.<p>A common pattern is to prepopulate the app with some data and lead the user to a likely wow event quickly. That&#x27;s super hard, because you need to know what wow is, but it&#x27;s gold when you crack it.<p>I&#x27;ve asked customers &quot;What made you decide to give us money&quot; and that can get some good insights towards what wow is.<p>I just visited the site for the second time, and my dashboard is empty because I haven&#x27;t done anything. A real user will likely churn, because they don&#x27;t know what to do. Nudge them hard towards the action that will bring them to wow.<p>I&#x27;m parroting patio11, but your pro plan is priced to low. Try raising prices on it (a lot) and see if anyone goes for it. \nAnecdote: I set a pricing page to have $50, $180 and $1200. $50 sold the most, but one day someone self served themselves an annual $1200&#x2F;month plan, which is 24 $50 customers. Point being, if someone wants to give you a lot of money, give them the chance to do so.<p>Last point, I just noticed the video under the the pricing section. My personal opinion is that it&#x27;s weak for marketing purposes, it tells me how to use the app, but doesn&#x27;t immediately show me what the app can do for me. The point of a video on a marketing page is to get me excited to try and then convert. Make me feel excited ... \nOn the other hand, it is a very good tutorial video, maybe put it on the dashboard of the app if the user hasn&#x27;t uploaded any tracks yet.<p>Good luck!')
