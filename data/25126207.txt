Horrid Door Dash drivers wore my generosity thin real fast, but with Ubereats it can actually be performance based as it should be. It reflects in how unprofessional and entitled some Door Dash employees are. I wrote simple steps for getting tto my door and they&#x27;d tend to not read it, with one even saying something like &quot;wah wah I&#x27;m not reading this huge paragraph&quot; (it was maybe 15 words total). I should&#x27;ve been able to leave a negative tip for that one.
