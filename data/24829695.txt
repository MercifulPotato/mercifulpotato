Fine, that might be true; it might not; further experiments could probably get more conclusive about it, but you&#x27;d need a much wider number of people and a wider array of different situations and contexts to ensure it&#x27;s a fair study.<p>The problem is the the interpretation of the data out the other end. &quot;Suggestive evidence&quot; that this is driven by &quot;stereotype threat&quot;; this belies an implicit assumption that there&#x27;s no reasonable biological explanation for this situation. This assertion is borne out by no actual evidence; but this paper itself becomes yet another piece of &quot;evidence&quot; supporting the idea, because it can and will be cited as such despite not proving it at all. Slowly, a mountain of these papers develops, and consensus builds, but there&#x27;s no there there.<p>There&#x27;s no attempt here (or really anywhere, anymore) to find an evolutionary-psychological reason for why this observed behaviour occurs.')
