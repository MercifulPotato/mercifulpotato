It might be even good thing if it ensures stability of the developer. If it turns out the original developer with dual licence&#x2F;CLA is no longer good, community can continue from the AGPL version on its own and if the original developer wants to incorporate these new community changes, the AGPL will &quot;infect&quot; the dual licensed version.')
