In that context, all three are equivalent. (Carbonite has clunky FileManager-like GUI for handling backups.) Make sense now?<p>I actually use Google Drive for files I share with people who don&#x27;t have MS Office, then I use Duply+PGP-&gt;Duplicity to AWS S3 backups of all documents on my Mac that aren&#x27;t on GitHub (and don&#x27;t have GB of object or docker files), and lastly I do monthly TimeMachine for the entire DISK (because TimeMachine is effing amazing, I won&#x27;t go into to much detail, but it is brilliant when moving to a new machine).<p>When it comes to backups, I am reluctant to spin up rclone&#x2F;borg when a single alias that calls Duply+PGP to S3 on my 1GBit upstream fiber has worked fine for almost 10 years. Just telling me I should switch to something without a making an effort to explain WHY is basically asking me to spend hours studying and trying something that might fuck up my established protocol for what ROI?
