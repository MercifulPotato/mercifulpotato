Negative frequencies do not exist!</i><p>I agree that that&#x27;s a place where the explanation goes wrong, but negative frequencies do exist, they cancel out the imaginary part of the positive frequency. A real-valued signal has equal amplitude at <i>f</i> and <i>-f</i>, if you&#x27;re talking about Fourier transforms. Admittedly, Fourier transforms depart slightly from the more elementary definition of frequency as one divided by the period, but that&#x27;s a linguistic snag, not a conceptual one.')
