Cop car was behind us in traffic, pulls us over, and two cops get out guns drawn instructing everyone to get face down on the pavement.<p>Turns out they thought they saw a knife&#x2F;gun when my friend had held us wallet up in the light, and they figured we were brandishing a weapon at them. We all got searched and when they found half of us <i>Boy Scouts</i> were carrying pocket knives things got really stupid really fast. We had to beg them to be rational with us, nose down on the pavement. Seriously I think the only thing that saved us was two of us had our Eagle cards...<p>This is anecdotal in rural small-town Iowa... but having lived this sorta stuff first-hand you realize that it&#x27;s not uncommon to have been harassed at gunpoint by the police.')
