Zoom isn&#x27;t open source software, and has never claimed to be.<p>I don&#x27;t use Zoom and wasn&#x27;t familiar with the company before I looked at their whitepaper. It&#x27;s not fake-surprised at all.<p>&gt; The title is also pure clickbait, since the article itself comes to the conclusion that the design is secure and the oddities are likely due to the need for legacy support.<p>...Yes, but they&#x27;re still oddities, right?<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call a title clickbait when it&#x27;s completely accurate.<p>If I found security issues, I would&#x27;ve titled it &quot;Vulnerabilities in Zoom&#x27;s End-to-End Encryption White Paper&quot;, if I even blogged about it at all.')
