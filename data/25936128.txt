Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611792694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25931499, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t think the fact that I can&#x27;t give you an off-the-cuff but brilliant strategic plan in this Hacker News comment describing how Elon Musk could best structure his charitable foundation is a real indictment of my assertion that such a plan could be put together.<p>Mostly I just want to counter the mistaken idea that redistributing the wealth of billionaires would result in improvements for the poor. It wouldn’t, because that wealth is already in a form that can’t be easily translated into the things that poor people lack.<p>&gt; As I mentioned in a previous comment to somebody else, I recognize that &quot;giving away&quot; incredible amounts of money is easier said than done -- but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not possible.<p>Its possible to give it away. I’m asking how to improve people’s live thereby. The wealth is in the form of companies that are already providing goods and services to people. There’s not enough profit to make meaningful direct cash payments to the poor. If you liquidate the companies assets you’ve expropriated Bezos’ wealth and sold it to people....then you do what with the money? We already know transfer payments are only temporary.<p>&gt; Again, as I mentioned in that comment, MacKenzie Scott (Jeff Bezos&#x27;s ex-wife) appears to be doing a startlingly good job of it. So is Bill Gates, as you mentioned. There are others.<p>Its not easy: [0]<p>&gt;&gt; Both insiders and external critics have suggested that there is too much deference to Bill Gates&#x27;s personal views within the Gates Foundation, insufficient internal debate, and pervasive &quot;group think.&quot;[101][159] Critics also complain that Gates Foundation grants are often awarded based on social connections and ideological allegiances rather than based on formal external review processes or technical competence.<p>&gt; There are all sorts of conversations to be had about extreme wealth, but it really does strike me as at least reasonable for part of that conversation to be around changing the culture of expectation for billionaires.<p>Its reasonable for people who think they can better allocate resources to explain how their proposed allocation is, in fact, better. The billionaire has already proven he can put his wealth to productive use. I’m merely expecting you to suggest how you could meet that same standard.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation#Reception_and_reforms" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundat...</a>')
