Item(by='ColanR', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604780008, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25018290, text='&gt; if someone wants to live in isolation, then they probably don&#x27;t care and aren&#x27;t affected very much by society&#x27;s policies<p>Or they care too much, or society has driven them away, or they just don&#x27;t like the population density, or it&#x27;s cheaper, or they like the countryside better.  See: the increasing number of people moving to the country and the popularity of Musk&#x27;s Starlink project, indicating that remote people are invested in society.<p>I think that making the assumption that the people who live closer together have a better handle on how to run the country (society != country) needs a lot of justification. The large fraction of the population that lives less densely should not be disregarded as somehow &#x27;less valuable&#x27;.<p>As I referenced above, the last time we tried to weight the value of different people it didn&#x27;t turn out to be such a great idea. Skin color (the 3&#x2F;5ths compromise, if you didn&#x27;t get the reference) or geographic location, the value of a person or their vote shouldn&#x27;t be tampered with.')
