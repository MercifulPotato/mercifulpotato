There is a workaround in the meantime documented and a suggestion on how to address the feature request (that requires refactoring of the codebase) on the non-dupe ticket.<p>Since this is libre software anyone can improve the code along those lines and send a merge request or even commission a developer to do that refactoring; the DarkTable maintainers _didn&#x27;t_ refuse contributions nor marked it as wontfix however that doesn&#x27;t mean that the maintainers have development-time to spare in that macOS-specific code.<p>On the other hand if not using macOS hotkey convention is an example of it being &quot;unusable&quot; then I guess it is really great for something most people don&#x27;t pay a penny or contribute otherwise for.')
