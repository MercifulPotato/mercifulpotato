One of the first things I did was back up all my 5.25&quot; disks to 3.5&quot; and also copy them to the fancy hard drive I had in the new computer.<p>Going from having 2 5.25&quot; drives to having a hard drive and and 3.5&quot; drive was an explosion in storage space and it just didn&#x27;t make sense to keep using the 5.25&quot; disks, especially given their high failure rates.<p>Everyone I knew at the time did the same thing.  3.5&quot; was vastly superior in storage and reliability (as long as you knew how to fix the springs in the metal covers on the disks).')
