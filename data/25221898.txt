A synchronous blocking IO API is fine if you&#x27;re working with nanosecond latencies of RAM, or with storage that&#x27;s as painfully slow and serial as a mechanical hard drive.<p>Flash is special in that its latency is still considerably higher than that of DRAM, but its <i>throughput</i> can get reasonably close once you have more than a handful of SSDs in your system (or if you&#x27;re willing to compare against the DRAM bandwidth of a decade-old PC). Extracting the full throughput from a flash SSD despite the higher-than-DRAM latency is what requires more suitable APIs (if you&#x27;re doing random IO; sequential IO performance is easy).')
