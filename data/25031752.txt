At least I know it&#x27;s Microsoft who will be doing the backdoor...<p>My point isn&#x27;t about how much you trust Microsoft, but that Microsoft <i>has keys</i>, which are more easily stolen and in many regards more valuable than the scheme I gave.<p>&gt; TSA keys<p>Not remotely comparable. These were never designed to be secure in the sense we&#x27;re talking here.<p>&gt; OPM (all of it)<p>&gt; NSA&#x27;s hacking tools<p>Hence the scheme I gave, which isn&#x27;t vulnerable in the same way.')
