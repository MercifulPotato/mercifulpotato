Item(by='vaxman', descendants=None, kids=[25099923], score=None, time=1605433520, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25098912, text='&gt; If it was about securing US oil, war in Venezuela and Canada would be far more sensible.<p>Is there not a cold war between US and Venezuela right now (over nationalization of formerly American-owned oil production facilities there), somewhat of a proxy for China to attack us, raging since the second Bush administration? I mean, their nationals factually developed many of the US voting systems (because we&#x27;re stupid, not because they are stealth) and all we have is political rhetoric that those systems are &quot;the most secure in history&quot; and there is &quot;no evidence of hacking&quot;. I think most people here, at least, know that the first order of business for modern computer viruses once they penetrate a system is to get rid of the penetration evidence, neutralize system monitoring capacity and start unwrapping preloaded or downloaded payloads. This all feeds back into what America&#x27;s  government is going to do with respect to domestic oil production over the next four years and how that will affect the world&#x27;s dependency upon the Middle East and Russia. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gnews.org&#x2F;556010&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gnews.org&#x2F;556010&#x2F;</a> <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xinhuanet.com&#x2F;english&#x2F;2020-10&#x2F;26&#x2F;c_139467853.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xinhuanet.com&#x2F;english&#x2F;2020-10&#x2F;26&#x2F;c_139467853.htm</a><p>As far as Canada, it was far from a cold war, more like two gentlemen getting into an argument at the local country club, but a primary focus was oil (pipelines), no? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ustr.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;files&#x2F;Press&#x2F;fs&#x2F;USMCA&#x2F;USMCA-Energy.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ustr.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;files&#x2F;Press&#x2F;fs&#x2F;USMCA&#x2F;US...</a>')
