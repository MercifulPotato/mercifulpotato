Thats true of every particle or photon it traps. Of course they get twisted and distorted by the extreme gravitational forces, but in principle there is always structure. I suppose from the internal perspective, Hawking Radiation manifests as a rain of negative energy.<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m wildly off the mark, but it&#x27;s the best I can do.')
