Ubuntu is really opinionated about the UX and if you want to change or fix anything you have to get kind of hacky.  Sometimes when I woke my computer of from sleep it would ignore the keyboard and you had to use the mouse to click and slide the screen upward as if it were a tablet.  Multiple workspaces only worked on the main monitor, side monitors would only show Workspace 1.  There was a workaround for this, but it was a little bit buggy.  When I want to drag a window, exit a window, or minimize, I usually just slam my cursor into the top of the screen.  On Ubuntu there&#x27;s a thin black status bar at the top of the screen, so you have to aim your cursor carefully instead of gesturing your mouse upwards, and it was a huge pain to try to remove that.<p>I started a new job and my boss installed Linux Mint on my work laptop because that&#x27;s what he was using; after a month I installed Mint on my home desktop.  The defaults are sensible, there&#x27;s tons of customization options, and I don&#x27;t have to hack my way into really simple and obvious changes.')
