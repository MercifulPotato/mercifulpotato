This is simply not the case. JavaScript has taken the world by storm, as has Python. Ruby, PHP and others have taken the world by storm before and are slowly fading. Clojure has never taken the world by storm and (IMO) never will. Neither will Haskell btw.<p>To me, Clojure is very much on the same level as Haskell: an extremely niche programming language with a small (sub-1% in TIOBE) but dedicated following that is unlikely to grow much beyond what it already is.<p>Rest of the article: meh. It presupposes a lot of what it thinks Haskell should aspire to without investigating whether those things are <i>actually</i> what it is aspiring to be.')
