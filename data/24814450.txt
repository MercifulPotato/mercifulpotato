As there is no alternative hardware available nobody invests in alternative software runtime models. Which makes investing in alternative hardware models again unattractive as no current software could profit from it. Here we&#x27;re gone full circle.<p>It&#x27;s a trap. Especially given that improvements in sequential computing speed are already difficult to achieve and it&#x27;s known that this will become even more and more difficult in the future, but the computing model of C is inherently sequential and it&#x27;s quite problematic to make proper use of increasingly more parallel machines.<p>What we would need to overcome this would be a computer that is build again like the last time many years ago, as a unit of hard and software which is developed hand in hand with each other form the ground up. Maybe this way we could finally overcome the &quot;eternal PDP-7&quot; and move on to some more modern computer architectures (embracing parallelisms in the model from the ground up, for example).')
