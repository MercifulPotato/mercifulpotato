It overrides the default history page with a better ui for searching and filtering, plus I&#x27;ve included an analytics page that provides some neat information about your browsing habits such as top sites and a category breakdown of your history. My friend suggested open sourcing this project because nobody wants to give an extension access to their history for obvious reasons. The extension has no tracking, no database, no user accounts, etc so its totally private for a user. Just figured some people might be interested in having the analytic of how they spend their time on the web. Hope some people find this interesting!')
