(Yes, Ketone bodies are a thing, but that happens alongside your body mobilizing everything it can to feed the brain, not instead of.)&quot;<p>Layman here, but my understanding is that depriving the body  of the ability to replenish glycogen stores that are normally used for energy forces the body to metabolize fat in order to produce ketones, which in a ketogenic state, the brain is entirely fine utilizing as a primary energy source. Thus, if in a ketogenic state (or on a strict ketogenic diet), the body isn&#x27;t being starved, just consuming stored energy reserves.')
