And yet what we see is the opposite.<p>The EU demanded that individual nations buy collectively through the Commission. The Commission is run by diversity hires: half the commissioners had to be women, by demand of von der Leyen. They then moved way too slowly, didn&#x27;t approve vaccines quickly (and still haven&#x27;t), didn&#x27;t order enough and now EU countries are at the back of the queue as a result. The first German to be vaccinated with German technology received their jab in ... the UK. The collective buying operation has since collapsed, with Germany running to Russia to try and acquire some of the Sputnik vaccine.<p>The whole pathetic affair is documented here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spectator.co.uk&#x2F;article&#x2F;the-eu-has-botched-its-vaccination-programme" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spectator.co.uk&#x2F;article&#x2F;the-eu-has-botched-its-v...</a><p>When it comes to bureaucracies, size does not equal power. Size does not equal benefits. Size equals incompetence, lethargy and internal decay. The EU is run by people who failed upwards their entire careers. They insisted they be given power over vaccines even though the EU has no formal treaty-defined role in healthcare, and then they screwed it up on a massive scale.')
