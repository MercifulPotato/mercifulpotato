Item(by='valenterry', descendants=None, kids=[25441184], score=None, time=1608107483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25440257, text='&gt; What stops a frontend developer writing an ad-hoc query?<p>What stops them is that the &quot;ad-hoc&quot; query can only look like this:<p><pre><code>    articlesWithComments($id) {\n      title\n      contents\n      comment {\n        author\n        text\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s all. Now the only way to change this query is to remove fields but there is no way to make anything more complex. The only way to do more is to repeat the query. I.e. literally:<p><pre><code>    article1: articlesWithComment(1) {\n      title\n      contents\n      comment {\n        author\n        text\n      }\n    }\n    article2: articlesWithComment(2) {\n      title\n      contents\n      comment {\n        author\n        text\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThat will create two queries in the backend - that is the equivalent of just making two requests against the same REST route.<p>It _is_ possible to allow a user to change the query like this:<p><pre><code>    articlesWithComments($id) {\n      title\n      contents\n      comment {\n        author {\n          name,\n          age,\n          articles {\n            ...\n          }\n        }\n        text\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nBut that is totally optional - you don&#x27;t have to give your users this power.')
