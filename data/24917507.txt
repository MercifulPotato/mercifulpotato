I really don&#x27;t want to work with people that don&#x27;t want to accept me for who I am; which is a person that will deliver <i>extremely</i> good work, for fair, respectful treatment. I&#x27;m an outstanding team member (you don&#x27;t last long at a Japanese corporation, unless you do &quot;team&quot; well). I&#x27;m optimistic, energetic, and affable.<p>I&#x27;ve found people who want to work with me, working towards laudable goals, and I do work that I love. I won&#x27;t starve to death, and there&#x27;s the very real possibility that what I&#x27;m doing will end well. I&#x27;m pretty good at what I do, and what I do, is make stuff that works.<p>It gives me the luxury of saying &quot;Guv! Why&#x27;s that chap in the crown starkers?&quot;.<p>Whenever there&#x27;s a back-and-forth about LeetCode tests, it eventually gets down to &quot;Well, I was hazed, so you get hazed, too.&quot;<p>That sounds like a sensible baseline for selecting engineering staff.')
