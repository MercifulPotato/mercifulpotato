Sadly what this does is it attracts only the most junior or unqualified hires who (are great if you got time&#x2F;budget but if not) will need to be trained by the few seniors left holding the place together.<p>I&#x27;m not surprised Intel does this and the telecommunications side I have seen from them in Europe was rotten to the core. I have several anecdotes here just one: A friend got poached from Intel in a cushy job with great pay in a key role a lot of niche knowledge, they had to know how valuable he was, after the first week on the new job with Intel he got told that the department decided to reduce the headcount due to a restructuring and so he was the first to go.<p>If it sounds like &quot;business as usual&quot; let me add nobody else was fired, he had a 3 month long negotiation, 6 months notice period on the old job, 3 kids, and in his late 40ies in a specific market. What he was promised would have justified taking the risk. Later I heard they do this all the time from a guy who recruits for Intel. Also this was not in the enterprise market with lot of talent but telecommunications O&amp;M (operations and maintenance plane). He eventually went to go beg to get his job back. He&#x27;ll never have the same standing in the company tho.')
