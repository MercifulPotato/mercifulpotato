The macro-scale versions (overpasses above large freeways) are often less popular, at least in North America, due to cost and political concerns about encouraging dangerous or destructive species: wolves piss ranchers off and apex predators scare people--despite the the fact that the material risk&#x2F;damage caused by such predators is statistically and financially miniscule.<p>In light of that, it&#x27;s great to see conservation efforts starting small (cheap) and benign (hedgehogs) as a way to get people involved and caring about local wildlife! While the impact of the system designed in the article seems to be less-than-rigorously understood, the effort and empathy investment by the community in the &quot;highway&quot; is, I think, a very real and good thing for environmental work.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wildlife_crossing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wildlife_crossing</a>')
