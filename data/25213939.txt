No matter how often Rush Limbaugh says he&#x27;s &quot;just an entertainer,&quot; he&#x27;s clearly misleading his audience. Also misleading is sandwiching a comedic rant between a serious article and a serious quote by MLK.<p>&gt; And, see how many corporations also funded Trump<p>Corporations aren&#x27;t a unified block. Biden got over half a billion more in funding, which is telling.<p>&gt; Political polarization keeps people from seeing the robber barons that are benefiting in excess from others own hard work.<p>This is a narrative invented because if people find a <i>purpose</i> to polarization, they can blame someone else besides themselves. What is the greatest distraction from the proletariat rising up against the &quot;robber barrons?&quot; It&#x27;s Netflix, not Fox News. Without polarization, people won&#x27;t suddenly be plotting about how to take down the rich. They&#x27;ll go back to rewatching the Office.
