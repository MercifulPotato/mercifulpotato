Polestar&#x27;s figures for the 2 are (vs the XC40 on the same underlying platform):<p>Global power mix: 112,000 km (69,594 miles)\nEuropean power mix: 78,000 km (48,467 miles)\nWind power: 50,000 km (31,068 miles)<p>The electrical emissions data comes from GaBi, but I can&#x27;t see reference to the specific mixes they mention in the GaBi professional database, so I don&#x27;t know what the exact breakdown of the mixes are.')
