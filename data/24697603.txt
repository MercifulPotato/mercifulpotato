Making sure the motherboard supports it is hard and then the RAM options are extremely limited and generally quite slow and expensive. Threadripper is maybe better but that&#x27;s quite a jump in cost. It would be so nice to finally be able to assemble low-cost home servers and workstations with ECC but it remains a niche where you have to give up a lot to get it.')
