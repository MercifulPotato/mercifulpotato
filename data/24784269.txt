Item(by='Cogito', descendants=None, kids=[24784297], score=None, time=1602729344, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24779739, text='The framing you have here is an attractive one, but I don&#x27;t think it makes much sense in the context of reproducing molecules.<p>There is no reason to posit random DNA chains.<p>The statement that &quot;the number of DNA chains that produce valid&#x2F;useful protein in the space of all possible DNA chains is vanishingly small&quot; seems reasonable (however I&#x27;m not sure how we would know these chains are the <i>only</i> ones that produce valid&#x2F;useful proteins).<p>The idea that we need to choose randomly from the space of all possible DNA chains is <i>not</i> reasonable.<p>----<p>Once we have a reproducing molecule, we expect to see a multitude of valid reproducing molecules as descendants of that first molecule. We expect (at least some of) these descendants to eventually be extremely different from the original molecule, and by their nature valid reproducing molecules.<p>Once we have a reproducing molecule (like DNA) that creates other molecules (like RNA and proteins) we can expect the same of its descendants, and the descendants&#x27; by-products.<p>If these molecules form an ecosystem, where the reproduction of one relies on the validity of the other, the only succesful variations within the ecosystem will be valid variations of the ecosystem.<p>----<p>The space that we are choosing from is not the space of all possible DNA chains, it is the space of all DNA chains adjacent to existing valid chains (or chains in a valid ecosystem).<p>It&#x27;s analogous to taking a valid x86 program that can reproduce, randomly adding&#x2F;removing&#x2F;mutating some bits on reproduction (with low frequency, very quickly, and in a ginormous space - think on the scale of molecules in the Earth&#x27;s oceans), and asking if that new program is also valid. And then, after millions of years of this, asking if one of the programs is a valid mathematical function.<p>----<p>There are still big questions here. Questions like &quot;how do we get the first reproducing molecule?&quot; and &quot;is DNA likely to arise once you have reproducing molecules, or just one out of many options?&quot;<p>None of those questions give reason to evoke the number of all possible variations of DNA as evidence that the variation we see in proteins is somehow unlikely.<p>Once we know that there exists one valid DNA&#x2F;protein system (which we do, as it exists), and we know that variations of DNA&#x2F;protein ecosystems can be functional (which we do, as we&#x27;ve observed it), it is reasonable to expect a multitude of valid, functional DNA chains, and the proteins produced by them.')
