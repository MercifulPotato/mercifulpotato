Dangerous command is this:\n   scp admin:boring-spreadsheet.ods .<p>Here, user do not do type anything wrong, however if an attacker somehow replaces the remote with a malicious ssh server which returns a .bashrc that contains dangerous content (such as aliases like alias ls=rm -rf *) then you are basically screwed. So this is a serious issue.<p>Other security error is quite interesting if I understood it correctly (scp some-local-file remote:&#x27;`touch you-lose`remote-file&#x27;). It is basically running the command in the remote server. If that is so, why would a file transfer protocol run a command in the remote server? If an attacker manages to put a file with name `rm -rf &#x2F;` in the directory that one is going to transfer, it may damage the remote system. I think, this part of protocol really needs to be fixed.')
