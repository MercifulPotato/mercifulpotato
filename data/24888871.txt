Item(by='ddevault', descendants=None, kids=[24889423], score=None, time=1603652256, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24888791, text='Yes, they&#x27;re optional, and no, they&#x27;re not universally adopted, but <i>this doesn&#x27;t damn Wayland</i>. An example of where the screenshot protocol isn&#x27;t supported (and this is fine) is where Wayland is used as the driver for the dashboard display in a vehicle (which is one of the major places where Wayland adoption is strong in industry). Wayland is designed to accomodate a broader variety of use-cases than X11: it&#x27;s not <i>just</i> for desktop systems. That&#x27;s <i>why</i> these protocols are optional and separate from the core Wayland protocol: it gives us greater flexibility, by design.<p>Among desktop systems, GNOME is really the only one who maintains a concrete <i>objection</i> to these protocols. KDE supports most of the wlroots-sponsored protocols in theory, and a handful in practice - patches welcome for the rest. The remainder of the major Wayland implementations for desktops, and many for mobile, support most or all of the necessary protocols.<p>I am really getting tired of explaining this stuff, over and over and over again. Can we please just <i>stop</i> spreading FUD for technologies that we don&#x27;t understand? I&#x27;m just so sick of it.<p>Why do people do this? What can be done to stop it? Obviously nothing I&#x27;ve done so far has been working. This feels like talking to conservatives about climate change.')
