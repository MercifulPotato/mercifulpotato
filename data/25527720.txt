Item(by='eternalban', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608820170, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25525799, text='&gt; My conclusion was that fantasy Interfaces are very much like the early web. Lots of moving parts<p>These designs all have quite a bit of &#x27;hair&#x27;. There are some basic functional elements and then, like a salad, it is garnished with all those numeric registers and shifting rulers, and linear elements.<p>Since you are a designer, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve had those moments with a wip composition that has all the visual metadata still visible and possibly found it more &#x27;visually exciting&#x27; than the final cleaned-up product. Same thing happens with architectural design drawings. The &#x27;compact&#x2F;minimal intensity&#x27; of a conceptual sketch is, imo, partly due to the fact that relationships between elements are more explicit in the early stages and the composition feels more &#x27;dynamic&#x27;. Same design in final form will simply not evoke the same emotional response and is rather &#x27;static&#x27;. (my take on this.)')
