In a previous job, I had only been there a few weeks after moving across country to take this job. It was a large enough company  that I still didn&#x27;t know what the entire company did but recognized a few people from different departments just from water cooler chats. I had been becoming familiar with some new software and was staying late as I didn&#x27;t really have anything else to do. Taking a stroll through the building partly out of curiosity to see who else was still in the building I found a group that was staying late because of a next day deadline. Curiosity got me involved in what they were struggling to do. It just so happened that the software I had been playing with was the perfect solve to this groups problem. Ultimately, the deadline was met at the bottom of the 9th with 2 outs and no runners on the bases. Sometimes, things just work out where the right info is available and the people that can use that info all come together to pull off what looks like a miracle when it was just damn good luck of very fortunate timing.<p>We didn&#x27;t save any lives that day. We didn&#x27;t change the direction of medical advice. However, face was saved and the people that were dreading having to tell the client the deadline was not going to be met would call it a miracle. And since it happened after hours while we worked deep into the night, would that not also qualify as an overnight miracle?')
