The entire liability is $1.05 trillion.<p>To put this in perspective, even if you assume zero investment returns, that works out to $35 billion&#x2F;year over 30 years.  The California 2019 budget was $215 billion.<p>Pension liabilities are a BFD, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say the state is ignoring it.
