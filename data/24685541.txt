At my company we use a mix of PC running Linux and Mac. Being able to run Sketch on Linux would open perspectives for designer types. Although the switch to Linux would meet opposition for other reasons. :)<p>The home page of Darling specifies &quot;experimental support for running simple&quot; GUI. Does anyone have any idea whether Metal support (which Sketch uses) is out of the question?')
