Therefore, if they love to shout about day 0 support, I think they have the rights.<p>The provider project I&#x27;ve contributed to, or better, tried to, has been a complete trainwreck. Many devs discussing on an issue, maintainers ignoring the issue for a long time, then maintainer stepped in with a fundamentally incompetent comment, then disappearing again. This is odd, because the provider is maintained by Hashicorp employees.<p>There are polite and communicative ways of explaining why it&#x27;s not possible to work on a fix&#x2F;feature; that maintenance was far from this.<p>I suppose that they Hashicorp has a specific plan of maintaining the core very actively, at the cost of doing very poor maintenance on the&#x2F;some providers. I wouldn&#x27;t be suprised if they put their less important employees working on the providers.')
