It also stacks confusion. &quot;Unemployment&quot; used as a primary barometer for the labour economy.<p>People (including journalists, politicians... high stakes stuff) assume that unemployment captures most unemployment. They don&#x27;t consider that most unemployed 58 year olds are not counted because they &quot;retired,&quot; stopped seeking work or receive a disability benefit. When&#x2F;if these become substantial, the measure means very little.<p>Every time a journalist note record high&#x2F;low unemployment of X%, it&#x27;s probably just as deceptive or (more likely) misleading. The measure itself means something different in 2020 than it did in 1980, or in a different country&#x2F;region.<p>At least the &quot;true&quot; appendage makes clear that there are differing and divergent ways to measure unemployment, and that these cn result in huge differences.')
