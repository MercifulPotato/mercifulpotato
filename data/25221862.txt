At $50.00 on average and coming in in 119th place worldwide, one would expect American packages to be considerably cheaper. But while broadband in the United States is widely available and uptake is high, lack of competition in the marketplace means Americans pay far more than they should compared to much of the rest of the world.<p>Does the HN community agree with the assessment that the lack \nof competition is why the prices are high?  If so, does anybody have some explanations&#x2F;links for why there is a lack of competition and some proposals to improve the problem?  I know community broadband projects are starting to popup, I&#x27;m guessing partially due to this issue.<p>Also, is there a tradeoff?  Is the &quot;widely available and uptake is high&quot; benefit in part because of the low competition?')
