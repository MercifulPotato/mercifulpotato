One time, in a rather silly mood, I ponder this weird idea to add a game to the employee toolkit. I imagined it to grow just like all in-house developed software and ideally make a caricature of the business process. Then I remember how many people I met and hung out with in online games like Diablo 2. One would stand in town and chat about the game, life the universe and everything. The silly idea didn&#x27;t seem all that silly anymore.')
