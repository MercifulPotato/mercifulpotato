Knowing that I would have no way to become truly free. Free as in I don&#x27;t owe anyone my time. Maybe others can accept it or are forced to accept it. I just can&#x27;t. But people of course are different.<p>Currently I just can&#x27;t wait to reach that state. Sometimes I&#x27;m counting days even. I could never be happy&#x2F;relaxed as long as I am forced to work, or forced to work under someone.<p>With regular work, I think I am saving around 70% of my total compensation, but I am also finding ways to do side-hustles.\nHopefully I can hit something that will help me reach passive income or otherwise I will be dependant on my career compensation. So as long as I haven&#x27;t achieved that state I will keep trying and spend most of my time trying to reach this state.')
