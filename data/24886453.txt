Everyone including myself wants the useful or convenient niceties of a modern smartphone like maps, Spotify, various messaging tools, notes etc. without the dreck of social media. At this point, a stripped-down android launcher makes more sense than trying to bring back the candybar phone or some weird hardware middle ground. There are a bunch of minimalist launchers out there, but I haven&#x27;t found anything really great. I was using &quot;A Decluttered Launcher&quot; until an update screwed up its handling of soft keys and have moved to Niagra.')
