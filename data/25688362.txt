Suppose further that about 100 people actually passed the barricades (which were inexplicably opened by the police, by the way, video evidence shows) out of the estimated 40,000 at the rally. If that is the case, is it really fair to shut down major pro-Trump websites?  If so, it would prove that a few instigators can pretty much undermine any organization by these kinds of tactics.<p>I would also note that there has been terrible violence associated with BLM protests, much worse than was seen this week, with buildings burned, police cars smashed or lit on fire, dozens of police assaulted, people shot, stores looted, passersby beaten up... and to my knowledge, no effort was made to close down BLM websites.<p>I&#x27;m all for law and order, and I was against the trespassing that happened and whatever violence did occur at that rally, but we shouldn&#x27;t be so quick to just throw out freedom of speech and equal access to the internet, or it will come back to bite us, guaranteed.  The Internet was established by public funding, university research, and millions of people paying into services &amp; resources; it mustn&#x27;t be turned into a private club.')
