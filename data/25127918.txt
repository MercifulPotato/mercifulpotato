I&#x27;m in Boston and friends have had people yell in their faces about how they&#x27;re stupid for worrying about it (home depot) and I&#x27;ve personally had people drive by and feel the need to bother shouting out their window about how my mask is gay.<p>To be fair, my mask has lovely periwinkle patterns and I am gay, but that&#x27;s a lot of effort they&#x27;re putting into getting attention and obviously comes from deep seated issues with their own masculinity that aren&#x27;t my problem.<p>Nonetheless they have been the exception rather than the rule, so it may be good to assume the best unless someone is actually accosting you.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed there is a strong tendency for people to assume that a stranger&#x27;s gaze is antagonistic when in reality they barely register you are there.<p>It is hard to <i>not</i> be extra sensitive to these things when you are a minority, I guess honestly a lot of people are learning what that feels like for the first time.')
