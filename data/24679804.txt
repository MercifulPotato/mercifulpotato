The build system is a lot more relaxed than Factorio, since you have no enemies and you have access to an unlimited amount of elementary building blocks (mines, transport belts, splitters etc...) whereas in Factorio you have to assemble everything from elementary ores.<p>The advantage is that it makes Shapez a lot more chill to play and a lot more forgiving. The inconvenient is that it&#x27;s also vastly easier and it doesn&#x27;t have quite as much depth. Once you reach the level 15 or so it starts getting very repetitive, since you&#x27;re always doing the same thing over and over, just at an always greater scale.<p>Factorio is better at varying its gameplay, the game really plays differently as you unlock trains, blueprints, drones, etc...<p>Of course Shapez is a much younger game, so it&#x27;s unfair to expect the same level of polish and variety.<p>At any rate there&#x27;s no reason not to support a nice open source game at this price, so I definitely recommend giving it a try.')
