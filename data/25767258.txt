Why would we not be counting the asymptomatic cases for these purposes?<p>381K fatalities against 70M assumed cases is a fatality rate of about half a percent. It would doubtless tick up a bit higher if nobody got sick anymore starting today as hospitalizations are at very high numbers compared to the past, in the US, so those cases have more deaths to come.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webmd.com&#x2F;lung&#x2F;news&#x2F;20200901&#x2F;what-changing-death-rates-tell-us-about-covid" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webmd.com&#x2F;lung&#x2F;news&#x2F;20200901&#x2F;what-changing-death...</a> here the CDC projection is stated as about 0.6% which is consistent with that.
