Ie, having a 2TB disk and a 1TB disk and being able to say &quot;keep 2 copies of any data in this subvolume&quot; and &quot;keep only 1 copy in this subvolume&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m currently on Bcachefs, which has erasure coding with similar promises and works better for me.<p>ZFS is more rigid, I have to have all matched disks for best performance, plus RAM unless I like bad performance (I don&#x27;t). This could be solved by striping disks into 1TB partitions, but ZFS doesn&#x27;t like living on a partitioned disk nearly as much.<p>Mixed disk has a bunch of cool properties for homelab users. Bcachefs also solves another problem; caching and speed. I could designate my 1TB NVMe as fast and my SATA 2TB SSDs as slow. I could also define that &#x2F;tmp requiers no Erasure Coding and everything else requires 2 replicas. Then I would be able to combine the performance of my NVMe with the capacity of my SATA SSDs while gaining a simple redundance solution. My NAS has a dozen of mixed disks that I could combine more easily than ever.<p>The issue with ZFS is not that it&#x27;s not ready to use. The issue is that it&#x27;s born from enterprise and requires a costly enterprise setup to run, rather than a cheap homelab setup.')
