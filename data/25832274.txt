They executive branch should not be able to change the budget from year to year on their own, since they can &quot;punish&quot; state media if they don&#x27;t say things the government likes. Using tax revenue would generally give the executive branch power to set or at least propose the budget.<p>When Norway recently moved to tax funding state media, I think they solved this by making it a completely separate dedicated tax. At least that&#x27;s what was discussed, not sure about the details of the final implementation. So it can only be changed by a vote in parliament, which is more visible to the public, can take more time, and requires a majority of parties to agree on that specific change.')
