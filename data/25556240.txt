Keep it close enough to RISC-V that work proving out designs can be ported more or less mechanically, but take advantage of binary incompatibility to fix the worst design choices.<p>Status bits have turned out not to be such a problem as was once thought, since they started renaming status registers along with the others.<p>Perhaps the worst choice was the coarse-grained extensions architecture that locks up the most useful instructions with dozens of marginal ones, making them unusable in portable compiled code.<p>As a result, no RISC-V program can assume POPCOUNT is available, because it is locked away in the huge (still-unratified) &quot;B&quot; extension.<p>The most difficult problem modern CPU designers face is coming up with a way to put another hundred-million transistors to productive use -- i.e., that will make programs actually run faster, but without running too hot. Modern chips are crammed with dodgy, poorly documented gimcracks that make programs run absurdly fast much of the time, but not always.<p>Programmers now have two problems: discovering whether their programs actually are running fast, and discovering why the ones that aren&#x27;t don&#x27;t. Usually the only way to know our program is slow is when we see a faster one. It was fast until exactly that moment, then became instantly slow.')
