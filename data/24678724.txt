Item(by='mansion7', descendants=None, kids=[24678948, 24682184], score=None, time=1601816542, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24678373, text='Reddit is very much a nest of hate, if you are any stripe of conservative.<p>&quot;The Donald&quot; was censored, then banned, for speech  less heinous, in lesser amounts, and with lower, or often negative, voting scores, than is currently allowed on the site now (by those with approved political beliefs, of course).<p>Those with non-approved beliefs find themselves silenced and censored by moderators and admins, while those who instigated their silencing are left unmolested.<p>Subreddits with thousands (or in the case of &quot;The Donald&quot;, HUNDREDS of thousands) of members are banned for the actions of a very, very few.  In some such cases, those few were outside instigators (Reddit calls them &quot;brigaders&quot;) from subreddits with opposing views; purposefully posting inflammatory material under sockpuppet accounts.  The &quot;brigaders&quot; then report the naughty speech to the admins.<p>Doesn&#x27;t take many such reports to have all those thousands of voices silenced.  Of course this tends to go one way.  Although &quot;brigading&quot; is ostensibly against Reddit rules, subreddits with approved views are allowed to do it openly, although some do in private.<p>And lest we forget, the CEO of Reddit HIMSELF has hacked into user accounts of those with unapproved views, and posted inflammatory things posing AS them (an act which Redditors were assured was not possible).   Supposedly he&#x27;s only done it a few times, but how are Redditors to know for sure?<p>When all these activities on the part of Reddit&#x27;s leadership go one way, and are directed specifically against one political persuasion, it becomes very clear that Reddit IS a nest of hate, and that&#x27;s the way they like it.  It is also clear that they censor not to stop &quot;hate&quot; but to cease the discussion and meme production of conservatives, to which they partially attribute Trump&#x27;s 2016 victory.<p>To this end, they&#x27;ve recently gone so far as to announce that they will censure users for merely VOTING on unapproved topics.  Sure, they say those unapproved topics are &quot;hate&quot;, but when the people defining &quot;hate&quot; are so slimy as to hack into and pose as their own users to sow discord, or to tacitly approve one way &quot;brigades&quot;, one need not wonder their actual purposes.<p>Like so many of their brethren in the media who took it personally when Hillary lost, they are taking drastic action to be sure that such free speech activities not continue if there is any possibility of a repeat of 2016.')
