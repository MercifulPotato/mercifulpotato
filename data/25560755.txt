This is a great little micro-optimization, but definitely requires some compiler support to do safely (on the other hand, compiler devs should want to support it, because it&#x27;s a great little micro-optimization, so I don&#x27;t think that it would be _too_ hard to add).<p>Note that one way to get the code size wins for the caller in a compiler-blessed way is to use an alternative calling convention, like Clang&#x27;s preserve_most; this isn&#x27;t as good as explicitly providing a clobber list, but allows a library to provide a stable interface.')
