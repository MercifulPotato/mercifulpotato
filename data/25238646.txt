It&#x27;s not an easy problem.<p>I&#x27;m also not quite sure which problem is being solved by using your phone as a webcam. Actual webcams are quite cheap and come with way better mounting hardware than your phone. And for freehand videos like in the paper the realtime requirement isn&#x27;t very common, and if it&#x27;s there it&#x27;s usually sufficient to do the processing on the phone and stream directly from there. There has to be something I&#x27;m not seeing?')
