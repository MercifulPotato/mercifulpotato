Like the new guy coming in and saying how everything can be different and better, just listen to me. That is irritating, unhelpful usually because you don&#x27;t have all the information yet. It makes two assumptions, that the team isn&#x27;t competent enough to realize it, and that your current view of whats on fire is more important then everything else going on.<p>The other example of the guy saying from the outside, their fix will only take 2 weeks. That&#x27;s an estimate from someone who doesn&#x27;t have the whole picture, if your asking another team. The resolution was to pester people and write up long docs to convince them its worth it. This is immediately adding on to your estimate of time.<p>This idea of friction seems like its more a question of trade offs and prioritizing work. Is it worth going through all this effort and context switching to try to see if this thing can be done. Is it worth distracting other people. I think calling it friction means we could possibly be undervaluing work that is prevented by this friction. Ill have to think about it more')
