As an employee, I want to work for a company where I can keep growing, and where my skills and salary is fairly evaluated over time. I don&#x27;t want to work for a company where my only salary increase is a yearly 1% one, or where my only chance to get a promotion is once a year. If I need to switch a company to get both, then I&#x27;ll definitely do that.<p>Things like this are a two way street, yet companies often don&#x27;t treat it as such.<p>EDIT: Because you&#x27;ve changed your answer after I typed my response. Some people might be okay with having to stay 10+ years in a company to finally get that role they wanted. I&#x27;m not, if I think I deserve better, I&#x27;ll ask my company for it, if they tell me that maybe in 5 years I can get a better  thing, then I rather switch jobs now instead of holding myself back.')
