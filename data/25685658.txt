Instead of looking back at transactions and how much money has already left, this looks forward.  I have house and car payments due on the first, utilities due later in the month, kids college accounts, Internet, car registration due once a year, garbage due quarterly, insurance due every 6 months.<p>I get paid twice a month.  The day after I get paid a job at Simple runs that takes a share of all the above expenses from my account, moves those funds into &quot;envelopes&quot;, and gives me a main account view of the money I have left over after my expenses are accounted for.  So in the middle of the month I have half my rent and car moved off for 2 weeks in the future.<p>I guess a similar notion would be to just add all these up, or maybe keep a spreadsheet of them, and have it give me a number to transfer into a secondary account every paycheck, and pay bills off of that.<p>But the Simple expense view is great, I can see what expenses have already come out (because they are empty), which haven&#x27;t been paid yet (they are fully funded, according to the progress bar), etc...<p>In fact, their &quot;categorize transactions&quot; I&#x27;ve found to basically be useless.  Aside: Part of this is their system, which has never seemed to be able to learn some transactions.  Part of it is that you just can&#x27;t track Amazon spend (is this Home Improvement, Groceries, books, etc...).')
