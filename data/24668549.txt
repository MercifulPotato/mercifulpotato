If being inclusive, for example not being derogatory&#x2F;hurtful toward LGBT people, etc., is a &quot;liberal&quot; political take, it really tells you a lot about conservative stances, and the stances of people against this who just say it&#x27;s &quot;liberal ideology,&quot; doesn&#x27;t it?<p>&gt; If you want free debate we’ll give you free debate. We demand liberal bias training sessions paid or  by the company and run by conservative consultants. We demand proper gender segregated bathrooms. We demand nobody use the term “cis white male” with vitriol.<p>This guy is such a scumbag. Wow, you&#x27;re this upset and feel excluded because people are asking you not to use exclusive language, and workplaces are made more accommodating to trans people?<p>&gt; proper gender segregated bathrooms<p>Hmm, I wonder what he meant by this, also?<p>If your political views involve being a piece of shit to humans just trying to get through their work day <i>you&#x27;re in the wrong and nobody should give a shit about your political opinions.</i><p>Also, by the way, I do not consider myself a &quot;liberal.&quot;')
