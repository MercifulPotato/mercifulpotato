If you optimize for CTR, you are not necessarily optimizing for user satisfaction&#x2F;loyalty.<p>Case in point: Netflix&#x27;s auto-play feature used to drive me bonkers, so much that I would try other streaming services first.  How could they think this feature was a good idea?  The only plausible explanation I&#x27;ve heard is that they were optimizing for user engagement.
