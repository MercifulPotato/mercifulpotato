Using a classic Econ 101 argument, competition should benefit consumers by improving quality.<p>That argument makes a giant chasm of an assumption about the mechanism of the market.<p>In fact, the main driver of the market is the profit motives of publishers and advertisers.<p>Whilst it is true that one way to profit is to provide sustained long term benefit to consumers, that isn&#x27;t the only viable business model.
