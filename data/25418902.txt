Trees are cut down and signs widely spaced so that drivers can go fast while feeling like they are going slow.<p>And as a side effect, these wide roads make walking and cycling less feasible, because destinations are forced to be more distant, and the higher speeds enabled by the wide roads make walking and cycling more inherently dangerous. There is a strong relationship between lane width and pedestrian fatalities.[1]<p>As for enforcement, you try going to a city council meeting anywhere in America, call for speed cameras on every street, and see if you can get out without eggs on your face from all the drivers who think it&#x27;s their right to break the law and endanger others when cops aren&#x27;t present.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academia.edu&#x2F;12488747&#x2F;Narrower_Lanes_Safer_Streets_Accepted_Paper_for_CITE_Conference_Regina_June_2015_" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.academia.edu&#x2F;12488747&#x2F;Narrower_Lanes_Safer_Stree...</a>')
