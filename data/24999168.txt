I had a bully of a boss who made me do it in his cars, all of which were powerful for the time.<p>What it gives you is a very different perspective on car shows where they test cars on closed circuits and runways. If you are going downhill for ten miles or so then you are going well above what the top speed of your vehicle is supposed to be. Skill level is approximately zero as you are just pushing a pedal and totally ready for that moment when you get stopped and banned from driving for what must be forever. Maybe with jail time.<p>The other perspective is on those police chase shows where the bad guy is only doing something like double the speed limit. You have been tanking along somewhat faster than that.<p>My weapon of choice was actually a brick shaped Renault Espace with a V6 engine in it. That could roll along at aforementioned speed for mile after mile, no mechanical woes at all. I am sure it wouldn&#x27;t get to these speeds with the Stig on Top Gear, but, if you are driving the length of the country, then something magical happens even if the 150 to 151 mph time is 301 seconds. The speed just keeps going upwards.<p>Youthful stupidity means this is possible with walls of snow on either side of the road at 3 a.m. which amounts to the clear roads the recent Cannonball runs had.<p>There is also an adjustment afterwards when you are driving normal cars at normal speeds. For me this was just not what I wanted to do so I actually quit driving, having got away with many crimes. Nowadays, Ed Bolian aside, I detest anyone going at stupid speeds on normal roads. If you crash then you are going to have your brain crash inside your skull making you brain dead. Not to mention inconveniencing the world with the road closed and the people in the other car in hospital.<p>As far as driving is concerned, I have &#x27;lived&#x27; and got several cars cruising along at that top speed figure few drivers would dare get to. Although I will never do that again I have scratched that itch. If I was to get back into driving I would recommend a vehicle with a good view so the scenery can be enjoyed at a safe 65 mph. I would also recommend a full roll cage with harness - for those maximum 65 mph speeds. As it is most motorway driving is more dangerous than people appreciate, not least because the roads are shared with crazy idiots like my younger self.')
