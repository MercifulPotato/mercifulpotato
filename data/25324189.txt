I wondered about fire risk but saw some vague claims by the manufacturers and that the local authority approved them, and just trusted that, despite these local authorities having a history of approving bad products. Decades ago, my dad was very critical of all polymer building insulation because of the fire danger. I thought he was just out of touch and obviously it wouldn&#x27;t be allowed if it wasn&#x27;t safe. This isn&#x27;t the olden days! We&#x27;re more strictly regulated now!')
