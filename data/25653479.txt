Chisel is one of many languages that <i>generates</i> HDL, that is, you describe code to built a circuit whereas in eg. Verilog you just describe the circuit (Verilog has a limited ability to do dynamically with generate statements).<p>An HLS is one that raise the abstraction.  Almost all of them today allows you to write &quot;lightly&quot; annotated C[++] that gets translated into a circuit.  Almost universally, the timing relationship isn&#x27;t explicit at all.<p>Opinions:<p>All existing HDLs and HLSes are terrible and there&#x27;s fertile  ground for creating something to really advance the art.  Personally I&#x27;m looking for something that is more productive that HDLs, but with more control than an HLS.  Some promising examples: Handle C, Google&#x27;s XLS (assuming promised development), and Silice.')
