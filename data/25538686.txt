The new platform had a different way of getting configuration, and a different set of platform integration plugins. So I couldn&#x27;t just force-push the old platform&#x27;s Git history; I actually did need to do a divergent-history merge in this case and resolve the result in the new platform&#x27;s favor.<p>I assumed the warning meant that you couldn&#x27;t do it, or that it would be super error-prone, or something; but it turns out that it worked perfectly fine with no problems (aside from standard Git merge conflict resolution).')
