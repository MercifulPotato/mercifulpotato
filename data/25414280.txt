WTH does that mean in quotation marks??  And how does that make you an expert on where it is safe?<p>I moved here because it was close to the border and most of the horror stories I heard were farther into Mexico.  Also this way I could still visit my father before he passed away and still easily cross to buy things in the US or get US mail etc.<p>I live in Playas de Tijuana.  People here told me it was safe.  So far I have not seen any danger.<p>I have heard of other towns and locations in Mexico and South America.<p>How TF would you know how much traveling I have done?<p>Why do you say I am constantly in danger?  Where do you think I should live and why?<p>I put myself out here looking for information and of course I got what I deserved which was just for people to spit in my eye.')
