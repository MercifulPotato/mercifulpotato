In comparison, a SUV just gives you that extra confidence that no matter the weather conditions, you&#x27;ll make it to your end destination because of the increased ride height, bigger tyres and 4WD systems. For most people that may be 2 or 3 days during the year, and the rest of the time they are paying dearly for this inefficiency.')
