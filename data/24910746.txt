Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[24910848], score=None, time=1603826065, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24910495, text='&gt; A tarball of an _ancient_ youtube-dl version is absolutely useless because the youtube HTML will have changed a million times in the meanwhile.<p>But it&#x27;s not a tarball of an ancient version of youtube-dl. It&#x27;s a tarball of a version of youtube-dl from like two days ago. So then it gets posted to some other host or some distributed thing and development continues over there, only with twice as much support because of all the media coverage.')
