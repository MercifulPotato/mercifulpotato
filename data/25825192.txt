EDIT: let me add this comparison of health prices across countries from the Health Care Cost Institute.  See Table 1:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthcostinstitute.org&#x2F;hcci-research&#x2F;international-comparisons-of-health-care-prices-2017-ifhp-survey" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthcostinstitute.org&#x2F;hcci-research&#x2F;international-...</a><p>Our prices <i>are</i> higher.<p>The US is an obese country, but you will find if you look that obesity rates are similar or worse in (e.g.) Mexico and some Gulf States (I think the UAE though I don&#x27;t have a source for you).<p>We are not a wild outlier in terms of measured unhealthiness.  Life expectancies here are lower though, despite vastly higher expenditure than other rich countries.<p>There are important failures on the supply side of the market:<p>From the OECD, we have fewer hospital beds per capita than most rich countries:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.oecd.org&#x2F;healtheqt&#x2F;hospital-beds.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.oecd.org&#x2F;healtheqt&#x2F;hospital-beds.htm</a><p>We have fewer doctors per capita than most countries:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.oecd.org&#x2F;healthres&#x2F;doctors.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.oecd.org&#x2F;healthres&#x2F;doctors.htm</a><p>Failures of competition throughout the market (including hospital consolidation) keep prices high.  We do basically zero evaluation of cost effectiveness.')
