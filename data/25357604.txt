And of course this can&#x27;t replace meat only in stuff like chicken nuggets where you don&#x27;t have the meat in a full piece.<p>Hmm, just noticed that there were parts of the article I missed, the header formatting is a bit weird there. Somewhat lower than $50 a chicken nugget does sound like you might only want to try this for novelty.<p>I do think there is quite a lot of potential in that area, if people can be convinced that &quot;lab-grown&quot; isn&#x27;t a bad thing.')
