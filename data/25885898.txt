Is it laziness on the part of the police?  Are they trying to reserve these systems for more serious crimes so we forget they exist?  Is it just a matter of time before police culture catches up and we see license plate readers, cell phone records, CCTV networks, etc used to track down petty thieves and robbers?<p>Last year the police were begging for help to solve some of the gun store robberies that happened during the BLM unrest.  Why did they need the public&#x27;s help?  They could have checked cell phone records, stitched together traffic camera video, and likely tracked down the suspects within weeks.<p>I think the most likely scenario is that we gave all these tools to create a surveillance state, but the bureaucracy is too lazy to use them.')
