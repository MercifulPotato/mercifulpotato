So, I expect, can the therapist and the researcher etc.<p>The moment anyone knows it&#x27;s no longer double blind.<p>I&#x27;m happy to be corrected if there is some clever way around this. I have heard people suggest you give &quot;control&quot; group members so other psychoactive substance (MDMA was suggested). But that doesn&#x27;t have the same effect as mushrooms. And also, it&#x27;s ethically merky to give people other drugs they&#x27;re not expecting&#x2F;consenting to. Plus then you don&#x27;t really have a control group, you have Mushrooms vs Other Drugs...')
