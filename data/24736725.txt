I start to feel it around ten seconds, definitely by thirty; three minutes is way over the line.<p>I start to be reluctant to make small tweaks. I want to program in &#x27;blocks&#x27;, time compiling with bathroom breaks. My frame is just wrecked, and I&#x27;m fairly convinced that code quality suffers from this.<p>I like what Zig is doing, by taking such care to keep unoptimized builds as fast as possible. Release builds can run overnight for all I care, I&#x27;m fine with taking arbitrary amounts of time to get the fastest <i>end product</i> I can have.<p>But I firmly believe that a language which can&#x27;t give me a build in a handful of seconds is missing out, and it&#x27;s a real pity Rust is in that category.<p>It&#x27;s possible that a language with type inference and a borrow checker simply must have slow compile times, that it&#x27;s inherent. I doubt that somehow, though I concede that one-pass compiling a la Turbo Pascal is likely impossible.')
