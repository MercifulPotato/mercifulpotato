Massles particles don&#x27;t experience time&quot; a fringe concept?</i><p>The way it is stated, yes.<p>A correct statement of an innocuous truth of relativity is that the concept of &quot;elapsed time&quot; doesn&#x27;t apply to massless particles at all. It only applies to particles that travel on timelike worldlines, and massless particles travel on null worldlines.<p>However, that correct statement does <i>not</i> imply either that massless particles don&#x27;t experience time, or that you need mass to have time. Null worldlines in different directions can be used to define time.')
