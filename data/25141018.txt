It&#x27;s very possible that Dropbox just spent $100M upfront to start saving $35M &#x2F; year relative to AWS <i>current prices</i>... but discovers in year 3 that they are no longer saving money because AWS has reduced prices via their own R&amp;D, which is spread over a massively larger customer base.<p>Now, because Dropbox is a <i>storage</i> company, it may well make since for them to continue R&amp;D and try to keep pace with AWS, at least for their own needs.  But 99% of other companies - of <i>any</i> size - would likely fall on the wrong side of the scenario above.')
