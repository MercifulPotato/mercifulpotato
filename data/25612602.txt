TinyCC&#x2F;tcc [1] parses almost all C99 with a 3900 line tccpp.c and 8000 line tccgen.c.<p>As long as extensions are careful to stay &quot;syntactically isolated&quot;, the complexity of parsing C need not explode.\nE.g., at least on Linux where glibc headers are very gcc-tilted, the only extension tcc really needs is that __attribute__(()) stuff (maybe 1 or 2 other &quot;just ignore this stuff&quot; things).<p>While there can always be edge cases that are broken, I use tcc daily on Linux without issue.  So, I would encourage people to not view C as an untamable complexity monster or be captive to prevailing implementations.  { C++ is, of course, a more unfortunate story in this and <i>so many other</i> regards :-) }<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TinyCC&#x2F;TinyCC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TinyCC&#x2F;TinyCC</a>')
