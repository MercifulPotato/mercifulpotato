Item(by='koolba', descendants=None, kids=[25667201], score=None, time=1609992222, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25667091, text='&gt; That&#x27;s a bullshit cheap shot. The protests this past summer were characterized by non violence, not by showing up at Best Buy to loot.<p>I think the phrase you’re looking for is “firey but mostly peaceful”: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;6preTw28GWE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;6preTw28GWE</a><p>&gt; There was violence and property destruction. But if you count the number of people that protested peacefully and the number of people that engaged in violence and destruction of property, there&#x27;s one that is obviously vastly larger than the other, and it&#x27;s the peaceful protesters.<p>If you’re protesting and looters show up to take advantage of the chaos, then shame on them. But if you keep showing up to “protest” and all it’s doing is enabling more looting, then you’re not a peaceful protester. You’re aiding and abetting the looters.<p>Again, if it a protest against the government then take it to the government. March on the capital. March on city hall. Planning marches through retail districts isn’t done by accident. They knew exactly what they were doing.')
