As such, it&#x27;s very basic (I think I spent more time entering problem sets than building the site).<p>I&#x27;m trying to evaluate whether this is something I should \n iterate on or not, so consider this sort of like a demo.<p>Suggestions are welcome--I have some ideas, but I don&#x27;t want to pollute the air.
