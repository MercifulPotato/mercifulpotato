Many professional musicians (like myself) routinely have to sing or play at various pitch levels: A=390Hz, A=415, A=420, A=430, A=435 or so, A=440, a bit sharp of 440 (European orchestras), etc. Many of those musicians have perfect pitch to varying degrees.<p>Having perfect pitch does <i>not</i> make it impossible, or even difficult, to &quot;enjoy&quot; music at varying pitches, etc.')
