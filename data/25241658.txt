Sure, there&#x27;s issues, but the state of the web in 2020 is so much better than it was two decades ago. Yes, some sites abuse it... but abusing web technologies is a time-honored tradition since the Internet started. People used to be tracked using 1x1 pixels or Flash. Don&#x27;t blame the technology, blame people.<p>We&#x27;ve seen so many amazing things become possible due to JavaScript. We can communicate and collaborate better than ever before. Even news sites, historically some of the biggest abusers of JS (with ads&#x2F;tracking), have used JavaScript to build amazing data visualizations and tell stories in new and unique ways.<p>The criteria for this &quot;club&quot; is so narrow, even Hacker News wouldn&#x27;t even be eligible! Is that really what we should be striving for?<p>Sure, sometimes JS has been abused. But Chrome&#x2F;Firefox&#x2F;Safari have done an amazing job of reigning in abuse and speeding it up, and I&#x27;m so excited about the crazy weird new things I get to build every day because web technologies have gotten so good.')
