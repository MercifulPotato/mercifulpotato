Apple has already crippled application firewalls on macOS Big Sur to allow Apple authorised softwares to bypass them (and even VPN), even if the user explicitly chooses to block them. That&#x27;s another move to make it a closed system like ios, where the user no longer has control over what apps can or cannot access the internet and Apple decides it for them. Does that seem like the old Mac platform to you?')
