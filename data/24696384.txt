The notion of the Third Reich, also popularized by Spengler, was elaborated in Das Dritte Reich (1923) by Arthur Moeller van den Bruck. He used the term to propagate a conservative &quot;socialist&quot; ideal that could unite all classes under an authoritarian militarist regime. Together with Spengler&#x27;s Preussentum and Sozialismus , it formed one of the building blocks of the doctrine of National Socialism .<p>As Von Klemperer argues in his classical history of ideas of the Conservative Revolution, the Nazi movement was ideologically fueled by these conservative intelligentsia:<p>&gt;It mattered in these days that both movements were counter- \nrevolutionary agents in the Republic and appealed to the \nworst instincts of the population. The vicious charges of \nthe neo-conservatives against the political parties, the \nWeimar &quot;system,&quot; or the Western powers, their mere use \n(with whatever mental reservations) of the new glittering \nvocabulary words like &quot;myth,&quot; &quot;totality,&quot; and &quot;race&quot; \nwere but grist for the Nazi propaganda mill. That is why \nthe initial alienation of the neo-conservative forces from \nthe Republic was so fatal an event. It paved the way for \nthe Rightist intelligentsia to serve the aims of the Nazi \nrevolution.
