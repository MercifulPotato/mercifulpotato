You probably have more code from Google&#x2F;Amazon&#x2F;etc than GNU in any modern distro.<p>Just look at all the effort devoted to systemd (which is a blatant copy of oracle&#x2F;windows service management) or everyone eating up the hype of zsh on macs (which is nothing but a spin from apple: Look how this new shell is so much better, oh bash is going to be GPLv3, no this has nothing to do with it, look how shiny is zsh!)<p>GPLv3 will set you free!')
