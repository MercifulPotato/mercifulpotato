I was trying to give you the benefit of the doubt, but if you were just casually trolling the thread rather than feeling hurt by something that came up, that&#x27;s worse, and the kind of thing we will ban an account for if it happens again.<p>You&#x27;re completely welcome here as long as you want to participate as a community member and use the site in the intended spirit—which, by the way, has nothing to do with &quot;behaving oneself&quot;, &quot;just seeing the good in everyone&quot;, or &quot;vomiting rainbows&quot;. It has to do simply with wanting an online discussion forum that&#x27;s actually interesting, that has some value for curiosity, as opposed to melting down into a circle of hell. Comments like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25565642" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25565642</a> are not interesting and encourage worse from others. This is the way that internet communities poison themselves. We&#x27;re trying to stave that off, at least for a while (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=stave%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=stave%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;...</a>). The internet call-out culture where people shame and abuse each other is not sustainable here.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen Blind, only a few mentions here and there. When you say &quot;there&#x27;s an overlap between that community and this one&quot;, you&#x27;re assuming your conclusion. I don&#x27;t see any reason to believe there&#x27;s much overlap.<p>If you want your ideas about how to &quot;nudge this community in the right direction&quot; to be taken seriously, one thing you shouldn&#x27;t be doing is posting in a way that is utterly destructive of the community. That can&#x27;t possibly be the right direction. Places like this are fragile and we need to work together to prevent this one from becoming hell. Scorched earth is not interesting, and if HN turns into that, what good does it do anyone, or the world? It&#x27;s bad enough that racism, sexism, and other bad things appear here—indeed it&#x27;s awful, and it&#x27;s also inevitable, because anything that exists in society is going to show up in a large, open internet forum like HN. If you think we don&#x27;t care about that, you couldn&#x27;t be more wrong. But that doesn&#x27;t make it good to burn the commons to the ground, which is unfortunately what most of your recent posts point towards.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you bring up PG, but he hasn&#x27;t had anything to do with operating HN for many years.')
