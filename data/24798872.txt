The latter is a bit more kid-friendly, and you might consider it a little prescient for its time.<p>Also, not trying to be on a high horse here (hey, I&#x27;m posting this on HN...) you might find that the people are merely <i>offered</i> the drugs and brain-computer devices and they make their own decisions about the two.<p>There&#x27;s a fantastic comic (no link, sorry) comparing Orwell&#x27;s future to Huxley&#x27;s future that&#x27;s remarkably relevant.<p>EDIT: link - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;biblioklept.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;12&#x2F;huxley-orwell-amusing-ourselves-to-death.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;biblioklept.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;12&#x2F;huxley-orwel...</a><p>I forgot, but it gets even better when, at the bottom, you notice the book is also from an even more prescient book, <i>Amusing Ourselves To Death</i> by Neil Postman.

I should stop there; I&#x27;ll start giving out spoilers. Read the books. :)')
