I haven&#x27;t bought a single Sony product since their rootkit fiasco 15 years ago [1]. I don&#x27;t buy products with DRM on them: I buy classical music DRM free from an excellent record label called Hyperion (many of my friends in the choral music circuit have been recorded by them); I don&#x27;t buy DVDs; I legally format-shift media freely streamed on OTA TV broadcasts, and I don&#x27;t buy DRM encumbered things online. My indie games come from itch.io and my &quot;indie&quot; games come from gog.com.<p>The trouble is, (a) doing this is a bit of a giant PITA, and (b) <i>companies never know that you&#x27;re not there</i>. Sony doesn&#x27;t know, and doesn&#x27;t <i>care</i>, that I don&#x27;t buy their products because of their aggressive pro-DRM stance. I am <i>one</i> consumer, many sigma away from mu, and slowly but surely I look like an antiquated relic: streaming has been so successful, and Widevine so ubiquitous, that it&#x27;s <i>almost</i> impossible to join the &quot;normal world&quot; without being subjected to (unwanted) DRM.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootk...</a>')
