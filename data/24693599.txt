Another 33% are under private control. Very little of the parts of CA that are ablaze are managed by the State.<p>Forest management alone at any level cannot prevent these massive fires from happening.<p>There is this deep, visceral resistance to acknowledging the impact of global climate change and humanity&#x27;s role in causing it.<p>It certainly feels trite having to repeat it ad nauseam: global climate change is and will continue to cause extreme and unusual weather events including blizzards, hurricanes, droughts, floods, famines, and wildfires. And yes, it will still get &quot;cold&quot; in the winter -- that does not disprove global warming and the resulting climate changes.')
