I try hard to think about it another way, but I just can&#x27;t.<p>It seems obvious to me from reading extensively around this that we have very little basis for arguing the case for free will. Our entire existence: our personal lives, our business lives, our investments, our health, our wealth - are driven by luck.<p>I run a successful small business in the UK. I can squint and pretend that everything about this success is down to me, but the reality is:<p>I&#x27;m white<p>Middle class<p>Have a great family<p>Have had the luck to have a wonderful family background including supportive parental influence as well as a generational (mother + grandparents) financial safetynet all the way through my life.<p>Have (so far) had great luck as far as health is concerned.<p>Are ANY of these things down to me and my skill? No, none. They are down to luck.<p>Am I a good business person? Yes, I like to think so. What&#x27;s that down to? Luck.<p>So for me, now, to turn around and say &quot;No, I&#x27;m not paying my taxes. I don&#x27;t believe in taxes. I don&#x27;t believe in helping those less well off than me. I don&#x27;t believe in helping people. I don&#x27;t believe in the state&quot;...? That is bullshit. Utter, total bullshit. And it makes me f<i></i><i></i>*g sick when I see people gathering vast quantities of wealth and then somehow making out that they are somehow separate from the [majority] of people in this world who really badly need help.<p>We should all be getting off our fat, lucky arses and doing more to help people instead of squirreling away our wealth and pretending we&#x27;re somehow special. And we should start by taxing the bejesus out of the wealthy. They [we] [I] can afford it.<p>Rant over. As you were.')
