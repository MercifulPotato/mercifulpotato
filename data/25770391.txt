I moved here from San Francisco after working at several startups including a long stint at Airbnb. I&#x27;ve been consistently stunned by how peripheral software is to businesses here. In the bay area organizations are structured around how they build technology and see it as a key point of competition. Here it&#x27;s viewed as a cost center and usually outsourced to consulting firms who integrate some semi-generalized third party solution.<p>This isn&#x27;t universal, there are startups here that &quot;get it&quot;. But it&#x27;s ubiquitous in large companies that have money, and that drives the salary market.<p>It seems inevitable that this will change in time either by the old guard catching up or new companies displacing them. I think one of the key driving forces behind this could be the return home of people with experience from SV style companies. As they join companies or start their own they are likely to advocate for approaches that more strongly couple the organization to its technology.<p>In the Canadian startup circles I once inhabited this was a broadly accepted idea. Seeing people move to the US for high paying tech jobs was generally celebrated, because there was an expectation that many of them would eventually return and be a boost to the overall ecosystem.')
