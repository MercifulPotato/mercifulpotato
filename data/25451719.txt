Item(by='julienchastang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608172581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25444069, text='&gt; It seems too late to get back in.<p>It is probably too late to get a tenure (or scientist) track position, but through perseverance I think you can work as a software developer (and probably a bit of a pay cut if you are OK with that) in any number of scientific research institutions (e.g., JPL, any number of FFRDCs). Many of these software engineering jobs have the possibility of working remotely, as well. And your PhD will be a big help if you are applying for NSF, NASA, DOE grants.  I work at an atmospheric science research institute and we are in the process of hiring an AI&#x2F;ML developer. I too prefer the academic &#x2F; research institute life. I am looking forward to getting back to science conferences when the pandemic is over.')
