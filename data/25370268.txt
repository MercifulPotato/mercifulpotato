Item(by='acidburnNSA', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607579458, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25355706, text='Also (too late to edit my previous comment), this assumes fusion converts all of the deuterium mass to energy, but actually it&#x27;s only the change in nuclear binding energy between D + T and n + He-4, which is 17.6 MeV per reaction, or 2.8e-12 Joules (note minus sign). So this assessment above seems to be off by about a factor of 10^24, or 1 trillion trillion.<p>To get all the energy out of a deuteron, you need an anti-deuteron. This is dramatically less practical than thermonuclear fusion because we have no credible source of meaningful amounts of anti-matter fuel.<p>The linked ucsd page is pretty solid.')
