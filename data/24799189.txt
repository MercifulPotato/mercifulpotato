Thank you for your interest and questions.<p>There are a few reasons why we would like to get the public involved:<p>1. It&#x27;s taken 20 years, 13 telecom companies and about $200B to bring mobile internet access to 600 million Indians. Broadband deployment is more expensive than mobile deployment so even napkin math gives you an idea of the magnitude of money and time it will require to truly make a dent in the connectivity of the country. If we can lower the cost of the deployment tech then we will able to lower the cost of ownership and distribution of the tech. This would be a win-win for consumers and investors.<p>2. A whole lot of the issues that plague the internet today, from the splintering of it into a chinese network, censorship, net neutrality and other issues comes from the fact that it&#x27;s so expensive to deploy these networks that they fall into the domain of mega-corps or nation states. As a result, control of the internet falls into a few hands and we have an internet that is getting increasingly centralized. If Wifi Dabba can spread ownership of the network then we hope that it will lead to more open internet that is harder to control or shutdown.<p>3. You&#x27;re right, we&#x27;re aiming to raise only $2M from the public - 100 PoPs x $20k each. Not sure where the $13M comes from, if you could point out where you see that number, I&#x27;d be happy to rectify it.<p>4. We&#x27;ve also built a lot of safety elements into the purchase process. We&#x27;re following Kickstarter-ish rules where you only have to make a $1000 deposit - the remainder to be paid only when we sell all 100 PoPs. Furthermore we offer a 100% refund in the first 12 months should you choose to change your mind at any point.')
