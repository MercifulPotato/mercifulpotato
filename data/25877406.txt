There were multiple documented posts on Parler that have been documented running up to the events on Jan 6&#x27;th that show people organizing and preparing for it. The evidence was present before the decision by AWS. I know folks who were collecting that events weeks <i>before</i> the event and predicting violence based on what they were seeing. The evidence for it is only increasing now but there more than sufficient evidence on the day of the event to indicate that Parler was going to be a liability to anyone hosting them.<p>Bias in this case works both ways. It makes some ignore the evidence that was already present. Businesses aren&#x27;t courts that need to prove guilt. This was about getting rid of a high risk client who had made clear that they will not be changing their high risk behavior. There is no reason AWS needs to share in that risk after giving them the opportunity to change.')
