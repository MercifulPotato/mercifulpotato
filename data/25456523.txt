Sometimes the very high compression levels (-19) produce a worse result, sometimes they kill it. I think most of the time I&#x27;m using -9.<p>I&#x27;ve seen cases where &#x27;--ultra --long -22&#x27; was bringing size down by 10% or more compared to the normal settings, and also cases where changing the defaults at all produced significantly lower compression.')
