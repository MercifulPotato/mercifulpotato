First let me say that with current blockchains, we achieve &quot;objective state&quot; at the cost of centralized control of the algorithm by some core group of developers.   This results in perverse incentives to maintain the status quo (c.f. bitcoin transaction cost problems).<p>Getting back to your question, I have no idea if the scaling functions will stabilize on a singular chain or not.  However, I think it would be a Pareto improvement over the status quo. Indeed, you could embed BTC and ETH into DCC (with the proviso that all users must use the core-developer-chosen hash functions and scaling functions), and  both chains could live side-by-side.')
