I pay Â£20&#x2F;month (USD $26) for unlimited data, voice and SMS.<p>I have two such SIMs, one for the home router (because it&#x27;s cheaper <i>and</i> faster than FTTC) and another for my phone.<p>Usage varies, but on a busy month the home SIM will see 100-300 GB, mostly for Netflix.  The phone SIM sees about 10-30 GB.<p>Speed varies by time of day, but at peak it&#x27;s 90 Mbit&#x2F;s down, 20 Mbit&#x2F;s up.  At the slowest times of day it drops to about 8 Mbit&#x2F;s down.  The phone is faster than the router, so I&#x27;ve occasionally switched to using the phone to download something large.<p>Last time I checked, there was technically a cap on the monthly data of 3 TB.  For a while they also limited tethering to 30 MB, i.e. using the phone as a wifi hotspot, and then (if they detected it) you could theoretically be charged a lot for tethered data over that cap.  But they officially removed that restriction a few years ago.<p>The links are a bit unreliable.  But the FTTC connection I had before was more unreliable, and more than twice the price.  The FTTC connection before that was nearly three times the price (gouging - it started out cheaper than quietly kept increasing a lot).  And if I move home, I can take my link with me now, instead of being tied into a 12 month contract at a fixed location.')
