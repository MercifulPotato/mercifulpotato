In the average company running VMs themselves, the person managing the VM is a different person that runs stuff on it. Even in &lt; 5 people tech teams. And Enterprise-grade VM management software is completely out-of-scope for any dev person for that matter. Chances are I will never even know any details about the real hardware it runs on.<p>K8S is a different story, it can be managed by a devops team (or a really engaged dev ;)). VMs virtualize your network interface and can take care of some IP routing, K8S can route HTTP traffic and TLS-terminate it. It facilitates being aware of other services and multiple instances. Basically it&#x27;s possible to get rid of nginx. And most importantly it runs the containerized applications basically on bare metal. Spinning up a test instance and destroying it 1 minute later is cheap, any dev can do it.')
