Here&#x27;s one for you, a 3-lane highway adjacent to a shopping centre and school. The 60km&#x2F;h speed limit is too high during shopping &amp; school hours, but stupidly low at 3am on a clear night with no traffic around. My opinion of a safe speed is very different for those 2 circumstances - I don&#x27;t see how that equates to bad judgement.')
