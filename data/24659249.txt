Your comment is way off the mark about Christians in India and to a great extant about Muslims as well.<p>Your first paragraph is very poorly put generalisation. As a resident non-upper caste Hindu Indian I couldn&#x27;t disagree more. While lower caste and Muslim oppression has skyrocketed in India since 2014 (esp. among low income groups of society), this is far from true in professional setups especially in the generalised way you&#x27;ve put it.<p>&gt; But the higher castes are extremely insular, and treat anyone of any race poorly.<p>This is just untrue!<p>&gt; This might be taboo, but every time I see a situation where there are multiple Indians in a reporting chain, I run.<p>I have never worked abroad&#x2F;in the west (other than short stints in SK&#x2F;JP) so I can&#x27;t comment on what you&#x27;ve said directly. But coincidentally most of my friends (different caste groups) who work in the USA (or even EU) avoid this as well - but because of some other reason. Work culture - as in timings, out of work hour calls and forced unreasonable expectations. They know that (and I agree) work-life balance will be shitty in a team full of Indians up, down, and around.<p>Hell, years ago I got an MS accept from MSU but I ran away seeing pretty much the entire CS department manufactured in India and China - PhD scholars, profs - all of them (I had applied w&#x2F;o checking that). Yes, is this another generalisation but to be honest that&#x27;s how I felt at that time. Apologies if it came across as offensive.')
