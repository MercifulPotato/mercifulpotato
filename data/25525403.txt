But is it a true statement? With cookie-based auth, the user can&#x27;t (except for digging deep into the settings &#x2F; dev tools) make the browser stop sending a particular cookie either, but the server (or script) can be programmed to ask the browser to remove a specific cookie. Is the same not true for basic auth, i.e., is there no response header the server can send that results in the browser ceasing to include the basic auth creds thereafter?')
