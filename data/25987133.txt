Item(by='rakoo', descendants=None, kids=[25987341], score=None, time=1612172265, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25986963, text='gemini isn&#x27;t trying to reinvent the web, to make it P2P or serverless or whatever; it&#x27;s just reusing the ideas of gopher and the web but going in another direction. It doesn&#x27;t try to replace the web. From this point of view it makes total sense to reuse TCP, TLS and DNS, because they&#x27;re not trying to replace them.<p>&gt; Maybe also add a header to the server response that says x-gemini: true or whatever.<p>That would require adding headers, which means extension is possible, and that&#x27;s explicitely something gemini doesn&#x27;t want. I believe it makes sense in the goals gemini wants to achieve.<p>&gt; And I will disagree on this part, http 1.0 is actually easier to implement than the gemini protocol.<p>HTTP 1.0 still has multiple headers and multiple verbs. It&#x27;s actually closer to HTTP 0.9. Yes, you can say &quot;don&#x27;t use those&quot; but at some point it&#x27;s good to refresh the spec and see what is and what isn&#x27;t needed. Moreover HTTP is just HTTP, Gemini is transfer + encryption + client identification (through client certificates); the latter is still the wild west for the HTTP world, there is no clear set of &quot;best practices&quot; in this domain')
