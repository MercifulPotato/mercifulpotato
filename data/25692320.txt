As someone who doesn&#x27;t use and never really &#x27;got&#x27; Twitter it&#x27;s really hard for me to take Twitter that seriously. Aren&#x27;t there myriad other and better ways for the president to reach more people? (Note that only a small-ish minority of U.S. adults even use Twitter at all)')
