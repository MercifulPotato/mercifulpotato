I think most people who currently own a car rather than taking an Uber or taxi everywhere will continue to own a car after self driving cars are a thing - there is a lot of value in having a car immediately available to you no matter what, and it&#x27;s nice to drive around in your car that is set up how you want and has all of your things in it.<p>I think if autonomous cars are much cheaper than Uber it could push some people to get rid of their car due to cost, but personally I would never do that since a cheap car isn&#x27;t a huge expense.')
