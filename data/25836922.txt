Item(by='generalizations', descendants=None, kids=[25837481], score=None, time=1611081656, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25836728, text='&gt; no man wants...many do feel<p>Are you appealing to the desires of the crowd (bandwagon fallacy), or to a moral principle?  I&#x27;m talking about moral principles, which the laws and the government ought to uphold.<p>If they don&#x27;t, the law and&#x2F;or government is in the wrong. The right to speak your mind is a moral right; arguably, the right to defend yourself with an attourney is a subset of this.  The law is not the arbiter of what is right, or what rights humans possess &quot;inalienably&quot;.  The law only enforces and protects those rights (since it&#x27;s inefficient for each person to defend their own rights against everyone else: &quot;I will have my attourney at my trial, I challenge you to duel if you disagree&quot;).<p>If freedom of speech is impinged, then a human right has been trampled upon.  If a private individual forces someone else to be silent, they are morally in the wrong, even though there&#x27;s no law against it. If the US government did it, then the US acted against its constitution and broke a moral principle, if not the laws on the books.')
