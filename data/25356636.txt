I think the badge&#x27;s document could also adjust to the size of the frame (via viewport dimensions) with JavaScript. I&#x27;m pretty sure though that GitHub couldn&#x27;t resize a third-party iframe to its content even with JS because of cross-origin restrictions preventing it from accessing the document.')
