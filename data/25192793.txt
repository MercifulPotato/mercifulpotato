So much that I wish that article suggestions by Google in Android left side window were as good.<p>I mostly watch tech, games, dev, toys etc. including rocket jump, Siggraph, viva LA dirt league, corridor, Tom Scott, Vertassium, Steve mould, numberphile etc.<p>I almost always end up finding something interesting to watch. When it&#x27;s not, I either mark it as &#x27;not interested&#x27; or leave a dislike and it becomes good again')
