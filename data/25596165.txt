When I did try using my Canon, I actually didn&#x27;t use the widest setting on my lens. A 16mm equivalent lens would&#x27;ve given everyone a really nice view of my closet, which isn&#x27;t something I want to do.<p>&gt; Using DSLR or mirrorless camera as webcam on desk is done by many, especially by Twitch streamers, Youtubers, and Zoomers who want quality video.<p>As I said below, those are groups that are willing to make tradeoffs for extremely high video quality, especially streamers and youtubers as that&#x27;s their job. For the rest of us however, the tradeoffs are probably not worth it.')
