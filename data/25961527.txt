Item(by='wonder_er', descendants=None, kids=[25961822], score=None, time=1611949811, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25961372, text='Why let the perfect be the enemy of the good?<p>&gt;  Legal sanction against law enforcement officer misrepresentation is a more attainable control point than 100% awareness and compliance with &quot;don&#x27;t talk to police&quot;.<p>The latter advice is valid, and I agree with it. The change in law, with both sanctions (against officers and departments transacting such conduct) and exclusions on all evidence and testimony resulting, would be vastly more effective.<p>I don&#x27;t think the legal sanctions would actually _do_ anything, because legal sanctions _never_ do anything. Cops still commit crimes, however you define &quot;commit crimes&quot;, _every day_ with zero penalty.<p>So, any argument that says &quot;we should ask police to stop lying, and if they lie, we&#x27;ll write them up!&quot; sounds like a non-starter.<p>On the flip side, we don&#x27;t need 100% awareness of &quot;don&#x27;t talk to police&quot;, we just need awareness to trickle into the percentage of society that has encounters with police every year.<p>Supposedly, there&#x27;s 700k police officers in the USA right now.[0]<p>Each of those probably interacts with at least 5 people a day, but there&#x27;s very much a 80:20 principle in _multiple_ contacts with police in a year.<p>So, I&#x27;d settle with 200mm people in the USA knowing this principle. That&#x27;s a measly 2&#x2F;3rds of the US population. A good and entertaining music video that highlighted this fact would get us half-way there in one fell swoop.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;191694&#x2F;number-of-law-enforcement-officers-in-the-us&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;191694&#x2F;number-of-law-enf...</a>')
