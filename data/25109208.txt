Item(by='Thorrez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605513198, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25108552, text='&gt;I don&#x27;t think they were talking about an actual web host<p>This HN post is about a blog hosted by WordPress.com (but not on the hostname wordpress.com). So given that context I think it&#x27;s clear this is about blog hosting. I agree that &quot;platform&quot; is a bit confusing, but WordPress.com the company can be called both a host and a platform (Wikipedia calls it both[1]). I would say that WordPress.com is in between a regular web host and a social media platform, but closer to web host, especially when a custom domain is used, as it is here.<p>&gt;clearly talking about social media platforms<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s very clear. Especially given the previous debate about Cloudflare taking down Daily Stormer[2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;WordPress.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;WordPress.com</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15031922" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15031922</a>')
