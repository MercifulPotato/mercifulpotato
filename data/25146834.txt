MIPI CSI is supposed to be a camera <i>serial</i> interface. Cameras on Pinephone are connected via a 8-bit parallel interface.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure how they came up with 5Mpix in the datasheet, CSI can do up to 4800x4800 which is 23Mpix.<p>OTOH, 1080p@30fps is not attainable on the parallel interface, at least not with the cameras that are in the phone. It would require ~120MHz clock, and communication starts to break down at around 60-70MHz.')
