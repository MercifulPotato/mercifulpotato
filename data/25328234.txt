All your point are strongly inline with mine.<p>I personally love how pragmatic Ruby is but its billion dollar null mistake + lack of typing + single threaded issues are glaring. But I still love the language and especially the community, my problem with switching over to Kotlin + SpringBoot is that lack of rails ecosystem web mindset. The SaaS web focused mindset doesn&#x27;t really exist in Kotlin e.g no Phoneix LiveView&#x2F;StimulusReflex competitors. Also while SpringBoot is suppose to be the like the Rails competitor I don&#x27;t have access to my `rails routes` or `rails new` or `rails generate..`, the rails guys really focus on happiness.<p>Having said that with Project Loom coming and other JVM goodies it feels really good to be in the JVM ecosystem. It is very much the &#x27;good enough for 95% cases&#x27; ecosystem.')
