For a while Google did just keyword targeting and it worked fairly well. (Not it&#x27;s gone berserk and you often don&#x27;t even see the organic results without scrolling). But the closest I get to relevant targeted advertising was when I&#x27;d do a search on Amazon for circular saws and see advertising for circular saws for the next 3 weeks.<p>Rough location based targeting is still going to be possible because requests will still have IP addresses. Likewise, the advertiser will know what app you are using and many apps provide context just based on what the app is.<p>Beyond that, I&#x27;m not super worried.<p>What would really help small businesses is if Goohle and Facebook would share the proceeds from advertising more evenly. Right now they basically suck all of the profits out of the market.')
