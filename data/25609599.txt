Sure the chance you get infected correlates with the chance you infect someone, but for some people infection carries more risk than others. And presumably the author also wants companies to be able to require people to be vaccinated, because otherwise vaccines are of limited use to companies.<p>Finally I&#x27;m not too sure if combatting &#x27;R&#x27; is <i>the</i> end goal. In the end you want to minimize total harm, this is subjective but among other things involves minimizing total deaths. It&#x27;s conceivable that vaccinating the group that&#x27;s overwhelmingly at risk first is an effective strategy to achieve that.')
