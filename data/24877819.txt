All I&#x27;m saying is QAnon, if it&#x27;s not a dumb LARP by some teenager, at least doesn&#x27;t set police cruisers on fire and doesn&#x27;t kill people for wearing a hat it doesn&#x27;t like. So if we were going down the list of dangerous societal things to address it would be nowhere close to the top.')
