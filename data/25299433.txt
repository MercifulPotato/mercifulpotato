According to Jeff&#x27;s response, first they bypassed a 2-week review process:<p>&gt; Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day’s notice before its deadline — we require two weeks for this sort of review — and then instead of awaiting reviewer feedback, it was approved for submission and submitted.<p>Then, when called out on it, they made &quot;an ultimatum&quot; and said they would leave if certain demands weren&#x27;t met. I&#x27;m not sure what every demand was, but one of them was indeed disclosing the name of the reviewers.<p>&gt; Timnit responded with an email requiring that a number of conditions be met in order for her to continue working at Google, including revealing the identities of every person who Megan and I had spoken to and consulted as part of the review of the paper and the exact feedback. Timnit wrote that if we didn’t meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date.<p>Jeff declined to meet the conditions, and let them go. Seems pretty straight forward to me.')
