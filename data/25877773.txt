Item(by='sildur', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611358719, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25875478, text='&gt; That&#x27;s what the post is arguing against. You seem to be under the impression that separating &quot;users&quot; and &quot;developers&quot; implies taking control away from the former - which is false. Users are different than you - and you should give them power.<p>False, but it happens. And I don&#x27;t like it. I feel like we are making a mistake here (a mistake older than time) by separating users between &quot;technical&quot; and &quot;average&quot;, and &quot;protecting&quot; the average, &quot;for their own good&quot;. These &quot;average&quot; users don&#x27;t exist, we are creating them by keeping them digitally illiterate &quot;for their own good&quot;. As I said, this theme is older than time.')
