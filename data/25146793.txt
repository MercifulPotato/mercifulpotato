Item(by='lifthrasiir', descendants=None, kids=[25149069], score=None, time=1605767146, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25146732, text='&gt; I see no reason why DST code (which is generally implemented as an extra timezone) could straightforwardly be adapted to handle a single permanent shift of time.<p>The point is that we don&#x27;t have to add the additional code to handle leap hours, as it can be implemented as a large swath of time zone changes.<p>We can imagine that there would be two versions of UTC, one before the leap hour (hereafter UTC) and one after the leap hour (hereafter UTC&#x27;). After the leap hour UTC and UTC&#x27; will coexist, where UTC&#x27; = UTC-1. Since time zone definitions themselves have UTC offsets, the trick is that instead of replacing all occurrences of UTC with UTC&#x27; (so that they would have UTC&#x27; offsets) we replace those offsets to have the same net effect. For example EST is UTC-5 before the leap hour and UTC&#x27;-5 = UTC-6 after the leap hour, so we pretend that the definition of EST changed to UTC-6.<p>Note that this approach essentially fixes the UTC-TAI offset (as opposed to the UTC&#x27;-TAI offset) and makes UNIX timestamp (time_t) deviate from the <i>current</i> version of UTC (well, UTC&#x27;). I believe this is just a matter of definition and thus much doable than changing UTC every few year. After all, leap hours would be much rare, probably the first one would occur at least a few centuries later.')
