Or a sleep on the way to work? Ideal) but given the timelines we should look elsewhere for the time being.<p>I think &quot;find ways of charging them away from their homes&quot; does not scale given how long a charge takes and the numbers involved. If you&#x27;ve ever seen a petrol station at peak time you tend to get an idea of just how impractical that is.<p>I don&#x27;t see any way round a truly colossal investment in infrastructure in order to move to fully electric in the UK (or any country), which maybe is necessary - but govts need to openly say this and then start actually taking action on it, not haughtily act as if it&#x27;s not the case.')
