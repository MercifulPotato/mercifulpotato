But I have still noticed how offensively useless the timeline is. The timeline has never been anything more than an out-of-context jumble of nothing, even with how curated my following list is. It is actually shocking to me how utterly incompetent it is. It takes what I want to see and actually somehow <i>strips</i> it of value. There is no reason for me to use the timeline in any respect ever, but it&#x27;s still the landing page.')
