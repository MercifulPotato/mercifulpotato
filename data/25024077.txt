His business failings have been known forever, but his personal debt is new information.<p>Normal people joining <i>any</i> position which requires security clearance can get denied, on basis of relatively small consumer debt. Why? Because it makes you risky, and susceptible of corruption.<p>Based in his personal debt alone, Trump would never, <i>ever</i> get any security clearance of any kind.<p>Also, letting the senate decide seems like a broken system when it&#x27;s absolutely clear that both sides will pick party of country, any day of the week.<p>If anything, the Trump administration has been the great stress-test of how things work in practice. Better to patch up the system now, than to wait for the next smarter and more cunning wannabe-dictator.')
