I decided to build it because I frequently heard complaints about how slow some of the more popular jigsaw apps are and how they are filled with annoying advertisements. So, over the course of many weekends and weeknights, I slowly developed this site with the helpful feedback I received from my family and friends.<p>The site is completely free to use. No advertisements, and no selling of user data. However, I do offer a paid tier for users that want more jigsaw puzzles, a harder difficulty mode, and a few other perks.<p>On the technical side, I&#x27;m using Svelte on the frontend with a tiny bit of wasm, and Rust for my backend API. I hope the site feels snappy, it&#x27;s one of the main reasons why I decided to build it.<p>There&#x27;s a demo puzzle linked on the home page for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to sign up! I&#x27;d recommend trying it on a computer or tablet as mobile is still a little rough around the edges :)<p>Happy to answer any questions about it!')
