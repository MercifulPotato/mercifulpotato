Item(by='djedr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611410682, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25878883, text='&gt; I often notice the precision with which he used language.<p>Indeed. Hard to find an inaccuracy, even when he&#x27;s talking about some details of technical subjects. He had an exceptional ability to translate between the spiritual and the technical in a way which seems to make complete sense.<p>&gt; Such a joy to listen to.<p>A true spiritual entertainer. Never boring. I imagine he could be a stand-up comedian today.<p>&gt; I especially like the chill-step YouTube videos some people assemble and publish. I download them with youtube-dl and listen to them on my phone at night while drifting off to sleep.<p>Similar, I went thru a lot of the material on youtube. High-quality material with transcripts can also be found here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.organism.earth&#x2F;library&#x2F;author&#x2F;alan-watts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.organism.earth&#x2F;library&#x2F;author&#x2F;alan-watts</a> \nA lot of it I listened to many times over and I keep getting new insights out of it, it&#x27;s so densely packed.<p>&gt; At 61 years of age, the philosophy he describes (Advaita Vedanta &#x2F; Zen Buddhism &#x2F; Taoism) brings me great comfort.<p>Definitely helps to know these philosophical perspectives, especially if one gets tangled up in some harmful model of reality.<p>Somehow the basic (non-religious, just philosophical) Taoism seems to most align with me at the moment. I credit the Dao for solving a very tough naming problem for me. ;)')
