I have friends in South America who would never move to Europe or US. It&#x27;s not that South America is better in some absolute way, but it is great at the things they value (including proximity to family).<p>I personally would never, ever leave the US for France (or pretty much anywhere in Europe). For all the problems we have in the US, it&#x27;s still one of the best places in the world for the things <i>I</i> value.<p>The author is clearly left-leaning, so it&#x27;s not entirely surprising he would prefer Europe. US liberals tend to want to implement many things that already exist in Europe (free X, free Y, subsidized Z, more vacations etc).')
