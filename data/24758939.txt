We do a ton of travelling to rural and touristy small towns, and the experience of renting from a super host blows hotels out of the water (and is usually cheaper, or at least similar in price).<p>Even if Airbnb goes under, there seems to be more than enough demand from both owners and travellers for VRBO or someone else to pick up.
