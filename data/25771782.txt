I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;d even be half that.<p>My guess is you thought those people were useless because you didn&#x27;t understand the role they played in the company.<p>However, I&#x27;ll admin again that I don&#x27;t have first hand experience. I&#x27;d genuinely love to hear from others who have experience with large companies.')
