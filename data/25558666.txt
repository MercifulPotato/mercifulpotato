Doing business, solving concrete problems, and building stuff?<p>I believe you can do a rigorous design&#x2F;architecture in theory. In practice, we cannot handle the complexity and uncertainty. Usually at some point you have a human as part of your system to close some feedback loop and then you are discussing fuzzy topics like psychology.<p>You use programming languages as examples and claim that Rust is &quot;closer to an optimum solution.&quot; Most of the other replies are about our inability to agree what that optimum should be. Rust certainly loses in terms of ecosystem maturity to C++, so it is further away from the optimum in that aspect and thus many people rationally decide not to use it.<p>I agree with you that design and architecture is a lot about intuition and gut feeling and should be more formal. However, we don&#x27;t have to time to wait for the formal theory. Foods needs to put on the tables, so income needs to be generated, so business needs to be done, so decisions with incomplete information and lacking formal theory must be made by biased humans. Unfortunately, the complex and wicked problems are usually the more important ones. If you pick C++ instead of Rust, the organization will probably survive anyways. If you pick the wrong technology or person it can kill a company.')
