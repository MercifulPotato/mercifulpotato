It&#x27;s also why you always unmute yourself when someone joins the call - yes, we can hear you, yes your mic is fine, no you&#x27;re not muted, it&#x27;s just no one is replying becuase they&#x27;re all muted and causedoing something else because we haven&#x27;t started yet.<p>It feels like people really haven&#x27;t put any thought into how to handle video conferences.')
