We (not Amazon...I don&#x27;t work there) also see users of our service who have sent &quot;STOP&quot; to our SMS number occasionally and then complain we never send them 2FA codes. If you can see the number those SMS used to come from you can try sending a &quot;START&quot; to it, or check to see if they have been blocked from sending to you.')
