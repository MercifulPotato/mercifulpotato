Don&#x27;t be snarky. Have curious conversation; don&#x27;t cross-examine. Please don&#x27;t fulminate. Please don&#x27;t sneer, including at the rest of the community.<p>&gt; Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.<p>&gt; When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. &quot;That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3&quot; can be shortened to &quot;1 + 1 is 2, not 3.&quot;<p>BTW, I don&#x27;t claim to follow the guidelines perfectly all the time, the reason I&#x27;m writing this comment is basically because I would have preferred if you managed to get your point across better.')
