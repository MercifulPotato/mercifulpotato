Item(by='shakna', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604109475, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947498, text='&gt; When I&#x27;m done yelling, I&#x27;m trying to sit quietly and meditate about this pain. What is it trying to tell me? Can I mentally follow the nerve from the location (referred pain or otherwise) to my brain and determine what the body wants me to know? Am I being told there&#x27;s danger?<p>For many chronic pain conditions this is a vital step, and that acceptance can be a huge boost, allowing you to get through a day.<p>Unfortunately for many of us... It isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m in pain now, chronic and debilitating, but there&#x27;s no known cause. There&#x27;s no message my body is trying to send other than the equivalent of every light on the dashboard turning on. Something is malfunctioning, so the body is misbehaving, and I&#x27;m in agony.<p>Every moment, of every day, for the last fifteen years, the pain is there are increasing. As you learn to tolerate the pain, the body learns to increase the signal because it thinks there&#x27;s something that needs to be addressed... But there&#x27;s not.<p>Sometimes... There&#x27;s simply no escape. And learning to live with that is a harder truth.')
