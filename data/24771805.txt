I want my small team to work on things that make us stand out. Running our own servers does not.<p>Vendor lock-in is not a big consideration for us. I increasingly think about cloud vendors like Operating systems. I really dont care which Linux distro we are on. Pick a vendor and run &#x27;natively&#x27; on it to go as fast as possible.<p>I&#x27;m happy paying AWS for maintaining the servers and getting out of that messy business. There are other concerns about serverless around observability and managability, but vendor lockin and cost is not part of my equation')
