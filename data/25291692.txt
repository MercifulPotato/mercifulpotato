Keeping some of my assets in Bitcoin keeps some of my assets out of the hands of governments and banks and will not be affected by devaluation. There&#x27;s no risk of a bail-in [0] for example.<p>I don&#x27;t invest all my assets in Bitcoin, currently perhaps 10% of my net worth. I do feel Bitcoin will rise to 100.000 USD in the next few years and possibly even 1.000.000 USD in 10+ years, my aim is to gain a total of at least 3 BTC or so in the next year. I just hope Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t rise too quick in value in that time period, since I can only afford to buy for maybe 1.000 USD per month.<p>I might sell a bit of my Bitcoin assets after my total Bitcoin asset value reach around 500.000 USD, since at that point I should be able to take things slow. At that point I would diversify a bit more into ETFs or stocks.<p>Perhaps this video [1] by Raoul Pal can give you some insight in my point of view, as I agree with him on most points.<p>---<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;nathanlewis&#x2F;2013&#x2F;05&#x2F;03&#x2F;the-cyprus-bank-bail-in-is-another-crony-bankster-scam&#x2F;?sh=e83ff8c26856" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;nathanlewis&#x2F;2013&#x2F;05&#x2F;03&#x2F;the-cypr...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qL2LfVRl3J0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qL2LfVRl3J0</a>')
