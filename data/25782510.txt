It’s not a stretch to interpret the wording of the license as requiring users of the SSPL’d software therefore to release the code for everything straight down to the bare metal<p>This seems to be an issue of people not being able to figure out what the license actually would imply if challenged in court.<p>I think this is a fair argument, at that point, even a full on proprietary license where you ha e to pay to use ElasticSearch and Kibanna might be seems as less risky by business lawyers.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not a lawyer, but this makes me wonder how is &quot;law&quot; supposed to handle scenarios like this? Is law at a point that even reading the license terms that you agree with isn&#x27;t good enough to know what you&#x27;re agreeing too?<p>Isn&#x27;t law supposed to be about agreeing to things ahead of time so there is no surprises? So what&#x27;s failing here?')
