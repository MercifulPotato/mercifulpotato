None of the examples have lists containing non-string objects, but the documentation doesn’t seem to draw a distinction between lists and dictionaries wrt what can be placed in them.<p>(Both lists and dictionaries are initially described as only containing strings, and later this description is expanded to include nesting; this counterintuitive arrangement may explain the confusion.)')
