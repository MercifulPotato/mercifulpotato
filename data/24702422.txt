Why don&#x27;t the p &amp; ap produced then pair up with and annihilate with other ap and p created in the vicinity such that it wouldn&#x27;t really be detectable over ordinary vacuum activity. This could happen both inside and outside the horizon. It seems like Hawking radiation (if I&#x27;ve understood correctly) could be produced but would be almost impossible to detect as it would all annihilate immediately?<p>What have I missed?')
