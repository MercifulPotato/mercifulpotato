I think not.<p>We already see this with existing simulations, though they are of much simpler objects than conscious beings.  If I simulate water sloshing in a bucket, it doesn&#x27;t matter how long the simulation runs, the results are the same.<p>Now, I may add in short cuts to make it closer to real time to support practical applications which leads to different results, but a slower machine running the same shortcuts will see the same differences.')
