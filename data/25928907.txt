Is there some chance that, for mental health, the ordering goes &quot;in-person interaction &gt; social media interaction &gt; no interaction at all&quot;?<p>In my experience, yes. When I was real life social isolated, stopping the online interactions was destructive each time I tried. (I tried couple of time till I realized that yes, it does count as interaction that I need.)')
