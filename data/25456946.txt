If I&#x27;m reading a blog about baldness and someone advertises some sort of hair transplant on the page that&#x27;s totally fine!<p>What I&#x27;m not cool on is an advertiser tracking this page, cataloguing me as someone that suffers from hair loss, fingerprinting my device to follow other pages I visit to further target me, then placing advertisements for herbal remedies for baldness on every single page I visit, then changing the advert based on machine learning about the most effective advert based on my other attributes (a single young male living in a city).<p>These two things are not the same.')
