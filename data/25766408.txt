In-arguably there is more content recently, and it is somewhat more discoverable.  But it has always been true that truly effective self directed learners exist but have been thin on the ground.<p>To abuse a quote from good will hunting (I think) - you could have got that education for $3 in library late fees.  Why don&#x27;t more people do this?  I think roughly the same problem is at work with MOOC and remote learning.  Clearly some people can get a lot out of it; clearly a lot don&#x27;t really.<p>I&#x27;ve taught inside and outside of universities; I suspect we still have a pretty poor understanding of what parts are working and why.<p>Some of the remote learning approaches I see now seem a bit of cargo-culting the existing system and then arguing about whether or not it is working.')
