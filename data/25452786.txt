The reason is in the name: It&#x27;s comedy rooted in some <i>situation</i>, so you can&#x27;t allow the situation that is the source of humor&#x2F;drama to ever resolve or the premise for your show ceases to exist.<p>This is why MASH was so long-running: The <i>situation</i> in question was The Korean War and the conflict between career military types and draftees who had hippie-like values and really didn&#x27;t want to be there. This allowed for a lot of swapping out of characters when things went sideways.<p>The TV show was based on the movie and over time Burns became increasingly toxic and crazy and they finally wrote him out of the show and replaced him with a character who could have some of the same inherent frictions with other characters without it being Flanderized into something really stupid and ugly and no longer actually funny.<p>I&#x27;ve long considered writing a blog about the moral bits in MASH and&#x2F;or other sitcoms. I sometimes think that might be a better outlet for my keen eye for social patterns than turning my baleful eye on actual people, which tends to be taken as extremely cutting. It&#x27;s sort of an &quot;occupational hazard&quot; as someone who spent too much time in therapy and sorting my own crap to be at all socially acceptable for small talk with most people.')
