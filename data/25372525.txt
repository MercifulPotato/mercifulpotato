The upshot of that choice is that I&#x27;m unlikely to switch to Deno until that&#x27;s changed (and I suspect that&#x27;s the case for many other companies as well).<p>I love the direction the node compatibility layer is going in though <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deno.land&#x2F;std@0.80.0&#x2F;node" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deno.land&#x2F;std@0.80.0&#x2F;node</a>, now I just wish it supported normal import statements from node_modules (not just require()).
