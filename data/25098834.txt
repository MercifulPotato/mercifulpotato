He got 73M votes, compared to 78 for Biden. That&#x27;s way more than Obama&#x27;s 69M, the previous record.<p>I loathe the big orange baby, but would he have lost if the pandemic had not hit? It seems a perfect storm just as much as his election four years ago.<p>Like many people, the author looks at some things Trump didn&#x27;t do or fucked up and says &quot;look, he&#x27;s just really bad at governmrnt&quot; and assumes that would translate into people not voting for him.<p>But that&#x27;s not how it works, it takes many, many years of that to convince people that someone is not worth governing after they vote for her&#x2F;him: people identify with their vote, and it takes a lot to get you to say &quot;well, I suck&quot;.')
