You talk about the need to maximize trust and stringent editorial guidelines are part of that. This is a story that even most conservative media didn&#x27;t want to touch because it was so fishy. Greenwald has always worn his bias on his sleeve and the article and editorial objections (both linked from this post) are pretty clear on that. His entire article is saying the media are covering a poorly-sourced and inconclusive story aggressively enough. His opinion is larded with weaselly statements about how there&#x27;s no evidence of wrongdoing but there could be. That&#x27;s terrible journalism and the editor knows it. Greenwald has absolutely always been like this. He&#x27;s the sensationalist and The Intercept was trying to keep him in line.')
