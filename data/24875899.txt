Most people love it.<p>The standard head strap is cheaper, with upgrade options available if it bugs you (obviously that kills the $300 price point, but for most people I think it&#x27;s fine). The controllers feel and perform the same as before, except now there&#x27;s a thumb rest that isn&#x27;t &quot;Oops I pushed the Oculus button.&quot;<p>For certain IPDs between the 3 positions, the new lens setup doesn&#x27;t work well, but the software apparently does understand more IPD steps and will position the displays properly if you carefully balance the lens position slide in between its spots where it locks.<p>The worst thing about it might be losing a sliver of peripheral vision at the sides, but from what I understand this only happens if you use it at the wide IPD setting <i>and</i> don&#x27;t use the glasses spacer. And even if you&#x27;re one of the people affected by that, the screen is still a good trade-off for the higher resolution and framerate.<p>EDIT - I should say that&#x27;s the worst thing about the hardware. The actual worst thing is the Facebook account.')
