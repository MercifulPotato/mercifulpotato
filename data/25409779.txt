It&#x27;s hospitalization rate means a wide spread will literally shut down hospitals in whole regions. At <i>current</i> infection rates we&#x27;re seeing hospitals being overwhelmed at regional levels.<p>Even if vaccines had been delivered after a Phase 1 trial of &quot;no one died immediately&quot; in the trial group, we wouldn&#x27;t have enough vaccinated people to avoid social mitigation. We&#x27;d be in a similar situation as we&#x27;re in right now.<p>It will take something like 75% of the population to be immune (by vaccine or previous infection) to have effective herd immunity. Even if vaccines had started distributing months ago it would still be a long time before we hit that 75%. Distributing vaccines after the phase 1 trials might ultimately get an immune population to that 75% sooner but it wouldn&#x27;t stop any of the damage happening until that number is reached.<p>Even if no one died from COVID the &quot;long hauler&quot; after effects can be crippling. Some 10-20% of COVID patients end up &quot;long haulers&quot;. If the virus were to spread to significant portions of the population because no one practiced social spread mitigation because they assumed the vaccine would fix everything you&#x27;re <i>still</i> in a terrible situation.')
