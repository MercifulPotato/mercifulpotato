Foreign media (as well as the Swedish media and politicians) has a tendency to point out Sweden as the perfect example of everything (until the pandemic, that is), but in reality it&#x27;s just another European country with a majority culture derived from Germanic bronze&#x2F;iron age tribes.<p>There are small differences, of course, but the <i>main</i> differences between living in Sweden, Denmark, or Finland is basically down to language differences (especially here in Finland) and different ways of managing  various administrative tasks. Norway is a bit of an outlier, but it&#x27;s not really _that_ different either.<p>I&#x27;ve never actually lived in Germany so I can&#x27;t tell how different it would be for you, but it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s any radical change in peoples&#x27; manners and culture if you walk from Flensburg to Padborg and the way I see it, it&#x27;s more of a cultural continuum stretching northwards, rather than a bunch of separate cultures.<p>If you want to live in the Nordics then go for it.
