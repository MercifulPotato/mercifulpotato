Well, I mean, I would be, if I still got on planes.<p>I own a nice pair of Sennheisers with active noise cancellation. They&#x27;re AMAZING on planes, or other noisy environments, but like any full-sized set of headphones they&#x27;re not something I&#x27;d wear moving around. Since COVID happened, mine have been on a shelf -- if I want headphones in the house, I just use my AirPods or the older set of wired Sennheisers semi-permanently set up next to the couch.<p>But yeah, I&#x27;m interested in these for the post-COVID world. One thing gave me a little pause, though, prior to Gruber&#x27;s piece, and that was my assumption that Apple wouldn&#x27;t make it possible to use these in a wired mode at all. My Senns CAN be used that way, and it makes a big difference on a long-haul flight. If you can use your own nice headphones with the seatback system, you&#x27;ll have a much nicer time, and I just assumed Apple wouldn&#x27;t do that.<p>I&#x27;m VERY pleased to see they allowed for that: &quot;You can use AirPods Max as wired headphones with a Lightning to 3.5 mm headphone jack cable&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s lots of stuff I like about my wireless ANC-equipped Sennheisers, but they don&#x27;t sound as good as the wired set by my couch. (I mean, no surprise; the older wired set is like $300, and the wireless ones were half that.) Additionally, the wireless ones have all the sorts of goofy interface bullshit and dodgy Bluetooth things going on that I associated with basically all non-Apple Bluetooth things.<p>I&#x27;d absolutely pay a premium to have wireless headphones that rival my fancy wired Sennheisers, include ANC, and operate seamlessly. That&#x27;d be a no-brainer.<p>But, as I said, only if travel actually becomes a thing again. ;)')
