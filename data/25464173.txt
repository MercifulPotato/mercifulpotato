The game is certainly buggy and many similar open world games have also been buggy on release.  However, a lot of the problems in Cyberpunk 2077 don&#x27;t appear to be bugs.  They appear to be active design decisions that were made as a shortcut on promised features.  Here is a Twitter thread with some examples of design decisions that might appear as bugs to an untrained eye.[1]<p>It seems like CDPR knew they had an unfinished game and couldn&#x27;t deliver it close to its release date.  Management decided to do whatever had to be done to release a game in time for Christmas.  This &quot;open world games are always buggy on release&quot; narrative plus some shady behavior surrounding how they handled reviews[2] allowed them to get largely great reviews and a huge influx of cash.  Hopefully that provides enough capital to justify a long term commitment to finishing this game because it is doesn&#x27;t appear to be a few bug fixes or performance improvements away from being the game that was promised.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jumpovertheage&#x2F;status&#x2F;1338929166301990914" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jumpovertheage&#x2F;status&#x2F;133892916630199091...</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;screenrant.com&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077-ps4-xbox-one-review-scores&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;screenrant.com&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077-ps4-xbox-one-review-sc...</a>')
