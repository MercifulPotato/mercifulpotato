As Java lacks specialisation, I don&#x27;t imagine there&#x27;s a way to do anything similar, short of having the library offer two very similar Steam APIs, one that permits throwing of checked exceptions and one that doesn&#x27;t.<p><i>edit</i> I suppose the standard library could offer a wrapper around the Stream API, to only accept non-throwing streams, and to return a <i>NonThrowingStream</i>. Internally this wrapper would presumably use the strategy adrianmsmith explained.')
