I know they returned it eventually, but not without complete uproar. It burned myself as a decade old (family) premium user though; I used to love them, but that complete disregard completely changed that.<p>Now, only a 3 month minimum (6 would help) completely free retrial would get me back. Thus far, none has been received.<p>(On the flip side I absolutely love YouTube Red or Premium or whatever they call it these days.)')
