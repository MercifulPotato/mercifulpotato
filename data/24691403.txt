I have a professor who missed winning the one for the expansion of the universe as he was the third or fourth author of the paper, and the committee caps the prize at 3.<p>He was the lead author of a different paper from the group which excited him more, and that&#x27;s what cost him a chance at the Nobel Prize, though he still got to visit Stockholm and the ceremony. It&#x27;s just in general a weird way to look at things, when teams are so big anymore.')
