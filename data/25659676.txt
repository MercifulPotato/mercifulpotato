A lot (low level) human labor will be made irrelevant, but AI tools will allow people to easily work productively at a higher level.  Musicians will be able to hum out templates of music, then iteratively refine the result using natural language and gestures.  Writers will be able to describe a plot, and iteratively refine the prose and writing style.  Movie producers will be able to describe scenes then iteratively refine the angles, lighting, acting, cuts, etc.  It will be a golden age for creativity, where there&#x27;s an abundance of any sort of art or entertainment you&#x27;d like to consume, and the only problem is locating it in the sea of abundance.<p>The only issue I see here is that government will need to take a hand in mitigating capitalistic wealth inequality, and access to creative tools will need to be subsidized for low income individuals (assuming we can&#x27;t bring the compute cost down a few orders of magnitude).')
