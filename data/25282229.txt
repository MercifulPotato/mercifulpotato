Sickle Cell Disease occurs when someone has two copies of the gene and having two copies goes bad places.<p>Maybe I am missing something and the plan here is to leave Sickle Cell trait alone and only subject people with Sickle Cell Disease to what amounts to genetic experimentation. I find that ethically questionable, but perhaps there are people who think that makes sense.<p>To me, fixing this means getting rid of the mutation. The mutation exists because it is protective. If you remove that protection without first removing the reason it exists, I find that also morally questionable. First, eradicate malaria from the region. Then eradicate the trait.<p>You could reduce incidence of the disease dramatically without coming up with Frankensteinian medical experiments by testing everyone for the trait as a condition of getting a marriage license and trying to get carriers to stop breeding with other carriers. It would be a social intervention, not a medical intervention, and it&#x27;s completely humane.<p>Of course it wouldn&#x27;t make headlines as being <i>ooh, shiny</i> new tech and some people would no doubt have a cow about it for some reason or other, like &quot;What right do you have to tell me whom I can love?&quot;<p>But as someone with a different homozygous recessive disorder (who also has a child with the same thing), that was more or less my policy after I was diagnosed and was getting a divorce. I didn&#x27;t wish to risk getting pregnant by a carrier again, so I did what I could to protect myself against that scenario.')
