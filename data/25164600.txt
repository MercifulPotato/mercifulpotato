Item(by='berkut', descendants=None, kids=[25164670, 25165696], score=None, time=1605904236, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25164451, text='Out of interest, how do you define &quot;works perfectly fine&quot;? :)<p>Obviously you&#x27;re saying &quot;for me&quot;, which I recognise, but from my experience playing around with Linux Mint, Kubuntu and Fedora on a Thinkpad T480S over the past year, while things work technically, getting them perfect (in my opinion) takes a lot longer, and might not even be possible in some cases.<p>Take for example suspend&#x2F;resume: yes, this works in terms of the machine waking up again, but things like the keyboard and screen brightness get reset (or are at least inconsistent) each time. Googling the problem, there are a lot of suggestions for hooking up scripts to run xbacklight to store &#x2F; reset it each time, and I did manage to get it almost working &quot;perfectly&quot;, but I&#x27;m not really sure why I should have to do this from a user&#x27;s perspective. It&#x27;s even more annoying in that at least in Linux Mint and Kubuntu&#x27;s case, controlling the screen brightness isn&#x27;t possible until you&#x27;ve logged in, so if you resume the laptop and the screen is dark, it&#x27;s actually sometimes difficult to verify what&#x27;s going on at the login screen.<p>Same goes for things like Dropbox - it doesn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s been woken up (maybe it&#x27;s a Dropbox issue not listening for events), so doesn&#x27;t resync - there are hacks to make a script to touch a file to trigger the refresh, and basically get it working, but again, why do I need to have to do this?<p>Even getting decent battery life involves (in my experience) tweaking things and running things like powertop to work out what system services are doing what, etc, etc.<p>Whilst I do agree it&#x27;s technically possible to get something I&#x27;d term &quot;good&quot; with Linux + Laptop, I&#x27;m not convinced the average consumer would be that happy with it compared to a Mac or a PC laptop.')
