Normality+some winter deaths does not make for a disaster. Yet we see posts here saying it&#x27;s too early to tell if Sweden is a COVID success or &quot;disaster&quot;. That looks like motivated reasoning: under what plausible scenario could Sweden end up a disaster for 2020 with these stats? There&#x27;d have to be an actual natural disaster for deaths to become high enough to be noticeable.')
