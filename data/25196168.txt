Whereas currently it takes an equal mining cost to reap an equal reward, proof-of-stake rewards those who already have enough to stake. This is essentially a recreation of the inflation system we have in the fiat world, where printed money first goes to the government, who can spend it at its current value, eventually having it entropy out to other users through spending, at reduced purchasing power. This makes the rich richer, and increases inequality of savings in the network.<p>So it&#x27;s not exactly the same refrigerator, so to speak.')
