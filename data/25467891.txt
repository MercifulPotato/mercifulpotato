What complex PR strategies could potentially be employed here by Apple and Facebook together?<p>I wonder if this ‘fight’ represents some sort of controlled opposition by Silicon Valley to win favorable regulation for the tech industry as a whole. By showing fake hostility&#x2F;rivalry between Apple and Facebook, they can carefully control the overall narrative, and although this story focuses on a negative issue (which, let&#x27;s be real, is not that much worse than the average person having already soured on Facebook), it could lead to premature, pro-corporate laws, rapidly lobbied for, and passed, through mostly tech illiterate senators (just look at all the senate hearings the past few years) [1].<p>To the average citizen, these new laws will seem like a transparent and proper attempt to address the problems in the tech&#x2F;adtech space, but in reality they are psuedo-solutions, as they do not tackle the underlying root causes. In the end it allows the tech corps to slightly adjust their products (small concessions in the short term), after which they will slowly repurpose the old mechanisms into new shells, and continue with business as usual.<p>I think a Prop22-inspired PR playbook is also in full motion here.<p>This is corporate gaslighting of citizens in it’s most advanced form.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=stXgn2iZAAY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=stXgn2iZAAY</a>')
