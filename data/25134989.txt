I don&#x27;t trust the television to present the truth.  Perhaps you also know, but &#x27;the science&#x27; also tells us there are more polar bears than ever.  I don&#x27;t really trust any of it.  Science, media, government - all are long-captured areas that have been bent to manage us for the benefit of those that own the corporations.<p>On your point about climate - do you really think that the climate should be the same, year after year?  I think there are fluctuations.  (I also think the weather we have is not entirely natural, but that&#x27;s a different story.)<p>On forest fires, these are in fact managed environments.  If you don&#x27;t let the fires burn naturally, and allow matter to build up, eventually you will have a massive conflagration.   You can just de-fund the organisations that actively managed those environments, to prepare a fire event.<p>Additionally, it really doesn&#x27;t take much to create a fire - just someone to start one - ie this doesn&#x27;t need to be a natural event.  In fact, there were lots of people that were arrested for starting fires on purpose.  Bizarrely, lots of them were released!  (At least that was the case in Aus.)<p>You might say &#x27;why would they do that?&#x27;  Well, my view is that those who govern us want to usher in a technocratic control system, and they need us to accept this.  If they say they are going to save us from climate change and killing the world, the psychology is such that most people would willingly sign up.  They teach us about climate change in schools, so everyone is on board.')
