Elastic could have grown (or not) organically with closed source software but that&#x27;s hard without community help and being able to hire top developers to build your product. FOSS seems like a great way to market&#x2F;PR your name out there because <i>free is popular</i>. I compare this, perhaps not perfect analogy, to Uber. Offer cheap rides, gain popularity while burning investor cash and wipe out existing industry&#x2F;competition. Then, investors complain they can&#x27;t monetize it. No shit! In the case of Elastic, the rest of the world benefited from it atleast.')
