I would talk to people, have my mind wander a bit then have to guess what they just said. 99% of the time I was really good at guessing, but it led to some awkward situations.<p>In my case, it turned out to be undiagnosed ADHD. In fact, &quot;Do you have trouble focusing on conversations you&#x27;re having?&quot; is one of the regular screening questions psychologists use for it.<p>When my therapist first suggested I might have ADHD, I actually didn&#x27;t believe her. It took a bunch of reading about ADHD to change my mind; in hindsight, my understanding of ADHD—based on popular culture—was pretty far from reality. Doing a bit of research and reading about ADHD <i>from the perspective of people who had it</i> (as opposed to the perspective of, say, teachers dealing with ADHD students) really helped. I found <i>Driven to Distraction</i>[1] a particularly good overview, with a lot of insights and stories that resonated with me 100%.<p>Since getting diagnosed, things have gotten much better. Just <i>knowing</i> about it was a real relief and let me start building habits to deal with it more effectively. Later on, stimulants and meditation have both helped even more.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;Driven-Distraction-Revised-Recognizing-Attention&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0307743152&#x2F;ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=driven+to+distraction&amp;qid=1604850669&amp;sr=8-3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;Driven-Distraction-Revised-Recogniz...</a>')
