I now feel like digging in might be productive here.<p>&gt; You&#x27;ve made claims like &quot;this is Germany+&quot; without actually supporting that claim.<p>I wasn&#x27;t like, making a legal statement or whatever. You&#x27;re arguing &quot;this is communism with extra steps&quot; and my point generally is that these prescriptions largely exist in democratically socialist, productive, EU countries. There are actually not that many communist countries that aren&#x27;t also authoritarian so, I don&#x27;t think the &quot;communist&quot; characterization is super useful. But, either way I&#x27;ll expound.<p>- Enshrine the right to organize<p>You wrote that the NLRA already created this &quot;right&quot;, but it&#x27;s been hobbled by the Taft-Hartley act [1] and subsequent legislation in multiple states [2].<p>On the other hand, Germany (like many other EU countries but unlike the US) has ratified the &quot;Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention&quot;, which, well it&#x27;s in the name [3].<p>- Require equal profit sharing across all employees<p>Profit sharing is pretty common across EU countries, but it takes different forms and certainly isn&#x27;t equal. The coop corporate structure is closer to my thinking here but, admittedly it&#x27;s not mainstream yet.<p>- Require significant worker representation on corporate boards<p>We covered this one but, yeah generally the idea here is for workers to have a big say in how their company is run. Definitely not the majority though; my personal preference would be that there were no majority and representation would be equally divided between workers, c-suite&#x2F;owners, and shareholders, but baby steps.<p>- Heavily tax relatively high salaries, e.g. if everyone makes $1m then 0 tax. If one person makes $100k and 99 others make $1, insane super tax them down to $100 (include tricky stuff like bonuses or whatever)<p>High CEO pay is (variously) subject to tax penalties in Germany [4] [5]. And it seems to be working; their ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay is 136x, just over half the US&#x27; at 265x [6]. That&#x27;s not wonderful and I&#x27;m sure there are other factors but, these problems are tricky and one policy probably won&#x27;t fix it all in one fell swoop.<p>It&#x27;s also worth saying CEO pay is generally bad and not meritocratic [7].<p>- Heavily tax nationally high salaries with a progressive income tax<p>Germany&#x27;s 3rd tax bracket is higher than anything in the US and kicks in around $69k (USD) [8].<p>- Heavily punish tax dodging<p>Germany does this a little [9] [10] but, obviously not enough. Re: simplify the US tax code, no administration since Reagan has done this, for reasons outlined here [11] [12]. TLDR tax prep is big business, and--like I said before--our tax code does a lot, and changing it creates winners and losers.<p>- Set the minimum wage to a living wage and pin it to the CPI<p>Germany has a comparatively high minimum wage of â‚¬9.35 ($11.33), but I don&#x27;t know enough to say if that&#x27;s a living wage or not. Something that&#x27;s nice about their (relatively new, 2015) law is they have to update it at least every 2 years [13].<p>- Abolish &quot;right to work&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been wrong about what this is called my whole life. Apparently what I mean is &quot;at-will employment&quot;. Mea culpa. But, still the US has it and Germany doesn&#x27;t. We should get rid of it.<p>---<p>OK that&#x27;s my prescriptions. I do feel like what I&#x27;ve described is the natural evolution of democratic socialist policies in the EU, exemplified not just by Germany but other big EU countries as well and definitely don&#x27;t qualify as communism. But I think a lot of people think democratic socialism is communism so, maybe we just have a definitions problem.<p>I&#x27;ll quickly respond to your minimum wage point and say that you can peg minimum wage to a State&#x27;s CPI, and cities can create their own minimum wages. New York&#x2F;New York City do this, for example. I wouldn&#x27;t say that States are handling this well; 1 in 4 kids grows up in poverty so, something is off.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Taft%E2%80%93Hartley_Act" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Taft%E2%80%93Hartley_Act</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Right-to-work_law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Right-to-work_law</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Right_to_Organise_and_Collective_Bargaining_Convention,_1949" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Right_to_Organise_and_Collecti...</a><p>[4]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.firma.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;company-formation&#x2F;ceo-salary-in-a-gmbh-how-much-is-a-gmbh-ceo-allowed-to-earn&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.firma.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;company-formation&#x2F;ceo-salary-in-a-gm...</a><p>[5]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s11573-020-00978-y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s11573-020-00978-y</a><p>[6]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;424159&#x2F;pay-gap-between-ceos-and-average-workers-in-world-by-country" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;424159&#x2F;pay-gap-between-c...</a><p>[7]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epi.org&#x2F;publication&#x2F;reining-in-ceo-compensation-and-curbing-the-rise-of-inequality&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epi.org&#x2F;publication&#x2F;reining-in-ceo-compensation-...</a><p>[8]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taxsummaries.pwc.com&#x2F;germany&#x2F;individual&#x2F;taxes-on-personal-income" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taxsummaries.pwc.com&#x2F;germany&#x2F;individual&#x2F;taxes-on-per...</a><p>[9]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;ubs-group-face-93m-penalty-115611282.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;ubs-group-face-93m-penalty-11...</a><p>[10]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.espn.com&#x2F;soccer&#x2F;news&#x2F;story&#x2F;_&#x2F;id&#x2F;1613004&#x2F;bayern-munich-ceo-karl-heinz-rummenigge-accepts-fine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.espn.com&#x2F;soccer&#x2F;news&#x2F;story&#x2F;_&#x2F;id&#x2F;1613004&#x2F;bayern-m...</a><p>[11]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taxpolicycenter.org&#x2F;briefing-book&#x2F;why-are-taxes-so-complicated" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taxpolicycenter.org&#x2F;briefing-book&#x2F;why-are-taxes-...</a><p>[12]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;4&#x2F;13&#x2F;11417676&#x2F;elizabeth-warren-tax-return-free-filing-tax-day-intuit-hr-block-turbotax-automatic-simple" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;4&#x2F;13&#x2F;11417676&#x2F;elizabeth-warren-tax-...</a><p>[13]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Minimum_wage_in_Germany" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Minimum_wage_in_Germany</a>')
