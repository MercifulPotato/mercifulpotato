I have no idea where their generics come from, I doubt they manufacture themselves, so before the CostCo markup they are subject to the same inflated prices you&#x27;ll find anywhere else before the pill reaches the drugstore or your doctor or whatever.<p>What I&#x27;ve been imagining, specifically, is generics manufacturer that applied a fixed profit margin — &quot;cost plus&quot; — to their products. I guess that&#x27;s not precisely the CostCo model, but you get my drift now.')
