Item(by='ascotan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611002123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25823907, text='I have seen that a lot of people that now have &quot;software engineering&quot; titles that are not doing &quot;engineering of software&quot;. They&#x27;re doing network&#x2F;platform management or some other task that doesn&#x27;t involve the actual design and architecture of software systems. ie. it&#x27;s more of a payscale for HR than an actual discipline<p>Engineers should be able to understand design principles and be able to architect a new system from those principles. In today&#x27;s world i think we are moving further away from this than closer. We spend much of our time learning trivia such as how to fiddle with a particular software platform to get it to work.<p>Additionally with all the various abstractions that we have built (lock-in cloud services, high level languages, proprietary platforms, etc) many people are no longer capable of discussing with you what is happening on the CPU or how data should flow through a system or the disadvantages of a distributed architecture, etc.<p>I think that software engineering is still in it&#x27;s infancy in someways and hasn&#x27;t yet matured enough to be an engineering discipline. That being said there is an egalitarian quality about being a &quot;software engineer&quot;. We&#x27;re all software engineers.')
