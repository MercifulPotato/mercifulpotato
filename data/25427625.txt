They are promised assistance with applying to jobs as well which can be a nerve wrecking process for a university grad. If you have the money and want to jump into the work force ASAP it makes sense to me.<p>The in person bootcamps ive found have had great community vibes to them. Fun being surrounded by fellow students&#x2F;teachers, schools all have fun&#x2F;studious&#x2F;interesting faculty and students.<p>I taught the first few weeks of a FREE intro to software engineering bootcamp and had a few lower tier university CS grads who were happy with the curriculum&#x2F;services rendered, they would just tune me out when i was covering something they already knew and would study&#x2F;program while the less informed students would work through problems&#x2F;Q&#x2F;A with me.')
