But the answer is an elephant-in-the room kind of thing so I think it needs to be said:<p>The reason is that the overlap between &quot;extremism&quot; and our (now) minority political party is so large as to have muddled the distinction.  Per one poll, 45% of Trump voters approve of the sacking of the capitol.  It&#x27;s really not possible to distinguish people who merely post angry political speech and the ones who stray into extremist rhetoric about revolution and violence.  The same people are doing all of it.<p>So right now, &quot;moderating communities with extreme content&quot; simply looks a lot like &quot;censoring republicans&quot;.  But... I don&#x27;t see how that gets better by outlawing the moderation.  Republicans need to fix their rhetoric first.')
