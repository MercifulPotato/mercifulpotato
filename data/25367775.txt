Item(by='glenstein', descendants=None, kids=[25369526], score=None, time=1607560307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25367272, text='&gt;Don’t put words in my mouth. I’m not saying this one instance proves the whole election is fraud.<p>You&#x27;re not saying it, you&#x27;re just implying it by speaking in a way that leaves open-ended implications that you aren&#x27;t qualifying with concrete statements. You&#x27;re putting an isolated example into a broader category, &quot;things like this&quot;, to suggest it&#x27;s not the only one, and to invite people to believe there are more.<p>If you really do agree with everyone that the scope, scale and significance of the facts presented in the article are extremely narrow, are isolated, and that there aren&#x27;t similar examples, and are choosing to ignore that most important fact to emphasize a less important fact than I&#x27;m not so much interested in your point as I am in why you would choose to emphasize facts in that way.<p>And nothing about the articles suggest anything one way or the other about media bias. The articles could presuambly be used to argue somethingorother about the scale of human error in vote counting in Georgia. That would be valid. But they don&#x27;t have anything to do with any conclusions you are trying to advance about what the media is or isn&#x27;t &quot;being honest&quot; (again an extremely vague, unprovable claim that you aren&#x27;t quantifying).')
