Libbrecht is chair of the physics department at Caltech and has had a life long passion for snowflakes from his early days in North Dakota. He now studies snowflake formation in his lab. I read it cover to cover and cannot recommend it enough. The book dives into the science of snowflake formation. You can find the book for $4 at Abebooks.')
