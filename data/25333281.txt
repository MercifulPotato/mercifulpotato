Possibly I just need to spend more time with one to learn it. They&#x27;re super fast at boiling water, yes, but whenever I&#x27;ve frying stuff it seems extremely picky about alignment and eventually starts beeping at me and shutting off. I also had lots of difficulty picking a perfect power level, which is trivial with gas. The granularity in the digital controls seems too poor, or it has something to do with the thermostat not having direct contact like it does in an old electric stove?<p>The biggest issue though is every IH stove I&#x27;ve used has had touch controls on the top glass panel which means if you have any spills or overflow, you can&#x27;t even turn it off.')
