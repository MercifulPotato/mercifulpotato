Item(by='lliamander', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603757642, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24900352, text='GPA seems much more likely to be entangled with various aspects of privilege than SAT.<p>For instance, I attended a HS where GPA was graded on a 4.0 scale, even for advanced placement and college credit classes.  The consequence is that you had a bunch of &quot;Valedictorians&quot; with perfect GPAs that attended spitwad classes.<p>Other schools I&#x27;ve seen grade on a 5.0 (or even a 6.0 I believe) system, to differentiate.<p>I would also suspect that GPA is more easily influenced by parental involvement than SAT (or just a plain IQ test).')
