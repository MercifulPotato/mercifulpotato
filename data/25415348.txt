Crops are not lost due to uncontrollable events and a lot of savings in chemicals to protect them from bugs<p>- Saving the cost of SCM (transport and intermediaries) which is sometimes much bigger than producing. In farming is actually almost always the case, to my knowledge<p>- 365 days a year of efficient production<p>- Good for the environment to save so much in transport<p>- Independence from other countries. Very important for small ones like Denmark that wouldn&#x27;t have alternative to planting on their own soil.<p>To be honest, the only con I see is that this perfectly automated gardens produce much less tasty food because they are given the exact amount of water and minerals needed to generate the product, but the real soil somehow must add a lot of flavor, even if it&#x27;s not relevant to produce the fruit, because I really feel a big difference of taste between hydroponic food and classic farming.')
