More channels increases throughput, but doesn&#x27;t improve latency.<p>The M1&#x27;s memory bandwidth is ~68GB&#x2F;s, which is of course a tiny fraction of AMD Epyc&#x27;s ~200GB&#x2F;s per socket.<p>Epyc&#x27;s latency isn&#x27;t even competitive with AMD&#x27;s own consumer parts, so I&#x27;m really not sure why you&#x27;re surprised that Epyc&#x27;s latency is also worse than the M1&#x27;s?')
