No one is (rationally) suggesting that Rust will replace every language.<p>The tone of your post, however, makes it sound as though you have something against Rust, and that you&#x27;re more interested in pointing out all the things it&#x27;s not good at, or shouldn&#x27;t be used for, rather than contributing to a constructive discussion.<p>&gt; I also pointed out that Rust has to win the mindshare of C++ programmers first, before even reaching other ecosystems<p>Not entirely true; Rust is an alternative to C++, but it&#x27;s vastly more accessible to people who&#x27;ve used other languages like Java, Python, Ruby, and so on, where you get types, OO, and memory safety. Instead of simply resulting in a 1:1 replacement of C++ with Rust, it may result in a minimal reduction in C++ programming and a notable increase in Rust programming which would have been done in another safe OO language instead, but at dramatically worse performance.')
