Well worth a visit for the F-14 alone, it&#x27;s an awesome sight, but they&#x27;ve also got loads of other great aircraft and knowledgeable staff to help provide insight.<p>If you&#x27;re a flight and space geek like me, you&#x27;ll spend a day or two at KSC and then a full day at the warbird museum. Whenever I find myself in Florida I try to make my way out there, can&#x27;t recommend it enough!<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.valiantaircommand.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.valiantaircommand.com&#x2F;</a>')
