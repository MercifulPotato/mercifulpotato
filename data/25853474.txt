They are a development house, somewhat similar to say, ThoughtWorks.  But, they spend a lot of time with new hires, many straight from university, training them.  Not just technically, but &quot;US business speak&#x2F;culture&quot;, helping them with the CV that&#x27;s presented to potential clients, understanding schtick-of-the-day stuff like &quot;Scaled Agile&quot; and so on.  And client-specific training, like how to speak FinTech, Insurance, Airline, or whatever.')
