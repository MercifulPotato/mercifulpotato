I&#x27;m honestly not sure why either Rust or C++ bothered with regexps for this problem.<p>(If you compile and run this code in a random directory it&#x27;s going to segfault, because it&#x27;s potato code and I&#x27;m not handling the &quot;no text files at all&quot; case. But it&#x27;s p. fast counting all the words in all the text files that ship with Rust&#x27;s `ring` library!)<p>Anyways, you get the gist of what this looks like in C now. Obviously, don&#x27;t write things like this in C.')
