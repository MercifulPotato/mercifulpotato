Item(by='unit_circle', descendants=None, kids=[25840762, 25841773], score=None, time=1611098514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25839691, text='I live in a city and also own a converted van. The van typically has little of value inside it unless I am traveling. This van has an aftermarket alarm. I had this alarm installed after a nasty break-in in Vancouver BC which reminded me never to leave nice things in a vehicle. It makes some noise itself, but also comes with a fob and app that both also make noise. It has served me on at least one occasion where someone opened a door to nose around. I was alerted and ran outside to check on the vehicle but they had taken off. This alarm also caused someone who was walking their dog to walk over to investigate, though the potential thief took off even before they got there.<p>They could have taken my registration papers or the cheap &#x2F; second hand cookware, stove etc. Which would have been a pain and cost not a lot, but some money to replace. I don&#x27;t have room in my apartment for all of these items, so I rely on the alarm to keep my things safe. Especially when I am out of town without my van.<p>The article does mention valuables as a special case, but I would like to highlight this case and argue that these &quot;valuables&quot; are part and parcel to the function of this vehicle and that it&#x27;s not practical for me to remove them, making the alarm essential to the vehicle&#x27;s operation.<p>However, I do agree with the sentiment that most shock&#x2F;vibration&#x2F;etc. Sensors should not trigger an audible alarm. The only really useful trigger is a door opening. I&#x27;m not sure this is necessarily true, but is definitely true of the aftermarket alarm options on the market when I wash shopping for an alarm.<p>I&#x27;ll also add as a final note that the police (both in Vancouver and where I live) will simply not help you recover stolen property and are 100% useless as far as property crime goes. They are either too busy or too apathetic. For items like what I have in my van it is of course not really worth their time, but I&#x27;ve also had a motorcycle stolen _which was driving around with my plates for over a year before it was *crashed*_. As a citizen I am definitely on my own with this stuff which is a good lesson to learn while you have insurance.')
