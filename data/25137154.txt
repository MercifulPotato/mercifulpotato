I put a 4k youtube video playing and kept using the macbook, after 30 minutes the % was still the same. I tried some online cpu benchmarks that were supposed to put pressure on the cpu at 100% (activity monitor showed something like that) and running one of them for around 5-6 minutes ate around 3% of battery.<p>Keyboard is a change from my mbp 15, it will take some time to get used to it.<p>The most amazing thing, and I was using it side by side with the mbp 15 (i9 16Gb) is the M1 one (8gb) is so much snappier in Safari and opening apps. It really brings the &#x27;joy&#x27; of iphone with the snappiness that things just move&#x2F;show.<p>I still haven&#x27;t tried a lot of Rosetta or non-arm stuff so no idea there.')
