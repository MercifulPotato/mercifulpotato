Broadly speaking I agree, but you have to be pragmatic about that. There exist some accepted conventions it&#x27;s just senseless to break just to make a point, for example, if you are defining a ring, making + distributive over \\* rather than the opposite as is usual is not inherently wrong, but I would classify that as bad notation.<p>Similarly in OOP, you could technically name getters in any way you want, but why would you not conform to the accepted &quot;getValue()&quot; standard?<p>Of course fooling yourself into thinking you have achieved things you actually haven&#x27;t by clever usage of natural language is the opposite end of the spectrum, and it&#x27;s exactly what I was ranting against.<p>I guess &quot;skepticism&quot; is the correct word, indeed.')
