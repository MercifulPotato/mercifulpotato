I&#x27;m no malware author, but I can imagine secrecy is key until you have a final version.<p>&gt; And Cimpanu is surprised that the package is leaner, something that happens quite often when the author of a specific malware package decides to narrow his&#x2F;her field of operations.<p>What gives you the idea that it&#x27;s obvious that the field of operations is leaner? Seems like the malware does more now, so yes, being smaller is a surprise.<p>&gt; ...claims that Apache is included by default in many Linux distributions. That is not the case; Linux distro installers have software separated into groups and unless one picks a particular group of packages to be installed, it will not be on your machine.<p>Actually, that&#x27;s wrong. Apache <i>is</i> included by default on most <i>server</i> distros, which this malware likely targets.<p>&gt; I have been running Debian... for the last 20 years and Apache is not on my workstation...<p>Debian isn&#x27;t a commonly-used server OS. Most people use Ubuntu or CentOS.<p>&gt; Linux is far from being a secure OS...<p>This one is complicated. When people talk about &quot;Linux&quot; they rarely specify if they mean the kernel, or the whole ecosystem. Linux the <i>kernel</i> has a reputation for being secure, but often distros are not, even out of the box.')
