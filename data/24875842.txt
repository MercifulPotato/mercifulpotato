You have a reactor that can produce heat enough to generate 1GW continuous power, so it stores that heat for six hours a day during peak solar generation, then generates 2GW for six hours to cover peak demand in the evening, then generates 1GW directly for twelve hours overnight. It&#x27;s generating 1GW worth of heat at all times, you&#x27;re just converting the heat to electricity at different times of the day.')
