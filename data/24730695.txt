Something like PSNR or SSIM. A &quot;deepfake&quot; is likely to score low on such a score that doesn&#x27;t depend on high level visual perception.<p>Also know that you can &quot;deepfake&quot; yourself using a traditional video encoder, just change the keyframe to someone else&#x27;s face. Of course, it will look broken and totally unconvincing but because of motion compensation, you can sort of map the movement of your face on someone else&#x27;s face.<p>The technique in the paper simply has way better motion compensation, so good that it still works if you change the keyframe. Traditional video compression algorithms don&#x27;t work like that because they are not just for talking faces and can&#x27;t use such advanced techniques for performance and ease of implementation reasons.')
