My usual routine is to open the fuel hatch, check for card skimmers, swipe my card, punch in my phone number for the loyalty program (if I&#x27;m at my usual gas station), punch in my ZIP, grab the nozzle, select a grade, stick the nozzle in the hole, set the trigger on the lower speed, head into the store, buy beer, put the beer in the car, wait for the pump to finish (if somehow it hasn&#x27;t), put the nozzle back, close the fuel hatch, and drive off on my merry way.<p>This all seems to be pretty normal where I&#x27;m from.')
