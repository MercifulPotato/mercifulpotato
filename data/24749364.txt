But, I&#x27;m very incredulous of arguments stating this isn&#x27;t considered by companies that are large enough for employee activism to matter-matter.<p>CB essentially tried the usually avoided approach. It said it wouldn&#x27;t support this stuff by implication (would stay &quot;only mission focused) and gave healthy severance packages to those who wanted to leave. 5% of employees left, and the makeup of the 5% reflected that of the overall workforce. I have to think other companies paid attention to this outcome, although I wonder what internal polling and the like led to CB doing it.')
