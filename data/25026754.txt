Understand them and implement correctly. Stackoverflow is not a magic library you should take books from without understanding.<p>&gt; Imagine finding a solution on Stackoverflow and just being able to import foo from stackoverflow&#x2F;a&#x2F;12345, and when the community finds a better way to do it, your software is automatically using the new version!<p>Wow, I&#x27;ve just imagined it. Props for the great horror story, but... it&#x27;s a security nightmare. You basically surrender all control over your project for almost nothing.<p>&gt; The second advantage is that it&#x27;s basically built-in refactoring: Code from these micropackages will not litter your code, there is a clean separation between what is your business logic vs where you just need some generic functionality.<p>Writing this utility in a separate code unit (namespace, project, whatever) gives exactly the same advantage.\nAnd micropackages will litter my building process &#x2F; dependency tree.')
