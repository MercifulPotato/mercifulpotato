Maybe they have others that are hidden for now, like you said?<p>I don&#x27;t think they need more than a few IP addresses since most of their hardware could sit on a private network with only a single load balancer visible from the Internet. Also, a small ASN doesn&#x27;t really need IPv6 compatibility to function, and won&#x27;t for many years to come.<p>Since they&#x27;re still using Cloudflare, it looks like multiple layers of defense. When Cloudflare eventually bans them, people will realize that it was only pointing to their own ASN and no one knows which datacenter it&#x27;s in. The single peer with HE doesn&#x27;t actually mean they&#x27;re in an HE datacenter.')
