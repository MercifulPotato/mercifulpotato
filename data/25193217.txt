To some that means a server I control that has a simple file share configuration. To others that means Google Drive. In the case of the former just mount the storage securely on the pi and save &quot;locally&quot; to it. Could be as simple as mounting the remote server via sshfs and selecting that mount directory to save the file.<p>In the case of the latter usually a similar concept but depends on the service&#x2F;protocol.')
