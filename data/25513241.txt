Old things don&#x27;t get us excited.  Do you understand ML, Deep Learning?  Deep dive into it, not just in using the library but being able to go low level, that will excite you.  I only get that feeling when I learn something really new, then it quickly goes away.<p>I get that when I read deeply technical stuff that&#x27;s at my level or above my level.  So it just means you&#x27;re not challenging yourself well enough.  It&#x27;s easy to make really good money in this industry operating below your capacity.    That&#x27;s the problem, challenging yourself a lot will not necessary make you more money unless you really go to a FAANG.   So why bother especially as we have now gotten older, with more responsibilities.')
