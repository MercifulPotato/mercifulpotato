I had a peek at some of the papers and did a quick search on the topic, but everything is so covered in hype it&#x27;s difficult to get a grasp what&#x27;s actually going on.<p>My quick impression is that it&#x27;s something similar to &quot;embeddings&quot;, where some features (e.g. words) are mapped to some high-dimensional vector space and computations are done in that space. What those computations are seem to vary quite a bit from paper to paper.')
