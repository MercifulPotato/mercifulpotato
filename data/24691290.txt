You put real work into a project and deserve some proper feedback not a single sentence that was mostly about me.  Give me a moment and I will try some real feedback.<p>Ok - Some notes.<p>1. Blogs are a very good source of evergreen SEO especially if you focus on the keywords that work for you.  So please make sure you do weekly or more posts on a blog that only has one every 1.5 months so far.  I suggest you Make a commitment to yourself to do say 1 a week for the next year.  Blogs that look given up are as negative an indicator as a git repo with last updates in 2016.<p>(cf Rand Fishkin - there was a really good microconf episode on this. His new startup might help you find likely wiki owners,  it i suggest just listening for the mindset !)<p>2. English is not your first language - this can be a hinderance or an advantage.  You can probably find someone to brush up the text - but I suggest that you aim for also having a look at near-English markets - India being an interesting example - a Hindi landing page might make an interesting SEO tactic, yet still allow you to expect many readers can bounce into the English blog.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.news18.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;tech&#x2F;microsoft-teams-sees-significant-usage-growth-among-indian-users-during-covid-19-crisis-2678493.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.news18.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;tech&#x2F;microsoft-teams-sees-signif...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;etr.plus&#x2F;articles&#x2F;no-slack-by-teams" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;etr.plus&#x2F;articles&#x2F;no-slack-by-teams</a><p>3. I honestly don&#x27;t know your product market fit.  Till now Teams always seemed a bit also ran, but they do seem to have real growth- and if you have some paying customers happy to put blurb on your site you are doing something right :-)<p>Good luck - keep the faith :-)')
