Comprehensive public housing doesn&#x27;t exist. There are no construction sites, there is no program, there is no money, there is no will. It&#x27;s just talk. The <i>only</i> time it has a real impact on anyone&#x27;s housing situation is when it&#x27;s the reason to block a private development and maintain status quo.<p>Comprehensive public transit doesn&#x27;t exist. The agency is in year 5 of 10 for community consultations about adding 1.5 more miles of joke to the pile of jokes. We know how fast it can expand and what it costs. Becoming remotely as useful as TNCs or scooters or whatever would take 3 generations to build and consume the entire productive capacity of 5. Everyone knows this, which is why no one is seriously trying. The realest that the proposal will ever be is when it is listed as the rationale for blocking scooters&#x2F;TNCs&#x2F;whatever.<p>Credibility on the right way to solve a problem is earned through progress. The &quot;real solution&quot; people will say they don&#x27;t have the capital needed to make progress. Well, part of being a real solution is having a workable funding story. If the opposition is reliably defeating attempts to fund it, there you go. Not a real solution.')
