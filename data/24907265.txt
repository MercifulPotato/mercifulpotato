Here is a YouTube video of a Greek person going through the alphabet, linked to μ. [1]<p>However, in English this was never used, at least not recently, and its not a &quot;mathematicians&quot; thing. English pronunciation of Greek letters was fixed around the 16th century (see [2] for a tiny bit of history) and was an attempt to use the classical Greek pronunciations, though probably not a very successful one.<p>If you&#x27;re going to complain about μ, then hopefully you also complain about π, which in modern Greek is pronounced like &quot;pee,&quot; not &quot;pie,&quot; and so would make π-day very different...<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;P85PXR6deIw?t=214" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;P85PXR6deIw?t=214</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pronunciation_of_Ancient_Greek_in_teaching#England" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pronunciation_of_Ancient_Greek...</a>')
