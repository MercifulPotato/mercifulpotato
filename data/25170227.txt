It&#x27;s used a lot in many places and many discussions, but just focus calling out the bad.  It isn&#x27;t his responsibility to ensure that some person building off his work at some point in the future does the appropriate level of research appropriate for their project.  Assuming that an action is bad because you think someday down the road it might lead someone else to do something and that that something will be a bad thing is just ridiculous.')
