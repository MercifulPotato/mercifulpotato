The driver doesn&#x27;t get to set the price, and there are downsides to declining the fare. Additionally there is no relationship established between the driver and the rider. The carriage contract is between Uber&#x2F;Lyft and the rider. The platform is then hiring the driver to fulfill their end of the contract. The driver and rider have no ability to form future contracts, unless they break the terms of service and exchange information during the ride. The business models could be tweaked to accommodate proper contractor relationships, but then Uber wouldn&#x27;t be able to achieve their goal, which is monopoly control over public transit.')
