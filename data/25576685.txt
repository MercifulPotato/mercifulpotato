Item(by='arminiusreturns', descendants=None, kids=[25577950, 25577002], score=None, time=1609286668, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25576159, text='My countries government should understand the implications of the policies it impliments, including the impact on people in other countries, but my governments first concern shouldn&#x27;t be those other peoples, it should be it&#x27;s own citizens! For those who seriously try to understand this topic, the implication you aren&#x27;t talking about (and a myriad more) is that due to this we can expect the first world standards&#x2F;wealth to <i>decrease</i> in response. Of course there are those who then respond &quot;good! about time!&quot; or some equivalent, but I digress.<p>The mental gymanstics I see being performed in comments here boggles the mind, but I am thankful at least to have a refresher on all the kinds of responses I need to be prepared to rebute. Lets restate them as prereq for responding to them: (on globalism)<p>It increases the wealth of poor people in other countries<p>It offers more employment opportunities for said people<p>It increases the wealth of the third world in general<p>It&#x27;s not globalism, it&#x27;s the companies who participate in it and aren&#x27;t heald accountable.<p>You had a &quot;protectionist&quot; president and how did that work out?<p>It&#x27;s not globalisms fault, it&#x27;s capitalisms fault.<p>Globalism as a term is a &quot;racist dog whistle&quot; and an &quot;antisemitic conspiratorial buzzword&quot;<p>So far, none of these are particularly well thought out or presented, and suffer obvious weaknesses. I&#x27;m not sure if I feel like taking the time currently to dissect them each right now, but they will go in the todo list.')
