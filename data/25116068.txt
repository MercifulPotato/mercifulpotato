On Google, you can tell it&#x27;s an ad (even if this is getting harder as Google disguises ads more and more).<p>2: Grubhub didn&#x27;t place phone numbers on Yelp. Yelp has had phone numbers since day 1.<p>If Grubhub puts menus or something on Yelp and someone uses that to place an order more efficiently, then they would be adding some value. That still wouldn&#x27;t justify charging a premium without telling&#x2F;asking either party, but I would at least agree there is some value-add there (but only for customers who actually look at the GrubHub-provided menu before calling in).')
