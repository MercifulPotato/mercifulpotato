The French for pastry is <i>pâte</i>. <i>Pâté</i> means &quot;pasted&quot; as in &quot;pasted fish&quot;.<p>The French <i>aliment</i> simply means food, although it&#x27;s not spoken very often in France. The word exists in English but it&#x27;s quite rare and normally used in legal contexts like so many other words of French origin.')
