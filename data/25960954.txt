And, the hedge fund managers that shorted GME don&#x27;t deserve to be bankrupt.<p>Shorting stocks, in general, is a beneficial action for the market because it helps prevent shares from becoming overvalued.<p>The problem that GME highlighted is that it&#x27;s too easy to purposefully trigger a short squeeze.<p>One possible solution seems to be that the SEC should make it easier to borrow shares to short a stock.  And, in so doing, they should make it harder to purposefully trigger a short squeeze.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with greed if it doesn&#x27;t hurt others...The SEC&#x27;s ultimate goal should be to have a fair and efficiently priced market at all times.  In this case, it seems like the party that needs to be protected is the hedge funds....What am I missing?')
