They spent a lot of money and effort building the initial product and growing users.  Now that the product is (mostly) feature complete and they have sufficient users they can run lean and mean.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean they could have run lean and mean while building the company.  IMHO, you still need the upfront investment to build out the core product and acquire a sufficient customer base.<p>The reality of today with interest rates so low is that growth is more valued than cash flow.  So while lots of companies (Dropbox, Slack, AirBnB) could do something like this and start generating a bunch of cash they create more value in the eyes of investors by growing.')
