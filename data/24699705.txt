We don&#x27;t &quot;have to first lose&quot;, its just the very likely outcome is that we will lose.<p>That&#x27;s not to say its not worth trying but that we should assume failure, otherwise you end up like the UK&#x27;s Brexit negotiators who were &quot;all-in&quot; on the &quot;oh they&#x27;ll buckle as the time runs out&quot; strategy and have no plan if that doesn&#x27;t pan out beyond &quot;so what now?&quot;.<p>The basic strategy right now seems to run on the basic belief that human-kind will figure out its slowly destroying its habitat and change accordingly.
