Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[25597934], score=None, time=1609453478, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25597573, text='The problem isn&#x27;t that it doesn&#x27;t happen, it&#x27;s that there&#x27;s no reliable way to tell when it&#x27;s happening vs. isn&#x27;t, and internet users are, let&#x27;s call it, rather undisciplined about jumping to conclusions. On any divisive topic, people eagerly proclaim without a shred of evidence that some comment they don&#x27;t like has been planted. Soon there are astroturfers and spies and foreign agents under every bed. However much real manipulation may be happening, it&#x27;s plain that many people are simply indulging their assumptions and fantasies about it, which quickly inflates to grandiose levels. This has an extremely degrading effect on discussion, surely at least as degrading as any sophisticated campaigns.<p>That&#x27;s why the HN guidelines ask people not to post such insinuations [1]â€”it&#x27;s not because such things don&#x27;t exist. It&#x27;s because once a topic gets polarized enough, it <i>always</i> feels like the other side isn&#x27;t arguing in good faith. In the absence of some specific evidence or data or something at least a teeny bit objective to go on, the default presumption has to be that the other user is commenting in good faith and just has a totally different view than you do (I don&#x27;t mean you personally, of course).<p>I find it helpful to imagine that we&#x27;re already at the endgame of this, which is that everything is potentially manipulated and artificial. I call this the SSM: imagine a Sufficiently Smart Manipulator [2], smart enough to plant whatever they want, make it sound authentic, and leave no detectable traces in the data. What can we do in such a situation? Only what we should be doing anyway, which is thinking and writing clearly and respectfully replying to bad arguments with better ones. Since that&#x27;s the only answer in the long run, we might as well practice it now. It has the desirable side effect of strengthening the community, and a healthy community is the best immune system against manipulation.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=sufficiently%20smart%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=sufficiently%20smart%20by:dang...</a>')
