This is about the very nature of our country and a party wanting to throw it all out.<p>If you are uncomfortable with an employee saying the truth (Many seditionists wore Nazi &#x2F; white supremacist apparel and were carrying Confederate flags!), you should examine your own beliefs and whether you are either a white supremacist or a sympathizer.<p>This isn&#x27;t about being &quot;alarmist&quot; or a &quot;snowflake liberal&quot;, this about saying what we _literally_ see.
