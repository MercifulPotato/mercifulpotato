I find keeping my fingers on the home keys makes me twist my wrists outwards, which gets uncomfortable pretty fast. I mostly try to minimise wrist action in general.<p>I&#x27;ve actually had a Planck EZ for a few weeks now and I agree it&#x27;s probably not very ergonomic for the classic qwerty touch typist, or at least not much better than a normal keyboard barring the programmability.<p>But since I don&#x27;t do that anyway I find the keyboard to be pretty nice in terms of customisability and avoiding stretching.<p>In general I feel my hands are used most naturally in close proximity to each other (at roughly abdomen height) so I&#x27;m drawn to small keyboards with lots of modifier keys. A spherical keyboard would be pretty interesting to try out.')
