I used it from launch until it finally died on me a few months ago. I upgraded to the Pixel 4 and was really disappointed. My primary complaint is the lack of a fingerprint scanner, the face unlock is simply slower and less effective (especially now that I&#x27;m wearing a mask because of covid). With the fingerprint scanner on the Pixel 1 the phone was unlocked before i was even done taking it out of my pocket. The face unlock will never be able to match that.<p>Im excited that the Pixel 5 reintroduced the fingerprint scanner. I am strongly considering tossing my new Pixel 4 and upgrading it to the 5.')
