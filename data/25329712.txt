I work as a writer&#x2F;producer and despite all of my experience and theoretical understanding I’d probably be hard pressed to come up with a way to algorithmically describe my musical instincts in a way that generates satisfying music.<p>&gt; I think a large part of the trouble comes from the notion that most music requires a certain degree of subversion of expectation. And not randomly selected subversions either. Deliberate choices that feel meaningful. I could spend a lot of time defining one melodic phrase and immediately need to tweak the rule for the second half or a reharmonization. Not to mention rhythmic cadences and groove.<p>I mean this in the kindest way but... you’re right. You should not seed generated music algorithms. You’re describing something people feel viscerally as something mechanical. I don’t know if that’s how you experience music but... it’s not what most people feel hearing it. And that’s okay.')
