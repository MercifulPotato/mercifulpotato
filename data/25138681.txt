Christie&#x27;s detectives get on my nerves and I like her stand-alones better.<p>Anyone who likes golden-age mysteries should check out John Dickson Carr&#x2F;Carter Dickson.  Wonderful plots with twist and turns and much more entertaining detectives. Try &quot;The Three Coffins&quot; and see what you think.')
