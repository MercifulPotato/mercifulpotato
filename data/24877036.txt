If I had to choose a top tech company, I would probably pick Apple, although they do have an ad network and have a lot information about you if you are in their ecosystem. Also stay away from Facebook and Amazon based on privacy. If you really want to go with 100% privacy, you could say goodbye to you all these companies and forget about the convenience and using all their services. For me, Iâ€™m trying to stay the hell away from Google. I found it really difficult to get away from Gmail, google voice and Waze.')
