They don&#x27;t have to care, and they&#x27;ve outsourced all of their caring to a robotic bureaucrat. Without a human in the loop, like yourself, to realize the absurdity in edge cases you get the worst possible version of bureaucracy. And I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s an all or nothing situation either that &quot;digital bad&quot; or &quot;bureaucracy bad&quot;. Bureaucracy can be good, it helps streamline certain processes &quot;at scale.&quot; Digital can also obviously be good.<p>The PROBLEM is when you marry these things together without proper controls in place by society. We haven&#x27;t completely thought through the ramifications.')
