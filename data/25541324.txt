Item(by='ptero', descendants=None, kids=[25541894], score=None, time=1608956132, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25540230, text='I have pretty low faith in USPTO (or, to be fair, any other organization), making reasonable predictions on the technology value. And even if they did, I think inventors would feel low-balled: &quot;those idiots did not understand the revolutionary benefit of my invention&quot;, etc.<p>Rather than trying to estimate the value of the idea we could drastically reduce the time for patent protection. Shortening protection period to 2-5 years should still encourage inventions, but would discourage early carpet-bombing filings (which scare many inventors away) as well as move successful inventions into public domain while they are still relevant.
