It&#x27;s clear a number of people here consider the command line difficult. I do not. There are many tools that make simple tasks very simple. I use it for manipulating tab files. I can pipe data through scripts and back through command line utilities, pipe it directly into a database, or do the reverse. It&#x27;s very simple, and very powerful.<p>Consider all the things you&#x27;ve committed to memory that you&#x27;ve had to learn to do those things: all the archaic command names, all the one-letter switches, all the unreadable awk lines to re-jigger the formatting between tools, all the gotchyas and edge-cases you had to deal with in your scripting language, etc.')
