And looking back, I found the parts where development slowed down is when I was confused--I almost want to yell at myself--hindsight really is 20&#x2F;20.<p>What I took away is the faster I can recognize I&#x27;m in confusion, the faster I can get out of that state--it means I really need to focus on learning what I&#x27;m not understanding, and then come up with a plan to change the actual system into what I want it to do.<p>Another thing is, though I&#x27;ve really refined text editing skills, it&#x27;s interesting to see yourself struggling to _simply edit text_.  So while watching myself, I jotted down a few ideas of shortcuts that could help.<p>Final thing, that I don&#x27;t know how to fix, is sometimes I&#x27;m not motivated, or not in the mood, or scatter brained.  Honestly, looking at myself, I don&#x27;t know what my deal is.  If I can just force myself to turn on the stream, then my friends will pop in and encourage me, so that has really helped.  Though I&#x27;ll still hit work that I&#x27;m like <i>ugh</i>.')
