I enjoy it so much that I actually look forward to it now and wish I could do it more than ~4 times a year.<p>I fly either Zurich or Frankfurt to SFO on United and get an economy bulkhead seat (nobody in front to recline).  Wifi is solid.  In-seat power. It&#x27;s a ~12 hour day flight (leave around 1pm CET, land 4pm PT). It&#x27;s dark since many people sleep so they turn the lights off and close the shades.  There&#x27;s enough ambient noise to be calming without annoying.  There are zero distractions otherwise.  The are regular coffee refills on-demand.<p>Every time I&#x27;ve done this flight (I&#x27;ve done it 6 times now) I get into a solid and excellent flow state.  I&#x27;ve accomplished more on various coding projects in that one flight than sometimes in a week or two of regular at-home time.<p>Obviously as I said it&#x27;s not practical to fly around the world to get work done :) But I try to use that as a roadmap for setting up an environment at home to emulate it as much as possible.')
