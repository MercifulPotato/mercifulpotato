Item(by='bzbarsky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610520650, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25754431, text='&gt; When did speaking truth to power become &quot;bullying&quot;?<p>It _can_ become bulling when people will arbitrarily claim that the victim of the bullying is the one who &quot;had power&quot; while the mob that got them fired, say, was just &quot;speaking truth&quot;.  Which maybe they were and maybe they were not.<p>Not every incident of a bunch of people attacking someone on social media is &quot;bullying&quot;, but neither is every incident of such &quot;speaking truth to power&quot;, but a lot of the incidents of the former sure do try to pretend to be the latter.<p>I suspect that you&#x27;re thinking of a specific set of incidents and that j_walter is thinking of a quite different set of incidents, for what it&#x27;s worth.')
