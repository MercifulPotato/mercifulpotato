When they first started their marketing push to developers years ago, which I remember was very aggressive and full of evangelism marketing which I disliked, I kind of blew them off as some mid tier or old school oddity.<p>But it really shows you how powerful their enterprise sales machine is and the legacy reach of existing programming languages&#x2F;frameworks.<p>It’s always easy to underestimate Microsoft I guess. Ditto with Oracle and the like. From our view down in the startup world.<p>That said. Alt-tab not working is an embarrassment though. And I hope they really haven’t let their OS QA slip this badly in favour of some growth area or whatever.')
