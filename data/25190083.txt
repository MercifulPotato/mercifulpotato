Reddit has been aggressively expanding their advertising, yet they&#x27;ve done little to nothing to stop ad blockers, or third party Reddit clients, such as Apollo, that automatically strip the website of ads.<p>I&#x27;d posit that Reddit understands that the demographic actually generating content (comments, posts, etc...) are very tech savvy, heavily utilize ad blockers and ad-stripping third party clients. Reddit understands that these users would leave the site en masse if their third party clients or ad blockers were interfered with. This would result in a drop in quality content for &quot;average&quot;, non-ad blocking users to interact with, ultimately killing their web traffic and ad revenues.<p>I&#x27;d also bet this is why Reddit has yet to force everyone to the new advertising-optimized redesign, which their power users hate.')
