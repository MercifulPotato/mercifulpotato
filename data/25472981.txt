Item(by='vincentmarle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608331344, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25470094, text='&gt; My perspective on angel and VC investors is shaped by my own experiences as an entrepreneur on the firing line trying to get revenue in the door at a startup called Tellme after the dot com bust.<p>&gt; A particularly memorable moment was one night I was in the office at 11pm with our then director of finance, Alfred Lin (now COO of Zappos).<p>&gt; We were at wit’s end because we had just lost our biggest customer opportunity which was with a large US telecom company.  Normally “losing” didn’t phase us as we even developed a motto: “losing is just a step on the path toward winning.” But this time, we were really in trouble because the customer was signing a long-term contract with our competitor later that week.  We had already appealed to the President of the division; the only further escalation points were to the CEO or Chairman.  We had already tapped out our VC contacts.  If we lost this customer, as Alfred dryly pointed out, it was unlikely we’d be able to get our revenue over our fixed costs in any reasonable timeframe.  I asked Alfred what about any of our angel investors, so we went through them and none seemed likely to be able to pull this off.<p>&gt; Alfred said, “Well there is this one other investor, Ron Conway.”  I didn’t know Ron at the time, and his investment was quite small.  But we had nothing to lose by reaching out. So sometime after 11pm, I wrote Ron and essentially said: “hello, you don’t know me, I’m an executive at a company you’re an investor in, and we need a meeting—in person—with the CEO himself of this Fortune 50 company—this week—and if you can’t make this happen, hey that’s ok, but we may be going down—sorry.”  Ron wrote back in literally 2 minutes and said, in what I have learned is Ron’s distinctive email style (immediate, short, all caps), “AM ON IT.”  The next morning, Ron had done it.  Tellme went on to win an eight figure contract that led to a nine figure contract. That’s a lot o’ money from a desperate email from someone he’d never met at 11pm.<p>&gt; Tellme was eventually acquired by Microsoft for about $800mm.  My view of building startups is that it is somewhere between impossible and almost impossible, so you want all the help you can get.  Tellme’s VCs (The Barksdale Group, Benchmark and Kleiner Perkins) were also extremely helpful, and I don’t think Tellme could have succeeded without them, including help with customer connections. But my personal opinion is that I’m not sure we would have made it without Ron either.<p>From: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a16z.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;04&#x2F;06&#x2F;ron-conway-explained&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a16z.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;04&#x2F;06&#x2F;ron-conway-explained&#x2F;</a>')
