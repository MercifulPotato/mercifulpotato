It never really went anywhere but we were astounded at the possibilities, with hardware getting less expensive and reagents being available to even a couple of dudes in a home lab. I believe the next 50 years will see a huge democratization of biology and it will be fascinating to see what happens. Imagine a GitHub for custom viral vectors or plasmids.<p>Unfortunately, this will also mean real bioterror events and I shudder to think what malicious groups could (will?) do with this technology once it is more widely available.<p>(1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openpcr.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openpcr.org&#x2F;</a>')
