The point is that if you want a general purpose performant cpu (like ARM&#x2F;x86) targeting a wide swath of applications, you will end up with these optional extensions as default. And then it is as bloated as others. We are not talking about micro-architecture optimization here to make it more performant, but isa architecure.<p>Ofcourse, you can change the computing module to minimal base isa and specific accelerations in ISA&#x2F;HW. But then you will be restricted to niche applications and never replace the incumbents for general purpose workload.<p>&gt;&gt; Hence it is premature to assume it will end up the same.<p>And it is wishful thinking that it will happen otherwise. Whether ARM&#x2F;x86 thought about extension from the ground up doesn&#x27;t matter if you are targeting the same application space as them.<p>I have not seen anything done to even acknowledge this issue, let alone do something about it, for the simple reason that this lies far into the future and has no impact on the current scenario.<p>Given time and legacy software, it will morph into one.')
