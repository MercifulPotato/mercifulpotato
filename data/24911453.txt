Hunter was going to leave a handful of expensive computers for repair without following up and getting them back? The owner doesn’t even have his contact information?<p>Then you have Rudy not willing to allow anyone to examine the hard drive. If it was legit this is the easiest way to give the story credibility. Given his refusal, it seems very clear that the data on this hard drive was assembled after the fact.<p>Who has the technical resources to hack Hunter Biden’s accounts to assemble such a large trove of his personal emails and texts?<p>Russian Intelligence is by far the leading candidate and there is no one in second place.<p>It was a clever plan. Fill the drive with legit emails, photos, videos, and texts. Then salt them with a small set of carefully produced and incredibly damaging forgeries.<p>Release right before election, with enough time to maximize impact, but not enough time for anyone to detect the forgeries. Bam!<p>Was a good plan, but the press is far more savvy about these types of attempts now.')
