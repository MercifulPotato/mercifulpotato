PG is not some omnipotent being that can &quot;ensure&quot; anything for the companies he originally helped launch. His &quot;enforcement&quot; options are probably minimal, based on his (by now many times diluted) ownership. The best he can do is advocate, leveraging a lot of respect he still commands in the startup community. And this is what he is doing there. My 2c.')
