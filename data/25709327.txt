By pretending both sides are the same, it would appear you are the one spinning and rationalizing.<p>I mean, let&#x27;s not forget that Donald Trump of all people called into question the results of his own win in 2016 by claiming that 3 million people voted illegally, and that people were being bussed to New Hampshire to vote against him. He even formed a commission to investigate this &quot;fraud&quot;! So any impressions that the vote was illegitimate were flamed by the winner himself!')
