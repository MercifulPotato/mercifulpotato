What is music? What makes music good? What makes a particular song &#x27;tick&#x27;? This can get pretty abstract, and might involve some nifty math. Still not strictly scientific, though there may be some science involved.<p>If you have a theory as to what makes good music, you&#x27;re naturally going to write music that tests your theory, hence the association between music theory and compositional practice. They are technically distinct, but most musicians use the term loosely. So that&#x27;s probably where you&#x27;re confused.<p>I would not recommend learning about music theory unless you&#x27;re interested in actual music. Most of your time learning music theory will be spent analyzing actual music, so if you don&#x27;t like it you&#x27;re gonna have a bad time. And personally, the benefit of music theory for me is applying its lessons to music that I write. So if you don&#x27;t even like music, I&#x27;m not sure what the appeal would be.')
