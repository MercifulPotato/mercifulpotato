CentOS 8.0 dates from Sept 2019, so it&#x27;s killed in just the 3rd year of its presumed 10 year lifespan. I could read the tea leaves when they announced this Stream thingy recently, but I&#x27;d thought they would at least hold off till RHEL9 to pull the lever.<p>Blindingly obvious, of course, because Red Hat bought CentOS, presumably with real $$$, and IBM bought Red Hat for $34bln.<p>What&#x27;s going to happen next? Microsoft buying Canonical and all businesses running either IBM Linux or Microsoft Linux? Crazier things have happened...')
