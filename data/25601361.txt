Coming from a family that left their country of birth because of the hell-hole socialism had turned it into to now seeing the country of adoption being dragged (albeit very slowly) to the same place is profoundly dispiriting.<p>The books &quot;Death By Government&quot; and the &quot;Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression&quot; estimate killings from communism at 148 million and 110 million respectively. \n(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mass_killings_under_communist_...</a>)<p>Black&#x27;s Book&#x27;s estimate of victims include deaths through executions, man-made hunger, famine, war, deportations and forced labor [1]. The breakdown of the number of deaths is given as follows:<p>65 million in the People&#x27;s Republic of China<p>20 million in the Soviet Union<p>2 million in Cambodia<p>2 million in North Korea<p>1.7 million in Ethiopia<p>1.5 million in Afghanistan<p>1 million in the Eastern Bloc<p>1 million in Vietnam<p>150,000 in Latin America<p>The tally for China and North Korea needs an update because the Black Book was published in 1997. This list is incomplete in other ways. For example Mongolia&#x27;s carnage in 1917 is missing as Mongolia&#x27;s current government contains communist remnants and suppresses any attempts at dissemination. One of the accomplishments of Russian (Bolshevik) backed Mongolian communists was lining up and shooting 30,000 monks at point blank and dumping them in mass graves. Directly spoke to journalist who was imprisoned by communist and later government for his work and saw photographs he had taken of exhumed mass graves. Horrendous.<p>[1] (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Black_Book_of_Communism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Black_Book_of_Communism</a>):')
