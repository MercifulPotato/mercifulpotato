Chris isn&#x27;t making any claim that the run time is fast compared to an in-core production renderer. He rendered Moana in 8GB of GPU memory, which is smaller than the input data. From the advertisement, it&#x27;s clear you are a 3Delight fan (employee?), but I bet 3Delight cannot do that: render Moana without using more than 8GB of CPU memory.<p>The algorithm here to do out of core rendering is the important part, and it doesn&#x27;t make sense for you to try to compare in-core CPU rendering to out-of-core GPU rendering.<p>&gt; I would love to see a breakdown how much of these 5hs is owed to the fact that the data doesn&#x27;t fit on the device.<p>I already know it&#x27;s pretty close to 100% of the time spent handling out-of-core requests, that&#x27;s not surprising, nor is it a bad thing (though it probably can be improved). If it were a CPU renderer doing this - streaming the geometry &amp; BVH, the result would be the same (or much worse if streaming from SSD instead of an external ram of some sort.)')
