If I had a dollar for every &quot;duh, orange man bad&quot; post I could pay off all US student debt. It&#x27;s just unbelievable. And if you said anything positive about trump (like hey, how about that H-1B loophole fix? that wasn&#x27;t being abused by big tech) you get eviscerated, possibly even banned. And whats your appeal? To a mod that just makes up rules on a whim that aren&#x27;t even part of their rules? Pretty much.<p>Reddit has gone out of their minds. They want people to target ads to, not a genuine community of people that care about the content they make. That&#x27;s why those stickers have gone to absurd levels and they charge ridiculous prices for it. Now when I see a post, gold means nothing anymore. I don&#x27;t even know whats a worthwhile post to bother reading cause half the time it&#x27;s garbage group think irrational &quot;the dems are freedom fighters!&quot; stuff anyway.')
