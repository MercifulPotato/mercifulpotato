Couldn&#x27;t get internet to work so it didn&#x27;t get much use. Later when I was studying in 2005 the computer room in the school had these insanely restricted Windows computers where the only browser was IE, sessions got wiped when logged out.. so burned Knoppix to a CD and later some other similar &quot;portable&quot; distro (don&#x27;t remember its name, something starting with &quot;S&quot; I think) on USB with persistence. That lead me to install Ubuntu on my home computer and haven&#x27;t looked back, unless you count the fact that I&#x27;ve been using MacOS since 2015, but I do manage a large amount of Linux server in my job.')
