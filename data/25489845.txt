Maybe in your circles it&#x27;s just about the safety of the sex workers from abuse and trafficking, otherwise it&#x27;s &quot;yay, you go girl! $muscle_emoji&quot; and &quot;yay you go guy, for watching porn and satisfying your need for intimacy through onlyfans&quot; (erm... wait...)<p>But there&#x27;s lot of sneering like this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9gag.com&#x2F;gag&#x2F;arVYxm5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9gag.com&#x2F;gag&#x2F;arVYxm5</a> spreading on social media, which is essentially that girls on onlyfans are going for the easy money instead of more &quot;decent&quot; work and career path. I know it&#x27;s just a meme, I&#x27;m not defending a silly image as truth, just as the illustration of the viewpoint. The idea that there is a who-deserves-what aspect.<p>And perhaps you think the anti-porn Christians simply tell boys not to jerk it because of an irreducible argument that &quot;Jesus doesn&#x27;t like that&quot;, but to me it&#x27;s pretty clear that there is a deeper Christian pattern underlying it, namely suffering&#x2F;effort giving rise to reward, and that it&#x27;s immoral to sidestep that, Garden of Eden, Christ paying for sins by suffering on the cross etc. The protestant ideal of hard work etc. Do these ideas seem foreign to you?')
