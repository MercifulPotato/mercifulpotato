I own a MBP 13” 2018 with 8GB of RAM. For starters:<p>1. Windows 10 via Bootcamp boot faster than macOS — on an Apple machine.<p>2. What’s wrong with a tiling manager? Why I need a third-party app to organise windows?<p>3. I saw in another HN post that an Apple engineer was patting themselves on the back for the memory mama garment. Then, why the hell at login macOS uses more RAM than Windows?<p>4. I can’t use Docker for Mac. The same dev environment with Docker and WSL2 on Windows 10 via Bootcamp works fine. I mean, it still sucks because of the limited RAM, but it’s fine. On macOS it’s way slower, and the fans go crazy.<p>The hardware — except for the keyboard and the Touch Bar - is fine. The touchpad is great, the screen is fantastic. But Apple needs to work on the operating system; just don’t touch the shortcuts. Those are fine.')
