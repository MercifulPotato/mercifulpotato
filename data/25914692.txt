The TPC-C benchmark suggests fairly strong scaling up to medium~high double digit node counts, and my understanding is that it&#x27;s decently conflict prone and very much relying on distributed transactions.<p>Of course a distributed architecture costs efficiency, but as long as it still scales further (and after some point, cheaper) than single-node alternatives, the efficiency loss is tolerable.<p>You can affect partitioning, but forcing it requires the payed version.')
