How is the NSA antagonizing me?  What is one example of a material impact on my life?<p>&gt;Even if it doesn&#x27;t effect you now all you need to do is look at historical examples from other nations going down the same path. There&#x27;s a reason the poem &quot;First they came ...&quot; exists and it&#x27;s a direct counter point to the argument you&#x27;re making.<p>This is getting into slippery slopes and hypotheticals that don&#x27;t seem to motivate anyone and they are the exact arguments that are used in defense of this spying.  If we demand examples of the safety this spying supposedly provides, we need examples of the freedom this spying destroys.<p>&gt;Otherwise I don&#x27;t know what you want here, historically the masses mostly don&#x27;t do anything until they start starving...<p>I am looking for anything that will motivate people to political action.  It doesn&#x27;t need to motivate people to overthrow the government.  A simple here is why you real life is worse so vote for this candidate, volunteer with organization, donate to this cause, etc.')
