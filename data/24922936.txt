It&#x27;s like they don&#x27;t understand that the world is moving on and doesnt really give a $h!t about them and their love of X. I mean here is a post from &quot;the guy&quot; whose been keeping X going for a long time saying &quot;this shit is done&quot; and people keep complaining about that as if they have some say in it without actually contributing to the code. It reads like entitlement - some kind of expectation that other people exist just to make things the way they want them to be.')
