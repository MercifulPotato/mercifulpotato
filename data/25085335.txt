In reality, COVID-19 should be seen more as a &quot;taste&quot; of things to come. I don&#x27;t know why more action, or at least discourse, regarding climate collapse exists in tech communites about this subject. Is it because it isn&#x27;t as interesting to think about, when compared to working on self-driving cars, VR, human longevity, etc?<p>Edit: I&#x27;m looking at you Lex Fridman and 90% of his guests.')
