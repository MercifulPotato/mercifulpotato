The VMs are extremely fast, light-weight and integrated well. The VMs start in under 2 seconds and compile times are virtually identical to running on the host. I use the host Windows system as my &quot;personal&quot; computing space and all work is isolated on the WSL2 VM.  I simply run a windows X server for GUI apps (X410 is my goto) and it works flawlessly.  Multiple WSL2 instances can be run with different flavors of Linux in each including Arch and Kali as would be the case in your scenario.<p>I realize having a closed-source Windows host can be a complete non-starter for many.')
