I.e. you can maybe make a backdoor to something without monetary consequences (even in a bank most systems don&#x27;t handle money), but introducing a backdoor to the core system (i.e. a money-dealing one) in such a way that it is not noticed in code reviews or testing AND you can claim plausible deniability seems hard.')
