Relatedly, I just wrote at length to a museum director about wanting to see a painting in the collection. The painting has been warehoused for years, like thousands of other works. it&#x27;s not in need of special preservation. it&#x27;s simply not on display because their walls have no room and the artist isn&#x27;t currently of any special interest (except that he&#x27;s important enough to have his work hoarded?). What a shame! All works in all major collections should be digitized and on display. What&#x27;s the point of our culture if it&#x27;s not being transmitted!')
