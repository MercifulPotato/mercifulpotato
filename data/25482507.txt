And in the long run, it&#x27;s not more effective if it drives everyone to ad blockers and privacy-oriented operating systems. It&#x27;s like saying dictatorships are more effective than democracies, which is true until people decide they want to get rid of the dictator. My point was that this doesn&#x27;t have to be a choice between ultra-targeted Facebook ads and non-targeted billboards. We can imagine a compromise with semi-targeted ads that most consumers can tolerate and most marketers can live with, but it just isn&#x27;t viable if Facebook maintains its dominance.<p>The solution I&#x27;m suggesting is to either break up Facebook or legislate away their business model. I know that would make your life as a business owner more difficult, but wouldn&#x27;t you also feel a little bit better knowing your business couldn&#x27;t be wiped out by a broken algorithm disabling your ad account?')
