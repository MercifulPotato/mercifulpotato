It is a few inches of snow, most all of which will melt within a few hours.  Come to north america.  In the last month, temperatures where I am standing have fluctuated between +7c and -23c.  There is currently snow&#x2F;ice on every street and we will almost certainly not see grass again until summer.  But we survive.  Our airports don&#x27;t close.  We still get to work on time.  Thundersnow is cool, but not exactly newsworthy.  Thunder loud enough to set off car alarms isn&#x27;t special in the prairies.  Drive a few hours west of me, into the mountains, and &quot;winter&quot; gets properly serious.  I bet the vast majority of people in Scotland have never even seen tire chains.  Are block heaters even sold in the UK?')
