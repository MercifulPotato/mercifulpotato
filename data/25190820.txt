It&#x27;s a glitch in how Quake 3 handles motion vectors. But it&#x27;s now also enshrined behavior, complete with entire game modes in CS built around it (KZ &amp; surf maps). If you went and made an entirely new engine, or even just used something off the shelf like Unity or Unreal, you&#x27;d have to add that bug back. It&#x27;s core to the gameplay now.')
