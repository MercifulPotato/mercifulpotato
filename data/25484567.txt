You don&#x27;t have to build a rack in a colo to run a non-Serverless app. There&#x27;s this thing called The Cloud now, and Virtual Machines, and other fancy new technologies from 15 years ago<p>I think you are miss understanding my comment. I was comparing serverless to colo because that’s essentially what the author was doing. I agree that there are plenty of other cloud compute solutions that work for many workloads.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s like 20 other things you need for a functioning product, many of which literally cannot be replaced by Serverless-anything<p>I totally agree. Serverless is usually just a piece of infrastructure that is combined with other resources like databases, batch clusters, blob storage, vms, etc. I don’t think you’d be able to create a very interesting app using stateless functions alone, though I could be proven wrong ;)')
