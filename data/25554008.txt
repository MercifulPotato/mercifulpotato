Killer features are mostly from the room sensors:<p>* Keep upstairs comfortable at night, main floor during the day<p>* Auto home&#x2F;away mode (based on motion). This works so well, I only just changed the schedule to account for working from home about a month ago<p>I also like &quot;Run fan for minimum of x minutes per hour&quot; as it makes a noticeable difference on sunny days where the South side of the house is normally a lot warmer than the North.<p>Other than that, the app is decent and it&#x27;s easy to connect to Home Assistant.<p>I have an older wifi thermostat controlling my fireplace, and a very useful automation I only just added turns on the furnace fan when the fireplace is &quot;on&quot; (temp set above 21) which helps keep the house balanced.')
