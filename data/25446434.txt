Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608143854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25446241, text='&gt; It seems correct as a matter of policy to not earmark PPP loans directly to employee wages.<p>At a minimum, it should be tied to maintenance of payroll, since that&#x27;s the entire theory of the Paycheck Protection Program.<p>Alternatively, it should just not have existed, and direct individual aid should have been increased instead.<p>&gt; We don&#x27;t want to set up a scenario where a bunch of small businesses fail the instant the PPP ends because they haven&#x27;t been paying the bills.<p>The fungibility of money means that earmarked funds for payroll frees up any other funds for other uses. It might make sense to earmark <i>less</i> than 100% for paychecks, or to have a separate relief mechanism, to account for ongoing <i>fixed</i> costs. If business is reduced so that revenue is not available for marginal costs, than those marginal costs should also not exist.')
