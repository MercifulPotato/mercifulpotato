So of course we put the WiFi AP at the end of the apartment where the fiber comes in, and it needs to be at full power to reach the other end. Of course, now the person on the other side of the wall will be blasted with signal.<p>A planned network from a provider would instead have 2-3 APs spread out through the middle of the apartment at a low power. But that costs 2-3 times more, plus now you have to drill through the walls to wire them (which we can&#x27;t do as we&#x27;re renting).<p>There&#x27;s a lot more difference between the usage of the ISM band and the licensed bands than &quot;if everyone just lowered their power a bit it would be great&quot;. Since ISM band usage can&#x27;t be planned to the same extent, it should have MORE spectrum than the planned bands, not less.')
