Nearly everything has been done before: what you are doing isn&#x27;t fundamentally new.  There is lots of opportunity to add minor new features, reliability, or better user interfaces.  But the fundamentals of what you are doing isn&#x27;t new anymore. You can look at your past versions and what competitors do for guidance on what you will probably need next. If you have any broad knowledge of your problem domain you can make reasonable guesses as to what you will need and what you won&#x27;t need. When replacing a subsystem I know if there will be 100 users of it in the future or if it is a leaf with 1 user - because I know what the old crufty subsystem has (the first case I spend days thinking about the interface, the second I design the interface when I integrate the one subsystem)')
