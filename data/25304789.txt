Coding Bootcamps have also become bad at training students to pass interviews by practicing coding questions and putting cookie-cutter &quot;side projects&quot; in their GitHub profile.<p>One of our local coding bootcamps had students post their class projects to GitHub as &quot;side projects&quot; to show to interviewers. The catch was that every graduate from the boot camp had the exact same &quot;side projects&quot; that followed the same formula.<p>As an interviewer, it&#x27;s amazing to see people arrive at interviews with an idea that we&#x27;re just robots trying to check items off of a checklist. The internet pop-culture view of coding interviews is that they&#x27;re just arbitrary gatekeeping that can be bypassed if you simply know which magic words to say to your robot interviewers.<p>Tip for interviewers: Speak to your interviewers as if they were your future peers or managers.')
