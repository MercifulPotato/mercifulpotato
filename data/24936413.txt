Anonymous publishing is a very important right.</i><p>It also wouldn&#x27;t work. Or rather, at <i>best</i> it would only work as well as political campaign message attribution does (and that&#x27;s with considerable enforcement muscle aimed at it).<p>Somehow &quot;dark money&quot; often manages to evade these efforts, and evade the consequences of violations, and I wouldn&#x27;t expect transnational phishing and scams to be any different.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say that we should stop trying, but sacrificing the capability of the general public for anonymous speech in return for dubious-at-best attribution by well-heeled actors seems like a poor tradeoff.')
