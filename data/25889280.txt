People promoted to PM generally receive no training or mentorship. In fact, sometimes the only way to break into management is to quit your job and start somewhere else with a slightly exaggerated resume. And sometimes the only qualification required is a desire to give it a try.<p>So you have an entire class of people whose skills follow what you&#x27;d expect in a task with no discipline or training, with 50% of PMs moving the needle in a positive direction, and 50% in a negative direction (to varying degrees like a bell curve). Roughly 25% of them are people you&#x27;d actually like managing your team.')
