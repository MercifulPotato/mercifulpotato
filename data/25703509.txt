It sounds more like what else could you do with all the money going to the police now, which could also reduce crime. And it seems the argument is that the police is designed to react to crime as it happen, while there might be ways that can stop the crime from happening in the first place, like better education, more housing, or who knows what else.<p>I think this is the key takeaway from the opinion piece:<p>&gt; As a society, we have been so indoctrinated with the idea that we solve problems by policing and caging people that many cannot imagine anything other than prisons and the police as solutions to violence and harm.<p>I find it an interesting idea to be honest. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;m convinced one way or the other, but it definitely seems an interesting area for research and innovation. We innovate solutions to all kind of problems, it seems it has been a while since we&#x27;ve tried to innovate solutions around crime reduction and prevention.')
