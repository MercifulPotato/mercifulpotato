Full autonomy actually meaning, you could rip the steering wheel out of the car and have it drive through any city you wish instead of &quot;it drives through grid streets in American suburbs correctly like, 95% of the time&quot;<p>The entire current approach has no correctness guarantees, ML systems are horrible at dealing with tail-risk, there&#x27;s a human communication element to driving and so on. It&#x27;s a ridiculously hard problem, honestly AGI hard.<p>I much more suspect that before we get autonomous driving we&#x27;ll get more &#x27;rail like&#x27; street systems, geofencing etc.. that limit how drivers and cars can behave, that&#x27;s kind of how the whole hyperloop thing works ironically enough. Obviously if we wanted that we could just build better metro systems to begin with which already drive themselves.')
