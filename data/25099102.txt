Two and a half years ago, I dropped out from an average university to be admitted in Harvard within one year. At that time I also had poor English, struggling to differentiate present and past simple tenses.<p>In just two years, I ruined relationships with my relatives, lost all friends, don&#x27;t talk to anyone, got a horribly loose skin, had a mini-stroke and got tinnitus. Also, I became fluent in written English, lost more than 50 kilograms, and right now 70% done preparing for applying for SWE positions. It&#x27;s tough, but I&#x27;ve never been happier. Never had so much progress before.')
