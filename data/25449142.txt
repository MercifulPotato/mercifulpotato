Both sides are already connected to the bounce server and all interaction between those peers is done <i>through</i> the bounce server. Thus, the peers don&#x27;t need to communicate directly... so you don&#x27;t need to do any NAT punching.<p>That&#x27;s what makes this method simple... with the downside that you need a publicly exposed intermediary. But it is vastly simpler to setup than STUN.')
