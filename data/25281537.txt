The range that a starlink antenna can transmit or receive at is ~10.7GHz - 14.5 GHz. (possibly a bit wider than that, but not by much) All of which is licensed spectrum. And starlink only has a license for using that band if the beam is steered at least 25° above the horizon, and 25° away from the geostationary orbit band.<p>Good luck doing anything other than the intended use with that.')
