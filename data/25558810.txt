Recent technical improvements would have had some, but minor, impacts on the UK de-coaling their economy compared to that.<p>&gt; Unless the UK wants to heavily subsidize coal at a major loss and force themselves to continue to use antiquated technology to prop up this energy buggy whip, it&#x27;s done.<p>If the buggy whip drove further &amp; faster than a motor vehicle we&#x27;d still be using them. Coal produced more electricity than their new setup does. This is more akin to all the horses being dead so everyone has to move to bicycles. Arguably not a big step back, but not obviously better.')
