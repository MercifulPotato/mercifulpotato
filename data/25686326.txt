Giving something to the community, either for free or gratis, in a hobbyist space such as this one is not more work. It&#x27;s clear people in the retro computing scene feel passionate about it -- they&#x27;d rather spend their time doing this and not something else (and if you see the people writing retro games, they are willing to put <i>a lot</i> of work into it).
