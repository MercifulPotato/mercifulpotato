The rules surrounding the auction were unnecessarily prohibitive and expensive. Telcos were being forced to pay too much, which meant customers got a very expensive, limited service. Jio broke that system, by hook or by crook, and got us what we should have had long ago if markets were allowed to function naturally.<p>Edit: Before Jio, we had many providers, but all of them were bad for the user! I&#x27;d rather have a monopoly that works for the user over that.')
