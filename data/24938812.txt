Item(by='lliamander', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604028226, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24938394, text='1) He has his own copies of emails found on the laptop (for those that he was included on)<p>2) He didn&#x27;t have the whole picture until details from the laptop (that didn&#x27;t include him) were made public<p>3) question the timing all you will (I certainly do) but the contents of the laptop have never been repudiated other than as a vague smear of &quot;Russian disinformation&quot;. Hunter&#x27;s lawyers even asked for the laptop back<p>4) The DOJ just admitted that they&#x27;ve had an open investigation into Hunter since last year, and Bobulinski just turned over his phones as evidence in that investigation.<p>I <i>really</i> hope everyone here who is dismissing this was just as skeptical of the Steele dossier, because there is more actual hard evidence and witness testimony here than with the dossier.')
