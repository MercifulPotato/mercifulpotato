Notifications for transactions stopped working.  As I always do when things like this happen, I went to twitter and tweeted at them.  They claim it works, yet replies on twitter beg to differ.  They support people point me to a document that shows UI elements which have been removed.<p>Still broken.  Still no word from them.<p>And there&#x27;s the issue about financial software.  A couple of years ago they stopped supporting what Moneydance uses.  Basically, Cap One only supports Quicken.  I would rather cut off my nose than use Quicken.  I moved all my accounts to other banks after Moneydance stopped working.  Problem is, my SO still has accounts there and the notification issue is a real problem, as she was not notified of fraudulent transactions due to their new bug.')
