That&#x27;s just talk, though, not actual action, but it undermines the legitimacy of the election in peoples&#x27; minds.  Then there was impeachment on, bluntly, very political grounds rather than legitimate reasons.  It wasn&#x27;t like the beginning of the movement to impeach Nixon during Watergate.  This time was just looking for some chance, <i>any</i> chance, to accuse him of <i>something</i>, to try to remove him.  That seems to me clearly to be &quot;attempting to cancel the results of the 2016 election&quot;.<p>Yes, I remember that Clinton conceded quickly.  Trump should have done so as well, at the latest three days after the election.  It&#x27;s over, it&#x27;s been over, and it&#x27;s going to stay over.<p>But Trump is absolutely making a fool of himself by continuing to fight, and in the process he is damaging the norms that keep this creaking democracy functioning.  So far, he hasn&#x27;t gotten anywhere because people (who nominally should be on his side) haven&#x27;t gone along with his BS - from the governor of Georgia, to the Supreme Court justices he appointed.<p>I worry, though, that next time it will be worse - that people will be willing to go along.  And I worry about that for the left, not just for the right.  In fact, I worry about it somewhat <i>more</i> for the left.  The right has (some) people who believe in the rule of law, and things like &quot;originalism&quot;.  The left has (some) people who believe in the &quot;living&quot; constitution, and judicial activism.  I worry that if, say, President Harris tries to follow this same playbook in 2024, some on the left in positions of power will be more willing to go along than some on the right have been in 2020.<p>On the other hand, there are far too many people who are still following what I can only call a cult of personality around Trump.  They worry me on the right.  If they haven&#x27;t come to their senses by 2024, and Trump runs again...<p>So, yeah.  Trump is at the moment worse.  I oppose his attempt to remain in power, and I am delighted at how others have refused to play along.  But I worry about both the right and the left in the future.  Within the next 20 years, I think it&#x27;s likely that someone will try this again.<p>Biden has the chance, maybe, to strengthen our institutions and repair some of the damage.  Or he has the chance to continue to try to make them more partisan, but in the opposite direction of the last four years.  Will he be wise, or just political?')
