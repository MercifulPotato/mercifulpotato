For example, I think most people would read &quot;I have dated a lot of guys&quot; as meaning &quot;men&quot;. Or perhaps take for example the title of the 1950 musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;. It seems that &quot;guys&quot; is just undergoing the same treatment that has largely happened with &quot;men&quot;; certainly there are people who would argue that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; does in fact include women, but it seems like saying &quot;women are a kind of man&quot; reinforces the assumption that male is the default. Would people be as charitable if I were to state &quot;all women are created equal&quot;? That &quot;men are a kind of women&quot;?<p>Also the fields which concern these issues are sociolinguistics and the sociology of language, for anyone who is curious.')
