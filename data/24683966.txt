Prestige is massive in F1). Especially considering how slow and incremental the new tech addition rules are added to the vehicles and how much the rules neuter the cars on purpose.<p>This is probably just down to the team&#x2F;human capital not being super interested in investing the time and energy to play in the top league.<p>Honda still has a very large presence in the Indy series which arguably offers plenty of the more consumer oriented R&amp;D bits in the short term.<p>Additionally the non committal F1E stuff makes the consumer R&amp;D argument less persuasive.')
