It isn&#x27;t news that aliens are planning to invade earth. Not because that wouldn&#x27;t be a huge deal, but because there is no evidence to support it.<p>Second, if there is evidence of a son using a name to enrich himself but there is no evidence that the father played a part, I don&#x27;t think it is news. It may be a shitty thing ethically to do from the son, but I don&#x27;t think it is particularly news worthy. I thought the same thing when they were talking about how the wife of Bush Jr killed someone in a driving accident. Newsworthy if a candidate did it, not newsworthy if his wife did.')
