Nobody gets promoted by maintaining existing projects. Also, it seems as if there&#x27;s no communication between groups. So if a group gets reassigned or key people leave, their project (e.g. the umpteenth messenger app) gets sunset, too.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is all political, but rather they&#x27;re aimlessly throwing projects at the wall to see which stick.')
