Monarchies are obviously not great, but it&#x27;s good to remember that they aren&#x27;t evil or something, and that there can still be a balance of power.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking that, in a liberal democracy, there&#x27;s not much of a national identity. It&#x27;s like a football club where anyone can drop in, and vote to play chess instead.<p>I generally think that&#x27;s fine, except that it seems like having no identity at all is a vacuum, and gets filled by something. That could easily end up being the opposite of liberal democracy, so lack of identity can be self-defeating.')
