How much fuel does it take to launch a vessel built with currently-known technology that would be capable of landing a living human being on a hypothetical planet around Alpha Centauri? And what does that fuel number look like, when expressed in terms of &quot;years of current resource extraction&quot; (or, somewhat more audaciously, percentage of known proven reserves)?<p>To my knowledge, interstellar colonization is flat-out impossible with current technology. (I&#x27;d argue that even intrastellar colonization is impossible, rather than impractical). Arguing that we should discount this non-knowledge of how to do it when explaining why it hasn&#x27;t happened to our observation is irresponsible to me.')
