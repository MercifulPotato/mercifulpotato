I have actually been looking for a true counterargument to their approach and so far everything I&#x27;ve come across I don&#x27;t buy into. If anyone has anything countering&#x2F;disputing Tesla&#x27;s approach - please share! I can&#x27;t help but feel like there is something I DON&#x27;T see that many smart, respectable people see and understand that I just haven&#x27;t seen.<p>Also thanks for the link shares, but I don&#x27;t think either actually disproves Tesla&#x27;s approach.<p>My understanding of the Tesla approach is: In order to truly &#x27;solve&#x27; self-driving (situations on the road that have never been seen before to drive safely - think unannounced construction, collision or road closures due to protests), you MUST solve &#x27;vision&#x27; with a very, very complicated and well trained neural net (re: ridiculous intelligence in the form of a human brain as you state). In addition, the existing road infrastructure (re: signs) is all built around human vision - and so being able to identify and interpret all of that is a requirement.<p>I find their approach compelling as in this instance where you have cameras with a particular neural net (which they are constantly refining the learning model on) that are training across the millions of cars across the billions of miles across the thousands of various edge cases into a generalized solution. You also have a re-enforcement loop via the nature of a human driver which &#x27;intervenes&#x27; through the drive, a necessary step in refining the model at scale. Note: I am not saying that Tesla&#x27;s FSD will be coming to a street near you anytime soon. BUT, I haven&#x27;t heard or understood a well articulated argument that says &#x27;lidar is really the only practical solution&#x27;.<p>This also doesn&#x27;t factor in that I&#x27;ve heard Lidar doesn&#x27;t work well in any kind of precipitation (light being refracted away from the sensor). Also, full self driving doesn&#x27;t mean it can drive in situations that humans WOULDN&#x27;T be comfortable with (i.e. snowy blizzard or thick fog) so in either solution shouldn&#x27;t be factored in as a part of the required solution set.<p>And finally, the practical threshold on a FSD system that would pass regulatory approval is evidence&#x2F;data that it is materially safer than a &#x27;typical&#x27; human driver. It seems the &#x27;throw millions of cars and billions&#x2F;trillions of miles at it&#x27; with a refined tagging system that approaches the narrow vision solution for driving forward in &#x27;driveable space&#x27; seems to be most likely to reach a solution first.')
