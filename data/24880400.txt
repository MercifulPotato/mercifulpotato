This is how some functional languages e.g. Erlang emulate mutation. A function holds the desired state in a closure and evaluates to a new function closure with updated state. It&#x27;s also how a stateful object system can be trivially implemented in Scheme.<p>A few of pieces of the Erlang OTP infrastructure are actually just an elaborate mechanism to reintroduce global mutable state i.e. the process registry or Mnesia.')
