LiveConnect was commonly used as glue to invoke and interact with applets from JS.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say that it enabled a virtually unlimited blah blah enterprise parp, but it had its uses. A common hack was to put some shared storage in an applet so multiple documents could use it to persist and communicate cross-document data, back before browsers could do that natively.<p>There was some really tedious bug in IE with the Sun VM that occasionally allowed JS events to fire concurrently whilst LiveConnect was waiting for a response from a method called on an applet, which we never quite figured out. This was one of many things that made JS+applet development unreliable and unpleasant.')
