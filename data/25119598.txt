See big tobacco, big oil etc.. Their statistics and data is cherry picked and portrayed deceptively. It&#x27;s a big difference from good faith data. Yes, it&#x27;s easy for bad actors to muddy the waters with intentionally biased and skewed data.<p>To equate intentionally misleading data with legitimate data and say &quot;See data is a matter of opinion!, Why vaccinate, reduce c02, stop smoking, or anything like that!&quot; is irresponsible.<p>Do you believe in vaccinations? Will you take up smoking? Can we spread lead gas fumes around your house? I&#x27;m guessing you would not be on board with those. There&#x27;s a thousand more examples like that. If you aren&#x27;t okay with them, then at heard you don&#x27;t even agree with what you said about analysis being subjective.')
