A scarf makes a huge difference.  Probably larger than you would think.<p>Chicago will probably get a &quot;polar vortex&quot; in February or March.  It will be a week of really cold weather and then it will be over.  You&#x27;ll probably find that November and December are warmer than you expected.  January is a bit dreary, but only because of the reduced daylight hours (compared to LA).  Chicago is just a bit further north than NYC, but compared to Paris or London it gets a lot more winter daylight.<p>The think I&#x27;ve noticed about winter since moving to Chicago is that the really sunny days are the coldest and the cloudy days are warmer.  If you&#x27;ve got large south-facing windows, you might need to close the shades or even open the window slightly when it is really cold.  That sun can be intense!')
