But in my opinion it shouldn&#x27;t be the <i>required standard</i>. Since I can markup just as easily in JSON And like it or not JS <i>is</i> one the the core web components today, we can make JS the standard (we can keep it safe by allowing defining a <i>safe</i> subset of JS - e.g. JSON - which would work with general scripts disabled), with support for plain ol&#x27; HTML.<p>Point is, JSON can replace HTML, while preserving everything you like about HTML but not vice versa.')
