My elderly parents called me and were alarmed that WhatsApp is threatening with removing their account unless they agree to share their data. They wondered if FB will be able to track their transactions or perhaps even get into their bank accounts. After years in the tech industry, I&#x27;ve learned that my parents&#x27; feedback is a good predictor for how well my messaging will be perceived by the wider world. I would have assumed that at FB they would do something similar (or rather, that their testing is 100x more sophisticated), so it&#x27;s bizarre that they would miss the mark with messaging and with their prediction of overall success when it came to something so strategically important and sensitive.')
