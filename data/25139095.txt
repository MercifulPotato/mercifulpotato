It was picked for technical use because of that.  Naming something &quot;nigger&quot;, even in a technical would do what, offend some other piece of code?  If somebody chose an offensive name arbitrarily (like, say, &quot;git&quot;), I would understand the impulse.  Though the former is fraught with specific and awful connotations towards a very specific group (American blacks) whereas the latter is simply a general derogatory term (which is tacky, but not unbearably so).')
