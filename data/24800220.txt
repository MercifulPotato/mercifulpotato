In a trial a judge will often tell the jury to disregard information that has been improperly brought forth. It&#x27;s difficult to enforce, but what wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to have something similar in the court of public opinion?<p>Also, it&#x27;s a slippery slope argument, but I&#x27;ll point out that &quot;once it&#x27;s been said, it&#x27;s true&quot; is a social anti pattern. If I lie, and someone else quotes me, does that make it information that is &quot;out there&quot; or is it just noise?<p>FWIW, the more we learn about this story, the more similar it sounds to my extreme example.')
