Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608762317, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25519549, text='&gt; Personally I would not be opposed to facial recognition in school and I don&#x27;t think there is any expectation of privacy in schools.<p>I disagree for a number of reasons.  First of all, we are dealing with children that are largely under 18, and are not able to provide consent to be monitored.  As such, I think we should tread very carefully, with a tendency towards violating their privacy as little as is possible.  I&#x27;m not convinced that the problems facial recognition will solve are prevalent enough to warrant foisting an extremely invasive monitoring system upon people who cannot reasonably consent to that monitoring system.<p>Additionally, school is legally mandated.  Even if the children were of age to consent, their consent is effectively void because of coercion.  They do not have the option to say &quot;no&quot; unless they can afford to pay for a private school.  I don&#x27;t think &quot;privacy for the rich, state surveillance for the poor&quot; is a good paradigm.<p>I understand where you&#x27;re coming from, keeping kids safe is important.  But I think it&#x27;s important to remember that even though they&#x27;re kids, they should have rights, and it&#x27;s up to the rest of us to protect them.')
