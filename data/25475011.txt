I suppose we may end up seeing Blender Cloud offering remote renders using AWS&#x27;s infrastructure, which is good news unless it means tying the rendering engines to Amazon tech.<p>For context, here is a brief overview of the 2019 financial report of the Blender foundation :<p>- 33% of income (316 k€) from individual sponsors<p>- 28% of income (267 k€) from EPIC Games<p>- 27% of income (257 k€) from other corporate sponsors<p>- highest salary: 58.4 k€<p>- lowest salary: 32.5 k€ (55% of highest)<p>- 43% of expenses (416 k€) were salaries<p>I really like Blender, and seeing it thrive in the last years has brought me immense pleasure. I hope that I have the chance to work with Blender again, and benefit from the recent improvements.<p>Congratulations to the Blender Development Fund for this new sponsor, which I hope will bring value to the project.')
