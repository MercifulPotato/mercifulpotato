Mind that atomic does not mean that it has to be about details, I usually create flashcards for each abstraction, that is, besides asking for details, I also write a question for the full sentence.\nThis is one way to prevent the loss of resolution, but sometimes it is time consuming to write all those flashcards (think about a long proof).\nAnother way to do it, is to write down the answer pen-and-paper, that way you are forced to focus on the details, not just the big picture: no loss of resolution.')
