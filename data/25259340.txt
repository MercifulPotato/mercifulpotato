I&#x27;ll focus on your claim, though.<p>&quot;Sending mRNA to human cells to produce viral proteins&quot; describe how all of the other vaccines work. You&#x27;re saying that this one uses DNA. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a typo or if that&#x27;s an important difference. However from what I understand, the two other vaccines people are talking about don&#x27;t <i>change</i> any of the genetic material in your cells. They just send other genetic material that makes use of the translation equipment in some of your cells. It sits next to your existing genetic material, and then (I&#x27;m guessing?) just goes away.')
