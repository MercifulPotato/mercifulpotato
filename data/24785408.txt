The code has already shipped and they’re pressuring you to move on to the next problem. Anything you haven’t nailed down by the time the customer is happy is not going to get nailed down. The time you get is the time it takes. So if you genuinely haven’t gotten enough time, then you need to slow down and take the time now, because there is no after.<p>There’s only been two times my code could kill someone, and you bet your ass I didn’t deliver it a moment faster than I thought reasonable, and in one of those cases it ended up being fast enough (the other was, in retrospect, already doomed before I got there)')
