I&#x27;m not sure at what point that became a problem though. Although still to this day many people are here in the US undocumented. The extent of that being a problem I&#x27;m sure we could debate. It&#x27;s certainly not fair for those who attempt to play by the rules though.<p>Is Canada xenophobic? They won&#x27;t allow just anybody in. I&#x27;m not allowed to move to New Zealand without some legal work visa thing they made up. What about France? Can I move to Japan? Why do I have to sign papers to move to any of these countries?<p>I&#x27;m fine if you want to advocate for open boarders (and I think it actually would be great, but we need far fewer people on the planet to make it work) but I think you really should be consistent about it.')
