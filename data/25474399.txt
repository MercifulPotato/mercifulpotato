Instead of doing things myself, I tried to hire people to do it for me.<p>I tried a few different things, data labeling, custom sewing work, custom car modifications.<p>Turns out that the work was either done badly when it came to fairly common tasks or people refused to outright do it when it was custom work. I&#x27;ve seen the same thing when I looked at what happened when friends hired others.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s a point where you have enough money to hire highly qualified people. But I doubt it&#x27;s anywhere below $10M net worth. Below that you&#x27;re just not likely to start handing out $150 per hour for what I would consider fairly standard yard or other work. At least I&#x27;m not.<p>Or maybe the trick is to hire a supervisor as well. So first you hire someone to do the work and then you hire someone to supervise it. Unless of course the supervisor also does a bad job. But then I can hire a supervisor for the supervisor.<p>Most likely I just wasn&#x27;t good enough in the hiring process. So I probably should have hired someone to do the hiring for me. But what if I hired the wrong person, because I&#x27;m not good at hiring?<p>Now I&#x27;m sitting on piles of money and I&#x27;m still doing everything myself.')
