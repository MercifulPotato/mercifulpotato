This power is established, even reinforced, by the arbitrariness that a state can include or exclude aliens on a whim. I can&#x27;t think of a way to change this for physical borders given the entire world has settled on this system, and it seems more borders are being erected for the digital world too. You&#x27;d need to take down the concept of a state with a finite realm of influence to take these borders down.')
