I&#x27;d seen Arnold&#x27;s work on teaching mathematics, and I&#x27;m very much aware of the dry formalism in Bourbaki books. However, I was not aware of the Arnold-Serre debate.<p>But the thing that really caught my eye here is your claim that there were visible effects of Bourbakism polluting mathematics.<p>Do you have any examples or specifics of that &quot;visible effect&quot;. My question is a genuine one, not a challenge to what you are saying.')
