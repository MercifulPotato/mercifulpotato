These protocols can potentially make it so you can&#x27;t use that pi-hole at all.<p>Traffic that is local to a network being unencrypted is not a huge privacy problem. If this protocol was adopted by local resolvers, your pi-hole or network router could use it for any requests it makes while still preserving its ability to filter the traffic. It&#x27;s basically all win under this scenario.<p>The problem comes back to applications implementing this in ways that can&#x27;t be managed taking the option away from end users and administrators. Without the protocols specifying control and fall-back behaviours on networks that don&#x27;t need or want this, it&#x27;s more harmful than useful.')
