Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611740679, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25924233, text='&gt; Does it have full support for all the kinds of stacks people are running on Linux today?<p>No, of course not; the only thing that supports everything that Linux supports is Linux. But most use cases don&#x27;t use every part of Linux.<p>&gt;  Is there a robust ecosystem of MirageOS users online able to help troubleshoot issues from the simple to the arcane?<p>I doubt it, but how do we get to there from here except by more users starting to use it?<p>&gt; Is it supported by VPS providers the world over?<p>Yes, since what you build is just a VM image.<p>&gt; However, if the answer to any of these is &quot;no&quot;, I have a hard time seeing how &quot;just abandon Linux wholesale for NewShinyThing&quot; is a viable option for more than a tiny subset of users. (Even if they&#x27;re all &quot;yes&quot;, it&#x27;s still a wildly unrealistic expectation...)<p>I don&#x27;t disagree as such, but I do think that at this point building anything on these insecure foundations is throwing good money after bad &#x2F; building castles on sand. Probably 95% of the time you build something that serves your present business purposes, accept a certain amount of insecurity, and get on with your life. But it&#x27;s worth putting a bit of effort into looking for better ways to do things.')
