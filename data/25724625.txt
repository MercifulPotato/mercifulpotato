Item(by='vehemenz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610340183, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25719208, text='&gt; <i>You are building up an incorrectly narrow vision on what a coup actually looks like, then using that to declare this to be a non-coup.</i><p>That&#x27;s fair enough. Living in the present, we usually have a blind spot about how present events relate to others in history. It&#x27;s likely that some peasant revolts throughout history were just as stupid and chaotic as this one.<p>However, the events on Wednesday were particularly complicated. There were many factions and ideologies present. There were MAGAs, QAnons, &quot;Federalists&quot;, neo-Nazis, COVID-deniers, Blue Lives Matter supporters, Boogaloo Bois, Proud Boys, Moms for Trump. There was but one shared allegiance—Trump.<p>There were five separate raids into the building, each as unorganized and chaotic as the next. Not a single rioter inside the Capitol was seen brandishing a firearm (I did see a few outside the Capitol though, via live streams). Many of the rioters were destroying things, but even more were marching through the hallways and rotunda &quot;saying their peace&quot; (from interviews I saw later, many thought they were still legitimately protesting). While there were a few dozen paramilitary types among the mob—or to stop the &quot;coup&quot;, as they see it—their intentions were closer to fantasy fulfillment than a coup. One of the &quot;zip tie guys&quot; was there with his mom.<p>There was a lack of organization, little actual violence, no realistic attempt to seize anything, let alone a realistic chance to seize power in the first place. Throwing &quot;attempted&quot; in front of &quot;coup&quot; does not change the fruitlessness of the proceedings. In hindsight, I don&#x27;t think even the worst case scenario would have changed much.<p>Regardless of the criteria we use to determine this case, I argue that it&#x27;s not clear cut, and the use of &quot;coup&quot; and &quot;terrorism&quot;—as many outlets have—to describe the whole affair, especially before the dust has settled, seems like an overreach. And it&#x27;s exactly the kind of thing that Trump supporters are constantly accusing the &quot;mainstream media&quot; of perpetuating. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s an uprising, revolt, insurrection, seditious riot. All of these terms are accurate enough for now.')
