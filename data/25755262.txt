There are a number of type warnings on 64-bit systems. The build system cannot be used for cross-compilation, and compiling&#x2F;installing it is a disaster kind of generally.<p>Runit&#x27;s licensing is all over the place, and its documentation is incomplete&#x2F;inaccurate. It&#x27;s been abandoned by its creator, as near as I can tell. I tried to get in touch with him a couple of years ago to offer some fixes, and got radio silence. There is no apparent way to contribute code to the project.<p>I&#x27;ve never used the busybox version, and so I can&#x27;t speak to that one. But upstream runit has been a dead project for years, and badly needs to be forked by the distros that use it.')
