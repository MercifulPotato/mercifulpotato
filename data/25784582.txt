The most recent 3 of those years at FAANG earning a hefty salary. Maybe it&#x27;s just COVID-related depression or something, but I don&#x27;t feel the joy I used to feel from coding. I look at the next level on the promo ladder and think... what&#x27;s another $XXXk in RSU&#x27;s going to change about my life? I need a change.<p>I recently started tinkering on the beginnings of a no-code eCom brand that I&#x27;d like to build up into a &quot;lifestyle business&quot; a la 4-Hour Workweek. I can&#x27;t share much about it yet because I&#x27;m still researching my market segment, but I&#x27;m reading and learning a lot about product design, branding, and business that I never gave much thought before.<p>It&#x27;s not the unicorn dream that many on this site have, but there are a lot of single digit millionaires living their best life off this kind of business.
