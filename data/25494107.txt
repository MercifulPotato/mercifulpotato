Unix-likes have an actual VFS as an API and it happens (at least on every unix-like I&#x27;ve worked on for any bit of time, which is mostly Linux but I expect BSD has it as well) to allow for comparatively wondrous workflows.<p>Windows programs also often only support &#x27;CDs&#x27; (ISO9660 &#x2F; UDF), FAT, NTFS, and maybe SMB&#x2F;CIFS (Samba &#x2F; CIFS) network shares.  Since Windows lacks (or at least historically lacked) a general VFS they could target.  That&#x27;s why any actual VFS that ever gets made, due to all the legacy software, is either going to directly support one of those interfaces, or have a compatibility mode which does.')
