Financially speaking however NASA has spent less to buy launch capability from SpaceX than it would have to otherwise.<p>From the R&amp;D perspective NASA doesn&#x27;t really have any say in how Starship&#x2F;Superheavy are developed, which is the cutting edge of space launch. Nor does it dictate the timeline or milestones of the program. Not the same compared to the EU&#x27;s initiative.<p>In fact, SpaceX&#x27;s success shows a different path: let the private sector innovate, provide support in terms of know-how, credibility and potential contracts.')
