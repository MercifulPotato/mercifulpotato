Item(by='barumi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601616320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24658590, text='&gt; Looking at confirmed case numbers leads to bad conclusions because those numbers are almost completely worthless.<p>They really aren&#x27;t, and trying to portray official numbers as &quot;worthless&quot; is something that flies in the face of reason. In the very least they serve as a verified conservative estimate, or a reliable lower bound.<p>Moreover, it&#x27;s stupid and disingenuois to claim that &quot;majority of cases are never counted in official statistics&quot; because &quot;official statistics&quot; represent only test results taken at specific moments in time, and never were assumed to represent the total number of cases.')
