Guix reinstalls (and take forever doing it). The Nix installer is much faster. You also need to make sure you import keys when installing Guix because security.<p>Doing any package related thing will tell you about a failure to install locale. This is straight out of the box Guix if you&#x27;ve installed it on, say, Ubuntu. This is not a good out of the box experience. It blows. If you Google this error you are told to install glibc-utf 8-locales but on my Ubuntu base system this doesn&#x27;t actually solve the error.<p>If you the user can clamber over these two landmines well it&#x27;s an awesome Emacs package repository. This is actually where Guix wins over its cousin and as an ardent Emacs user its fantastic to have all the most esoteric packages and weird builds of Emacs like emacs-pgtk-native-comp I source from a Guix user channel and install declaratively from a manifest.scm file.<p>Guix should lean into this one major strength and put out an Emacs-centered heavily opinionated installer image that uses EXWM for its window manager.')
