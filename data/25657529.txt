Thanks for mentioning that. I&#x27;ve been using it for years (albeit in LAN-only mode, I don&#x27;t like clouds). Need to re-evaluate it now (not that I trust China&#x27;s gov particularly less than US gov at this point, but I prefer apps that don&#x27;t give any governments obvious remote access capability). Do you know of any good alternatives for hassle-free WiFi file transfer?')
