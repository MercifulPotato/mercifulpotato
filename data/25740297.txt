He was idealistic and brilliant.  His death was as sad as it was unnecessary.<p>After his death though, I always found it inappropriate when obituaries and memorials called him a reddit cofounder.  He joined reddit as part of a merger and didn&#x27;t stay on long before being let go.  The original founders didn&#x27;t consider him a cofounder, and until his death did not have the nicest things to say about him.<p>Personally I think there&#x27;s better things to remember him by than that rather negative chapter.  He created a lot of good outside reddit.  Personally I still use RSS to this day, and am occasionally reminded by that of his story.')
