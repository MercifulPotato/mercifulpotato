Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence to <i>establish them as true</i>. But that doesn&#x27;t mean extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence to <i>investigate</i>. You investigate the claims in order to <i>see what kind of evidence there is for them</i>. I would expect the actual peer-reviewed paper, which unfortunately this article doesn&#x27;t link to (I hate when pop science articles do that), to lay out in more detail what the evidence is and why Loeb thinks it establishes his claim.')
