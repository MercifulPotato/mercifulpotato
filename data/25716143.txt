People elected fascists in Germany. They elect socialist regimes on a regular basis. It&#x27;s not automatically good because the majority looks for it.<p>I&#x27;d argue that democracy can only work if there are mechanisms to protect the minorities from the majority. Because otherwise democracy always ends up as oppression.')
