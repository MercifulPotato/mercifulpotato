If the FOIA is rejected for national security reasons, that&#x27;ll be explicit. Public records laws and regulations don&#x27;t apply to a big company like Google, so they can stonewall you forever and not have to explain what their policies are or how they were enforced.<p>Public authorities are at least theoretically accountable to the public, unlike a billion-dollar megacorp which isn&#x27;t accountable to any force on this planet.')
