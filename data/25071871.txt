Also - both in London and in Tel-Aviv - I had never known any business who bought second hand servers or workstation. I&#x27;m sure these businesses exist - but every IT person I&#x27;ve ever talked to only buys new.<p>The US 2nd hand equipment economy makes sense to me, but no other place in the world does.')
