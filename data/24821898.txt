Visit &#x2F;r&#x2F;malefashionadvise and follow the basic starter guide, i.e. chinos, white oxford shirt, and leather shoes.<p>You DO NOT need to spend 2.5k to look good: aim for 100-200 from ASOS.com and you&#x27;ll look fabulous! You can order multiple sizes of the same product and return those that don&#x27;t fit. Fit is key!<p>Check eBay for good quality shoes if cost is an issue (e.g. Meermin, etc) as imho that&#x27;s generally the large cost in the wardrobe.')
