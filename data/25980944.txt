They believe in contextual application of the law, faction and outcomes-based speech tolerance, racial&#x2F;gender&#x2F;religious collectivism, and therefore racial consciousness, find markets to be inherently exploitative, determine equality&#x2F;equity in accordance with population outcomes, and tailor systems around producing equitable collective outcomes, and believe in designing systems that are less principled in their means so much as they are pragmatic in pursuit of their ends.<p>As a liberal myself, I find this faction of the left (AOC&#x2F;Robin Diangelo&#x2F;Ibram X. Kendi&#x2F;Ilhan Omar etc) to be the furthest political faction from my own.')
