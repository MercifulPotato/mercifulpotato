If Mark Cuban were born in Libya there&#x27;s almost no chance he becomes a billionaire for instance.<p>Or you can pretend like the reason you&#x27;re rich is solely of your own doing, and that the world owes you something.<p>Cuban seems to be the former, and while he&#x27;s not going to volunteer to just give all his money away, he is trying to help society collectively improve.  It&#x27;s a stark contrast between his approach and say, the Koch brothers.<p>I guess the best way I&#x27;d put it is Cuban is a capitalist who believes in the social contract.')
