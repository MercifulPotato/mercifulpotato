It does. It always will and always has. It isn&#x27;t just utility that is useful for building things. It is a universal truth and until someone can prove it actually does not, then it does. No ones lived experience changes this.<p>And it&#x27;s not just about finding facts and attaching moral or ethical considerations to them. It&#x27;s about making claims of knowledge in ways that are _falsifiable_. Any claim must have a way of being proven wrong, otherwise it isn&#x27;t something we should accept into the discourse of what is knowledge and what is not. 2+2=4 is a claim that is falsifiable and therefore valid to propose.<p>&gt; ...but I don&#x27;t think that the majority of left-wing post modernists are anti-science per say<p>I don&#x27;t think most right wing people are either - except when it is convenient. People appeal to science until it doesn&#x27;t help or in fact is detrimental to their cause. Science will make us uncomfortable and I agree that many bad things have been done because &quot;science&quot;. But at the minimum, claims from eugenists were falsifiable and in time they have been disproven.<p>And yes I agree, we need to be careful how we interpret things. I love the left&#x27;s idea that &quot;race is a social construct&quot;. I 100% agree it is. Yes, there is DNA that determines race and people are therefore biologically &quot;different&quot; - but it&#x27;s unimportant. The social constructs that exist made race into something more than it is. It&#x27;s no more important than nose shape, or eye color, or fingerprint shape, etc.')
