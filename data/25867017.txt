I have a example00@fastmail.com address, does this mean that I can also register example01@fastmail.com and example02@fastmail.com as an alias on my account, and it will seem like I have three accounts and recipients will never known about example00@fastmail.com if I send from one of the two aliases? Do I then also &quot;own&quot; example01@fastmail.com and example02@fastmail.com in the same way I &quot;own&quot; example00@fastmail.com while a customer?. If understood correctly, I could register an alias for mailing lists, and disable it if too much spam is received without ruining my main address.')
