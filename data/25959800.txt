The irony is that the attempt to be “inclusive” is actually exclusive to some. For example, George Washington is a hero to many Americans, as is Paul Revere. Stripping their names, to be, makes me feel less included. While naming a school after Barack Obama seems to be on trend, but historically just as fraught with moral minefields as any other former president.')
