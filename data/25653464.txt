Item(by='tekstar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609894233, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25652275, text='Just to chime in, I bought a CNC and 2 3D printers from Kickstarter over the years.  One was junk, one was a scam, and the other ran out of funds before they shipped a unit.<p>The first CNC (MyDIYCNC) was 6 months late and the quality was horrible.  The two MDF walls that held the metal Y axis in place were pre-drilled more than an inch apart.  It was sold as a budget CNC printer but in reality was basically useless except as a learning exercise in what matters in CNC design.<p>Of the two 3D printers I bought, neither arrived.  The Peachy Printer was a cute, simple, and cheap design.. after many updates of adding complexity and delays one founder accused the other founder of running off with the funds and buying a house, but did so in such a weird way one has to wonder what the hell actually happened.<p>The other 3d printer I don&#x27;t even remember the name.. it was supposed to be high quality and cost around $300 CAD.  Manufacturing delays and issues, they cancelled the whole thing and shipped nothing.')
