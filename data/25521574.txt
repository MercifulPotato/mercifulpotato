Very engaging UX &#x2F; text.<p>By the way, I hated the Spotify ads so much I paid up for YouTube Music + Premium. Even though the Spotify Windows app is VERY usable compared to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;music.youtube.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;music.youtube.com</a>. Good Lord, I hated those ads. I know the conspiracy theory that they were designed to be irritating so that you pay up, but that only works in a world without much choice; ;now you have YouTube Music, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and Deezer. Spotify, I&#x27;ll readily pay up and switch if you improve those awful ads.')
