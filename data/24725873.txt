The Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment generally requires law enforcement agencies to obtain a warrant before searching cell phone data, but there is an exception for “exigent circumstances,” which is supposed to apply only to extreme situations in which lives are in danger.<p>It seems like a clear cut abuse of power. These aren&#x27;t exigent circumstances, they&#x27;re protests, and besides that it&#x27;s not a federal problem. It seems like the 4th amendment doesn&#x27;t have any power any more.')
