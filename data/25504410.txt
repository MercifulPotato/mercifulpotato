Item(by='aww_dang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608628168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25504219, text='&gt;The clowns that run this world frequently view gold as a problem, a threat, and they work hard to suppress its value. They also occasionally get caught doing so. If they can figure out a good way to do it, they may assault the value of Bitcoin, directly or indirectly, given the chance.<p>How do you feel about the theory of BTC acting as a controlled opposition to gold?<p>I find it interesting that the same CNBC commentators who slam gold promote BTC as &quot;digital gold&quot;. If gold is so useless in their eyes, why is intangible &quot;digital gold&quot; being pushed? Despite the anti-establishment veneer of BTC, it is accepted and promoted by the MSM. Gold is still derided.<p>There&#x27;s a parallel with the captured, walled-garden Internet. BTC&#x27;s lack of usability, Mnuchin&#x27;s words on self-hosted wallets all point to this so called disruptive technology being captured. Similarly, platforms like PayPal taking an interest in BTC point in the same direction.<p>Looks more and more like a steppingstone, positioning of goal posts towards CBDC.')
