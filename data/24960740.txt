For every death there are many more people that just barely survive after a hospital stay, and data suggests a significant amount of those people will have long-term problems.<p>...where long-term means a few months at most. People do recover, just uncomfortably slowly.<p>&gt; Second, if the hospitals are overloaded by such people (even if most of them survive) then the IFR of Covid can rise higher than 0.5-1%.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure about that. These IFR estimates haven&#x27;t changed much since spring, when half of those hospitalized died.[1,2,3] Our treatment methods have improved since then. If the estimates reflected the IFR with treatment, they would be lower today. So I think an IFR of 0.5-1% is actually the worst case.<p>Unfortunately, I  haven&#x27;t been able to find any source explicitly comparing death rates with vs without treatment.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;laninf&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS1473-30992030243-7&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;laninf&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS1473-3...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;in.dental-tribune.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;new-estimate-by-the-cdc-brings-down-the-covid-19-death-rate-to-just-0-26-as-against-whos-3-4&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;in.dental-tribune.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;new-estimate-by-the-cdc-b...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;32234121&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;32234121&#x2F;</a>')
