I wouldn&#x27;t venture to say it was educational or intellectual in any sense, but it was still pretty fascinating - even as a ten year old - to observe what was essentially a bunch of fake people run around on my little P3. IIRC there were user made characters that had custom bot files with distinct &#x27;personalities&#x27;, so you could throw together different combinations of bots in different maps and come away with some very different encounters.')
