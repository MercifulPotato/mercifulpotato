Tests were done on Abbott Labs equipment (though the results sheet did not specify the particular assay - there are 2). My results were a high multiple of what would be considered &#x27;positive&#x27; for both and were consistent with the timeframe of my illness.

I hear that it is available for approximately $60 if you just pay retail for it. If you give blood at your local blood bank, many are offering the antibody test as an incentive to donate.')
