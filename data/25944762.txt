Every time a competing car is sold, Tesla gets the subsidy instead of the maker. Then Tesla can use it to continue building out the supercharger network which everyone benefits from.<p>GM, Ford, VW, Toyota... these are multi-billion dollar companies, several of which have received massive subsidies from the US government themselves. Forcing Tesla to subsidize their myopic competitors as sort of perverted corporate tort in the US is crap.')
