After a decade in new Zealand I see it&#x27;s problems very clearly as compared to the uk and while I&#x27;ve witnessed my birth country melt down spectacularly over the last few years, I can also see that my home country has a bleak future without a significant change of course.<p>If anyone reading this does move to a new country please take on just one piece of wisdom from me when you do so: Do NOT establish a friend group in your new country that consists primarily of other expats. You&#x27;ll get stuck in an echo chamber where comparisons between places are always de jour. This should be recognized as toxic. To properly settle into a new place conversation is best done inside your own head with yourself or (sparingly) with your partner. Being careful about this can make all the difference between successfully integration and, well, other less desirable outcomes.')
