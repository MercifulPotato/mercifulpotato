They seem to think other EU members will be angry with how the EU are treating the UK in this matter and will also want to leave. This point seems nuts since the EU is basically fighting for it&#x27;s members vs a non-member, kind of shows why it&#x27;s better to be with them than againist them. Considering this hasn&#x27;t fully played out, their constant bragging on the matter seems foolish. Especially considering the EU clearly has more power. The UK is in an extremely vulnerable position overall and seem to be making their position unsafer by the day. The damage the UK goverment is doing to the EU relations will, I suspect, haunt the UK for decades. I suspect if this carries on for a year or so, the UK will end up in a trade war with their closet and largest trading partner during one of the largest recessions ever.<p>I highly suspect this is going to cost AstraZeneca big.')
