Buy 5 of these, each with two SATA SSDs&#x2F;HDDs, SFP+ uplink to cheap 10G switch [1], run k8s&#x2F;k3s, might even be able to squeeze in Ceph.<p>2.5G switches are expensive and rare. If you want to make use of multiple links to an L2 ToR, you have to set up LACP which is annoying. You could do ECMP for L3 LB instead, but that requires an even more expensive switch.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mikrotik.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;crs317_1g_16s_rm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mikrotik.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;crs317_1g_16s_rm</a><p>EDIT: as for commitment, I&#x27;m literally looking to solve the problem of &#x27;I want a low power k8s cluster, and I&#x27;m okay with a switch SPOF&#x27; for bgp.wtf&#x27;s FMT location. If I could buy 5-6 of these, with 10G uplink, especially ready to rack, I&#x27;d probably order them today.')
