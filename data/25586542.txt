She told me all that low end production was going to be outsourced to lower cost places, and that the US would be mostly management.<p>I was stunned that not just a person, but a school could be so stupid. What, did they think the Chinese could make shit but would never learn how to manage things or design them? Worse yet, they can now do design, production, logistics, and the US no longer knows how to make a lot of things.<p>I&#x27;ve even read that Krugman now sees that as a mistake.<p>Way to go, followers of Jack Welch.')
