Definitely not as much as coal or fossil fuel for example. Sure, they’ll burn, but not hot enough. Most domestic waste has a calorific value of not more than 16 MJ&#x2F;Kg, and you need at least 15 MJ&#x2F;Kg for ignition. Meaning, you need to add some other fuel to make it burn. Coal for comparison gives off 15-30 MJ&#x2F;Kg, so it’s right on the edge there. Industrial waste is a different ball game, but then industrial waste has lots more toxic stuff.<p>Source: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.igniss.com&#x2F;calorific-value-waste" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.igniss.com&#x2F;calorific-value-waste</a>')
