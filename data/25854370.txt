Google could any day they want rewrite an API that brave depends on (like one used by adblockers) and it would instantly have caught lots of Barve users with a Bad Browser, many not knowing. Brave lives even more on the whim of Google than Mozilla does. It&#x27;s like using Windows 10 with telemetry ripped out instead of switching to Linux. Good enough for some, not for all, bad to depend on in the long run for most.')
