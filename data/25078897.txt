Topic and people inspired the movie <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> and was at the forefront of the national consciousness in the late 1950s and early to mid 1960s.<p>As a set of ideas and concerns, it was beaten to death at the time, revived a bit during the “nuclear winter” thesis of the 1980s, and always was and continues to be an active issue at the Federal level.  Mismanage nukes and you can be booted out even if you are the Secretary of the Air Force.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-airforce-idUSWAT00960720080606" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-airforce-idUSWAT00960...</a><p>It is a very, very deep rabbit hole.

If he reincarnated immediately, he’d be in his mid 30s.<p>How old are you, landfish?  Is that you, Kahn?<p>For everyone else, repeat after me, nuclear weapons are weapons of policy, not weapons of war.  Nuclear weapons are weapons of policy, not weapons of war...')
