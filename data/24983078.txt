DigitalOcean continues their march towards irrelevance.<p>First it was the app platform and now this. Gouging us at $0.10&#x2F;gigabyte bandwidth charges makes us: (1) think less of you, and (2) adds a bunch of cognitive complexity &amp; work to developers&#x27; lives.<p>If this is how it&#x27;s going to be we may as well just use AWS or move on to one of your competitors that isn&#x27;t trying to pretend that bandwidth is expensive. It isn&#x27;t, and there isn&#x27;t any reason we should have to design applications around artificially absurdly inflated costs.<p>Even Oracle pretends to understand this. _ORACLE_ are the ones trying to make the case that they aren&#x27;t only about having hostages&#x2F;locked in customers.<p>When Oracle is beating you on this metric you&#x27;ve <i>really</i> jumped the shark.')
