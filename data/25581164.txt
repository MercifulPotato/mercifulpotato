You can charge them to download the source code. You can charge them to download pre-compiled executables. Someone else could build it and put it up online, but you&#x27;d have the only authoritative source, the first word on updates (including security updates), the only source that they can trust hasn&#x27;t been manipulated, and the first-mover advantage. And if someone goes to a shady site to download your software to avoid paying you for it, maybe they can&#x27;t afford it and you should look the other way.')
