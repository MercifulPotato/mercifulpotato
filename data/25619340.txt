They don&#x27;t have either.<p>Google maps may or may not be good for road travel, I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t drive. They certainly seem to suck for public transport planning because of silently added walking times that you can&#x27;t turn off, and overcomplicated 3D-chess like UI, that&#x27;s hard to navigate and automatically jumps around the map for no really discernible reason.<p>On a recent holiday, I had to constantly switch between gmaps and one other app with better actual mapping data&#x2F;display (just because one has better public transport data, and the other is better at actually being a map - having things like a scale!, or contour lines).<p>A lot of walking&#x2F;cycling tracks were just not there in gmaps at all, nevermind the washed out display style of the map tiles and lack of clearly visually defined features you typically orient yourself by when walking, like houses, or other important things you need when planning a walk, like contour lines. Or let alone a scale for quick orientation on how far something is at the current zoom level.<p>All they really have going for them at this point for me is public transport data (not the UI though).<p>A case in point:<p>Google &quot;maps&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;megous.com&#x2F;dl&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;46f0e2aff9573bba.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;megous.com&#x2F;dl&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;46f0e2aff9573bba.png</a><p>Actual maps: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;megous.com&#x2F;dl&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;003b6d5bc0f15199.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;megous.com&#x2F;dl&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;003b6d5bc0f15199.png</a>\n(with forests where forests really are, lol)')
