Enough applications statically link their libraries that this is not a reliable strategy.<p>If you can&#x27;t trust a library author to keep their code up to date, it&#x27;s probably also a mistake to trust them to use your system libraries in a way that minimizes their attack surface.<p>I also have problems with Flatpak&#x27;s security model, particularly with their UX around permissions. We already learned from Android&#x2F;iOS that allowing highly permissive manifests out of the box was a bad idea. But at least Flatpak is trying to do <i>something</i>, and that something seems like a tangible improvement to me. The idea that our systems will be secure because we dynamically link everything needs to die; it&#x27;s not a viable security model.<p>Even if the only thing that Flatpak does is kill the &quot;dynamic libraries make me secure&quot; perspective, that on its own will be worthwhile.')
