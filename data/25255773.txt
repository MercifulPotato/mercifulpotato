Yes it is!&quot; discussion. Note that<p>&gt;According to Professor Moult, a score of around 90 GDT is informally considered to be competitive with results obtained from experimental methods.<p>So if we go by &gt;= 90 as solved:<p>&gt;In the results from the 14th CASP assessment, released today, our latest AlphaFold system achieves a median score of 92.4 GDT overall across all targets.<p>they solved for their targets, but<p>&gt;Even for the very hardest protein targets, those in the most challenging free-modelling category, AlphaFold achieves a median score of 87.0 GDT (data available here).<p>They basically admit they still haven&#x27;t &quot;solved&quot; it for &quot;most challenging free-modelling category&quot;<p>Take that as you will, not sure how useful the &quot;&gt;= 90 is solved&quot; criteria is since they call it &quot;informal&quot; themselves.')
