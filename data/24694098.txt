I&#x27;m just saying that people should educate themselves on the symptoms and RUN if they can&#x27;t manage their boundaries. If they do have someone in their life and can lure them to therapeutic thought, that is a huge net good. What worries me about the current discourse is otherizing them like rounding them up will solve the problem. Do not work for them, do not date them, but do understand that they are humans and to otherize them is an open door for an amorphous scarlet letter that is very difficult to take back when wrongly applied.<p>I don&#x27;t have a solution. I don&#x27;t think in our society, we, have a solution. To some degree the NPD person is the exemplar ubermensch of what our society is selling us. Look at the gleeful schadenfreude and two documentaries about that Fyre festival guy. He WILL run for office at some point in the future and people will eat it up. They are a race condition of, that operating within, the exact terms that are fed to us all day telling us to succeed at all costs in ways that keep all of us fucked.<p>I suspect the reason to vilify the vampire is to avoid looking at what made them and the knowledge that they&#x27;ll always be a predator even when they know what not to eat. There are no good options, but I know the best option isn&#x27;t making personality disordered people into untouchables. For one, they&#x27;d love that. They thrive on that and can dedicate more energy to gaming that than most people can imagine. Maybe that&#x27;s how we got to now. I dunno, but I&#x27;m just advocating for some sympathy for the devil even if you stay far far away from it.')
