The value of a bitcoin is driven entirely by speculation. There&#x27;s no news driving prices. The only news is ever about the price itself.<p>Every purchase is also a sale. Every vigorous post about how much you should be buying bitcoins is also a statement that somebody wants to sell theirs off. It&#x27;s no surprise that mainstream investors have no interest in that.<p>Not that investors are above cheering on stock market bubbles and other speculations. But they at least know that there&#x27;s some value there setting a floor for what a stock is really worth. A bitcoin has no way for me to evaluate its real worth, and all I hear in &quot;bitcoin at alltime high&quot; is &quot;bitcoin getting ready to crash again&quot;.')
