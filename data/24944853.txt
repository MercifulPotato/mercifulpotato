For laptops, you can desolder the chip and run magnet wire outside the case. With a little work, you could attach the magnet wire to the SD cardreader contacts inside the case.<p>There are also chips with fuses you can blow to make them write once. Somewhere back in my comments is a link to a datasheet.<p>But all of that doesn&#x27;t really matter, because OEM&#x27;s don&#x27;t ship firmware images with checksums or signatures.')
