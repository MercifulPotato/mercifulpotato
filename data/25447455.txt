Many of those are work trucks, and most won&#x27;t fit car seats for three kids. While Americans buy lots of SUVs, many Americans do <i>not</i> have one, and for those, transporting three kids is indeed a challenge.<p><i>&gt; From a pure financial standpoint, I&#x27;d look more to the cost of education, healthcare, and housing.</i><p>Housing definitely comes into play, but I don&#x27;t think the other two end up being major factors in the decision because they are so far out. In the US, you literally <i>cannot leave the hospital with your baby</i> if you don&#x27;t have adequate transportation and an approved car seat. So Americans are made acutely aware that they need to have a transportation solution for their family <i>right now</i> before choosing to have a baby.<p>Healthcare is a non-issue for many because their employer-provided insurance covers as many kids as they have. Education is somewhat far down the road and fairly fungible so it&#x27;s less likely to be a showstopper.')
