[1] It&#x27;s been around for years.<p>Who needs better than 1080p from a <i>webcam</i>?<p>You can manually adjust focus, exposure, color temperature, shutter speed, zoom, everything you need.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got that, everything else is lighting. Most people <i>drastically</i> underestimate how much of photo&#x2F;video quality is actually about lighting, as opposed to the camera or lens.<p>As for audio, if you&#x27;re investing in the higher quality of an external webcam anyways, then you&#x27;ll never want a microphone <i>in</i> the webcam. The placement is inherently bad.<p>You&#x27;ll want either a lapel mic for normal interviews or meetings, or a podcasting mic on a desk tripod for more serious stuff. A mounted shotgun mic is a kind of in-between option too if you don&#x27;t want it visible.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.logitech.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;products&#x2F;webcams&#x2F;c920-pro-hd-webcam.960-000764.html?crid=34" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.logitech.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;products&#x2F;webcams&#x2F;c920-pro-hd-...</a>')
