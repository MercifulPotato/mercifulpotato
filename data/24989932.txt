Yup, it boils down to &quot;Install PiAware.&quot; I mean, at least put a twist on it and build your own half wave antenna or something!<p>What would impress me would be two SDRs, one monitoring ADS-B and the other tuned to VHF, pulling down the ATC radio transmissions, recognizing the speech, deducing the tail numbers, and then visually associating them with the ADS-B traces on the map. Now that would be impressive! I&#x27;ve had VHF and ADS-B on my roof for the past few years but never got around to doing the speech parsing.')
