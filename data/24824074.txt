I&#x27;m sure you are all familiar with those — getting an out-dated onboarding doc when starting a new job; digging through multiple tools to find a spec you swear you saw before; answering the same question over and over in Slack — you name it.<p>We believe in the power of good written communication, especially in today&#x27;s remote-first environment. Slab is laser-focused on fulfilling this need.<p>We built Slab to be the best knowledge base for your entire team. We focus on the editor, post management, and search. We&#x27;re not trying to be your issue tracker, calendar, or any other tangentially-related tool. Instead, we integrate with other tools that fit your workflow.<p>Some other features I wanted to highlight for HN:<p>- Editor: Our editor has a simple and easy UI but still support advanced usages like code syntax highlighting and Markdown-type shortcuts.<p>- Unified search: You won&#x27;t miss any potential search hits just because you are looking into the wrong place, our search covers Slack, Dropbox, Google Drive, GitHub, Box, Asana, Confluence, Trello, and more tools.<p>- Verified posts: You can assign a maintainer to each post and Slab will remind them to keep posts accurate.<p>Looking forward to your feedback and happy to answer any questions you have!')
