We are talking about technology here, not overall life experience. Everyone starts out life on the same footing, with zero experience, and has the innate potential to learn how to live it. But computers are a very specific, highly specialized machinery that the vast parts of the population will never be able to directly understand or fix. I can drive a car but I don&#x27;t know the first thing about fixing it.<p>You could claim that no one should own technology if they don&#x27;t understand it intimately, but that is a different kind of logic and argument. It&#x27;s silly to conflate the two.')
