However, while the main focus of DOSBox is for running DOS games, DOSBox-X goes much further than this. Started as a fork of the DOSBox project, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for. But it is also a platform for running DOS applications, including emulating the environments to run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software written for those versions of Windows.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;joncampbell123&#x2F;dosbox-x" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;joncampbell123&#x2F;dosbox-x</a>')
