That corporate culture changes with time? That you can&#x27;t trust companies like you can humans? I&#x27;m genuinely curious with which part you disagree.<p>It&#x27;s nice that you can feel morally superior by working at Google (I assume you work there by how hard you are claiming they are good) but please realize that sentiment is not universally shared. _You_ can trust Google to do the right thing but the replies in these comments alone show that there&#x27;s at least a noteworthy amount of people who are distrustful or at least would rather not have to be trustful of Google. And this also applies to other mega-corporations too.<p>You not having concerns doesn&#x27;t invalidate other people&#x27;s concerns. Trust does alleviate concerns but for some people trusting a corporation is a very tenuous emotion.')
