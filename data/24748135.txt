Even after PG&amp;E bought the electricity to meet their renewables quota, it was cheaper to waste it than to build the transmission infrastructure.<p>Renewables have the inverse of the problem you described: They are <i>too</i> distributed, and it&#x27;s hard to get enough to power a community without running transmission lines over hundreds of miles.<p>Yes, the centralization of infrastructure required for efficient nuclear energy production is a problem. But don&#x27;t forget that renewables have equivalent problems.')
