I compare Tesla to Apple: they&#x27;re technological leaders who set the benchmarks (and own the patents) but who also keep a relatively small and simple product matrix. There&#x27;s loads of computer form-factors that Apple doesn&#x27;t produce products for (e.g. rugged laptops, industrial control computers, &quot;affordable&quot; computers, and so on) - the demand for these products which are typically lower-margin are met by other manufacturers and I see Tesla being fine with this: let Toyota, GM, etc stress over meeting demand for a sub-$30k BEV while making hardly any profit.<p>I think the importance of self-driving &#x2F; autonomous cars should also be considered. GM has Cruise, but Toyota, Ford, Honda, etc are either uninterested for some reason, or hoping Google or Apple will license them their Waymo or Titan system, or playing catchup very, very slowly - given Tesla is looking like they&#x27;ll make their FSD an open-beta this year (and a public 1.0 release before the year&#x27;s end, I hope!) that further widens their moat and with their current (overinflated, I admit) valuation that could see them buy-out a smaller carmarker to cement themselves should anything detrimental happen in the medium-term.')
