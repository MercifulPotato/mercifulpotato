It feels like you&#x27;re complaining about a sort of cultural appropriation.<p>Functional ideas are sometimes good, and they should be borrowed and used in nonfunctional contexts. Like continuation-passing-style got lifted and used to inspire promises and async&#x2F;await. That doesn&#x27;t mean languages with async&#x2F;await are functional, or that programming with async&#x2F;await is taught as functional, it&#x27;s just the pedigree of the idea.<p>React hooks lift some ideas from algebraic effects, and embed them in a decidedly nonfunctional, VERY non-pure-functional context. But the pedigree of the idea is still... algebraic effects.')
