I&#x27;ve had similar feelings about myself and whether or not I&#x27;m disabled. My left arm is crooked from two childhood injuries and doesn&#x27;t turn over more than about 30%, it&#x27;s called a Madelung deformity[1], it showed itself after my second injury when my arm was healing from a fracture when I was 10 years old.<p>Most of the time, it&#x27;s pretty invisible for me and everyone else, but there are things in day-to-day life that are a chore if I think about it, such as cutting food with a knife, exercising, or even trying to hold something at a certain angle with my hand can be uncomfortable. It&#x27;s kind of silly, but I also can&#x27;t play guitar standing up, as the angle of turning my wrist over is too uncomfortable to stay in position on the fretboard. Sitting down is similar, but I can play longer as I can hold my elbow closer to my body.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;radiopaedia.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;madelung-deformity?lang=us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;radiopaedia.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;madelung-deformity?lang=us</a>')
