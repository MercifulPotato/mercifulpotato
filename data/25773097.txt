Item(by='jjude', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610607734, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25771083, text='I take notes in an atomic way (other than clipping interesting articles). Because they are atomic, many of the notes are linked in one manner or the other (either via &quot;concepts&quot;, &quot;daily log&quot; etc.). So whenever I revisit one of the &quot;concepts&quot; node, I visit these atomic notes.<p>Also, obsidian has a &quot;open a random note&quot; button. Thus I open a random note once in a while to see if I can learn (or relearn) something + to see if that note is still relevant for me.')
