If I can describe it with one word.<p>8 years of hype to launch what looks like an Early Access game.<p>It&#x27;s glitchy, it&#x27;s buggy, it doesn&#x27;t run well unless you have an RTX card and DLSS enabled. And that&#x27;s barely passable.<p>But those can eventually be fixed.<p>The core of the game, the massive open world, is incredibly superficial, with nothing to do in it. CDPR crafted a beautiful, detailed world, with braindead AI and overly simplistic gameplay.<p>There&#x27;s no roleplaying involved like you would find in Deus Ex. There&#x27;s no extracurricular activities that doesn&#x27;t involve shooting a bunch of bad guys like you would find in Red Dead Redemption 2. You won&#x27;t find tight gunplay like you would see in Destiny 2.<p>The AI completely lacks any sort of intelligence. Enemies rush you without the sense of self-preservation. Oftentimes standing there letting you blast them in the face. Cops spawn literally yards behind you without any chase, or any threat. Walk a block down and they completely forget you exist. No bounty on your head, no search and apprehend procedures. But stand next to them for 3 seconds and they&#x27;ll shoot you on sight.<p>Really, there&#x27;s not much to do except shoot things. Guns feel impactful enough, if you use revolvers or tech weapons, and melee combat is passable. You can go for a stealth or hacking approach, but those don&#x27;t feel as good as just pulling the trigger on some thugs. Hacking is just pointing your reticle at someone, and then make a selection from the menu. And depending on what you chose, sparks just fly out of their head. That&#x27;s it.<p>The story is engaging, yet forgettable. This is a cyberpunk setting, but it&#x27;s in appearances only. There&#x27;s all these talks about megacorporations taking over the world, but only one corporation takes center stage. There&#x27;s no political intrigue, no conspiracy theory that actually turns out to be true, no investigation into a greater mystery. Keanu Reeves is literally taking your breath away and you go out to make sure that doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>Your personal backstory is forgettable. It&#x27;s literally 20 mins long, and your entire introduction to Night City is a montage. CDPR failed the show, don&#x27;t tell aspect. They could&#x27;ve squeezed in a few good hours of character development and worldbuilding with the opening hours. Instead, you get taken straight into Night City, told to care about certain things, and want to have this lofty ideal of becoming a living legend for some unknown reason. You don&#x27;t have a story to tell, there&#x27;s a story being told to you.<p>The characters definitely carry the narrative, from Silverhand&#x27;s personal vendetta, to Panam&#x27;s sense of belonging, and Takemura&#x27;s strong honor code.<p>Regardless, I did enjoy this game. But there&#x27;s so many glaring flaws that becomes hard to ignore.<p>So it pains me to say, I do not recommend this game. The numerous technical issues make this equivalent to an Early Access title. But the gameplay loop, the promise of an immersive experience, a sandbox for you to get lost in are totally nonexistent. It&#x27;s a beautiful world CDPR created, but it&#x27;s just a glorified loading screen going from one mission marker to another.<p>It&#x27;s all style but no substance.&quot;')
