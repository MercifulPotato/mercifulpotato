But that&#x27;s not the case at all, and it&#x27;s obvious from your second graph. Do you believe that in 1950 ~70% of women were idle, doing nothing? Of course not. They were doing all sort of societally valuable work. It just wasn&#x27;t in the form of a paid job. And that&#x27;s my key point here: there is plenty of stuff that needs doing that would make the world better. It&#x27;s just that a lot of it hasn&#x27;t been converted into paid jobs that would show up in a graph like this. Just try thinking about all the things wrong with the world and ask whether more people helping with them could make them better.<p>Secondarily, a decline in the labor force participation rate can have all sorts of causes. The formal definition is &quot;the percentage of the civilian noninstitutional population 16 years and older that is working or actively looking for work.&quot; Labor force participation rate for people 16-19 is low. Is that because there&#x27;s nothing a teen could do? No, it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re in school. Labor force participation rate for people over 65 is even lower, ~15%. And over recent decades, we&#x27;ve seen that that segment of the population grow rapidly. So the labor force participation rate has declined significantly because people are living longer and enjoying retirement.<p>And of course, there&#x27;s plenty of overlap in the two factors. After my dad retired, he spent a lot of time volunteering at a school. The kids definitely needed the help, but he was unpaid. That&#x27;s a great example of something for people to do that wasn&#x27;t counted as part of the labor force. Similarly, my aunts spent a ton of time helping raise their grandkids after they retired. Because of politics and accounting rules, that&#x27;s not a formal job, but it&#x27;s absolutely socially valuable labor.')
