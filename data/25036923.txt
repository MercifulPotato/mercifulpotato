In reality forcing users to select through the myriad of cookies that many sites set isn&#x27;t practical, and doesn&#x27;t get round the fact that you still would have to &quot;Receive users’ consent before you use any cookies except strictly necessary cookies.&quot;<p>A better technical solution would be to enforce that web applications respect a client header that specifies the level of cookies the client will allow (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdpr.eu&#x2F;cookies&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdpr.eu&#x2F;cookies&#x2F;</a>).<p>An even better solution to this would be to stop the invasive tracking and profiling of users that has brought us to this point at all.')
