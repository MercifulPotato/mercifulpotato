It is <i>possible</i> that my body quantum tunnelled from the USA to China, through the earth&#x27;s core, and picked up the virus.<p>But these events are <i>exceedingly improbable</i>. Therefore neither deserve the merit of future study.<p>Besides... Hypotheses <i>must be falsifiable</i>. That&#x27;s how science works. Anything else is just click-bait. So I question that this article has any real utility at all except possibly fanning the flames of racism or sensationalism.')
