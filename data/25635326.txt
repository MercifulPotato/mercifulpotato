Using obscure acronyms to arbitrarily focus on race and ethnicity (something frowned upon here in Europe at least) + the hyperbole of &quot;fighting totalitarianism&quot; doesn&#x27;t give me great confidence that this is representing workers, as much as it is pushing the ideology of a vocal minority.<p>If they truly believe they represent the majority of Google employees, then they are free to widely share this call internally and see how many people actually agree with them and want to join their group. So far, it&#x27;s ~0.2K out of ~260K employees.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alphabetworkersunion.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alphabetworkersunion.org&#x2F;</a>')
