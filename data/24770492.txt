One can try -- and try fruitfully, for these theories have been useful in practice -- to match &#x27;money&#x27; and &#x27;inflation&#x27; and &#x27;debt&#x27;, in their macro senses, to everyday experience, with the caveat that they&#x27;re aggregate concepts that affect individuals and various productive activities differently, and that they (money especially) can behave a little weird.<p>What happens instead is that people have feelings about what these concepts are <i>supposed</i> to mean, and then use that to make a political statement. The reason armchair- and pseudo-economists are so eager to say things like &quot;Money is really about X&quot; or &quot;Money is really about the opposite of X&quot; is they want to hijack the word &#x27;money&#x27; and the meaning it has in the brain and turn that into politics.<p>These confident takes are more directly engaging, whereas economic pronouncements are wonky and weird in a way that&#x27;s more relatively neutral or at least not obviously political, so the gravitation is towards the bad and confusing takes.')
