With a bit more extra complexity, the app could do raymarching on a interpolated height map: this would remove triangle artifacts around &quot;cliffs&quot; on the height map. It would still be real time 60 fps even on smartphones.<p>To do something like this, you need to know a bit of WebGL and a bit of JS. No frameworks really needed at this level. The best guide to WebGL I know of is this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webgl2fundamentals.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webgl2fundamentals.org&#x2F;</a><p>Complexity starts when the height map isn&#x27;t enough and you want to make arcs or otherwise arbitrarily shaped structures. This is where you&#x27;d need a framework, unless you want to implement all the math and glsl yourself.<p>And as always, the idea is really the 1% of the work. Anyone can say &quot;it&#x27;s just a height map on a sphere&quot;. 99% of the work is materialising the idea, debugging glsl, fixing ugly bugs on smartphones and esotheric browsers, dealing with partial WebGL API and so on.')
