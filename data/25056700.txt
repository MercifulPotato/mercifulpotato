It&#x27;s a measure of risk reduction.<p>It sounds like 94 participants have become ill with COVID. Fewer than 9 of them were in the treatment group.<p>Sample risk of catching COVID: 94&#x2F;N. Sample risk of catching COVID, knowing you&#x27;re in the treatment group: 9&#x2F;N. The risk of catching COVID, knowing you&#x27;re in the treatment group, compared to the overall risk of catching COVID: (9&#x2F;N)&#x2F;(94&#x2F;N) ≈ 0.096. Decline in risk due to being in the treatment group: 1 − 0.096 = 0.904.')
