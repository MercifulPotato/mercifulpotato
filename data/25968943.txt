Item(by='joshspankit', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612013887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25963846, text='&gt; I think you might underestimate how deeply and inexplicably confused people can get.<p>&gt; ...<p>&gt; It&#x27;s extremely hard to anticipate all the ways someone might become confused and adding additional material to resolve a potential confusion risks introducing other new and novel confusion.<p>I actually support this argument. I also concede that it’s easy to point out the information in hindsight. But I will still argue that a vital part of building a company of RH’s size and branding is about taking the time to think deeply about the customer experience. To be the experts. To distill that expertise carefully when designing each service and each app screen.<p>Just based on how RH potentially “sold shares out from under people”, and how the accounts are automatically margin accounts as apparently stated on some part of the user agreement; RH was specifically aware of how this would violate user expectation and they chose not to address it. It’s very difficult, I feel, for someone to argue on the basis of “well yes, of course they were margin accounts, it’s obvious to anyone who knows about how stock accounts work because &lt;blank&gt;” because RH was specifically designing their platform around people who <i>don’t</i> know how stock accounts work.')
