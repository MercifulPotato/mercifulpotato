I used to work at Amazon before moving to FB and the difference in internal tool quality is night and day.<p>FB approaches internal code development with the same data driven rigor as their business decisions. Everything is measured, so I knew for example that the slow build times I was experiencing were slower than 99% of everyone else. Easiest hardware request ever.<p>So it should be no wonder that even tests are measured. Flaky tests get disabled. That&#x27;s nice and keeps trust high in the test framework. The downside is that you are likely to forget to fix the disabled test, so now some functionality that was important enough to test in the first place becomes untested and leaves room for others to introduce regressions. This has happened in my team, but the pace at FB is so quick that there is no way to tie up all these loose ends without giving up your personal time. Or maybe it requires someone more diligent than me.<p>Either way, I just wanted to share that I personally found the idea of measuring test runs and acting on insights from thise measurements really powerful. It&#x27;s a theme that can be found at all levels of FB infrastructure.')
