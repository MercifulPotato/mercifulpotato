Or is it for just sharing any personal content? I was unclear on that.<p>Edit: looked it up <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;showhn.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;showhn.html</a>) and it says &quot;blog posts, sign-up pages, newsletters, lists, and other reading material. Those can&#x27;t be tried out, so can&#x27;t be Show HNs. Make a regular submission instead.&quot;<p>And I am not sure why the images aren&#x27;t loading. The server isn&#x27;t under any undue load it looks like, but Someone did mention that if javascript was blocked some content would 404. It could be that perhaps?<p>I&#x27;ll have to test the site more, but thank you for letting me know!')
