Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[25579360], score=None, time=1609309949, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25577812, text='&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Democratic ownership can counter act the tendency to grow and absorb competitors, because each new worker who gets a vote waters down the votes and control of their fellows. Plus the bigger the organization gets, the slower and less responsive it will get. And a democratic organization run by its workers will have a myriad of motivating factors to balance, other than chasing infinite profit or return for the investors.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s like saying no one will want to buy shares of a large conglomerate or vote to have it merge with another one because the shareholder&#x27;s votes will be watered down. Empirically false, happens regularly in practice. Especially when the larger company with less competition could pay higher dividends&#x2F;wages.<p>No it isn&#x27;t.  Shareholder capitalism is one-<i>share</i>-one-vote, but those shares can and usually are concentrated under the control of a small number of people.  The GGGP seems to be talking about a system of one-<i>worker</i>-one-vote, which would prevent that kind of concentration and therefore have a different dynamic.  Also, shareholders tend to monomanically pursue maximization of dividends + capital gains over some time horizon, while I&#x27;d imagine a worker would care a more diverse range of things.')
