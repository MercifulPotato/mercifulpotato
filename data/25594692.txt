Businesses donating to STEM-for-schoolgirls programs is a way for them to assuage their conscience (or to do PR) without having to ask what they can be doing directly to solve the actual problem.<p>And I&#x27;m afraid this increases the perception that men are naturally fine at STEM and women need special support <i>because of inherent gender attributes</i> (and not because of social problems that we could just address at the root)... which at the end of the day makes life harder for women in their careers.')
