Features are not added to C++ on a whim. They are added because they make programming in new C++ a better experience than old C++. New C++ code is faster, safer, smaller, less bug-prone, and more fun than old C++. C++20 is much more fun than C++17, which is better than C++14, which filled out lots of features from C++11.<p>Do not trust anyone suggesting any virtue in more C-like C++ code, or in actual C code. We left those behind for reasons.<p>C++23 will be better than C++20.')
