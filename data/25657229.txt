[0]<p>They&#x27;ve built a language for distributed ledger platforms based on Haskell with defined state transitions based loosely on traditional contract law. For exactly the reasons you&#x27;ve mentioned, this makes modeling the participants, rights, and obligations of a smart contract use case incredibly efficient.<p>Whether smart contracts are useful or not remains to be seen. There seems to be a lot of potential in the finance and supply chain worlds.<p>When thinking about DAML it makes me wonder how impactful something like Cobol was in reality. Definitely found use and even long term value add, but transformational? I don&#x27;t know.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure what the technology comparison should be for DLT without DAML. There&#x27;s only so many use cases or niche areas where it&#x27;s valuable.')
