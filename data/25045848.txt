I was trying to emphasize that just because exams are unproctored at Stevens, doesn&#x27;t mean that there are no systems in place for detecting and disciplining cheaters.<p>The honor system is also about expectations. Other universities expect you to cheat, and put extensive administrative controls in place to prevent that. The Stevens Honor System expects you to be honest, and to hold yourself and your peers accountable. So investigations and hearings for honor code violations are conducted by students, not staff. The administration doesn&#x27;t get involved until it comes time for penalty enforcement.<p>So yeah, the end result is the same as any university: you can not expect it to bode well for your academic career if you cheat or plagiarize. But the structure is different, as is who ultimately bears responsibility for inquiring and investigating claims of academic dishonesty.')
