Obviously there need to be products that fit your purpose BUILT by someone for you to buy one. Several times I&#x27;ve been in a position where people around me pushed me into using something that remotely looked like it solves my problem. Since I was the one doing actual analysis and work, I knew I&#x27;d spend a lot of time digging through internals of said product to bend it for the use case. They also claim that they don&#x27;t believe that there&#x27;s not some existing software that exactly solves my problem and I&#x27;m creating something just for the sake of it. Let&#x27;s be honest, these people are full of crap thinking about software engineering only superfluously. There&#x27;s no silver bullet.')
