I knew the name, but nothing else until tonight. He seems very popular, that’s great I don’t really care for a lot of music made before my time. And I don’t care for what he has done during my time.<p>Coldplay boring, David Bowie never got into this music. U2 well let’s just say I was one of the people that went through the process to get their free album removed from my iTunes account. Eno seems exactly the type of music I wouldn’t care for. The fact that I made it this far without knowing who he is and finding all the stuff he has touched not what I like seems to validate that.<p>At what point is it no longer my burden to explore something more until I am no longer a philistine in your opinion?')
