You are right that my edits made a mess, I didn&#x27;t even do a good job of fixing it on my last edit. I didn&#x27;t know at the time that I removed the Fauci remark that you had already (correctly) pointed out that it was wrong. If anything I should had added an edit to that statement pointing out that it had been correctly discredited. I was fiddling with the edit&#x2F;update button because I typed too quick, then felt the urge to clarify and remove extraneous material so as not to sidetrack things. I shouldn&#x27;t have used the edit as a preview feature. I am well reminded that this does a disservice to anyone in the middle of a reply.')
