But I think the point is that if you&#x27;re using WhatsApp (especially group chats), there is a high chance that Facebook, Google AND Apple end up storing your personal data - even if Facebook might not have access to message contents (but Google and Apple still do). Still your data is all over the place. Doesn&#x27;t matter if you disabled cloud backups because the people you chat with most likely didn&#x27;t. With Telegram your data is stored on their servers - but but only on their servers.')
