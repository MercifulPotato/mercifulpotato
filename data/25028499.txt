So every time a GNU tool is used in the private back-end part of a SaaS webapp, that&#x27;s directly opposite to the spirit of the GNU project, because you, the end user, have no way of modifying said SaaS.<p>&gt; Also, I would be very hesitant to release anything valuable with LGPL or even GPL these days.<p>The point of the AGPL is to close the loophole that allows this abuse.
