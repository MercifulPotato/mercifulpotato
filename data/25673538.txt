Funny how they keep calling Trump the god emperor, when it&#x27;s really Big Tech and Big Media. Just look at the comments on this post. No one is complaining about censorship; they&#x27;re all claiming it should have been done sooner!<p>I bet no one one here has looked at one alternative news source for the past four year and eats everything CNN&#x2F;MSNBC&#x2F;FOX&#x2F;NPR feeds them.<p>This is how the freedom to speak fails. I hope the big take away is that people start moving further and further away from these big platforms, and take their friends with them.')
