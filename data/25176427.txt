He wanted to double-check, though, and he suspected that if an answer to the same problem already existed, it would be locked in an inscrutable volume by the German mathematicians Wolfgang Weil and Rolf Schneider, an 80-year-old titan in the field of geometry. Domokos is a professional mathematician, but even he found the text daunting.</i><p>&gt; <i>“I found someone who was willing to read that part of the book for me and translate it back into human language,” Domokos said. He found the theorem for any number of dimensions. That confirmed that cubes were indeed the 3D answer.</i><p>I&#x27;d like to know who this someone is, that&#x27;s an unsung hero of science right there! So much existing knowledge is locked away in &quot;daunting tomes&quot;')
