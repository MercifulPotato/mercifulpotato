It&#x27;s estimated there should be about ~1000 such objects in the solar system at any given time, and they all represent priceless data about the material composition of the universe outside of our solar system.<p>People weren&#x27;t <i>not looking</i> for them, but by their nature no one knows a way to find them reliably (other then, find all the things, look for anything which has a hyperbolic trajectory relative to the sun).<p>Same problem with an intercept plan: we would like to do it, but the problem is not particularly tractable with our current space technology. Up until we saw Oumuamua we didn&#x27;t even have a baseline for what we might expect the behaviour of objects to be - which is a problem when you&#x27;re coming up with a propellant budget for a space mission, since you have no idea how much fuel or weight you can afford for an intercept.<p>As it stands, we probably need to see a couple more Oumuamua-like objects to develop a reasonable expectation of the frequency of different classes and come up with a mission-profile which we can reasonably expect we&#x27;d be able to launch at one in the next 20-40 years. Or a way of establishing a permanent capability (which is not focused research its &quot;yes, let&#x27;s build the lunar gateway station and develop a long-term La Grange point mode for the Starliner - which is also something which you&#x27;d do if you were colonizing Mars).<p>This is my point: nothing here benefits from &quot;it was aliens&quot; as a starting point. In fact, all of this useful work is pretty explicitly &quot;it&#x27;s probably not aliens&quot;. Because if aliens have gone to the expense and trouble to scout the solar system, then we basically don&#x27;t need to do any of it - &quot;it was aliens&quot; closes research paths. If we&#x27;re sure it&#x27;s aliens, then a much more cost-effective strategy is waiting for them to send another probe that assuredly would move in to study the most interesting thing in Sol - us. Which will be much easier to see because we look closely for Earth-orbit objects.')
