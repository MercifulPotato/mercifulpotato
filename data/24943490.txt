Item(by='dietrichepp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604073110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24943376, text='My website is getting a bit big to shove the entire thing into a Git repo, unfortunately. At the very least I would want to have sparse checkouts.<p>I’ve thought about Hugo but it might require a serious migration effort. My current website is written in Go templates so I can do something like:<p><pre><code>    {{.SrcFile &quot;_src.c&quot;}}\n</code></pre>\nAnd it will read _src.c and set it up to be highlighted using C syntax rules. Leading underscore just means that the file doesn’t get deployed. This is just one example, there are a number of different things I’ve added to my website like this over the years.<p>Things would be different if I had chosen a static website generator from the start rather than letting things evolve naturally from hand-written HTML files. Currently, what I want to do is get rid of the templating and use DOM manipulation, so I’d write the above like<p><pre><code>    &lt;src-file src=&quot;_src.c&quot; &#x2F;&gt;\n</code></pre>\nJust because it would make editing the files more convenient. Putting something like C source code directly in an HTML file is too much of a bother, and I put a <i>lot</i> of source code in my website, so anything I can do to save time here means I can write more articles. Markdown makes it easier to embed source code but it’s just not good enough to replace HTML for my use case.')
