It&#x27;s going to take me some time to set-up how I want to use it (some script writing) and it&#x27;s not really a priority right now. I think there was a promotion when I got it and probably did so with the thought that I may benefit from a grandfathering policy if the price increases or something. Didn&#x27;t really think I&#x27;d put it off so much (it&#x27;s been like 3 years maybe), but it just happened. It&#x27;s very cheap though, so I think it&#x27;s fine.<p>Maybe your case is something like that. They plan to use it, but are putting it off and thought that signing up earlier rather than later would be better.')
