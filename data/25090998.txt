Many socialists want to (and do) use markets as part of their desired transition. Capitalism is not actually pro-market by default, it just uses markets to accumulate capital. Left to its own devices, anticompetitive (i.e., anti-market) behaviors always arise.<p>Capitalism vs. socialism is not markets vs. a planned economy. It&#x27;s about who owns the means of production.<p>&gt; Socialism (absent central planning) doesn&#x27;t have a means of allocating capital, so no one has ever tried it for long.<p>China&#x27;s doing it right now via state capitalism, erring on a side where they allow capitalists to exist in an extremely controlled fashion and they regularly jail or put to death those who violate their rules - or they seize segments of industry. Socialists often create transitional plans where they maintain much of the same system but with significant curtailing of private property.<p>Other socialist countries &#x2F; groups have operated largely by collectives, where initial capital is raised jointly with the government but once a venture is going it self-sustains as a collective bringing in new capital and divying it up by and to workers. Vietnam runs a mixed system where this is the dominant mode of production (the other is a China-style &quot;controlled&quot; capitalism).<p>Socialism is also a pretty wide brush. Rojava is communalist and local councils are the primary vehicle for regulating and controlling production. EZLN is anarchist-ish and nearly everything is a collective or co-op, with workers pooling capital to start a venture but also working within it and sharing alike. There are many ways to do socialism.<p>&gt; When they do, everything falls to the tragedy of the commons.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what this is referring to.<p>&gt; Even authoritarian socialists agree to this.<p>No such thing as &quot;authoritarian socialists&quot;. That&#x27;s not a self-identity or an ideology, but a pejorative produced by liberals and the folks that take that libertarian-made political compass too seriously.<p>&gt; Socialist anarchists have various opinions but agree that socialist organization is an unsolved problem.<p>Anarchists tend to think that it isn&#x27;t even a problem. Once they win, they depend on self-organization.<p>&gt; No one is prevented from setting up a socialist organization in capitalist countries, its merely the case that when they do, they aren&#x27;t able to externalize their costs and they don&#x27;t achieve very much.<p>I mean, socialists can organize a party or something within a capitalist country, but you can&#x27;t do socialism within a capitalist country. The entire system&#x27;s function is dictated by capitalism - a co-op, for example, is still competing with all the other capitalist companies and has to follow the rules set up for them or perish.<p>Not sure what you mean by externalizing costs. If you&#x27;re thinking of co-ops, they absolutely can and do externalize costs.<p>&gt; Then all forms of what you consider to be socialism will fail because of plunder.<p>I don&#x27;t see why.<p>&gt; yeah, its not cool to mess with other people&#x27;s stuff. that&#x27;s the problem here.<p>Depends on what that stuff is. Private property is distinguished from personal property in a socialist view.<p>&gt; Maybe if &quot;getting a footing&quot; wasn&#x27;t synonymous with expropriating the capitalists this wouldn&#x27;t happen.<p>If socialists weren&#x27;t socialist this wouldn&#x27;t happen? This doesn&#x27;t make any sense and it doesn&#x27;t address the point.<p>&gt; This is true. its also the case that rulers over a mixed economy have vastly more wealth at their disposal than rulers over a command economy and a collective that has norms prohibiting the collection of rents. This is because the market generates more wealth and rulers are able to extract more wealth because there is more wealth.<p>So the story goes. The expropriation of value from the Global South has something to say about that, though.<p>Unfortunately, there is a very selectively-enforced limit on political content that has resulted in me being rate-limited, so I&#x27;m unable to respond to you in a timely manner anymore. I&#x27;d point you at some resources but I feel like that&#x27;s condescending. Best of luck to you, friend.')
