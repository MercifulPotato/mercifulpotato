Freeing an entire arena&#x2F;resetting an allocation pointer is both much faster and simpler than `malloc`&#x2F;`new` &amp; `free`&#x2F;`delete`.<p>People often misunderstand &quot;custom allocators&quot; to mean &quot;making your own `jemalloc`&quot; and it feels like your comment runs the risk of fueling that fire. Creating your own `jemalloc` is both wasteful in that `jemalloc` performs worse than even the most simple of custom allocators and a waste of your time in that general purpose allocators already exist so if you need something like that you probably can save your time for something else.')
