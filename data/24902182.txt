Instead he posited that the universe is material and God is not outside of it:<p>&quot;Now, the word create does not mean to create out of nothing; it means to organize; the same as a man would organize materials and build a ship. Hence, we infer that God had materials to organize the world out of chaos-chaotic matter, which is element. Element had an existence from the time [God] had. The pure principles of element are principles which can never be destroyed; they may be organized and reorganized, but not destroyed. They had no beginning and can have no end&quot;[1]<p>Mormonism is the rare religion where there isn&#x27;t anything incompatible with religiosity and science. Other than the whole no physical proof&#x2F;requiring faith thing, of course- but the theology itself fits fine within a scientific cosmology.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.churchofjesuschrist.org&#x2F;study&#x2F;ensign&#x2F;1971&#x2F;04&#x2F;the-king-follett-sermon?lang=eng" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.churchofjesuschrist.org&#x2F;study&#x2F;ensign&#x2F;1971&#x2F;04&#x2F;the...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eom.byu.edu&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Matter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eom.byu.edu&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Matter</a>')
