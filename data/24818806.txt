Would differences in different types of binaries be distinguishable by human audio pattern recognition?<p>Also useful for this would be maximally permissive image representation requirements for the trip back to binary.  Of course, this would be difficult for binaries meant to be executed as code, as arbitrary binaries are unlikely to be executable, but for transformation of images to audio it should be much simpler to ensure that any image makes a valid, playable audio file.')
