Do we have to be so principled about all this? Holocaust Deniers are bad. Full stop.<p>We all keep going back and forth on these principled stances about how freedom of speech is some holy thing that should be protected at all costs no matter how much damage it causes.<p>That notion is absurd in my experience. This philosophical ideal of true freedom of speech doesn&#x27;t even exist! 4Chan still has to censor child porn - and thanks God! Child pornography is horrible and no one should ever be able to hide behind the guise of &quot;free speech&quot; to get away with dissemination of it.<p>You know what else is horrible? A huge population of people were tortured, starved and gassed to death with numbers in the millions. But do you know what happened after that ended?<p>People tried to pretend it didn&#x27;t happen at all.  And they still are. Now, I&#x27;m not Jewish, but just thinking about that makes me sick. The idea that someone is out there gaslighting people into believing the holocaust doesn&#x27;t exist is despicable.<p>If you proposed holocaust denial on this website you&#x27;d be in violation of its rules and be flagged or banned. The site is better because of these rules.<p>And finally, I&#x27;d like to pose a thought experiment -<p>If Hitler were alive today, how do you think he would gain power? Misinformation campaigns, appeals to white nationalism and racist dog whistles on one of the major social networks no doubt.<p>Of course, Facebook, Google, Twitter etc. are dealing with a very similar scenario right now with Donald Trump who has intentionally divided this country to its breaking point all while likely (indirectly) killing thousands of people by sending them confusing and false messaging about the coronavirus and don&#x27;t let me forget he&#x27;s literally stated his intent to steal the election if he loses. You know, basically just textbook fascism.<p>Ban them. All of them. Today.<p>Edit: Made things sightly less emotionally charged and rage-baiting. Apologies for the harsh (er) words. I understand it&#x27;s not in the spirit of the discourse we want to encourage here.')
