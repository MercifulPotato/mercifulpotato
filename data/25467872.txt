As to why someone would sit on such a committee, that&#x27;s a much better question. I suppose they might be flattered to be invited. It looks good on a resume and they might get some speaking gigs out of it? But I don&#x27;t see how someone with the necessary expertise to be considered could also be ignorant enough to take Google at their word.')
