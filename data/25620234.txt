Hence, you get a very biased viewpoint of historical events.<p>I have no judgement of the Germans here, but I would wager, that the British have not been good citizens of humanity.<p>The British have caused more suffering, deaths, and misery, either direct, or indirect, because of their actions around the world for the past 500 years.<p>I believe it was the Germans, that finally brought balance to The Force, and knocked the British off their high horse.  And for that, I believe the rest of the world owes the Germans a huge debt of gratitude. But bury that Aryan supremacy bullshit, because that was rather annoying.')
