There&#x27;s a few stores that have reasonable web stores, but most have a single web page that was updated in 2017.<p>Also helpful would be a browser plugin (or something) that would allow me to find the product on Amazon and see if it&#x27;s available locally.  I do this with books all the time (find on Amazon, find the ISBN number, and the go put it into the local bookstore website).  The local bookstore also does local deliveries.')
