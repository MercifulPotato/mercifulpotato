But that is just taste, in terms of quality, in the sense of the pictures, I never saw a difference. Not back the day when we still developed our black and white pictures ourselves and not now with digital cameras.<p>Lenses on the other hand a different thing altogether. There I saw defferences between the &quot;cheaper&quot; Sigma and the premium Nikkor ones. Not always but sometimes. I would assume that the new mirrirless cameras are less complex to build, so maybe the Thailand based manufacturing facilities are best suited. After all, it&#x27;s the lense and the person behind the camera that counts.')
