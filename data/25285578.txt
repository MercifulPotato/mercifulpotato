In my country (it&#x27;s -5c outside now, so not exactly warm) the building standards dictate new houses must consume no more than 15W&#x2F;m2&#x2F;year of heat energy for heating.<p>To convert that to US units, that means a 3000sqft house somewhere were electricity is $0.15c&#x2F;kWh would cost $600&#x2F;year to heat from electric baseboard heaters. If you have a heat pump you could bring that down to $200&#x2F;year - and that&#x27;s before you even consider solar.<p>I live in a 5 year old apartment, and haven&#x27;t even turned on the heating this season, but it&#x27;s still a comfortable 20c&#x2F;68F inside.')
