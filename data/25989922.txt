Do people self-host their pods?  Is the pod one more thing to sign up with an external provider?<p>If I&#x27;m self-hosting my pod anyway, then wouldn&#x27;t I want my self-hosting to include the (for example) photo-library viewing layer instead of giving google photos or flickr access to the photos in my pod?  If I did give them access, then how is it more private than if they hosted it themselves?  Maybe the pitch is more about mobility of services and avoiding lock-in than it is about privacy and security, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the message I get.  Does anyone have any pro-solid blog posts or articles you think might be helpful in convincing me?  It smells like it is well aligned with my values but I just can&#x27;t see how it will actually work.')
