They are so into it they give support (word of mouth, helping onboard others, bug patches, they will test alpha builds and give money&#x2F;time where possible).<p>90% of users don&#x27;t understand your product as well.  They haven&#x27;t totally bought in. They will need more support&#x2F;handholding in order to convert.  People are trying to get your product to work for their situation and if they can&#x27;t 90% will go away and 10% will ask (usually dumb questions).<p>Your unhappy with the 10% who can&#x27;t get it working but want your product to work enough to bother to ask?<p>I guess you can feel that way.  Those 10% do represent an opportunity to get a group of people who want to use your product to onboard.  The ones who tried and failed and never asked a question will probably never come back.  If you ultimately want more support you are going to need to convert this group (or invest more time in advertising hoping to get more superusers&#x2F;fanboys)')
