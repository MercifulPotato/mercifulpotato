I try in general to be as charitable to both sides of an agreement possible. If your standard for uncharitability is such that the linked tweet is a proof of racism, I don&#x27;t understand why one would take a tweet claiming against overwhelming evidence at face value.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think either indicate racism. I see the link you tweeted as an excessively abrasive response at a dismissive and reductive understanding of an issue, bias in learning system, despite research old and new. At the same time, I see LeCun&#x27;s dismissal as a genuinely held position in error.<p>To see the first as racist but the second as okay seems to be a case of being much more charitable to one side than the other, though I understand how it may look this way.')
