It has no wisdom for us. If you want wisdom, look to math and science.&quot;</i><p>What do math and science study?  What is the proper subject of chemistry or physics?  That question such questions are not something math or science can answer.<p>When you&#x27;ve got some knowledge (say from science), what do you do with it?  That question, again, is not something science can answer.<p>Which course of action is right or wrong?  Again, science can not do otherwise than to be silent here.<p>Mathematics is widely considered to be the foundation of and one of the most useful tools that science has, yet it itself is based largely (if not completely) on logic.  Logic is part of philosophy.  The foundation of mathematics (as distinct from logic) is also a branch of philosophy.<p>If you look at the deepest, most critical questions that science tries to answer, at the core of them is often a philosophical question that at least up to now has been intractable to scientific study.  I&#x27;m talking about things such as the nature of consciousness or the mind, deep questions in physics also blend almost seamlessly in to philosophy -- things such as the nature of time and causality.<p>Now, it may be the case that at some point in the future science will have some convincing answers and explanations to these questions, but the belief that it will is a form of faith in science that is often termed scientism -- something which is distinct from science itself, and is not subject to scientific inquiry.<p>Also, when you say that <i>&quot;If you want wisdom, look to math and science&quot;</i>, do you know what you mean by the word &quot;wisdom&quot;?  Are math and science sources of wisdom or merely of knowledge, and what&#x27;s the difference?  All philosophical questions.<p>How about whether science helps us to get closer to truth?  And what is truth anyway?  Again, all philosophical questions which science can not answer.<p>I would argue that the most important questions for most people are not scientific or mathematical questions, but philosophical ones -- such as:<p>- &quot;what should I do with my life?&quot;<p>- &quot;what is the purpose of my life or of the world?&quot;<p>- &quot;should I help someone in need or help myself?&quot;<p>- &quot;what subject (including mathematical or scientific subject) should I study or work on?&quot;<p>- &quot;who should live or die, be punished or rewarded?&quot;<p>- &quot;how should we structure our society?&quot;<p>- &quot;how should we as a society or as individuals spend our money?&quot;<p>Science can offer no tools to help us answer any of these most pressing and practical of questions.  At best it can give us some indication of what has happened or would happen if we chose a certain course of action, but is silent on what we actually should do or what the purpose or meaning of anything is.<p>Even the question of how science itself should be conducted is not open to scientific inquiry.<p>Usually people answer these questions for themselves in some ad-hoc way, usually without recognizing that they are philosophical questions, and usually unconsciously adopting some many-hundred-year-old philosophical position which has be passed down to them through the culture around them by osmosis.  If they studied, read and thought about these questions, they might actually make more informed decisions.')
