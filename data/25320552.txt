It has no wisdom for us. If you want wisdom, look to math and science.&quot;</i><p>What do math and science study?  What is the proper subject of chemistry or physics?  That question such questions are not something math or science can answer.<p>When you&#x27;ve got some knowledge (say from science), what do you do with it?  That question, again, is not something science can answer.<p>Which course of action is right or wrong?  Again, science can not do otherwise than to be silent here.<p>Mathematics is widely considered to be the foundation and one of the most useful tools that science has, yet it itself is based largely (if not completely) on logic.  Logic is part of philosophy.<p>If you look at the deepest, most critical questions that science tries to answer, at the core of them is often a philosophical question that at least up to now has been intractable to scientific study.  I&#x27;m talking about things such as the nature of consciousness or the mind, deep questions in physics also blend almost seamlessly in to philosophy -- things such as the nature of time and causality.<p>Now, it may be the case that at some point in the future science will have some convincing answers and explanations to these questions, but the belief that it will is a form of faith in science that is often termed scientism -- something which is distinct from science itself, and is not subject to scientific inquiry.<p>Also, when you say that <i>&quot;If you want wisdom, look to math and science&quot;</i>, do you know what you mean by the word &quot;wisdom&quot;?  Are math and science sources of wisdom or merely of knowledge, and what&#x27;s the difference?  All philosophical questions.<p>How about whether science helps us to get closer to truth?  And what is truth anyway?  Again, all philosophical questions which science can not answer.')
