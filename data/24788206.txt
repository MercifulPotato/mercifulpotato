Full disclosure, I run Xfce &#x2F; Xubuntu now with ZERO modifications.<p>I have to agree with @wraptile and say that we don&#x27;t need a desktop revolution. In the open source &#x2F; *nix world, there is a desktop for EVERYONE. Gnome is the corporate DE, then you have folks who run Firefox and everything else in a terminal. I think the desktop is akin to a car. Things have obviously changed, but the base will _always_ be there. Cars have 4 wheels, a steering wheel, and cockpit tools. Desktops need to open applications, field graphics, and navigate you through your computing tasks. And those are different for everyone. Someone driving their kids to school has different needs than a forktruck driver in a factory.<p>One thing that always interests me (I don&#x27;t work in &quot;tech&quot;) is that everyone is always trying to make things &quot;new&quot; or &quot;revolutionize&quot; it. I think the DE world is fine. We have the 2000 Toyota Tacoma (Xfce), The Teslas (macOS), and the Honda Civic (windowz). I&#x27;m not sure revolutions are needed. Tweaks and changes here and there to make things more stable or better tech (akin from x11 to wayland) but large overalls have already been tested and came and went.')
