That said, I&#x27;d say the list of mandatory components on a laptop is:<p>- Decent GPU Drivers<p>- Workable power management with sleep&#x2F; awake<p>- Trackpad (this should be straight forward)<p>The webcam, and brightness controls are stretch goals. I can&#x27;t imaging the trackpad is vastly different from currently shipping ones. The Webcam might cause some significant headaches since Apple secures that fairly tightly.<p>The onboard wifi modem is likely worthless, from what I recall, many of them are even in Windows laptops due to proprietary drivers.')
