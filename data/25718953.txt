All they could do is just sit there and wait for special forces shoot them one by one.<p>Coup wasn&#x27;t even considered, most probably what they did is plant  malicious software on laptops&#x2F;servers there and I think the real threat will be seen only few months later.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_coups_and_coup_attempts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_coups_and_coup_attempt...</a>')
