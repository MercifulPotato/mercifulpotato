I have started using it for one of my sites, then recently migrated another, and planning to do the same with the rest of my projects.<p>Moreover, Plausible being an open-source product, it gives anyone a chance to contribute to it and make it even better. As soon as I realised that it was written in Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix, I just couldn&#x27;t wait but find ways to help. Although my contributions to the project have been small until now, the guys were really kind and addressed the changes I pointed out almost immediately.<p>Great work!')
