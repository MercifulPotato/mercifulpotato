Remove the screws at the bottom, break the glue down, and unfold. Access to the screen and battery connectors are right there on top of the logic board. It’s so the service techs at the store can do it quicker. Anything else, they just give you a new device and ship the old one back to Apple.<p>Previously (think iPhone 4S and prior), the phone opened from the back. So a screen replacement necessitated deconstructing the entire device.<p>Could it be <i>more</i> accessible? Most likely. They could put in removable batteries (like older phones had), but they’ve chosen not to (presumably for space reasons (internal batteries take up less space)), and it seems the entire industry followed. But just because they’re not <i>easily</i> replaceable, doesn’t mean they’re not easily <i>serviceable</i>. It takes a bit, but an experienced person can do it about 30 minutes or even less. iFixIt’s guides help a lot here.')
