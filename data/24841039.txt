Item(by='Wowfunhappy', descendants=None, kids=[24841429], score=None, time=1603220005, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24840678, text='&gt; I mean the irony is when it comes to browsers you see the general tone of HN shift to the opposite opinion when it comes to features like, RTC, USB, Bluetooth, Filesystem Access.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that ironic. From my vantage point, the big tech companies are specifically and consistently invoking security arguments in ways that push their agenda.<p>• We need to enforce automatic Windows 10 updates to keep your computer secure. (But also, we won&#x27;t let consumers use the security-patches-only LTSC branch we offer businesses.)<p>• You cannot install an app on your iPhone that we have not personally vetted. (And made sure will give us 30% of all digital purchases.)<p>• We need to hide Chrome URLs to protect users from phishing websites (but isn&#x27;t it nice how it makes AMP more seamless?).<p>• We need to give the browser Bluetooth and USB access, because web apps are safer than installing a random Windows executable. (But also, we can advertise inside web apps more easily.)<p>I could go on. The problem with all of these is that they aren&#x27;t necessarily wrong. The iOS App Store <i>does</i> protect users from malware. Hiding URLs <i>does</i> protect users from phishing. All of these moves have trade-offs, however, some which may themselves be bad for security.')
