Item(by='Wowfunhappy', descendants=None, kids=[24841429, 24842102], score=None, time=1603220005, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24840678, text='&gt; I mean the irony is when it comes to browsers you see the general tone of HN shift to the opposite opinion when it comes to features like, RTC, USB, Bluetooth, Filesystem Access.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that ironic. From my vantage point, the big tech companies specifically and consistently invoke the security arguments that are best aligned with their agendas.<p>• We need to enforce automatic Windows 10 updates to keep your computer secure. (But also, we won&#x27;t let consumers use the security-patches-only LTSC branch we offer businesses.)<p>• You cannot install an app on your iPhone that we have not personally vetted. (As part of the vetting process, we enforce a 30% cut on all digital goods.)<p>• We need to hide URLs in Chrome to protect users from phishing websites. (But isn&#x27;t it nice how it makes AMP more seamless?)<p>• We need to give browsers Bluetooth and USB access, because web apps are safer than random Windows executables. (But also, we can advertise inside of web apps more easily.)<p>I could go on. The problem with all of these arguments is that they aren&#x27;t <i>wrong</i> so much as they&#x27;re <i>selective</i>. The iOS App Store <i>does</i> protect users from malware, and hiding URLs does protect users from phishing. What goes unacknowledged are the trade-offs of these decisions—some of which may themselves be bad for security.')
