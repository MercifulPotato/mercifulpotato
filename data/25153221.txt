As the video explain, this is not a straightforward and obvious generalization of summation.<p>I think that the generalization that use averages are fine, and some analytic continuations using power series are fine. Analytic functions are just too good to ignore them. It is not <i>another</i> mathematical system. It it just the extension of <i>our</i> mathematical system.<p>Anyway, to get a result for this sum, you must drop too many of the obvious and expected properties of summation. For example if you add a zero in front of the sum, the result changes :(. There was a nice blog post I can&#x27;t find, but there is a hint of the problem in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%E2%8B%AF#Failure_of_stable_linear_summation_methods" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%E2%8B...</a> . So the result is ... polemic.<p>Anyway, in some courses of a Math degree, one of the important ideas is that you have many possible definitions of convergence. For example, if you have a sequence of functions, you have <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Uniform_absolute-convergence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Uniform_absolute-convergence</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Weak_convergence_(Hilbert_space)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Weak_convergence_(Hilbert_spac...</a> and many many many more.<p>So you don&#x27;t write<p><pre><code>  lim f_n -&gt; f,\n</code></pre>\nyou must write<p><pre><code>  lim_{something} f_n -&gt; f\n</code></pre>\nwhere something explain which definition of convenience you are using.<p>The trick here is to hide the nasty problem of the multiple definitions of convergence in the dots. So the correct statement of the problem is<p>1+2+3+4+..._{with a weird convergence}=-1&#x2F;12<p>but it doesn&#x27;t look as nice as<p>1+2+3+4+...=-1&#x2F;12')
