Why is this?<p>It is because we cannot ignore the rules completely (that might attract fines), but mass lax observance of the rules might communicate to elected officials and potential candidates for office that people are getting tired of lockdowns and restrictions after nearly a year and we want some other approach. (For example, as someone already advanced in years, I personally feel that the rights of people now in their teens and early twenties to enjoy normal coming of age things like big group events and the usual courtship rituals takes higher priority than the most vulnerable COVID demographic – half of our deaths have been in care homes.) A candidate who looks at how willing the public is to accept the restrictions imposed on them, and who offers to change the state of affairs, might get my and others’ vote.<p>Now that we know so much about the virus, there is a large subjective element to whether an approach to the epidemic is “right” or “wrong”, and an electorate has the right to push its elected officials towards the course of action which they feel is preferable.')
