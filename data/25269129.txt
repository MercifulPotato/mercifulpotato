FreeBSD and OpenBSD are better (and easier) than ever, but you still give up a lot in comparison with the average Linux distribution, where more things just work.<p>The BSDs are often great if you stick to the base system, but once you start adding software, things break way more often than with Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc.<p>This is especially true if your hardware is not-a-Thinkpad.<p>I always wanted to run OpenBSD as my main OS, but for &quot;production&quot; desktop use, I can&#x27;t deny how much easier&#x2F;faster it is to get and stay running with Debian, Ubuntu or Fedora.')
