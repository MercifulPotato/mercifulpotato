If I was allowed to start a pharma company as easily as I could start a software company then you bet I would be doing that instead of SAAS. I can guarantee that prices would be lower than the rest of the world, and that American pharma companies would be top-of-market in international markets as well.<p>But, the mafioso in-bed-with-the-gov-and-politicians absolutely corrupt elitist-owned system that we have in America is ruining this country.<p>And to all the people downvoting the &quot;regulation&quot; comments: You are being COMPLETELY intellectually dishonest, and you know it. Game theory validates that regulatory capture is 100% the issue. The Universe and nature work by a set of laws that has been investigated since the 50s with Von Neumann, Nash, etc. It is time that we stop telling ourselves that some politicians in government are going to magically create legal algorithms that outperform the laws of the nature. It is dangerous, immoral, and stupid and it ends up only protecting and embedding the existing corrupt elite for life.')
