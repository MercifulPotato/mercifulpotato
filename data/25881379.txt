Thankfully as it turns out the last 1.xx version of the API was mostly adding functionality we don&#x27;t use and we can swap to using a new field without lots of pain.<p>However this does mean we need to spend a couple of weeks of developer and tester time retesting the interface code. Cost I would guess $10,000 by the time we add in all the PM&#x2F;PO&#x2F;DevOps time multiply that by a few customers and it adds up fairly quickly.<p>Moving to version 2.xx doesn&#x27;t look too bad but the monolithic protobuf file has been split into parts and the upgrade is probably going to take a 6-8 weeks as they&#x27;ve also changed some of the enum values and properly deprecated stuff. My gut feel from having spent a couple of hours looking at V2.xx is it mostly compatible but this vendor has form for hiding a surprise change (they changed from representing money as an int with an implied decimal place to a long+int)<p>Again probably not too much work overall but it will cost $20,000 to swap versions and the opportunity cost of not doing something else instead.<p>We have the same problem with the API for external applications we provide. We know folks are running very elderly versions (over 3 years old) and our next version is huge change for client applications. We&#x27;ve taken advantage of this change to rename a load of stuff and explicitly add types in various places. I doubt we&#x27;ll be able to sunset the old API for many years.')
