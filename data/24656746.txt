Nearly everything is cheaper there, and not by a little.  Gas can be $1.50&#x2F;gallon instead of $3.89&#x2F;gallon.  Dairy, produce, meat are all cheaper.  Utilities&#x2F;energy is cheaper.<p>Maybe it doesn&#x27;t have as big an impact if you don&#x27;t have kids, but I only have three and man these things eat a lot.')
