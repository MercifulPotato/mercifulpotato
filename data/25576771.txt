I was going with a buddy to camp and fish. My other two buddies insisted we take paper maps just in case. Same thing. Caught a fork, then the road turned to a dirt road and that&#x27;s when we stopped, got out the paper map, and realized we took two wrong turns. It was dark and we had been driving most of the day and were pretty tired already so missing the initial turn was not a surprise.<p>Had we continued using Google Maps on our phones, god knows how far into the interior we would&#x27;ve gone before being in real trouble.')
