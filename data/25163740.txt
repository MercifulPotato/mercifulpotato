If a company quotes a typical job at 80 man-hours with $15&#x2F;hr welders, and a year later you want to hire welders and can only find them at $20, they&#x27;re more likely to complain there&#x27;s a welder shortage and decline jobs because they don&#x27;t have enough welders to complete them than increase their labor rate. Plus, if you increase the rate for a new guy, and your $12&#x2F;hr hire from a decade ago hears the new hire is making $20, he&#x27;s going to be pissed, so you&#x27;d have to increase costs across the board or suppress discussion of salaries.')
