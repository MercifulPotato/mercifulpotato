Ethereum too, or rather any decentralized currency. Governments don&#x27;t like crypto, they don&#x27;t like the anonymity it provides, so they&#x27;ll find other ways to starve it. Making it a speculative investment is one such way. Shutting Down Silk Road was another. Shutting down the Dark Web sites might yet be another. Or (gasp!), creating their own legal cryptocurrency that is universal, mandated by banks to use for transactions, with some form of tracking, etc. As someone on another thread mentioned, there&#x27;s nothing stopping a government from holding a gun to your head and demanding you to give away all of your crypto. Now one may suggest exchanging it for fiat, but that&#x27;s a really long and cumbersome process, which will often come with significant scrutiny (as happened in my case).')
