For my tastes, it has gotten out of control and disgusting. I&#x27;m tired of being treated like a consumer, and I&#x27;d imagine the majority of people feel that way in their bodies, even if they aren&#x27;t conscious of it (my small N sample is pretty heavily in agreement). The whole process of being advertised to is exhausting. That&#x27;s even before we get into the 2016 election.<p>It probably is the most efficient model for a social media company (as you said, that&#x27;s why they all do it). I don&#x27;t think that type of monopoly is healthy in a market economy, and by regulating it, you allow other, more benign models a chance to grow.<p>&gt; We&#x27;re successfully doing it with smoking, and making good progress on the sugar + sedentary lifestyle front as well with all sorts of niche diets and fitness regimines popping up.<p>Are you just shitposting or are you not aware of the substantial history of prosecuting and regulating those industries, which have been instrumental in driving those changes? I don&#x27;t underestimate end users - I think if you provide proper leadership and make the right thing the easy thing, then end users will do the right thing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tobacco_Master_Settlement_Agreement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tobacco_Master_Settlement_Agre...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sugary_drink_tax" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sugary_drink_tax</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mexiconewsdaily.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;new-food-warning-labels-begin-to-appear-on-store-shelves&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mexiconewsdaily.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;new-food-warning-labels-beg...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Let%27s_Move" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Let%27s_Move</a>!<p>If you spend most of your time around people who have a certain type of education and economic means, who do their own research, and have the liberty to control their lives to some extent then a libertarian outlook seems obvious. Outside that bubble, it becomes real clear that a lot of these problems are systemic and too big for most individuals to comprehend, let alone solve. It sounds dramatic to apply that to Facebook, but given the impact it seems to have on society, a little flair is appropriate.<p>&gt; Also, and maybe I&#x27;m just being unimaginative, but what kinds of market rules would make sense here?<p>Apply the CCPA nationally and give users full control of their data and how it is used for starters. If you make it easy for customers to opt their data out of targeted advertising most will - if not immediately, then eventually (as you described, fatigue). If Facebook doesn&#x27;t have the data, then their ad engine isn&#x27;t really much better than anyone else and other business models become more attractive.<p>There are a bunch of different ideas about how to go about it, but taking away the data monopolies would seem to be the easiest, most self-executing solution.')
