Especially the language around &quot;hashed email addresses&quot; seemed quite clearly targeting Facebook to me.<p>I&#x27;m surprised Apple&#x27;s weaponization of the App Store (for example, forcing Sign in with Apple on any developers who use Facebook or Google SSO) hasn&#x27;t drawn more anti-trust attention.<p>I definitely applaud Apple&#x27;s push to be more transparent about the privacy you give up when installing these apps!  I just wonder if the rollout could have been done in a more app-publisher-friendly manner.')
