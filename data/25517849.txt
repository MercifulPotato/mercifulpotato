I didn’t want to gamble $300+ on a hub that might not work.<p>My solution was to use an LG thunderbolt monitor (which has a usb3 output), and hang a cheap self powered usb3 hub off that for all the lower bandwidth peripherals.<p>This has worked well between Mac and pc so far, just one cable that does 4k60, 100W power delivery and handles all the other peripherals in the background.<p>One gotcha: Apparently some monitors deep sleep options mean the monitor powers down the hub and laptop won’t wake up from keyboard&#x2F;mouse events!<p>Hopefully via usb4 thunderbolt can be commoditized and we can get cheaper universal hubs rather than a $300+ dock, but at the moment you need to spend a huge amount to do anything with multiple thunderbolt connections.')
