An attack basically downs a site for an extended period of time. GoogleBot notices the slow speed and logs dozens of 500 errors, which can result in dropped rankings.<p>I did a quick check for usefathom.com though, the only somewhat interesting keyword would be &quot;google analytics alternative&quot;, but fathom ranks on page 2, which imo would not really justify an attack. Maybe there is some other long-tail keyword with a high enough value though where usefathom.com pushed small niche players out of the top positions.<p>Also a DDoS is obviously bad for the user experience of paying customers, nobody wants their analytics service to be down or have missing data bc of downtime etc.')
