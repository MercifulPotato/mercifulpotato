Imagine time as a window into an immutable graph of deterministic state transitions, for example. You could come up with such a model where loops &quot;back in time&quot; were possible, but where the model simply can&#x27;t express situations that leads to paradoxes, and where we by extension can&#x27;t exist in a universe where people can ever take steps that would lead to a paradox.')
