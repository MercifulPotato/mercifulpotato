Capping tax increases is also necessary to make it possible to financially plan for them (e.g. I can invest enough so that my investments will pay the taxes w&#x2F; increases for the rest of my life, and just add that to the &#x27;cost&#x27; of the home-- given historical market returns this requires investment of 25x your annual property taxes, so long as they can&#x27;t grow faster than inflation).  One could also make the case for a public interest in not letting some businesses get pushed out (primarily small, single location businesses).<p>But prop 13 goes far beyond that-- applying to all property and with extremely expansive portability-- and as a result creates a massive windfall for existing property owners at the expense of new property owners.<p>I&#x27;d like to see at least a rule that for rented properties that assessments should be allowed to increase as much as rents have.  There is little to no prevent-displacement justification for not tracking rents.')
