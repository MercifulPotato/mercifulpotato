There would be some surprises for historians and archaeologists, but we certainly wouldn&#x27;t treat them as cultural or technological equals.<p>So the horizon of interest where an encounter would be fascinating <i>and worth the time and effort</i> but not devastatingly disruptive to either side is probably only a few millennia.<p>But let&#x27;s call it +&#x2F;- 10k years, to be generous.<p>Compare with the age of the universe, or even of the galaxy.
