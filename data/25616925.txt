They also haven&#x27;t decided yet whether they will open schools in 35h time. They were 100% certain theur would be no Christmas lockdown 4h before announcing Christmas lockdown.<p>The spectator used to be a respectable right wing outlet. But since brexit, it&#x27;s gone full foxnews.<p>The NYT (which is the right of where the spectator was a few years ago and hardly &quot;liberal&quot; by the British definition) is correct there will be mixing. The government themselves only decided what circumstances would need to be for mixing a few hours ago. They only decided that when dozens of experts (including their own advisors) publically said it was a bad idea to mix so they rowed back from anything goes. Apparently it hadn&#x27;t occurred to them to even ask.<p>Once again, policy by uneducated dictat. Now with political coverage by bs claims of &quot;fact checking&quot;.')
