Could you imagine the number of PRs, issues and discussions over trivial shit the GitHub userbase would create against an open GH repo? Nightmare. Not to mention code cleanliness expectations and buildability expectations and so on.<p>Of course they &quot;could do this&quot; or &quot;do it that way,&quot; but the fact that they don&#x27;t should tell you their priorities lie elsewhere, and that&#x27;s fine. Closed source isn&#x27;t evil and we have other open source git hosting platforms.')
