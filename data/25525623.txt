Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608793996, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25523053, text='&gt;  I&#x27;m aware that at some point the Sun will expand and engulf Earth, but I&#x27;m not terrified of it.<p>Mainly because you won&#x27;t be there when it happens when it happens, but would you feel the same if you felt earthquakes, nuclear effluence spikes, droughts or landslides from the few times it rained, plus all the aforementioned calamity? It&#x27;s a visceral feeling that you carry with you for the rest of your Life, and it manifests in different ways depending on the person one of the most prevalent being depression and anxiety as I&#x27;ve seen far too many succumb to alcholism, drug abuse and SSRIs just to cope with the antipathy and eventually apathy towards World around them.<p>That&#x27;s what I (and many more like me endured in that period in CA) saw and lived while I lived there until my early 20s, so we adapted (as I&#x27;m multi-generational) and I personally sought to apply my skill-set to what I felt had the best chance of ensuring we as a Species transitioned to a sustainable system that spanned: Renewable and sustainable Ag, Farm to table seasonal cuisine, Energy (solar), EV, Currency&#x2F;Monetary system (Bitcoin) and then I got stupidly ambitious and almost made it to SpaceX this year.<p>Again, you can take your placid (in my view monotonous and short sighted) and insular existence but the truth is I always wanted to live my young adult Life this way and I have inspired more to pick up where I left off. I wanted what I went through to be for something in order to be a part of something that helps us transition out of this horrid system that has devastated our ecosystem and now looking back on it all I know I did something right.')
