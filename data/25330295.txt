I was a monthly contributor to This American Life. I switched credit cards and wanted to update my payment, but they had changed their website or something and there was, as far as I could tell, no way to change or cancel or any &quot;account&quot; page or &quot;login&quot; system. I couldn&#x27;t even find support or a phone number. I think I sent email to a generic account and waited a week. After not hearing back I canceled the credit card.<p>I tried to stick to PayPal to manage subscriptions for a few years since it was centralized and I could change payments or cancel. Patreon seems to have taken over a lot of this--but it&#x27;s even more niche.<p>&gt; Big hope that fin tech will blow it up, but unfortunately start ups didn&#x27;t deliver.<p>I just can&#x27;t imagine the ROI needed to satisfy VC funding...especially without it becoming shady or predatory itself. Or, like you said, the regulations involved for a self-funded startup. I think the other aspect is that big companies aren&#x27;t motivated to play ball. Yodlee is probably the biggest player and has had spottier integration as companies have added 2fa and other security measures. Very few have gone as far as adding tokens to support 3rd parties like Yodlee.<p>&gt; Each bank got their app and added some obvious features there<p>I suspect if something does happen (I&#x27;m not particularly confident) it will be a spinoff from a bank like how Allstate and Discover Card were spinoffs of Sears or Kingsford Charcoal from Ford Motor. Do companies do this anymore?')
