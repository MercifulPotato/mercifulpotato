Most of my clients seem to come from Hacker News and tend to be tech professionals with a lot of experience who are struggling to keep their information-dense resume easily digestible.<p>I do some editing and do a write up of the kinds of changes I made and why and try to help clients up their game because I know resumes need to be rewritten and customized for each position. It&#x27;s not &quot;one and done,&quot; so this is kind of like <i>resume coaching.</i><p>I work 100 percent remote. I typically get documents via Google docs (no PDFs -- they cannot be edited), some basic information via email and I get paid up front at $50&#x2F;page.<p>DoreenTraylor.com (See the &quot;For Hire&quot; page.)')
