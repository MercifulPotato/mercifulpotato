If Apple&#x27;s claim is to be believed there are a million patterns that make more sense for achieving this goal. Blacklists, whitelists, caching, etc.<p>I get &quot;never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence&quot;, but this is Apple. Are we to believe that this public, unencrypted endpoint was set up and is being called tens of millions of times a day because Apple engineers were too incompetent to come up with a better solution for something so fundamental (to Apple) as the security of the software running on their devices? And flying so blatantly in the face of their claim to protect user privacy?<p>This whole incident is completely bonkers. People should be getting fired over this and there should be an apology and a massive step back from this horrible, horrible approach.')
