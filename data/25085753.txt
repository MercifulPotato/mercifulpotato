Without being allowed to know, I cannot challenge the search, etc.<p>The same contra-positive-analysis is helpful with claims of &quot;foreign interference&quot; in elections, where I may have little concern for a foreign adversary&#x27;s right to speak, but also take serious issue with the idea that I should not be allowed to learn about matters that may be important to and relevant to my vote.')
