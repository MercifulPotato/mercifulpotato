They aren&#x27;t putting minorities in camps.<p>&gt; The American government did that too, in WWII...<p>No. Our government exterminated our minorities. It&#x27;s how a nation of 13 states became 50. Of course we became a nation of 13 states by genocide as well.<p>The idea of benevolence is laughable. Not only did we nuke japan, burn german cities to the ground, use biological weapons in korea, etc ( and these are our vassal, or allies ). Look at how we benevolently nuked japan. As I said, for everything we&#x27;ve &quot;benevolently&quot; done in history, switch that to china.')
