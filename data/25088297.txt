I find that works well for me. As you say, previewing what bold looks like offers minimal value. :)<p>Joplin also has a beta single pane WYSIWG view which is like, I believe, Typora or Bear (markdown in the backend, but you type in what is effectively the preview window). I haven&#x27;t really tried it out yet though. If it works well though, it might solve your concern though.')
