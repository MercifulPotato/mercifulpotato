It doesn&#x27;t sound like regulation was necessary, as the free market provided products that fit your needs.<p>I fundamentally disagree with the notion that government should have a say in design decisions for consumer products past safety and environmental concerns. I don&#x27;t design things to support every consumer use case, I don&#x27;t document it so those use cases can be supported, and I don&#x27;t take it personally if a consumer chooses a competing product because it fits their use cases better. If enough consumers do that, I support those cases.<p>There is plenty of consumer freedom in consumer electronics. We don&#x27;t need the government telling us what they think our customers want.')
