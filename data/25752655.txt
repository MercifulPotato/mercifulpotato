I&#x27;ve seen grown up devs abandon stacks that were perfectly fine to spend years migrating to the new thing â€” granted this happens more at larger companies where resume building sometimes overtakes business needs.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;angular-fullstack&#x2F;generator-angular-fullstack" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;angular-fullstack&#x2F;generator-angular-fulls...</a>')
