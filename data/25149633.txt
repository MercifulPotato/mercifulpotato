Item(by='Gravityloss', descendants=None, kids=[25149659], score=None, time=1605795291, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25149508, text='Jet engines have a thrust to weight ratio of about 10.\nThe power is not so interesting as a lot of the thrust comes from heating the air. Ie the compressor might work at 40 MW and turbine also then of course extracts 40 MW from the airflow.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why one couldn&#x27;t build an electric supersonic aircraft. It would have very short range. The design presented, could be made more aerodynamic by fairing the motors. Leave a hole in the tip for cooling air. Add a compressor for low speed cooling if needed. Alternatively have liquid cooling.<p>You could also have a design where the airflow is slowed down in a duct, compressed by a fan and then expanded. The duct would be heavy though. But it might obviate some problems with the free stream propeller.')
