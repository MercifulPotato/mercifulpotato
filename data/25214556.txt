The main point of SQL builders is not to make SQL more readable, it&#x27;s to make SQL approachable by people who don&#x27;t know SQL.<p>- There can be several ways of achieving the same result in SQL, with sometimes deep performance implications, so it&#x27;s really important to understand what is being executed and in what order. Regular languages are much simpler and while the string representation of the regex might end up longer than the handcrafted equivalent, the runtime performance should end up being the same since in the end it&#x27;s all deterministic finite automatons.<p>- SQL builders have to be at least a little bit opinionated to be really useful, in general they make it easy to create simple queries but can quickly become limiting for complex queries, especially if you already know SQL. These &quot;verbal expressions&quot; on the other hand can easily map 1:1 with raw regex constructs, allowing somebody who already knows regex to express exactly the same logic, just in a more verbose and human readable way.<p>This verbose syntax operates at exactly the same level of abstraction as normal regex, it&#x27;s just a syntactical transform effectively. It&#x27;s like JSON vs. CBOR or something like that.')
