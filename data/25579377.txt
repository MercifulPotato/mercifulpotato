After a while, he downplays his resume - gets responses. In the interview he&#x2F;she answers every question with great accuracy, but something just doesn&#x27;t &quot;click&quot; to the interviewer (the interviewer is sure he&#x2F;she is filtering on skill alone, but is very wrong about that)<p>The fact is, recruiters and interviewers hire people they like, people that are similar to them. If you&#x27;re from the same place look similar and from a similar age it generally has a lot more weight than anything skill-related.')
