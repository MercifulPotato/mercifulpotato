I can&#x27;t analyze or fault your work habits, especially since physics might be even harder to measure than coding. (Of course a lot of physics is coding). There&#x27;s a difference between 3-4 hours of focused work surrounded by a regular day of <i></i><i></i> work, and 3-4 hours of procrastinating. I was on the wrong side of that equation.<p>But I was up against a number of realities: 1) My project was not in fact moving forward at a sufficient rate. Work is not static, but decays if you leave it sit there, so the progress rate has to exceed the decay rate. And it wasn&#x27;t. 2) I was paying through the nose in opportunity cost. 3) I wasn&#x27;t <i>happy</i> with myself, and in fact was kind of depressed.<p>A stress of grad school is that you have to be self managing, and I still don&#x27;t have a good formula for overcoming this problem. But I survived and eventually finished. My advisor leaving the university put a fire under my ass, because I had to finish before the lab got demolished.<p>But this is the other thing to know: The risk level is <i>extreme</i> in terms of something bad happening that sets you back or kills your project altogether.<p>One thing I found was that some kinds of work were easier to get into &quot;flow&quot; than others. Coding was easy. So I actually let coding occur in what I might actually call spare time. Interruptions weren&#x27;t as much of a problem in grad school. The boring stuff was the hardest -- grinding on a supplier to get me a price quote and then grinding on the purchasing department to send out a purchase order. That&#x27;s where my procrastination really kicked in.<p>So, enough of the scolding. If you&#x27;re doing the right thing to get through, then ignore this message. You probably know better than anybody. Best of luck!')
