I selected the option to not connect my Facebook account, but continue to use my Oculus account. There was a sunset date on this option.<p>I&#x27;ve never bought anything from the Oculus store. I honestly only use VR for Skybox and movies I download to a file server.<p>Are there any alternative OSes for the GO? Honestly I&#x27;d rather just get off the stock OS if I just had a way to play my movies.')
