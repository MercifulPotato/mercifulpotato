I don&#x27;t understand the obsession for macs as a developer machine when every year macOS just keeps getting heavier and slower with unnecessary translucency and animations and less reliable hardware. My colleague had to send his mac in twice already for keyboard and speaker repair on a fairly new mac. Not to mention some ThinkPads are a fraction of the cost and upgradable.')
