It&#x27;s just unimaginable to many today&#x27;s developer.<p>TBH, I&#x27;m still not aware of any truly simple&#x2F;easy way to get a dynamic HTML page.<p>Recently, I had to make a dumb utility app to render some dynamic data, and I wound up writing a Golang server with the HTML specified as a Go Template. But making it accessible on the publc internet still required spinning up a server, installing nginx, configuring SSL with Let&#x27;s Encrypt (at least it was free) and futzing around with nginx `proxypass` directives for several hours.<p>It works, and I guess it&#x27;s conceptually simple, but it was still an all-day ordeal to get it up and running from scratch.')
