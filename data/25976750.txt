But the index they reference doesn&#x27;t measure that. It measures more general Quality of Life metrics like prevalence of malnourishment or quality of the social safety net.<p>So while a high score reflects an easier life for the low end of the social ladder it doesn&#x27;t actually measure their ability to move up it. I could on paper come up with a country that scored quite well on most of the index measures and had a rigid caste system where children could never outperform their parents and cannot escape their birth status.')
