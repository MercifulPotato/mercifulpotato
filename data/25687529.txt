When you use a thunderbolt dock right now, doesn&#x27;t it use pure thunderbolt as a backhaul, and have a PCIe-based USB 3 controller inside of it?<p>If that&#x27;s right, then even without mixed signals you could have a pure-thunderbolt hub, and you could have a device with several thunderbolt ports <i>and</i> several USB 3 ports.  And it should be straightforward to combine them into dual-purpose ports.  The rules for passing through alternate modes don&#x27;t matter because you&#x27;re not passing through, you&#x27;re not a USB hub, you have your own USB root.')
