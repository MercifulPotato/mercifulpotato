One thing they&#x27;ve taught me is to be cautious about taking too much Tylenol.<p>At the right dose, Tylenol may well be <i>the</i> safest pain medication we have, even compared to Advil, which can occasionally cause problems if taken regularly over a lifetime. However, the gap between a useful dose of Tylenol, and the amount of Tylenol which <i>will</i> kill you, is relatively small compared to similar medicines.<p>My parents say they&#x27;ve watched a lot of people die in the hospital from Tylenol overdoses. There is an antidote, but only if you get it in time.')
