Slides is great for collaboration, but lacks a lot compared to other graphics applications.<p>Mainly, I find it difficult to make text look good in Slides.<p>* For instance, the line-height can only be set in multiples of the font size (&quot;1.5x&quot;). That makes it difficult to impossible to lay out text of different font sizes in a baseline grid. The multiplier can be adjusted for each line and font size but it&#x27;s not precise enough, so the results look off.<p>* A large share of decks use bullet points and again the formatting options are very limited.<p>* No custom font support<p>* There is also limited support for importing vector graphics, e.g. SVG needs to be converted to a Windows Metafile&#x2F;EMF (!) before importing. I assume that&#x27;s done to simplify MS Office compatibility.')
