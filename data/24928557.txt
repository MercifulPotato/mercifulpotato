Twitter has a fairly good one, but even that s very clunky. I&#x27;m not saying they are all slow, but they are <i>clunky</i>, jumpy and unpredictable, which in many ways is worse than a webpage like HN that is 100% consistent, but sometimes times out. Predictability for me is more important than pay-it-later responsiveness. E.g. when i press the Pay button i &#x27;m OK with waiting 20 seconds for the payment to process. What&#x27;s unacceptable is the button standing still, not doing anything until a few seconds later, at which time i ve pressed it 10 times.')
