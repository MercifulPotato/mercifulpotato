This is a very incorrect way to put it but it gets closer to the intuition of definition:<p><pre><code>   Disorder is more probable than order that&#x27;s why things trend towards disorder. \n</code></pre>\nHowever it is only a probabilistic phenomena so technically low probability things can still occur. This is what the article is saying and he proves it with a bunch of math.<p>But the above is still technically incorrect because Entropy has nothing to do with disorder per say. Entropy is defined relative to a &quot;system&quot; and we can actually pick different systems where as entropy goes up while things become more organized and more ordered!<p>Keep in mind that a system is as much something that exists as well as properties of something we can arbitrarily define.<p>Say a system of loaded dice:<p>If my system consists of 100 weighted dice that flip up at 6 almost every time then entropy is increasing as I roll all the dice but the system is trending towards order: more sixes facing up.<p>Another system that trends towards order is the solar system. Gravity pulls particles to form ordered circular orbits and ordered spheres&#x2F;planets because that is the way the system is configured. You have a bunch of random atoms but like the weighted dice, gravity pushes the system towards order and organization. But entropy is increasing!<p>Ever wonder why people say entropy always increases but you see weird ordered stuff in nature all the time like snow flakes and crystals? In those cases entropy is still increasing but producing order.<p>Basically in the systems I described above Ordered configurations are More probable then disordered configurations thus while &quot;order&quot; is increasing, entropy is also increasing. Once you understand this you&#x27;ll have a better intuition of entropy and why it doesn&#x27;t have to do with &quot;disorder.&quot;<p>When people talk about stuff like entropy always goes up they say things like whenever you see something self organize then something else in the universe must become more disordered don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about. Yeah entropy trends towards higher values but this is not equivalent to disorder.<p>As for life on earth. Life on earth is a low probability phenomena. Something else is going on in this case but that&#x27;s another discussion.')
