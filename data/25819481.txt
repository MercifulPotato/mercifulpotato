Thin people don&#x27;t go snacking all the time, it&#x27;s the chubby folks who do that.<p>For example, if your cortosol (the &quot;stress&quot; hormone) is high, you will be craving snacks. The moment it&#x27;s back to normal (you don&#x27;t have stress) you can sit around and not want snacks.<p>As other posters said, it is <i>extremely hard</i> to avoid snacking when your body craves them. It is extremely easy to not snack, when your body does not want them.<p>Stop throwing around this &quot;easily&quot; &quot;its easy&quot; around. If it were easy, we would not have this conversation.')
