The project is battle-tested running on more than 5,000 sites and we’ve counted 180 million page views in the last three months.<p>Plausible is a standard Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix application backed by a PostgreSQL database for general data and a Clickhouse database for stats. On the frontend we use TailwindCSS for styling and React to make the dashboard interactive.<p>The script is lightweight at 0.7 KB. Cookies are not used and no personal data is collected. There’s no cross-site or cross-device tracking either.<p>We build everything in the open with a public roadmap so would love to hear your feedback and feature requests. Thank you!')
