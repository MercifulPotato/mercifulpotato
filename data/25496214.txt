Their revenue per employee is over twice that of Walmart. They keep labor costs low by employing as few people as possible. As such, they need to hire the best workers and pay them competitive wages and benefits. When Walmart wants the best workers, they also treat their workers well like with truckers and researchers at Walmartlabs.<p>This is why the meme about Walmart is subsidized by the government is completely preposterous. With Walmart was forced to, they could restructure their company to support the Costco model and lay off a million people.')
