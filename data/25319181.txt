As a former fat kid who never ran a mile and always found a health reason to escape PE class it was amazing.  It didn&#x27;t last long though.  I met my wife and started gaining weight, and soon I was back to where running hurt like hell.<p>Now I hike, and I love that.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever lose enough muscle and fat to get down to where running feels good again.')
