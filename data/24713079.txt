That said, to be really &quot;ground breaking&quot; they really should use the &quot;low boom&quot; technology that NASA has been researching to make a plane that can fly supersonic over land. That would actually be a <i>new</i> spin on the old Concorde business plan where it opens up more routes. Just the &quot;hey it will be cheaper&quot; bet doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of room for an assumption fail late in the certification process.')
