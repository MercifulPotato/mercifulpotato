You can embrace that by working toward becoming an athlete. Start living like an athlete in ways that you can.<p>In corporate situations this is a lot less ambiguous, where if you want to be promoted then you have to do the work of at least 1 rank above yourself before you&#x27;re officially at that level.<p>If you feel like you&#x27;re pretending and it&#x27;s exhausting, then it either means you&#x27;re not being true to yourself (you&#x27;re not meant to become that) or you&#x27;re suffering from imposter syndrome.')
