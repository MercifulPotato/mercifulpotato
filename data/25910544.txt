Superior mechanical and optical properties. Extremely high nanomechanical resonator quality factor.[6]&quot;<p>Indium antimonide - Used in infrared detectors and thermal imaging sensors, high quantum efficiency, low stability, require cooling, used in military long-range thermal imager systems. AlInSb-InSb-AlInSb structure used as quantum well. Very high electron mobility, electron velocity and ballistic length.<p><i>Transistors can operate below 0.5V and above 200 GHz. Terahertz frequencies may be achievable.</i><p>Lanthanum calcium manganate - <i>colossal magnetoresistance</i><p>Lanthanum copper oxide - <i>superconductive</i> when doped with barium or strontium<p>Nickel(II) oxide - <i>antiferromagnetic</i><p>Silicon-tin - <i>Adjustable band gap.</i> [34]<p>Strontium titanate - <i>Ferroelectric, piezoelectric</i>. Used in varistors. Conductive when niobium-doped.<p>Tin(II) sulfide - Tin sulfide (SnS) is a semiconductor with direct optical band gap of 1.3 eV and absorption coefficient above 104 cmâˆ’1 for photon energies above 1.3 eV. It is a p-type semiconductor whose electrical properties can be tailored by doping and structural modification and has emerged as one of the <i>simple, non-toxic and affordable materials</i> for thin films solar cells since a decade.&quot;<p>Etc., etc...<p>PDS: Also, any semiconductor material on the list capable of generating a laser -- should also be theoretically capable of receiving a laser too; that is, acting as a transducer&#x2F;optical transistor&#x2F;transciever -- for that laser beam as well (in other words, instead of communications via electricity down metal paths on a chip&#x27;s surface, any chip made with this material should (and yes, I know, the science is a long way off!), should in the future be able to communicate with other parts of itself via laser&#x2F;light beams...)<p>But, this should (no doubt!) be a fun list to revisit from time to time -- I can&#x27;t wait to see how it unfolds (when more entries and information is added) in the future!')
