Item(by='pr0zac', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607018052, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25290819, text='I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with your point regarding letting a disgruntled employee go (and do agree with both grandparent that mentioning resignation was a dangerous negotiating tactic and parent that this seems like Google attempting to quickly revoke an unhappy employee&#x27;s access to internal information that could paint them in a bad light) I do think its important to note that the email documenting her demands was only sent to her managers and wasn&#x27;t a group email. Based on the responses to her tweets about this her team was blindsided by her being let go.<p>Also important to the discussion is that her managers (and thus Google) appear to be framing this as &quot;accepting her resignation&quot; as opposed to firing her (tying into GP&#x27;s point) which likely has consequences with regard to separation benefits and lets Google frame this as not being their decision (or at least would be if it weren&#x27;t for Twitter&#x2F;articles like this).<p>It seems like Gebru did things correctly with regard to reporting her unhappiness to her management team but made the mistake of mentioning possible resignation in response to a lack of change which Google jumped on as a method to protect themselves by immediately removing a possibly disgruntled employee in a way that allows them to avoid the downsides of firing her (that simple description alone not meant to imply any judgment).<p>Its a rather murky situation to untangle though when combined with Google&#x27;s firing of employees participating in organization and other events over the last few years giving the general impression of Google &quot;becoming evil&quot; I does seem like the bad PR this will cause means Google&#x27;s handling of the situation was a bad choice.')
