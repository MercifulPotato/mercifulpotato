I always get them confused because I trialed them simultaneously :p<p>Huh, I wasn’t aware of that being the primary use case of npx. I assumed the primary use case was to be sugar on top of ‘.&#x2F;node_modules&#x2F;.bin&#x2F;*’, which the documentation seems to lead with too (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;npm&#x2F;npx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;npm&#x2F;npx</a>)<p>They immediately call out auto-installation as a feature after that, but apparently there is a ‘—no-install’ flag you can use too. I guess I would have expected this to be opt-in through ‘—auto-install’ or something is all.')
