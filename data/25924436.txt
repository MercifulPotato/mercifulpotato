Twitter and Facebook are in a bind because their business is to curate speech amplification in order to maximize exposure to ads. So if you ask “why did person X see post Y?” it’s because Twitter&#x2F;FB <i>decided to</i> show Y to X. So they have automatically become at least partially responsible for the effect of that post.<p>So to me this Twitter&#x2F;FB censorship fiasco is not about free speech censorship whatsoever. It’s about these companies being in the business of deciding who sees what, being externally pressured to do a better job.<p>It wouldn’t make any sense whatsoever to ask Twitter&#x2F;FB to “stop censoring” while admitting that they should be allowed to curate feeds to maximize ad revenue.')
