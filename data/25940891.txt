It&#x27;s a cool idea to plot out the journey you&#x27;ve been on with little summaries and links to the blogs and videos&#x2F;talks&#x2F;ideas that you were focused on at the time.<p>Cooler still that the beginning of the journey was a 12 startups in 12 months project. I&#x27;m actually in the middle of doing that as we speak, and am about to finish month one. Definitely feeling that &quot;final 10% of effort seems to take as long as the previous 90%&quot; thing currently ... kind of wondering whether I&#x27;ll have something shippable or usable in the next two days. But even if I don&#x27;t, next month is another chance to get it right and to build off of the things I&#x27;ve learned in month 1.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ll be interested to see more from you. If you&#x27;re curious to check out my work I&#x27;m putting up weekly blog summaries here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;startupinamonth.net" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;startupinamonth.net</a>. Definitely gonna start keeping track of what I&#x27;m reading and thinking about so I can do a similar overview post in a year or two :)')
