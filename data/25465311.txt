In any case your opponent <i>will</i> do the same against you so you come up handicapped if you skimp on preparation. Having to do actual homework is the thing that kind of disincentivized me as a teen from pursuing a potentially professional chess future and led me to do more normal studies. Now with an actual job and all that I&#x27;d hardly find the time to go up that hill again.<p>So you can see my habit of being distracted in the face of actual work isn&#x27;t new and the advent of electronic devices was just icing on the cake.')
