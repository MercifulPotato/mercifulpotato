With the growth of LSP and DAP, it&#x27;s no longer an issue, and I&#x27;m back in Emacs for the vast majority of my daily work (including Java).<p>I hope LSP beats JetBrains products.  It&#x27;s an open standard and lets language designers focus on their language instead of tooling.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, JetBrains products are well polished and productive.  I just don&#x27;t see them being able to compete in the long-term with LSP, which is free and more attractive to language designers.')
