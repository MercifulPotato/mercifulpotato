Specifically, all profits have a fee assessed but it doesn&#x27;t account for money lost on associated contracts so if you buy Biden winning the election for $0.90 and buy Trump losing for $0.10 ---&gt; if Biden wins, that contract resolves to $1 but you only receive $.99 due to the fee. Meanwhile you have lost $0.9 on your other contract. This effect is most noticeable in markets with multiple contracts (e.g., who will be named secretary of state).')
