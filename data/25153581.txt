Previously successful people often over-estimate their skill and have a naive belief in their ability to pick or make a winner. They can fail and lose most everything, and the consequences for their families and friends are harsh (although I don’t know if it is ends up being a benefit for the economy overall; and restarting from scratch again is easier if younger).<p>Some requirements for diversification (instead of accreditation) would help mitigate such risky behaviour, and allow small investors to invest too.<p>Do “director-level management and those employees that are actually responsible for the investment activities of the fund” make sensibly diversified investment decisions? I don’t have a wide enough experience to answer that, but my very limited experience says no, they are just as likely to concentrate everything into one risk.')
