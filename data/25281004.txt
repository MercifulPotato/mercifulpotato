For some, we know they do. For most, it&#x27;s more likely they simply don&#x27;t matter much or at all. There are tons of examples thru history, and modern, of the benefits of simple enriched foods from iodized salt to Golden rice that do not have the whatever mythical natural balance of iodine and vitamin A. There are people living entirely on food substitutes, both due to poverty&#x2F;medical conditions and because they are tech hipsters. As someone mentioned there are vegetarians&#x2F;vegans who do just fine without these nutrients; hard to imagine they&#x27;d do worse if they also ate a fake burger.<p>Your comment is a simple example of natural-is-good fallacy. For all you know those natural micro-nutrients in meat could be net harmful (there are studies that some types of meat have negative health effects, and I say it as an avid steak eater - as far as I know, they don&#x27;t have a good handle on specific causes, so it could be that the fake steak won&#x27;t have them and only the &quot;natural&quot; one does :)).')
