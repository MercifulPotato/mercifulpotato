Of course, the delivery drivers&#x2F;bikers still make very little.<p>But the evidence suggests that given US labor costs and <i>relative</i> equality for much of the population, it&#x27;s generally hard for middle-class or even upper-middle class to justify paying people to run errands for them generally. I&#x27;m not sure the economics of fast delivery are all that different from when kozmo.com was around.')
