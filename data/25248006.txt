We need at least two webs of trust.<p>Would you trust a Democrat to fact-check Trump&#x27;s claims of election fraud?  Would you trust a Republican?  In fact, you should trust the Democrat if they say the claims are true, and the Republican if they say the claims are false.<p>Ideally, we&#x27;d get one set of fact-checkers that both sides trust.  In practice, that may not be possible.  But at least, if we have separate fact-checkers for each side, if they agree, then we have a fairly good basis for suspecting that they&#x27;re right.')
