Go errors are purely a convention that is no better than C style error code returns. Not good enough in whatever year Go was designed. There are solutions to that issue that are much more composable than that (options, sum types...).<p>People come to Go for performance and concurrency (although context is another one of these tacked on horrors) and they leave the language because of the crazy ceremonial boilerplate it incurs.')
