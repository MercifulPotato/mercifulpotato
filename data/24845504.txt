Even then its hard to see the pace of innovation (for lack of a better word) slowing.<p>It seems to me that technology is now in the stage, where its everywhere. Every industry that is quick to adopt new software gains a competitive advantage over its peers, in so many industries. This unreasonable effectiveness of software seems to feed itself.<p>I would love to see studies that measure&#x2F;quantify the blooming and culling of technologies so we could talk about these things with more than just anecdata.')
