Item(by='firethief', descendants=None, kids=[24720965], score=None, time=1602168507, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24715216, text='&gt; I specifically like the idea of zero waste stores where you bring your own containers to fill. Not only do you eliminate waste, reusable and sealable containers are so much nicer than what most products come in.<p>How would the food arrive at the store?<p>I used to buy food from a store with bulk bins. The store has a program where you can order the bags that they fill the bins from and pick those up directly--strong paper bags, usually around 25lbs. Lately I&#x27;ve found a mill and some other businesses nearby sell these bags of locally grown staple foods. By switching to the &quot;upstream&quot; bags, I&#x27;ve been able to choose local farms I want to support, nearly eliminate going to the supermarket (for produce I have a small, nearly-wild garden and do some foraging), and pay less for fresher food. Would it be possible to eliminate the 25lb bags from the loop? Probably, but they definitely reduce the friction of buying their contents, and they&#x27;re made from a small amount (square-cube law) of material that makes a good sheet mulch.')
