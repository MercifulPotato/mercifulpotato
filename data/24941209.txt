Find the OS, load it, transfer control to it, stop.<p>The most complex thing a BIOS should need to do is the user interface when I press F2 (or something) so I can boot from a DVD or USB.<p>I don&#x27;t ever want to &quot;upgrade&quot; the BIOS. If I have a machine with suspected malware on the HDD, I want to be able to remove that hard disk and be reasonably confident that the machine is now malware-free. If the malware had a chance to replace the BIOS, I would need to open up the case and use additional equipment to put the BIOS code back, as I could not rely on the BIOS code to this task for me.')
