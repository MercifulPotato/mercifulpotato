And a lawyer won&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s your personal device. They&#x27;ll want to see it because it shows up in an audit log from your employer. They&#x27;ll want to check: have you saved any work content? Have you copy&#x2F;pasted work messages elsewhere? Just about anything is fair game once the device is identified.')
