I am working on one, but the single reason for that is that I am not good with Raspberry Pi. If I had cofounder with embedded Linux skills I would immediately ditch my FPGA design. 25$ price tag of Raspberry Pi compute module 4 is very attractive. Iâ€™ll end with ~100$ FPGA board making whole product more expensive.')
