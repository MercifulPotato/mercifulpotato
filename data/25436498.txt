Seems like a good platform to apply the demoscene trick of &quot;adaptive subsampling&quot; to greatly improve performance at the cost of a little image quality.<p>It takes advantage of the fact that pixels that are close together in screenspace are likely to be similar enough to interpolate from it&#x27;s neighbours where possible.  It focuses the computation time on areas where neighbouring pixels are very different, such as object boundaries, shadow boundaries and large lighting differences.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20101123123238&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exceed.hu&#x2F;h7&#x2F;subsample.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20101123123238&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;exceed.hu&#x2F;...</a>')
