Jimmy and I met in the class and stayed in touch. One of the many things we bonded over was our shared mental health journey. From growing up in households where it’s highly stigmatized to dealing with our own struggles during college and beyond, we realized we both had a drive to do something based on our and our loved ones’ patient journeys. We are lucky to work with a number of advisors who are some of the most respected academics and practitioners in psychiatry such as Dr. Charles DeBattista and Dr. Alison McInnes. We know we have a lot to learn and are excited to continue to bring in these perspectives.\nI am super grateful you’ve pointed out what your perception is! I would be happy to address any additional concerns or take any other feedback :) thank you so much! lucia@osmind.org')
