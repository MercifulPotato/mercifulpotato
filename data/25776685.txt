Because &quot;labor saving devices&quot; is by no means the field of machine learning. A hammer is a &quot;labor saving device&quot; if all you have are rocks. I&#x27;ve got the impression that a lot of people conflate machine learning and robotics with labor saving in general. Of course compared to the state of art machine learning let&#x27;s us hope to find magical shortcuts to get our work done. But an IDE, a word processor, or a compiler is also a labor saving devices. As well as a piece of paper, it is way faster to doodle on a piece of paper at your desk than finding the next cave to doodle.')
