Ever heard of mukbang? Or reaction videos? Lots of people understand that if you make a 10 minute video that can be used as background noise while working or playing video games, you can make a lot of money. Youtube has to be aware of this, which would explain why they so quickly take down any video that advertisers might not like.<p>It may become a dinosaur to people who value quality content, but go search the topics I mentioned and compare the view counts to the types of videos you normally watch.')
