Obviously you want global deps for a console scripting language, but if you are doing any sort of bigger project, having a global deps location (which is implicitly resolved by the language, no less) is unacceptable for reproducible development for larger projects today.  The env hack that python managers like conda and venv use is, IMO, extremely dangerous, because it&#x27;s hiding state.<p>These days I use languages that don&#x27;t do this for my daily drivers, it&#x27;s better for my sanity.')
