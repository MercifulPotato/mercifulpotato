Item(by='gregw2', descendants=None, kids=[25681332], score=None, time=1610076620, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25679474, text='I think the points made in the article are fine, there is something to the way colleges facilitate community and their physical design encourages walkability and enables that... but I would offer one caveat to this which cities should avoid when considering what to imitate and what not to.<p>I have noticed a correlation between excessive building costs and campaigns and the two industries whose prices have most outpaced inflation the last 20 years: healthcare&#x2F;hospitals and education&#x2F;colleges.<p>Alumni returning to their colleges after 20-50 years may notice the following phenomena: there are a lot more buildings (with donor names on them) but there is an incredible number of empty rooms at any one point in time... many more than when they went to school back in the day.  (This also manifests in a lot more time-consuming walking to get around due to the lower density of usable space.)<p>This trend is neither wise nor sustainable nor just.  And college administrators should be held accountable for it, not given a pat on the back for raising money and spending it (despite the nice line on their resume). Alternate metrics of success should be culturally encouraged and measured.<p>How could this be done?  I don&#x27;t know if LEED certification (which is an award given to buildings meeting various sustainability&#x2F;efficiency criteria and has Gold&#x2F;silver&#x2F;bronze-type ratings which are thus indirectly a bragging right mentioned by anyone in academia who gets buildings built) measures actual building utilization... I suspect not. Typically LEED covers initial construction and is awarded at the end of construction, and thus could not include use-after-buildout metrics&#x2F;grading, but LEED or something like it should attempt to measure something like that, and that should be a sign of true administrative competence (and also efficient use of donor funds by the way.)<p>I wonder if the very sensors which are used to shut off lights when people aren&#x27;t around and any &quot;energy&#x2F;CO2 savings metrics&quot; from those sensors could be cheaply repurposed and inverted to also measure the creation of just such a building utilization metric (look how much carbon we wasted and continue to waste heating&#x2F;cooling a building people aren&#x27;t using?)')
