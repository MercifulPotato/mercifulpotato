The way it was discovered is remarkable. A telescope was looking at a distant star, then the star seemingly brightened over a period of 42 minutes. And that was basically it.<p>When a massive object passes between a distant star and an Earth-based observer the light coming from the star gets deflected and focused by the gravity of the massive object. The star seemingly brightens as a result. This is called gravitational microlensing. The duration and how the brightening happens allowed scientists to determine that it was likely a Mars-sized planet and that it likely had no star within 8 astronomical units. It&#x27;s likely a rogue planet of roughly Earth size.<p>Think about how little actual information these astronomers had. Yet they were able to make a very credible prediction on what happened. You see this all over in science, particularly in physics, where the truth is coaxed out of very little direct data. This makes me think that similar things can probably be done with data about people. This would mean that effectively anonymizing people&#x27;s data is very hard or maybe even impossible.')
