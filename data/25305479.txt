Make them pay for it!”<p>There’s some parallels between making college&#x2F;university free and the free K-12 education mandates decades ago. (Yes, it’s not “free free” but “taxed to be free”, but that’s beside the point)<p>Also, people don’t want their taxes raised when there’s no benefit to <i>them</i>. If one’s kids have all graduated, you see no reason to pay more money and get nothing in return.')
