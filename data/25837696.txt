Item(by='jsmith45', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611084588, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837209, text='I&#x27;d say that first one (api_info) is semi-plausible in terms of being &quot;configured&quot; for piracy, in that it hard codes the production API of the site, and I assume the data accessible therein is largely piracy.<p>It is also true that one would need to modify quite a few places to make this codebase sensibly usable for anything non-piracy. Even if an Anime studio decided to make their back catalog available over torrent (for some reason), this site really is not designed for their needs.<p>However, I strongly suspect this list of files is roughly the set that have &#x27;nyaa&#x27; as a stand alone word (i.e. not part of a snake case word or other compound). I suspect they loaded the code into a search engine, and searched for &quot;nyaa.si&quot;, and flagged all results. Many search engines will treat the &#x27;.&#x27; like a space, will filter out &quot;si&quot; as being too short, and thus search for &quot;nyaa&quot;, and only find results for that when it exists as a separate word.')
