Rust&#x27;s type system is basically a more sophisticated version of Java&#x27;s, JS is in the opposite direction - a much simpler dynamic type system.<p>I would argue that a sophisticated type system is closer to dynamic typing than a simple type system. A type system is like guard rails that prevent you from doing certain things. A sophisticated type system gives you more freedom and possibilities than a simple type system, and hence is closer to a dynamic type system without the guard rails at all.')
