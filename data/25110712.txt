I am saddened by your comment. As the HN rules suggest, try to be charitable. I am not a bad actor.<p>Does empathy and understanding other people lead to Nazism etc or away from extremism? Does encouraging less thought and consideration about your neighbour make the world better? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>Explicitly how do we change a person&#x27;s mind away from extremism? Is it possible? Will they want to? See my above comment in that light. Understanding others is hard but it&#x27;s possible.<p>Is it possible for humans to be less polarised? If so, perhaps understanding and empathy is one way.<p>I try to allow people to change their minds and allow peace and more empathy. Real change comes from inside. I cannot change another&#x27;s mind for them. Some see this change as painful and some others are fearful of people changing their minds as it means less in group cohesion. If opposite groups are less coherent is that better than advocating for more polarisation?<p>Back to the original question: If you do not understand what is going on, do you think it&#x27;s possible to understand? If yes, do you want to understand? if yes, how does one understand something? If no, how does not wanting to understand something affect the world? Does less or more understanding help or hinder lives?')
