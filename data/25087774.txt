Durable Objects will provide consistency, at the cost of not having the very low latency of KV because it has to run in a single location instead of on the edges. So there seems to be room for both solutions.<p>About DDOS, I believe Cloudfare is a leader in ddos-protection, so I would hope they include protection in all their Workers (pls someone correct me if I&#x27;m wrong).')
