Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605555410, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25114207, text='<i>&gt; relativity does away with the alternative, that of a universally accessible “now”</i><p>Relativity does away with &quot;now&quot; period--&quot;now&quot; is a frame-dependent concept in relativity, and frame-dependent concepts, in relativity, have no physical meaning.<p>As I noted in the article I linked to upthread, the physically meaningful division of spacetime, at some particular event &quot;here and now&quot; (like you sitting in your chair reading this), is into <i>three</i> parts, not two: the past light cone, the future light cone, and the spacelike separated region (what Roger Penrose, in the very same book where he presents the Andromeda scenario, calls &quot;elsewhere&quot;). The past light cone behaves like our intuitive concept of &quot;past&quot;, and the future light cone behaves like our intuitive concept of &quot;future&quot;, but the spacelike separated region does <i>not</i> behave like anything our intuition is familiar with. The whole &quot;Andromeda paradox&quot; argument is based on failing to recognize that the spacelike separated region exists in relativity and doesn&#x27;t match up with our intuitions about either &quot;past&quot; or &quot;future&quot;.')
