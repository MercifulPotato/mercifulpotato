A flurry of disinformation and online noise is somewhat manageable so long as it is coming from humans, who may be paid by a state or an enterprise to drive engagement with controversial topics.<p>It&#x27;s going to get a million times worse when this gets automated.<p>Right now the quantity of disinformation is practically limited by the human capacity to post stuff online, but GPT-3 style automation will remove this limitation, and we will live in a world of all noise, no signal. Our knee-jerk adherence to &quot;free speech&quot; is opening up a dangerous scenario where we are more vulnerable than anyone else to what is effectively a DDOS on our minds.<p>I explored this topic in more detail in an essay of mine, where I lay out that a world of Anonymity + GPT-3 can undermine free speech by drowning out real human views and opinions with machine-generated, human-looking propaganda. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jayriverlong.github.io&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;24&#x2F;gpt3.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jayriverlong.github.io&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;24&#x2F;gpt3.html</a>')
