This isn&#x27;t something I know much about, so perhaps it&#x27;s not at all practical, but at least in principle this should be possible for chips with open designs.<p>&gt; You could thwart all that with a microcode layer anyway.<p>I don&#x27;t see that the particular techniques used in the design, such as microcode, would matter. The question is whether the published netlist matches the one on your chip.<p>&gt; I think the closest you&#x27;re going to get to &quot;verifiably secure&quot; is an FPGA based core.<p>I agree that&#x27;s the most practical solution.')
