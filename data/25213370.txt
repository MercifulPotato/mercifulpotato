Item(by='morelisp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606333263, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25212671, text='&gt; animals presumably outrank plants in terms of moral standing.<p>In aggregate I probably agree but one thing I&#x27;ve wondered, especially in the last year as I started gardening during lockdown, is if that&#x27;s really universally true. Large, long-lived plants - redwoods, oaks, saguaros, and so on - seem very close to the same niche in the plant kingdom humans occupy in the animal one. They exert significant energy to cultivate and modify their environment; they gather and store resources they do not immediately need; they change &quot;behavioral&quot; patterns significantly and cyclically over the course of their life; they maintain vast communication networks.<p>I have no doubt a pig &quot;outranks&quot; a mosquito. But I also suspect a redwood outranks a mosquito. The middle is all fuzzy though - where does my cucumber (which exhibits relatively complex reproductive behavior to attract pollinators, and expresses significant &quot;wants&quot; in terms of vining and leaf facing) lie in relation to mosquitos, or aphids, or bees?')
