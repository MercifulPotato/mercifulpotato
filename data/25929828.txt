Stock owners are free to not sell their stock and this cannot be ignored.<p>I have a guitar that I could sell on the open market for ~$300.<p>But I don&#x27;t want to sell it.<p>If someone offered me $300 for it, I&#x27;d say no. If they offered $400, I&#x27;d still say no. I&#x27;d say no at $900.<p>Why? Because I don&#x27;t want to sell it and I don&#x27;t have to.<p>There is some price that will change my mind, of course, but it has nothing to do with the actual value of the guitar.')
