This is &quot;the plan&quot; that QAnon people implore us to &quot;trust&quot;. No matter how bizarre and disconnected the happenings in various Government agencies seem, it&#x27;s all supposedly part of &quot;the plan&quot; that we&#x27;re supposed to just trust.<p>Pedophile rings in the highest levels of Government and high society seem disturbingly plausible. I have no idea who&#x27;s connected to it or how it all works, but I bet we&#x27;d all be pretty disturbed if it ever really came to light. But I&#x27;m not about to buy that there&#x27;s a secret plan that&#x27;s going to make it all work out, and everything is actually happening according to that plan.')
