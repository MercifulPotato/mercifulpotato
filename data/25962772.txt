But Apple is hiding their own tracking under default opt-in switches and using double standards as well. It&#x27;s funny that their own apps don&#x27;t disclose all the data that iCloud collects and uses for basic functionality like messaging.<p>Having BOTH corporations honestly disclose what they collect would be the biggest win for us.')
