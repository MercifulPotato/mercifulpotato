But if anyone actually did that back in 1980, they wouldn&#x27;t have been successful<p>Strongly disagree. Although x86 was dominant on desktop PCs with MS DOS, Nintendo Entertainment System used MOS 6502 which is a lighter version of m68000, while Sega Mega Drive used a full blown m68000. Apple II desktop also used MOS 6502, HP used PA-RISC for their HP-UX servers, and Sun replaced their 68000s with SPARC in late 80-s. Alpha achitecture was so successfull there was a Windows NT port for this achitecture. So it wasn&#x27;t really game over as of 80s, and even in 90s the market was still diverse. It&#x27;s only by 00s x86 together with Windows NT series achieved total dominance, even in small server segment.<p>&gt;So I guess the point is that technology adoption proceeds by evolution, and trying to plan 10 or 20 years ahead of time never works<p>Right conclusion - wrong reasoning. Quality of product is never a main driver of sales. That&#x27;s why to succeed you need to market it first and then elaborate some way to make it usable. That&#x27;s where, for example, Motorolla, Alpha, MIPS failed, and that&#x27;s where ARM won as an umbrella brand for actually 4 incompatible architectures (original ARM, AArch32, AArch64, and Thumb a.k.a. SuperH).')
