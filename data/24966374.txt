Laptop which is thin and lightweight enough to be handy, but having real RJ-45 and access to the pinout, and having battery large enough for 24+ hours of uninterrupted work.<p>Could be a great tool for engineers working &quot;in the field&quot;, allowing to connect any device to pinout and check how it works on the spot, with simple Python script. Shame such an idea did not implement yet, I feel pity for not having proper background in electronics.<p>Dreaming on, I also can imagine Arduino co-processor, like it has been done in Latte Panda (Arduino Leonardo on SBC). It would&#x27;ve been an ultimate tool for prototyping, testing or studying electronics, Embedded and IoT.')
