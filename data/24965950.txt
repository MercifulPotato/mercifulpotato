Although I can see why the target market (education) just prefers an all-in-one computer, this also means that the RPi 400 can&#x27;t be used as a keyboard for other computers. Therefore I&#x27;ll still need to carry a keyboard around.<p>There will be software options for virtual USB host (e.g. shameless plugs for the EspUSB which uses WiFi, or KeyMouSerial which uses serial) but in practice, those wouldn&#x27;t be as easy for most hackers. There&#x27;s also no F12 key, which is needed for system configuration on some distros.<p>The two Micro-HDMI ports are quite small and close together (especially when using a 3-way micro-mini-full size HDMI adaptor).<p>Like Apple, there&#x27;s no headphone jack. Also no built-in SD reader, so I&#x27;d still need to carry a USB card reader (unlike my laptop, which can go directly from camera SD cards to HDMI on a projector).<p>Final nitpick: if this keyboard is intended for young people, their hands are smaller, so full-size keys are actually less comfortable. (believe it or not, I&#x27;ve even seen keyboards intended for children that have extra-large keys). A design with smaller keys that could fit in my large pocket (e.g. TI-84 sized device) would be preferable.<p>What the RPi Foundation has done is an excellent feat of engineering, and they should and will be rewarded by the market for their innovation. It&#x27;s a great product. I just still see some room for future improvements.')
