It blows my mind.<p>Here (Germany) offer letters are used to outline the general terms of an offer however the next step will then be that you’re sent a contract (some of mine have been &gt; 10 pages) outlining a lot of relevant things such:\n- role (ideally even with a job description but that is rare)\n- place of employment (city&#x2F;country)\n- IP assignment\n- length of probation\n- length of notice period for both sides\n- expectation of work travel\n- vacation\n- compensation<p>And a bunch of other things that I’m forgetting.<p>Similar to the above story, there’s always some resistance from employers to customize terms. It’s operationally much simpler for a company to have unified terms. However at every company I’ve been at I’ve been able to secure changes to the IP assignment clauses.<p>Of course all of this only works because these contracts are enforceable. There’s no such thing as at will employment here.')
