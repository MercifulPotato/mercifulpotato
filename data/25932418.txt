The “safe environment” was under constant revision and I regularly found myself unable to run pkg_add or build a flavored port or whatever because the expected variables were being excised from the environment. If I had been paying attention, keeping sudoers up to date probably would not have been such an ordeal, but I don’t like change.<p>&gt; The core of the problem was really that some people like to use sudo to build elaborate sysadmin infrastructures with highly refined sets of permissions and checks and balances. Some people (me) like to use sudo to get a root shell without remembering two passwords.<p>&gt; […]<p>&gt; Talking with deraadt and millert, however, I wasn’t quite alone. There were some concerns that sudo was too big, running too much code in a privileged process. And there was also pressure to enable even more options, because the feature set shipped in base wasn’t big enough. (As shipped in OpenBSD, the compiled sudo was already five times larger than just about any other setuid program.) Hurray, tension. It wasn’t the problem I was trying to solve, but it was an opening from which to launch my diabolical plan.')
