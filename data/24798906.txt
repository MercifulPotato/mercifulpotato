Yes there have been accidents, and there are accidents every month or so-- just check the public DMV reports.  A lot are minor, like other cars knocking the radars off the front of the car back when Cruise cars had radars that stuck out awkwardly.  Some were worse though-- I&#x27;ve seen one where airbags deployed in the other car (other car was going very fast and rear-ended the AV).  Cruise has not had an UberATG &#x2F; Elain Herzberg -magnitude accident, though.<p>The cars have a handbook for safety drivers and the case is handled like almost any other accident.  This system was put in place following the first accident that occurred near the SF courthouse years ago (safety drivers were hired following that crash).<p>What happens if there&#x27;s no safety driver?  Remote assistance is there, and the city is not a large place if you have to recover a wayward robot.  I am not a lawyer; there will probably be some regulation eventually.')
