It is a shame it hasn&#x27;t made it online somewhere convenient.<p>I believe it remains one of the seminal works in SF, and holds up pretty well today.<p>At the time of publishing, Vinge was one of the very few people who had a good grasp of the limits of computation and molecular nanotechnology were.  Up until that point in mainstream SF writing, highly advanced technology was more akin to magic, even in &quot;hard&quot; SF.  Aside from FTL tech (necessary for a novel with galactic scope), and the Zones of Thought (an artifice to help tell stories centering on people), Vinge sticks close to what is physically possible.<p>The prologue alone is packed with realistic details that was exceptional for its time.')
