It’s the IE of the 2020s, and sometimes Firefox doesn’t quite cut it<p>I&#x27;m aware that this is an unpopular stance in certain circles, but I wouldn&#x27;t touch Firefox with a pipe wrench. Chromium&#x2F;Chrome is not the IE of the 2020s, and this kind of delusional statement underlines the <i>actual</i> issue with the state of Chrome in Debian (and generally the linux world): a big share of the people still involved with the respective OS-development are completely out of touch with the actual state of things.<p>When Mozilla dropped the incident response team a couple of months ago, the backlog of incidents was already in an - from my perspective - inacceptable shape. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not against Firefox and the noble ideas it represents. It&#x27;s just, to be frank, batshit crazy to claim that <i>Chrome</i> is the IE of the two. The opposite is the case, and the situation will worsen dramatically over the course of the next years, if the current trajectory is any indication.')
