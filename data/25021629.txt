It was before the laptop become a thing. Read some CNN news on 2019 and 2018, when the water is not that hot. CNN still pose some doubt on Hunter Biden&#x27;s stance and potential corruption.<p>For example, Hunter Biden has invested a China company called Face++, which later to be a core technology to surveillance on Uygur.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;12&#x2F;business&#x2F;cefc-biden-china-washington-ye-jianming.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;12&#x2F;business&#x2F;cefc-biden-china...</a><p>Patrick Ho, a former Hong Kong official being charged for corruption in US, being accuse of bribing Africa leader for allowing China&#x27;s Energy company to exploit natural resource in Africa, which is part of the One Belt and One Road grand plan in China. Basically a form of colonialism from China.<p>The interesting part is right here. When Patrick Ho is on charged, who he called for a help? It is Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden&#x27;s business partner in China is Ye Jianming, who is the boss of Patrick Ho. Ye Jianming is now &quot;disappeared&quot; or under investigation in CCP because Patrick Ho&#x27;s arrested and Ye Jianming&#x27;s operation has failed.<p>You can seach the keyword here. Those story are in CNN, New York Times etc.<p>It is pretty strange for the mainstream media to completely ignore the story when they have the same doubt on two years ago.<p>Tha laptop? It could be a cover-up for a whist-blower. The information could be true or fake. But even without the laptop, there are many evidence that Hunter Biden using his father&#x27;s name involving in many corruption. And no one asked a question about his father&#x27;s involvement on that? In fact, Joe Biden has seen Hunter Biden&#x27;s China customer during the diplomatic visit to China.<p>If the mainstream media cannot be trusted, then it would be the best catalyst for conspiracy theory. In fact, the bias in the media has strengthened the polarization in the country even more.')
