Just as slowly use your arm and hand to move the head back to the middle.<p>By repeating it a few times while taking care to continue breathing smoothly in the background, it becomes possible for you to learn to use your arm muscles to roll the head gently and precisely, taking over the work usually done by the neck muscles.<p>For their part, the neck muscles are learning to let go of habitual tonus to accept passive movement.<p>Pause between movements. When you start again, go so gradually you can feel how soft intention to roll the head with the hand begins to manifest as movement.<p>You can also try moving the head 1cm to the right. The head rolls differently that way and if you do it slowly you can feel the details.<p>If you pay attention, you&#x27;ll probably notice that when you roll the head like this, there are small supporting movements of the shoulder blade and sternum. You might feel a shift of weight to the left where you feel your upper ribs against the floor.<p>Then you have a rest and go through this process using the other arm.<p>You maybe think if you do more, you can force the stiff ribs to move, but it&#x27;s the opposite: strong stretching movements, cause the ribs to protectively tighten themselves. (That&#x27;s how I think about it, but of course it&#x27;s actually muscles around the ribs that hold them in place.)<p>Instead by going near the limit of slow and small\nmovements, each movement generates more information, there is time and space for ribs, sternum, spine, shoulders, and head to let go and allow themselves to move together in a new way.<p>Hundreds of these movement lessons devised by Moshe Feldenkrais to improve human functions are called Awareness Though Movement. Hands-on work for this same purpose is called Functional Integration.')
