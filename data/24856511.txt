Layers upon layers of abstractions that ultimately wind up in data-driven points of control that align perfectly with the business questions. This allows for someone to reconfigure their business workflow application by logging into a web portal and adjusting a few settings. For instance, if our application were used in a retail environment, we would have a way to add and remove products from inventory using a web-based workflow as opposed to sending a change request to developers each time.<p>Ultimately, the key to producing a low code solution for us is to identify all of those points of change across business owners and contexts, and then to expose them in a way that the business owners are able to understand and manage themselves. This is never a perfect solution but you can usually get very close to no-code after a while.<p>Also, you can never <i>start</i> with a low&#x2F;no-code solution. You have to start with the option of full-custom and slowly work your way into low&#x2F;no-code. Developing Data-driven contracts which implement the various aspects of the business processes are the key to moving the slider down the spectrum.')
