Do you mean multiple remotes? The remotes are fully inside your local database if you run commands like git pull or git remote update, they are just not in your checkout. Commands like git show &lt;commit hash&gt; work on commit hashes in those remotes as well, even if it&#x27;s not in one of your local branches.<p>Or do you  mean configuring git to use multiple .git&#x2F;objects directories? I haven&#x27;t heard of that feature, can you give a link?')
