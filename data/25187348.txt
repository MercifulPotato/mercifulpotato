If you looked at anything down at the ASM level and lower it was pretty apparent what was going on.<p>There were plenty of RISC systems that were way out ahead of Intel that lost not because of inferiority but because they were being used for inferior business models.<p>DEC Alpha, Sun UltraSparc, etc.. they lost cause they weren&#x27;t pumping out zillions of consumer level chips that ran windows.  Then there are companies like IBM that just failed to capitalize on what they had or again kept their stuff super expensive and out of the big market for whatever reason.<p>I think lots of us new this day would come for x86.<p>A lot of this IMO is more about the ever decreasing importance of Windows.    Windows used to be so much more important than it is today.   Linux + the cloud taking over so much of server land and dev&#x2F;science land has changed things dramatically.   Then you have smartphones coming from the other direction.   Intel ruled back in the day because more computers ran Windows than anything else and Windows was heavily tied to Intel.   There&#x27;s more stuff non-Windows OSes today than there ever have been.  (Mac, Linux, iOS, Android).  All those other types of computers not running Windows gave competitors the money they needed to compete with Intel.')
