To me the true unrealized potential of these frameworks is abstracting away where and how exactly all the Rails&#x2F;Laravel&#x2F;Elixir business logic runs. If something need to run on the client, I want the framework to create the necessary JS of my backend code for me.<p>While I am sure there is a shit load of edge cases that would make this very hard to fully solve for all cases, I feel like a generic promise-like-structure shared between backend and frontend would already go a long way here.')
