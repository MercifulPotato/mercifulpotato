ML is used to improve UX &#x2F; ops\n2. Other people&#x27;s jobs depend on the quality of the ML output<p>1 can encompass things like offering recommendations or optimizing click-through. 2 is things like analytics-as-a-product in smart manufacturing.<p>I assume 1 is a lot easier to &quot;succeed&quot; at: if I receive a bad music recommendation, I just move onto the next one.<p>2 is harder to do well, and the output quickly loses credibility when it&#x27;s bad.<p>That said, bad ML in high-stakes contexts (by which I mean, someone else is using the ML to do their job better) <i>should</i> get weeded out pretty quickly...so for the total effort and care taken to address 2, they may be more successful on average.')
