I wish I knew and understood more, so I can eat less meat and eat more healthily.<p>My problem is that I’m Chinese and I live in Hong Kong. I’ve lived many years in Montréal before but I never picked up any “Western” culinary knowledge. Meanwhile, I get the impression that a lot of these nutritional studies seem to be based on Western diet, and there are ingredients that we Chinese are not familiar with (e.g. I can’t name at least half of the beans and vegetables that go into a salad at Passion by Gérard Dubois), let alone know where to buy without getting ripped off. Things that one would find completely ordinary and affordable in US&#x2F;Canada can be ridiculously expensive and&#x2F;or hard to find in Hong Kong.<p>If anybody has recommendations (books, YouTube channels, links, etc.) for someone living in East Asia to replicate similarly satiating, nutritious, and appealing meals, that would be awesome')
