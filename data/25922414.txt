The reply function works perfectly. I cannot stop suggesting it to people.<p>Unfortunately HackMD rejects the anonaddy.com TLD, so I&#x27;ve had to use my &quot;real&quot; address there, but so far everywhere else it works fine. A clever friend realized you can register a new github account with an anonaddy address and use that to connect to HackMD. Smart.<p>Great service. Free tier is great. Will probably end up paying and adding my own domain for the odd site that rejects theirs.<p>The only feature I&#x27;d like is greater bandwidth allowance per month on the lite plan. Current limits are 10MB per month free tier, 50MB on $1&#x2F;mo lite tier, and unlimited on Pro. But fair enough.')
