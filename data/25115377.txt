I&#x27;m in this career because I wondered how these things work in the first place. Just because Windows or macOS are closed systems they&#x27;re not less interesting. They&#x27;re harder to understand and, sometimes challenge calls.<p>Linux is nice, way better when compared to 15 years ago but, it&#x27;s not perfect. I&#x27;m going to buy a new PC in 12 months and I&#x27;d need to make some research about hardware compatibility and performance. Especially on the motherboard side. I have to make sure that it contains no funny devices or memory mappings so, I can&#x27;t use an on-board peripheral until someone writes a quirk just for that.<p>OTOH, every platform has its nice applications. While Darktable is a very nice photo editor and Digikam is a perfect DAM, CameraBag or OmniGraffle doesn&#x27;t work on Linux. Similarly, many basic functions of KDE&#x27;s Dolphin (Protocol support, embedded git, etc.) is not present on mac. Similarly my IDE of choice (Eclipse) wasn&#x27;t working well on macs until Big Sur.<p>However, while developing applications, Apple&#x27;s design decisions and inner workings provide some nice insight and inspiration for better experiences and more sensible defaults.<p>Using diverse set of platforms is mind opening for me. It&#x27;s important to understand the trade-offs of every one and, all of them are perfect in their own regard.<p>However, at the end of the day, I&#x27;m a FOSS lover and you can&#x27;t pry my Linux systems from my cold dead hands. macOS on the other hand is just a nice closed system to develop open source stuff for me.')
