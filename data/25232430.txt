Item(by='nickjj', descendants=None, kids=[25232732], score=None, time=1606509946, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25231486, text='&gt; Iâ€™ve been away from macs for couple of years, but these M1s are IMO a game changer.<p>The interesting thing here is, is it really a game changer in practice for something like web development and every day computer usage?<p>I&#x27;m not here to start a mac vs windows war but I have a 6 year old i5 3.2ghz CPU (4 cores, no HT) with 16gb of memory and a first gen SSD.<p>I use this workstation for full time development &#x2F; ops work on Windows with WSL 2 &#x2F; Docker, etc..<p>Everything is still pretty damn fast and it feels no different than the day I put together the machine.<p>Opening Chrome from hotkey to being able to type takes a second. Opening a terminal feels instant. Working with Vim and 50+ plugins has no type delay. Disk I&#x2F;O feels good. I can keep multiple VMs running, run multiple Dockerized large web apps in various web frameworks, open 20+ tabs in a browser and a bunch of other stuff and it doesn&#x27;t break a sweat. Sometimes I forget that I have image editors and other stuff open in virtual workspaces too.<p>I also do a lot of screencast recording &#x2F; editing. The only part of my workflow that feels sluggish at times is rendering videos but that ends up being a non-issue because if I need to export 75 videos for a course I queue them up before I goto sleep and it finishes before I wake up the next morning. For 10-20 minute videos here and there I just render them before doing something where I go AFK (showering, eating, going outside, etc.).<p>I guess what I&#x27;m getting at here is, I&#x27;m not sure how a faster CPU will really help that much in my day to day besides crushing benchmarks.<p>Are folks running non-M1 MBPs experiencing slow downs in their day to day where they feel compelled to get one with an M1? Where do you see and feel the performance wins in practice?')
