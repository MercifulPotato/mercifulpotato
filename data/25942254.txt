To continue with our little analogy: while Tuscany (and a few other places) have this peculiar cultural trait, it&#x27;s as still home for a lot of people who don&#x27;t recognize themselves in that and they also belong there and need to be respected. Very often that&#x27;s even the numeric majority of people.<p>&quot;my grandfather and my father and I all cursed God for breakfast for three generations and now I suddenly have to talk like what this pope-kissing bigots want me to?&quot; ignores that there are pope-kissing bigots in your society, your neighbor may be one, your friendly policemen may be well one, the old man across the street.<p>But also, there are people who are not pope-kissing bigots and YET behave themselves in a way to not saw division. Your children&#x27;s school teacher may be one, perhaps cursing in the privacy of her home but giving you a look you if your children talk like little fallen angels.<p>We&#x27;re all used to norms.

For them these topics become an identity-glue, something to hold on and to tell their ingroup from outgroups.<p>But there are also people who just don&#x27;t like norms and just by coincidence happen to be aligned with whoever is the norm-breaker du jour.')
