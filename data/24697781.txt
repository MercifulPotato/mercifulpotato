So when you bump up the ram speed you also bump the memory controller speed, which reduces ram latency and inter-cpu communication latency.<p>There is no telling what the memory controller -&gt; ram ratio will be with ddr5,  the memory controller has speed limits, so you aren&#x27;t going to get free speed just because the dr5 starts at 4800, because the zen memory controller can&#x27;t run that fast anyway.')
