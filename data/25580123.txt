Item(by='PeterisP', descendants=None, kids=[25580206], score=None, time=1609321011, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25577372, text='The thing we see with image features is that early layers of a convnet learn <i>almost</i> the same thing that specific engineered features that we used to implement, but better - the earlier feature engineering used &quot;clean&quot; human-designed structures, but DL automatically got to the same point and also tweaked the coefficients to be slightly better, and once you can do that, there&#x27;s no reason to go back to what we manually engineered. For example, why would you explicitly use a Sobel edge detector in preprocessing if you could use (for that same preprocessing) a set of convnet kernels that include (among other things) edge detector kernels that are very similar to Sobel but slightly better?<p>So no, I would not expect the currently known engineered image features to show up in preprocessing again - they simply do not add any value whatsoever (which can be experimentally verified) over the &quot;learned preprocessing features&quot;.  Perhaps someone will engineer a new substantially different type of feature that can&#x27;t be currently learned from data, and that would get used and cited - but it won&#x27;t bring citations to the old engineered features.')
