The entire point of the Sentate is to give a representation to the need of the state as its own entity - <i>not</i> as a representation to the people in the state. It wasn&#x27;t even intended to be an elected body.<p>It may feel unfair, but it&#x27;s intentional, and it does help ensure overall stability of the nation. The entire philosophy behind the US, right down to the the name of the nation, revolves around the fact that states are the fundamental unit and they have long-term needs which are not always understood or valued by the people. The house of reps is for the the needs of the people, not the Senate. This is why the US is a democratic republic, not a pure democratic state.')
