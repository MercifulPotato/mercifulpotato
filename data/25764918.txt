As more of a guided process than explicit steps, with the student getting to pick the direction they&#x27;ll go in.<p>That&#x27;s what taught me the most. It&#x27;s a shame there aren&#x27;t more opportunities like that in classes in general. Could be a question of teacher hours available, or because we can&#x27;t effectively measure progress between wildly different projects. Still, I think it&#x27;s more in-line with the way a workplace functions now.')
