No human body has seen this type of virus before, so when it infects the immune system has to work a lot to learn how to fight it. This causes symptoms like a fever which is a sign of the ongoing struggle. For frail people it means the immune system is not strong enough to counteract the infection and it spreads and potentially kills them.<p>However, if the immune system learns quickly enough how to fight it, antibodies are killing the virus faster than it can multiply and you get better. The antibodies then disappear in a few months but the long term memory cells remain.<p>Later, the virus infects you again. You develop the symptoms of a light respiratory infection but the immune system quickly references the memory cells and is able to produce suitable antibodies really fast. The fight is short and easy, the antibodies defeat the virus before it has time to spread. There is no sign of the struggle like first time (no fever) but only the light symptoms we don&#x27;t even think of (common cold).<p>Now, how about children? Well as we see already they&#x27;re unlikely to be seriously affected (low mortality). And children get lots of fevers (parents can confirm). So probably sometimes in the early years we get infected by some coronaviruses our bodies have never seen, the immune system puts up an intense fight and builds the long-term immunity that will be with us as adults.')
