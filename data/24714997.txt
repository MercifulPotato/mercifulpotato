African Americans are 13% of the US Population. Isn&#x27;t it reasonable to aspire to have at least 13% of African American staff (proportionally adjusted per state&#x2F;city populations)? This is a rhetoric question, what causes that to not be the case.<p>The article doesn&#x27;t mention the numbers but when a particular race is disproportionately less represented in corporations than its general population equivalent, then clearly there&#x27;s a broken piece somewhere in the equation.<p>I&#x27;m not even taking a political stance on this one. This is just the mathematical sound interpretation. If every person should have the same opportunities then the corporate populations should be a proxy of the general population proportions.')
