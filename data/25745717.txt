Word? Outlook? Autocad? Photoshop?) has its own system of automation if it has one at all, with many of the skills complicated to learn on one hand, and not transferable on the other. On tablets, automation is essentially nonexistent.<p>Whereas on Unix, there&#x27;s a mostly-unified system of automation (shell), with mostly transferable knowledge.<p>If there is nothing in your work that benefits from automation, you wouldn&#x27;t care. But you&#x27;d also be rather special, IME - most people spend a lot of time on recurring and automatable actions they gain no benefit from repeating manually.')
