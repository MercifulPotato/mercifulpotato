Anecdotally I know  a couple of people in Europe that travelled quite a bit during summer because it was an unique chance to see some historical places e.g. in Italy without the mass of tourists they are usually overrun by. But that was a tiny fraction of the usually very travel happy social circles of mine.<p>But for the US I think the main attractions are the big cities and the national parks. The former are not really tempting to go to atm and the latter you usually want to go in groups and they seem so vast that I donâ€™t think it is that big of an opportunity to go there when there are few tourists. The only people I know that traveled in between continents in the last months did so for family reasons and it was a huge pain for everyone with multiple flight cancellations, chaos with ever changing immigration requirements that not even the officials can keep up with, self-isolation, etc.')
