If your bank is taking &quot;up to three _work_ days&quot; for regular Euro transactions they are violating the law (§675s BGB).<p>As of last year, most banks also offer instant (10 seconds) transactions for a small fee. This is planned to be made mandatory at the end of 2021. My bank is charging 0.50€ for such transactions which is significantly less than the median Bitcoin transaction cost (more than $1 in 2020 average, more than $5 currently).')
