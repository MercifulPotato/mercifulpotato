Two major areas in which the identity politics movement is inconsistent with how a scientific rationalist society should behave are these:<p>1. The movement to deny that biological sex is an overwhelmingly important factor shaping human biology, just as it shapes the biology of other mammals. See<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quillette.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;30&#x2F;the-new-evolution-deniers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quillette.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;30&#x2F;the-new-evolution-deniers&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quillette.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;30&#x2F;think-cancel-culture-doesnt-exist-my-own-lived-experience-says-otherwise&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quillette.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;30&#x2F;think-cancel-culture-doesnt...</a><p>2. Deplatforming people with reasonable, rational viewpoints. Richard Dawkins is an example. Look at the most recent deplatforming by a university historical society that has recently become identity-politics oriented (The Hist at Trinity College Dublin). They deplatformed him because &quot;we value our members comfort above all else&quot;. So, that is an example of what I said, and that which you took exception to: the identity politics movement being less interested in truth than other things (here &quot;comfort&quot;).')
