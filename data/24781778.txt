(Apple&#x27;s chargers are of pretty high quality, but it seems weird to plug a phone into a usb c device that can charge a notebook).<p>Also I feel that the headphone ommission to save the environment would be more believable if they weren&#x27;t selling $100 wireless earbuds without replaceable batteries.<p>Much like &quot;Reuse your towels in the hotel&quot; is as much about saving the hotel money as saving the environment.')
