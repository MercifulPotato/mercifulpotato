Winter weather cycling&#x27;s definitely doable but I immensely prefer cycling in SF year round, where I don&#x27;t have to plan ahead or remember any warm gear. And I find not being able to bike for errands surprising, unless you lived outside of SF proper? I exclusively ran errands walking&#x2F;biking&#x2F;by bus for several years.')
