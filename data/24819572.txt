I tested with many different sites and configurations in order to narrow down the issue. The screenshots in the article are just a small sample of my tests, for illustration.<p>2. I&#x27;m not logged into Chrome or any Google services. I&#x27;ve gone through chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;settings and disabled everything Google-related.

My goal in publishing the article was to get the issue fixed ASAP. I&#x27;m a browser extension developer, so I&#x27;m constantly testing with different browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. It wasn&#x27;t my intention to start a browser war.<p>4. I believe that Chrome is entirely open source, so I hope that someone familiar with the code base will take a look at this issue. The sheer size and complexity makes it a bit daunting for an outsider, but since Chromium has been adopted by other browsers such as Brave and Edge, there are outside developers already working on it.')
