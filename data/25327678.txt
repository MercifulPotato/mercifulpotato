The purpose of JAMstack is to take client rendered websites (sites built with React, Angular, etc) and pre-compile the views to be more like static webpages. It is typically faster for the user because the client side framework doesn&#x27;t have to be downloaded and a lot of the layout and rendering computation was done before it was even deployed to the server.
