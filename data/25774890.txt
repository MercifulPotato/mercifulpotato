My role of course has changed although I&#x27;m still a developer&#x2F;architect type, it&#x27;s   obviously changing all the time. I have been offered management type roles but consistently rejected them though so it&#x27;s almost the same &quot;job&quot; too  (developer). That my business card might say &quot;Senior developer&quot; or &quot;Architect&quot; doesn&#x27;t really change what the job is I think.')
