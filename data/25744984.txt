The common usage of the word &quot;communist&quot; is defined not by vague Marxist theorising or tiny enclaves nobody has ever heard of, but rather the typical end state of actual communist revolutions. That&#x27;s how the word is used in practice.<p>This has the unfortunate property that at least for China the end-state is constantly evolving, but only in relatively unimportant ways. China has a freer market than the USSR did, but even the USSR had to abandon completely planned economics almost immediately after Lenin took power. After that it was mixed, just like China&#x27;s. And in all other ways they are the same: no democracy, rampant censorship and propaganda by state-allied corporate entities, no real private property rights  (if you can lose your IPO by giving a single speech criticising the government, it&#x27;s fair to say whatever private property rights you thought you had don&#x27;t really exist).')
