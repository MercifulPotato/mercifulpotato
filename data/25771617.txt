Item(by='hackeredje', descendants=None, kids=[25771749], score=None, time=1610595741, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25771510, text='COM interface: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;office&#x2F;client-developer&#x2F;onenote&#x2F;onenote-developer-reference" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;office&#x2F;client-developer&#x2F;one...</a><p>So just $whatever = New-Object -ComObject OneNote.Application and then lookat $whatever |get-member to see what you can do for members and properties.<p>---<p>I tried several things. I needed it because the amount of stuff around a family is just too much to keep in my brain especially with kids who needing a lot of help with their school and trying to also put some fun in it like &quot; nice netflix series you want to share&quot; but also serious stuff like &quot; households tasks, bedtimes etc&quot;<p>I think I could write a book on what i put in there.<p>Budget is also interesting, after 20 years I decide on the following structure:<p>A = income\nB = budget per household member (so 4 posts)\nC = everything that needs to be discussed (vacation budget, savings, subscriptions, stuff we want to buy this year, etc)\nD = everything that we do not need to discuss (mortgage, food, all kinds of city taxes, healthcare etc)<p>That makes it really simple: only the points in C are needed to discuss &quot;want to spend 20.000 on vacation Or want to spend 20.000 in savings&quot; .<p>Because I noticed that mosts of the costs stay the same.<p>Many of these &quot;topics&quot; then tie in or have an overlap with the knowledge management topics from another perspective. So e.g. the budget post C.Subscription.XboxLiveGold ties into culture_and_free_time.games and where we just have fun pages on various game consoles and tips for games we play or we want to share with each other or &quot; favorite games&quot; .')
