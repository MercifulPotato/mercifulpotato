And if any of this remote working has taught me anything, it&#x27;s that most of my colleagues don&#x27;t have steady&#x2F;reliable tech or connections, so i&#x27;d almost want it used pre-emptively as a default so we can spend the rest of those resources on robustness or other qualities. (I realise of course that at the moment none of them have high-grade Nvidia graphics cards, but I&#x27;m talking hypothetically in the far off future).<p>In short, I want a world where the cost to benefit ratio of things is orders of magnitude larger, because things like this let us spend network&#x2F;resources on things which matter.<p>Yes, when I&#x27;m calling my parent&#x2F;grandparent one on one I might want to upgrade the signal, but I don&#x27;t need to see random colleague&#x27;s face in all their HD glory, or remote people whom I have no idea who they look or sound like anyway (i believe that&#x27;s also been one of the findings with deepfakes, that you don&#x27;t notice the eerieness&#x2F;falseness as much if it&#x27;s a reference of a face that you don&#x27;t have pre-determined knowledge of).')
