The poorer countries can be partially funded by richer countries. This is to ensure that knowledge flows are not constrained due to lack of resources.<p>Agreed, a lot of grant funding now has an open access rider on it, so research doesn&#x27;t get stuck behind a paywall.<p>&gt; Research in the various Sciences have to be clearly identified as &quot;Critical&quot; or Not. The former is funded and managed completely differently than the latter.<p>How do you ensure that this classification of critical&#x2F;non-critical happens accurately? How do you hire for this team, and what metrics would you use to judge their performance? How do you ensure that this &#x27;non critical&#x27; funding isn&#x27;t simply a waste of money? This solution seems to just push the same problem further down the road.<p>&gt;For example, research in vaccines&#x2F;cancer is considered critical while research in &quot;battery chemistry&quot;(currently a hot area of research) is not.<p>I work in vaccines, and I don&#x27;t agree with this blanket assertion. How do you deal with vaccine technology that is junk and will never produce a safe and efficacious product?<p>&gt;In the former case, all we keep tabs on is &quot;some progress&quot; and not necessarily an external deadline i.e. researchers are given the freedom to keep working on it with self-imposed and self-defined milestones.<p>So unlimited funding for unlimited projects as long as they are critical according to some review committee? We might have a tiny problem doing that.. :)<p>&gt;* Finally, No &quot;Research&quot; project should ever be overseen by purely &quot;Administrative&#x2F;Finance&#x2F;MBA&quot; types. Only Core Domain Experts should be granted oversight with the above mentioned helping as needed.<p>We should have a large tent. Financial management is a critical component of any successful project. &quot;Core Domain Experts&quot; will likely have limited time, given their other commitments and own personal research to work on. Also, there needs to be a thorough vetting and oversight to make sure that these experts aren&#x27;t just funding projects that their buddies are working on.<p>I think you have some good ideas, but as you can probably imagine too, its no easy task proposing a working model, and getting it adopted world-wide :)')
