We also realised that I had a tinge of the stereotypical Canadian &quot;sooorry&quot; sound, so we ran with it.  If it&#x27;s a situation where one of us intends to express remorse for a situation occurring, we slightly intonate towards the &quot;o&quot; sound, and for situations where we&#x27;re accepting blame, we edge towards the American &quot;sarry&quot; (again, over emphasized to get the point across).  It&#x27;s subtle, but it&#x27;s worked well for us.')
