As a big data engineer, Rust does not provide any advantage to me. Good luck rewritting all the big data tools from Java (Elasticsearch, Spark, Kafka, Hadoop, Neo4j, Deeplearning4j, Cassandra, Solr, Arrow, OrientDB) and all the scientific stuff from C++ (Eigen, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Jax, Halide, OpenCV and the multitude of resources for CUDA and OpenCL) and databases (MySQL, MongoDB). If I want to contribute to LLVM or JVM, they are C++, the browsers are all C++. Unreal Engine and Unity (IL2CPP and engine) are all C++. Are you doing microVMs or drivers? Then probably Rust is a good investment (discutable), otherwise, I would wait for better alternatives. I will stick to Java, Scala, Python and C++ for the foreseeable future.<p>EDIT: may the downvotes come from the idealists that hammer down pragmatists, like our opinion doesn&#x27;t even count')
