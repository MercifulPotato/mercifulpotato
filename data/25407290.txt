And, also, just &quot;law&quot;.<p>One of the better developments of last few decades is that national borders are, for the most part, no longer subject to violent change. That&#x27;s due to territory simply losing importance: raw materials are insignificant, economically, compared to the fruits of intellectual labor. Borders have also become much more porous: the conflict in Northern Ireland, for example, lost much of its significance when it became commonplace to commute across the border every day.<p>Then, a once-mighty nation took the lead in establishing what&#x27;s called the &quot;rule-based international order&quot;: You may conquer some territory with your oh-so-mighty territory. But whatcha gonna do with it when nobody is going to reconise it and you can&#x27;t sell anything produced there in international markets?<p>There&#x27;s been enough regression in these efforts in recent years. No matter how grating it may be to see criminals getting away, it comes nowhere close to being significant enough to go back to might-is-right.')
