I think this was largely perpetuated by the rise of the Prius. Tesla solved this by building true performance cars, using the raw torque power of their EVs to assuage any concerns around performance and handling people could have.<p>Second is the concern around &quot;fueling&quot;, especially on road trips. This is obviously addressed by how stupid-easy the supercharging network is to use. I don&#x27;t think any other auto manufacturer will become a true competitor to Tesla until similarly extensive networks are built out by Ford, GM, etc.<p>Third is the paradigm-shift of the minimalist controls and the spaceship-like display. There are absolutely drawbacks to this--Mazda, for one, refuses to have touchscreens in their cars anymore due to safety concerns, and there are instances in my Model 3 where I dearly wish for a physical control. But there&#x27;s something incredible about sitting in a modern vehicle and not being faced with a baffling array of buttons and dials, and having nothing between you and the road.<p>The combination of these makes for a stellar experience with the vehicle, and for EVs in general.')
