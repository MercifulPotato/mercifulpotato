Charging stations can be everywhere: grocery stores, retail stores, office buildings, malls, just about any parking lot or parking garage, hotels, airport parking and on and on.  Gas pumps have to have huge underground tanks, and they have to be regularly refilled by large tanker trucks, by their very nature they will be less common and so they&#x27;d better be able to service more cars per hour.  Charging stations are much smaller and can tie into the grid just about anywhere, there should be a lot more of them and thus they won&#x27;t need to handle as many cars as a gas station does.')
