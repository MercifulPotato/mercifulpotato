Item(by='imgabe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603761733, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24903483, text='&quot;Two such procedures&quot; refers to two hysterectomies. Not <i>forced</i> hysterectomies. Presumably medically necessary ones. It is conceivable that out of thousands of detainees over two years, there might be two who needed a hysterectomy for some reason, and ICE provided them with the necessary medical care, as determined by the doctors in their employ charged with looking after the welfare of the detainees.<p>&gt; The report did not detail any detainees who said they had received a hysterectomy against their will;<p>Right there in the same article.<p>Even the whistleblower&#x27;s statement implies that there is <i>one</i> doctor doing it (though again, <i>this is unsubstantiated</i>), not that it is an official policy of ICE as the comment above implies. (&quot;the guys who forcibly castrate women&quot;)<p>I&#x27;m not trying to say ICE is great or never did anything wrong. I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m saying we can&#x27;t go around casually repeating unsubstantiated rumors as though they are gospel truths - even if they really, really seem like they would be true because they totally confirm all of our preconceived notions about the subject. Information is sloshing around the world faster than ever and this kind of sloppiness is literally destroying civilization.')
