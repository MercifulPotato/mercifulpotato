But WhatsApp <i>will</i> use the data they have more than Telegram will. That&#x27;s the tradeoff.<p>And yes, obviously Signal is more secure than both of them but I&#x27;ve been steering non-techies to Telegram because of usability, backups, cross-device history etc. As usual, everything is a tradeoff, but if people were happily using WhatsApp up until now, and also use Gmail, Telegram is not worse than those.')
