People who have been soldering their whole life find it easy to solder SMD because they have the coordination to do it and the temperature controlled station too.<p>I can solder qfps and tssop no problem but it&#x27;s still easier to solder a dip package, they can go in breadboards or perf board and you can bang together a circuit without temperature controlled stations or cad software')
