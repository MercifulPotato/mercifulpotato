The person is under the shelf in class E and therefore isn’t violating any airspace. They wouldn’t be subject to transponder or ADS-B requirements either because they (probably) don’t have an engine-driven electrical system.<p>The previous sightings do sound like this person busted the bravo but I’d have to do more research to be sure.')
