You cant run a signaling server in browser. When doing screen sharing between two browsers it basically goes to external signaling server on internet and asks credentials and then doing peer to peer communication.<p>Deskreen can run without access to world wide web with its own local signaling server.<p>The speed is also much better when doing direct communication through local signaling server running on host machine.<p>Hope that helps you to understand it better.<p>Cheers')
