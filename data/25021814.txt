Separate opinion journalism from reporting journalism.<p>Opinion journalism can be w&#x2F;e. Reporting journalism has to be fact checked. Masquerading as reporting journalism should be a big bad. You gotta disclose opinion journalism up front, like you gotta put a Surgeon General&#x27;s warning on cigarettes.<p>2. Mandate non-partisan districting boards and do away with &quot;safe&quot; districts.<p>This would lose majority-minority districts, which are responsible for a big proportion of our Reps of color. But safe districts skyrocket partisanship; politicians in safe districts can wander super far from the mainstream--think Steve King for example. And actually they oftentimes have to become radical in order to survive primaries. There&#x27;s only so much you can do here with the current system but, a little would help a lot.<p>3. Empower state and local governments by repealing balanced budget amendments and term limits.<p>State governments have really hamstrung themselves with these policies, and as a result the federal government has to do a lot. This creates a perception--right or wrong--that a far away government is telling you how to live your life. If the federal government has secured rights for all and managed federal concerns, it should be reasonable for say, Oregon to have one set of gun regulations and Illinois to have another.<p>4. Make voting compulsory, make Election Day a holiday, expand early voting, establish same day registration everywhere.<p>The majority of Senators (and in midterms, the majority of Reps) are elected by a minority of people who are much more partisan than the mean. This pushes politicians out of the mainstream.<p>5. Federally finance elections, shorten the length, and amend the Constitution to obviate <i>Citizens United</i>.<p>Campaigns and their ads are super polarizing. Special interests run messaging campaigns on wedge issues (abortion, immigration, gun rights) in order to pass bills like SOPA or subsidies for fossil fuel energy companies in the night. Campaign finance reform disarms all this.<p>6. Limit the terms of Supreme Court Justices to 18 years and enact jurisdiction stripping.<p>The stakes of Supreme Court nominations are so high that it drives us all crazy. We should limit their terms so that 2-term presidents get to nominate 2 Justices, and we should limit the power of the Supreme Court on the basis that it&#x27;s a deeply undemocratic and unaccountable institution. Pro-lifers feel this every day, as do progressives. We all agree it&#x27;s bad; let&#x27;s change it.<p>7. Enact affirmative action for mortgage companies, fund housing assistance, and reform public schools.<p>The US has a huge de facto segregation issue due to generations of discriminatory practices by mortgage companies, and the sky high cost of housing in neighborhoods with good schools. This creates fertile ground for bubbles and othering, not just in adults but also in children.<p>8. Re-establish affirmative action for colleges, and make it free.<p>The partisanship gap in the US now largely traces the education and income gap.<p>9. Establish clear boundaries on religious freedom.<p>Religious freedom is a fundamental part of the fabric of the United States, but so are personal liberty and individual rights. We need to give people the ability to live out their beliefs, but also establish a pluralistic society free of discrimination towards _and from_ the religious. Fighting a culture via religious freedom debases us all.')
