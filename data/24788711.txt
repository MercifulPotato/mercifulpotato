So you can certainly still read it, but you just can&#x27;t access to the specification itself? You don&#x27;t need the spec to reverse engineer it, its all in plain text.<p>There are other applications that implement S3 compliant storage. The interface is the same from the outside. Is that because Amazon can&#x27;t do anything about it, or because they don&#x27;t mind it? I would think implementing IMDF would be a similar situation.
