MBAs are the classic punching bags for HN. It seems we’re willing to bend the “civility” rules a bit here in order to have a nice hearty MBA-bash. I’ve seen all sorts of awful generalizations posted here about MBAs that would get you flagkilled if made about other professions or degrees. Some of us actually have tech&#x2F;coding backgrounds and aren’t the stereotypical pointy-headed-bosses, and it sucks to get lumped in with them but it’s ok—we don’t take it personally. Try to keep in mind though that we aren’t all bad!')
