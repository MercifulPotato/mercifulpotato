You could set up a table to import data into. Then export it out in whatever format you want, or query it however.<p>If the schema changes from one month to another it would be far easier to just update the DB table schema for the next import than change parsing code.<p>Everything can be solved with code, but not everything should be.<p>Interesting as a coding exercise and perhaps that&#x27;s the point of the article.<p>Not the way I&#x27;d do it if I wanted a stable process for consuming the data regularly.')
