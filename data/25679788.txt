Steve Wozniak is a pretty good example.<p>Personally, I work as a chem&#x2F;materials engineer if I were to move into a management position I&#x27;d have to give up doing technical work and step into a more administrative role and that is something that does not really appeal to me.<p>I think similar thing for politics, there doesn&#x27;t tend to be many scientist or engineers running for government because that sort of thing isn&#x27;t very appealing to people like me.')
