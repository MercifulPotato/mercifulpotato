People would watch it and then get back into line to watch it again. I remember hearing of people who watched it 15, 20, 25 times.<p>Star Wars substantially advanced special effects. If you want to get an idea of what the state of special effects were in that era, watch Star Trek (the original series).<p>&quot;Star Wars&quot; felt _real_. Lightsabers, the use of a &quot;Force&quot; where you could physically moves things from a distance, the glissando effect when a starship goes into hyperspace-- these were all incredibly credible and mind-blowing to people back then.<p>Star Wars didn&#x27;t just live up to its hype-- it has exceeded it, becoming a fixture in American culture, and becoming a franchise that continues to generate interest and income today.')
