I find it interesting how many people are saying something to the tune of &quot;I&#x27;d rather spend my time adding value to the company&#x27;s product than learning office politics&quot;. Firstly, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re mutually exclusive. And secondly, at least in my experience, the first six months at a new company is mostly an information gathering exercise. You&#x27;re not going to be able to make valuable changes to the company&#x27;s product in your second week, and attempting to force through something before fully understanding why things are the way they are is probably just going to leave a bad impression on people. If that happens, good luck getting the team to buy into those good ideas you&#x27;re so eager to spend your time on.')
