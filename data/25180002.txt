It&#x27;s part of why I stopped doing that kind of work.<p>Everything through the grant applications, working with different industries and government groups, presenting our results. Everything ended up being political.<p>Our data ended up being locked behind a paid government database against the approved plan in our grant application. This came shortly, coincidentally after we ended up discovering an endangered species in an area they hadn&#x27;t been found before near an active mine site.<p>I also seen first hand as a wetland restoration project was carried out for absolutely no reason after water samples in a lake pointed to the town golf course being the problem.<p>Sampling was immediately stopped, there was no more talk of the golf course and a project was approved to mitigate lake pollution by building a wetland on the opposite side of the lake away from the golf course.<p>Tens of thousands of dollars were wasted on this project. The lake&#x27;s just as polluted as ever. But the town council just couldn&#x27;t not have the greenest, green on their golf course.<p>The whole actual issue was fertilizer run off from the course and it was totally ignored.')
