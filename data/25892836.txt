Item(by='AnIdiotOnTheNet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611502463, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25892200, text='&gt; In my experience, most people have just as much possibility of slacking off at the office than at home.<p>I can confirm this because I&#x27;ve reached a point in my job where I am performing at most about 3 hours worth of actual work in any given week. This isn&#x27;t because I&#x27;m so good at my job (I once was...) and things are running so smoothly (though they kinda are), it&#x27;s because my current mental state prevents me from being motivated enough to do much of anything. Remarkably few people seem to have noticed and none have said anything about it.<p>When I was allowed to work from home because I had COVID (the entire IT department got it due to asinine butts-in-seats policy during a fucking pandemic), all that changed is that my stress level went down from not having to pretend to work most of the work day.')
