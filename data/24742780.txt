You can get damn near any color you want, get stripes or other designs if you please, all while protecting the real paint underneath for future resale value, like a miracle from God.<p>It makes sense then to buy some neutral color like black or white, and wrap up a vehicle later in a color you really want. You could even change colors later.<p>The only reason itâ€™s not more common yet is the price, costing about $2k-$3k to wrap a whole vehicle, but the effects of competition and capitalism will eventually bring that down for the masses, until wrapping a vehicle costs little more than applying window tints.<p>Soon enough, exotic, bombastic, offensive colors will be common in our streets. There has never been a more exciting time for the automobile.')
