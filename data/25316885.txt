In most companies project work is the exception compared to &quot;everyday functioning&quot; of the company, and the line managers are managing <i>that</i> instead; and a typical situation is where particular resources are needed for the success of the project, but they&#x27;re <i>also</i> needed for the non-project things that the particular manager controlling that resource cares about and is evaluated upon, so it&#x27;s in their best interest to prioritize other things at the expense of that project.<p>Or that manager might need a particular narrow subsection of that project done their way and the rest of the project is worthless to their goals (i.e. the very common &#x27;silo thinking&#x27; in many organizations), so they might assign resources for that part of the project and &#x27;starve&#x27; it afterwards. Management and internal politics has a big effect on which things get done and which don&#x27;t.')
