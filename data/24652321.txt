A lack of reliable strategies for data-driven patient stratification massively hinders the development and deployment of potentially life-altering interventions for devastating neurological ailments.<p>We&#x27;re going to fix this, and we&#x27;d like you to help.<p>We&#x27;re a small startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, ML researchers, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into hospitals and beyond. We&#x27;re well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.<p>Our team is composed of neuro-experts, open-source enthusiasts, audio&#x2F;DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going (but dedicated!) folks.<p>We believe that:<p>- Successful product development requires rapid, early feedback from real patients and clinicians.<p>- Feats of technical wizardry are only useful in combination with honest, frequent, and open communication.<p>- A diverse team builds more robust systems and practices more meaningful science.<p>We have a few different roles available (Data Engineering, DevOps, etc.), and are always happy to chat with interested folks!
