My startup is built entirely in python.<p>A boilerplate - by definition is a get started quickly tool for people that are (by choice or otherwise) not interested in going to the depths of a framework.\nIn that very particular context, a Nextjs based boilerplate will beat this one.<p>As an example, let me share a nextjs template that you can buy for 20$ \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;themeforest.net&#x2F;item&#x2F;react-material-bootstrap-4-admin-template&#x2F;20978545" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;themeforest.net&#x2F;item&#x2F;react-material-bootstrap-4-admi...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;themeforest.net&#x2F;item&#x2F;react-next-modern-landing-page-template&#x2F;23169879" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;themeforest.net&#x2F;item&#x2F;react-next-modern-landing-page-...</a><p>again, im not trying to crap over the OP&#x27;s attempt.

And I do think TS is a fantastic language. But again, my point was not a purist Python vs TS&#x2F;JS slugfest')
