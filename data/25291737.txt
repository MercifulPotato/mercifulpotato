Women (and nonbinary people) can be confronted with issues that men simply aren&#x27;t.<p>---<p>At Amazon, there are groups for Black employees, Latinx employees, LGBTQA+ employees, transgender employees, women, disabled employees, etc.<p>Sometimes these groups talk about work; but sometimes they talk about just life things. For example, often cisgendered employees will have children that come out as trans. So they&#x27;ll reach out to the transgender community for help and support as to how to be the best advocate for their child.<p>Or, as a personal example, I moved to a new city to take the job at Amazon. I was looking for a therapist, and it was important that the therapist be supportive of LGBTQA+ issues and ethical non-monogamy. So I reached out to the LGBTQA+ group for therapist recommendations.')
