For example if people are talking about a somewhat sketchy or tense return from a trip, you might ask them &quot;Who was driving?&quot;<p>I never hear anyone say &quot;Who was captain?&quot; or &quot;Who was steering?&quot; &quot;Captain&quot; seems to imply a title, and &quot;steering&quot; sounds like you just took the wheel for a moment.<p>That may be different for people who spend a lot of time on commercial boats. When I&#x27;ve been in formal settings, say on a police boat while doing search and rescue work, we will talk about the person who is filling the role of captain. But we still say that person is &quot;driving&quot; the boat.')
