This should have recycling easier (let it set for a few years after powering down then recycle it necessary). If each unit fit into a slightly oversized shipping container, safely transporting it doesn&#x27;t seem more difficult than transporting in nuclear material in the first place. Plus, since waste is going right back into a new containment, it probably doesn&#x27;t have to be as clean provided you can keep workers safe.')
