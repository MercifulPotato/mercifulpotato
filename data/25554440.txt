A large chunk of contemporary batteries is just packaging (i.e. does not contribute to energy storage), and this would replicated across every house. While more easily recycled (in theory) than PV, we&#x27;re still talking about a gigantic increase in highly distributed tricky-to-recycle material. That doesn&#x27;t even get to the resources required to store sufficient energy for contemporary western&#x2F;US lifestyles when solar or wind is unavailable.<p>p.s. I live in a net-zero-PV-powered house, grid tied.')
