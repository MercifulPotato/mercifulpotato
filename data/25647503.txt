Can you optimize your service or your service&#x27;s downstream dependencies or the application calling your service.<p>2. Can you build in graceful degradation into your service – functionality reduction to get more useful throughput out of your service – with same resources.<p>3. Build circuit breakers and throttlers before your downstream dependencies so that you don&#x27;t overload them and cause them to fail or you don&#x27;t fail totally when they do indeed fail.<p>4. If you do get overloaded for some reason (say your server pool suddenly became half its size), are you able to recover quickly.<p>5. Do you have monitoring and alerts for these load scenarios?<p>If you do this for each of the services in the service call graph, then your distributed service application would be robust.')
