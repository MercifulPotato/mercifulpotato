Item(by='paganel', descendants=None, kids=[24730005, 24730178], score=None, time=1602250631, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24729591, text='Not sure about the United States but in my parts of the world (Eastern Europe) it has also transformed into a social- and political-differentiating issue, i.e. people of a certain social status and of certain political views tend to over-emphasise the seriousness of the virus and to paint the other side in all sorts of unflattering colours because, supposedly, this latter side doesn&#x27;t take the virus as serious as they do.<p>I happen to share the social- and political-views of the first part of people I talked about, but I&#x27;ve started to very largely diverge when it came to how the virus should be handled. In late January - early February this year I certainly thought that the fatality rate would be around 3-4% (especially after the first images coming out of Wuhan), but as the disaster in Northern Italy and then Spain was unfolding and we were starting to learn more about it I started to think that that number would be more close to 1-2%.<p>Most of the summer I thought that the fatality rate would be 1%, and then in early August I saw a recent study carried out in Sweden bringing that number down to 0.4%-0.6%. In the last couple of weeks I&#x27;ve started seeing even lower numbers (between 0.3% - 0.4%), which, if I&#x27;m not mistaken, would make this virus 3 or 4 times more deadly compared to the normal flu (which afaik has a 0.1% death rate) which is not great, but which is also not catastrophic.<p>Now, I&#x27;ve tried having this exact conversation with a couple of my friends just yesterday and it did not go well at all, they were accusing me of being anti-mask and of not taking the virus seriously enough. Apparently the bare numbers don&#x27;t work even on educated people.')
