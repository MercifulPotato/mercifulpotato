There wasn&#x27;t really much &quot;fame&quot; or career boost to be an open source maintainer. The users themselves and the positive feedback they provided were basically the sole intrinsic motivation.<p>But now companies look at open source contributions when it comes to hiring. You can get paid speaking gigs or use keynote talks to further your career. Having a lot of users means a maintainer can extract value from <i>other sources</i>. And users <i>know</i> that now. They now that their tiny popularity vote is transferring something valuable to the maintainer who may then use it elsewhere. That leads to entitlement.<p>In GitHub these days, I often see PRs and issues where the contributor or person filing the bug clearly thinks the maintainer &quot;owes&quot; them something in return for their support. It&#x27;s like, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m making you be popular, so do what I say.&quot; That kills the intrinsic reward maintainers used to feel because now it feels transactional and obligatory.<p>My experience is that almost everyone filing issues and PRs is well-meaning and helpful. But it only takes a few cranky ones to suck a lot of the fun out. And even the good ones can be draining at a certain scale, though no fault of their own. Managing those social demands takes emotional skills that many maintainers don&#x27;t have. After all, part of the reason many of us got into software is because we found human interaction difficult or anxiety-inducing.')
