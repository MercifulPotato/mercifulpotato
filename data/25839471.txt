NY for example is a <i>Blue</i> state, but is  <i>Red</i> by area. Those same boundaries can also introduce arbitrary borders that divide people with a common culture and life experience. The problem with the Electoral College is that it&#x27;s just become a set of meaningless rules and lines that the political parties game to their advantage. I&#x27;d be <i>less</i> opposed if it weren&#x27;t winner take all by state, and even less opposed if the electoral college districts ignored state lines and actually represented real cultural and environmental boundaries (instead of gerrymandered puzzle pieces) while trying to strike a reasonable balance between population and area. Given the virtual impossibility of that, I think that a popular vote is more reasonable then the Electoral College.')
