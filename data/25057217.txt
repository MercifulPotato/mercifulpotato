It&#x27;s pretty clear Trump carried Florida on the strength of the Latino vote in that state. There&#x27;s also similar evidence that Trump made big gains this year among Asians.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RyanGirdusky&#x2F;status&#x2F;1326190869163225090" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RyanGirdusky&#x2F;status&#x2F;1326190869163225090</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sweep.thedispatch.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-sweep-dont-trust-the-exits-do" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sweep.thedispatch.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-sweep-dont-trust-the-exi...</a><p>So to summarise: Trump definitely made gains among Hispanics and probably made gains among Asians according to voting data; he made gains with every demographic except white men according to exit polls; the former data is more reliable than the latter.')
