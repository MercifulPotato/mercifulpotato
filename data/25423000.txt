Our brains are not made for videogames - they are just too addicting for many people. I think our societies (as far as i see) haven&#x27;t really coped enough with this addictive aspect of videogames - be it parents, teachers, politics or specific clinics (well, in some countries there are already clinics specialized for people who are addicted to video games). China is an interesting case study in that they heavily regulate what kind of games people are allowed to play and also how much and at which times. My personal pet peeve with casino [f2p] (including fifa cards) games is another aspect of gaming that has not been regulated nearly enough (if at all), so gaming - although doing more revenue than hollywood (might have something to do with addiction feeding...) - hasn&#x27;t quite grown up.')
