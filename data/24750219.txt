I would be curious to know if there are any drawbacks or dangers from doing that, apart from the obvious “if your box powers off, the ramdisk is gone” and “each time the box restarts, you have to copy the db to the ramdisk.”<p>The main problem I was uneasy about was, I would simply use the equivalent of rsync -Pa &#x2F;ramdisk &#x2F;disk in a loop, which seemed to ensure safety in the event of a poweroff. It never broke, but I wouldn’t say it was a good idea, necessarily.<p>Sure speeds up most things though. The benefits are pretty crazy for I&#x2F;O bound programs.')
