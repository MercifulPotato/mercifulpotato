Our git repo is 2GB plus 5GB of submodules. Git is painfully slow and I would imagine with more engineers it would become unusable. For example, git-fetch takes at least a minute.<p>To some degree we are doing it wrong like using Windows, creating too many tags, and committing binary blobs (despite LFS). Still, scaling it up by factor of two or three would not change it significantly.')
