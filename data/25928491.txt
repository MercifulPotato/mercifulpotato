Think of it like dynamic page generation on the server side, but for an image instead. Every time you hit the same URL you get a different image.<p>On the client you can decode that ID and use it throughout your code, in network requests, etc., to track user activity.<p>If the image is already cached you just decode the ID and use it as described above. All the browser cares about is associating a URL with a resource: it doesn&#x27;t know or care that the resource in question changes every time it&#x27;s asked for.<p>Also, the client code literally doesn&#x27;t need to care whether the ID is from an image in cache or an image returned from the server.<p>The server can simply tie all activity for a given ID together on the back end.<p>This is one way of doing it: there are probably others. I&#x27;m certainly no expert.')
