Elastic insists on copyright transfers for any code contributions as well, so that makes contributing under a different license not possible (their choice).<p>Crate is upset because they&#x27;ve created a significant derivative work which complicates their business under the new license. Apache 2.0 is intentionally designed to support this kind of thing; which is why it is a popular license for companies working together on OSS projects.<p>Copyright transfers like Elastic is practicing are of course a big risk for such companies. IMHO, any such projects has long term challenges. Most long lived OSS projects have a multitude of copyright holders. E.g. re-licensing Linux would be very impractical as it as many thousands of contributors some of whom have passed away (i.e. their families inherited the copyright). That&#x27;s a strength of that project; it&#x27;s forever stuck on GPL2, which provides enough wiggle room that the likes of Google, Samsung, and many others can use it to create software for their products.<p>Amazon&#x27;s work is of course less significant but this license is designed to prevent derivative works from being likely to succeed commercially. Even Amazon&#x27;s use which technically did not involve actually modifying the source code (not a single line, they used a binary OSS release provided by Elastic and added plugins) would be illegal under this license. That&#x27;s not open; sorry.')
