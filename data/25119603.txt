During protests this past summer many officers had no badge, nameplate, or body cam present. This results in absolutely no accountability of this individual and their actions. The police have much to benefit with civil unrest and crime in the city. Chicago police receive 40% of the city&#x27;s budget. We invest so heavily in policing yet we are known for our murder rate. Police do not prevent the violence in Chicago they only respond to it. This is because the police profit off of the crime in Chicago. The city continues to refuse to divest  from policing and invest in the communities which are struggling the most.')
