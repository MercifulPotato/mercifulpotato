As a comparison, I run the domain my family uses for e-mail (not just my spouse&#x2F;kids, but my brothers and parents and a few extended family members as well), and it&#x27;s currently hosted on GSuite, grandfathered in from way back when you could get it free.  I wanted to switch us away from Google to FastMail, but everyone balked at $5&#x2F;month for e-mail.  Even the ones making well into six figures didn&#x27;t want to cough up $60&#x2F;year for something they&#x27;ve been getting for free.  So I could pay it out of pocket, or we stay on GSuite, or I kick everyone off that won&#x27;t pay and deal with hurt feelings.')
