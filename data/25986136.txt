I also described two non-WhatsApp examples exhibiting user domestication (one of which wasn&#x27;t even an instant messenger). It wasn&#x27;t my intention to imply that WhatsApp was the first instant messenger to exhibit these behaviors; I even linked to a Wikipedia article comparing instant messenger protocols to illustrate how WhatsApp wasn&#x27;t a newcomer.<p>That being said, several others have mentioned how WhatsApp wasn&#x27;t the first IM platform of its kind. When a misinterpretation is this prevalent, it&#x27;s the author&#x27;s (i.e. my) fault: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1984&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1984&#x2F;</a><p>I&#x27;ve since updated the article to clarify that point.

Which really is a FOSS, GPL, Richard Stallman angle on Software. I argue it would be the same with many of today&#x27;s software.<p>So did I; I listed two more examples. User domestication is a widespread problem worth addressing. WhatsApp is a good example.')
