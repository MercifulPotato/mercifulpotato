I wanted to make a collection of &quot;Explain it like I am 5&quot; explanations and some examples for the need for data privacy for anyone online. My favorite example is about insurance companies reading your data and declining services based on their &quot;analysis&quot; of it. I wanted more such examples. So maybe we could make this thread a repository of explanations and examples we all could use to tell people in a way they&#x27;d understand!')
