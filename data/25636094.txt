So for example, if a user wants to have some kind of Spotify import feature built into his online music-management service, he is not permitted by this license to build n8n into his paid service. (Correct me if I am wrong on this interpretation.)<p>But I think you will get a lot of demand for including this product in various workflows in an integrated way. Are you planning on releasing an API license, or some such?')
