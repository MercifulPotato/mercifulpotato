Looking for a technical co-founder with experience building space hardware.<p>About me:<p>I&#x27;m Steven and I&#x27;ve been in the tech industry since 2007. I&#x27;ve been a software engineer since 2010. For the last 6 years, I did the whole digital nomad thing and worked remotely for most of that time. It&#x27;s been one hell of a ride.<p>I&#x27;m ready for the next chapter of my life. I want to head back to California (where I&#x27;m originally from) to start a very ambitious aerospace hardware startup. Yes, no software for me ideally.<p>Contact in profile.')
