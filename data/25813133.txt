My DSLR has a CF slot and an SD slot; I used the SD slot for a wifi chip, and saved all photos to CF. My CF reader hasn&#x27;t gotten lost or broken, and I didn&#x27;t have &quot;an entourage of assistants doing the heavy lifting&quot; (whatever that means when talking about a card reader).<p>In real life, you can just use an external card reader. It&#x27;s not a big limitation, just like it&#x27;s not a big limitation that laptops these days don&#x27;t have optical drives.')
