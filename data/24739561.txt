I&#x27;d <i>love</i> to live inside my own bubble filter.<p>Does anyone do personalization well?<p>I worked on team that was trying to transition from recommendations to personalization (fashion retailer with ecommerce, think Macys Nordstrom etc).<p>Our imagined gold standard was the expert sales person, the personalized shopper. So somehow figure out how to make a digital sales person. Like StitchFix or Trunk Club. Curation at scale.<p>But I couldn&#x27;t even figure out how to solve my own ultimate shopping challenge: recommend a quality white t-shirt that fits.<p>Though I doubt it, maybe StitchFix has cracked this nut. If they (or someone) has, we need to distill their magic and apply it more generally.<p>(I haven&#x27;t tried Spotify or Apple Music. I&#x27;ve heard their personalization efforts are pretty good, so I&#x27;m semi-curious.)<p>--<p>Oh, and a post script, while I&#x27;m chewing on this topic.<p>I have a theory why quality personalization isn&#x27;t likely to become the norm. I can&#x27;t yet imagine how it&#x27;d displace today&#x27;s biz models. Targeted advertising has sucked up all the oxygen.<p>It&#x27;s hard to articulate the difference between personalization and targeted advertising (recommenders). One of those torturous endless discussions our teams couldn&#x27;t escape.<p>&quot;Personalization&quot; is needs fulfillment whereas targeting is attention stealing. Personalization is much harder to monetize, because it relies on conversions. Whereas with targeting, the money changes hands before hand and is easier to pretend it&#x27;s working.')
