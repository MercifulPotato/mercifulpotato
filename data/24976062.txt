I&#x27;m a mountain-states native who went to the Bay for work and is (at least for now) back in the mountains.  I got along fine with folks in California, but it still never quite felt like home (tough to do in a 1BR).  Still, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve brought a little of the Bay back with me!  At the very least a new Subaru with California plates.  :)')
