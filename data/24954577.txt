By this standard, I&#x27;ve faced sexual assault because a drunken guy started petting me once (I&#x27;m a straight guy). By any reasonable standard it was a funny incident, but in a strict interpretation of a &quot;have you ever&quot; survey, I&#x27;d be a sexual assault survivor.<p>Could be the same here. Say that in 1&#x2F;100 of interactions between a upper and lower caste there is some form of discrimination, regardless the intensity. I&#x27;m too tired to do the math, but it seems reasonable that would lead to a high percentage of people ending up answering yes to a &quot;have you ever been discriminated&quot; question.')
