He claimed he won. So did Trump. Neither are backed by anything tangible, yet. It looks like the PA AG has called for a statewide audit of votes, several court orders have been issued in several states, including Michigan and Wisconsin, there are lawsuits in several jurisdictions, and recounts in Georgia and Nevada are going to start soon. Notice how I&#x27;m not saying the lawsuits and accusations are founded, because I&#x27;d like to talk about the system.<p>This is far from over. You could have votes invalidated. This is only over when the electors travel to DC and 270+ vote for one person. That could be halted. You could see the house delegations vote, you could see state or federal courts rule, you could even see some state legislative bodies make decisions on it.<p>It takes a lot more than a claim of victory and a news organization calling it for an election to be over, and I&#x27;d expect a bunch of very smart people to know that.')
