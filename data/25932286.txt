Item(by='ashtonkem', descendants=None, kids=[25932615], score=None, time=1611773901, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25929883, text='You seem to be making the argument that if it’s legal, it’s not immoral. I reject this argument completely. By necessity the law does not (and cannot) cover every single aspect of human behavior. Just because what IKEA is doing is legal does not make it right. Nor is it inappropriate for a private citizen to condemn behavior they disapprove of, whether or not it’s legal.<p>As far as where the ethical line is, that is a very complicated subject not conducive to generic discussion. But I am extremely certain that “we configured our multi-billion dollar international furniture business as a non-profit” is certainly well on the wrong side of the line. We can discuss other scenarios in their appropriate context, but the existence of other grey areas does not excuse the unethical behavior of IKEA here.<p>I do wish legislators would get their &lt;explicative deleted&gt; together and fix the tax code so that IKEA will pay their fair share, but <i>condemning them for their behavior is a necessary prerequisite to that change actually happening</i>. One can’t chastise other citizens for complaining about unethical behavior and suggest that instead someone else should change the law, that makes literally no sense. I have no direct capability to change the law, and it’s incoherent of you to tell me to stop complaining about it until the law is changed.')
