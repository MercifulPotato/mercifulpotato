I&#x27;d venture this was written by someone who has a more traditional machine learning background that wants new people to the industry to have that same foundation; however, I&#x27;d venture that that is a rather inefficient way to get to deep learning proficiency.<p>If I were to give a recommendation, it would be this -- pick a topic&#x2F;project that interests you, follow the classic knowledge-bootstrapping process where you read through papers and (hopefully) have an expert or trained person walk you through the specifics, then get hands-on instantly. Especially with something like fast.ai that values empirical results over hard theory, something understandably popular in the field.<p>From there I&#x27;d recommend branching out, but I&#x27;d use a JIT approach. The field isn&#x27;t necessarily super well-founded at the moment, and while machine learning fundamentals are useful, ultimately it&#x27;s a waste of time compared to the long-tail benefit of getting immediate empirical results and feedback hands-on.<p>Just my 2c, YMMV, and anyone is totally welcome to disagree as they wish! :)<p>Best of luck,<p>T')
