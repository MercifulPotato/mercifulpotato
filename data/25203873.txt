This machine would have been replaced in 2017 but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with that years model. I had planned to upgrade in 2020 but the announcement of the M1 basically quashed that. I&#x27;ve been on this planet long enough to know when Apple changes course like this the old architect is already obsolete. 68k -&gt; PPC -&gt; x86_64 -&gt; ASi. The PPC G5 got exactly 1 OS upgrade (10.5) before it was EOL&#x27;d.<p>If the reports are to be believed on performance and Rosetta than this upgrade may be one of the smoothest in Apple history. The Intel CPU has had an incredibly long run, 15 years, at Apple. If they are confident they can make the leap and not leave their users in the lurch more power to them.<p>I&#x27;m still on the fence on buying an M1 laptop. Apple users know you pay an Apple tax and a v1 tax. My MBP is getting so long in the tooth I may have to ignore my own advice of not getting first generation Apple hardware.')
