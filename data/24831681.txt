I have a way of fixing this (the person is interested cos you are going to make them look good)\nb) I can see your people are getting burnt out, we can fix that issue for you<p>This gives an instant&#x2F;emotional connection and gets the person&#x27;s interest which then leads you to say - X% of the issues your team is dealing with is A and building this feature &#x27;Y&#x27; means we automate that stuff and you no longer have to deal with it.')
