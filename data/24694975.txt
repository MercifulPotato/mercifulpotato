But this was done on H.264, which is now nearly 20 years old.  Modern Codec like HEVC and VP9, or State of the Art like AV1 and VVC would have done much much better.<p>Next problem, would this only work on Nvidia GPU? Apple are already doing something similar to FaceTime, but only with respect to eye contact. Are we entering an era where even AI video codec are bound by devices?<p>I used to hope and wish Apple introduce these kind of features to iPhone. But their act and response on App Store is making me wary.')
