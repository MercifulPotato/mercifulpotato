AFAIK americans don&#x27;t really use week numbering so it&#x27;s not really a thing. OTOH ISO defines a very strict week-based calendaring system.<p>Anyway SUNDAY_START defines that weeks start on sunday <i>and the first week-of-year needs only contain a single day</i>, so I expect you can never get the &quot;overlapping&quot; information from the JDK, it just considers that W01 is whichever week contains 01-01 and forgets about the overlapping last week of the previous year, if any.')
