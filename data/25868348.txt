With Python you have venvs which do a lot of the heavy lifting required.<p>The issue becomes when you are on a non Linux environment for development and deploy to Linux in containers. If you build your code locally then you are debugging $DESKTOP issues which might not be the same as Linux.<p>Also languange environments with poor dependency management (e.g. C, C++) benefit from having an installable system.<p>&gt; Even assuming they have the same version of macOS, homebrew constantly evolves so getting everyone developing with the same version of dependencies as you use in prod is super painful.<p>If someone is using homebrew for their development dependencies, unless they are targeting a release to homebrew, kindly ask them to stop doing this.')
