What you describe is what I used to do with Pandora. I migrated to Spotify several years ago.<p>Spotify generates some decent genre based playlists based on  my listening history. Not as good as Pandora was.<p>Lately with the pandemic, I&#x27;ve created a super-chill, ambient play list (I started with Moby&#x27;s Long Ambients and expanded from there) to relax before bedtime. This has been really helpful for unwinding in these stressful times.<p>However, an unintended consequence is that Spotify now thinks I listen to soothing ambient more than 50% of the time. My year in music is all ambient and my suggested play lists are all wishy-washy now. Apparently there is no &quot;ignore this playlist when tracking usage.&quot; You can only manually disable tracking under &quot;Settings &gt; Social&quot; and it times out after every session.')
