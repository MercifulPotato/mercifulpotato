There was a backend that connected to the iTunes API and then I parsed the data elements I needed and entered them into the DB.<p>The most infuriating thing was realizing that I needed to update the model with a new data element, or that some API responses didn&#x27;t include the needed data. There was all this controller and model code and then the migrations every time I needed to make a change.<p>Is this normal when coding any web application at all? I think if I had to do it again I&#x27;d just store the entire API response in a single &quot;document&quot; column and query it dynamically as needed. Did I stumble upon why many developers have moved to &quot;noSQL&quot; models of document storage?')
