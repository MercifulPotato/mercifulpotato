Item(by='easterncalculus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611106091, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25841065, text='&gt; If China&#x27;s system is really &quot;open source&quot; then this is really dumb.<p>I get the sense from reading this that we&#x27;re both aware that with China that won&#x27;t be the case.<p>&gt; Basically, they give out any innovations they create, while shielding themselves from any external innovation.<p>In a sense I feel like this relies on an exaggeration of the benefits and requirements of open source that most people in the west would have. Thinking about it right now I can see two questions.<p>1) Do we really need a free and open (as in free speech) internet to bring many people&#x27;s code contributions and skills together?<p>2) Is having a walled off system actually better, on the reasoning that developers in China make the best &quot;chinese software&quot; (meaning software that will do well in or be useful to China)?<p>I think the answer to the first is that the need for free speech for open source at first seems necessary, and is certainly still helpful, but not ultimately needed for this to work. China can block topics like on any other site and chances are the people that still want to contribute ultimately will, just like people still use Wechat, Baidu, etc. I would think that as it stands you can still have a large group of hard-working contributors without some &#x27;sensitive&#x27; topics coming up. I really think that the benefits of the open source model aren&#x27;t as tied to the principles of western countries as a lot of people would initially assume, myself included.<p>The second question might be worth looking into some more, in terms of market research and what is successful in China. Plus Chinese developers are probably more used to having to work with the government in regards to censorship and surveillance, which GitHub could shut the doors on pretty fast.<p>Either way I don&#x27;t think that having restricted topics is going to cripple the benefits of having a much larger contributor&#x2F;talent pool and open source code. Not having freedoms isn&#x27;t as good of course but I don&#x27;t think open source software <i>depends</i> on them as much as some might say.')
