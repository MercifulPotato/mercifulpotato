There&#x27;s so many now, from science doc specific (Nebula and Curiosity stream - I was eager to start with these but inevitably was let down with these &#x27;speciality options&#x27;) to anime too.<p>Personally, streaming has now also ruined watching the TV&#x2F;movies for me.<p>Since my TV burned itself I&#x27;ve had a non-smart TV and it&#x27;s actually really refreshing to have such minimal choice and be walled in as such. I end up watching films and actually enjoying them, not dealing with FOMO and wondering if there&#x27;s something better).')
