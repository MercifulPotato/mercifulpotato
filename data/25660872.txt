My advice would be to only use a language you know best, as long as it&#x27;s appropriate for the role -- and most mainstream languages would be appropriate for generic FAANG SDE roles.<p>Using the language you know best will bring all sort of benefits -- you&#x27;ll code faster, you&#x27;ll be more confident, you might even find a place to show off a little. There is no good reason to give this advantage up.')
