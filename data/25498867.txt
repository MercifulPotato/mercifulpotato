That&#x27;s why families have SUVs instead of sedans now. If you legislate away every vehicle capable of carrying more than five people you&#x27;re essentially banning families larger than that, especially in places in the US which don&#x27;t have public transit, which is most of the country.<p>THIS is the kind of clueless urban elite childless Coastal DINK perspective that drives regular people raising families in flyover country absolutely bananas with its complete lack of perspective for other lifestyles than the ones in San Francisco and New York! Not all of us want to live in tiny apartments and on crowded trains for our whole lives and the people who do want that life do not have the right to dictate that to the rest of us through limits on what kind of vehicles we&#x27;re allowed to drive')
