For reference back then we were more concerned about how the switch handled IPX (Novell Netware) than IP. Everything else since then was designed in the era where IPv6 is coming soon enough that you ensure you can support it with a software update if you don&#x27;t support it.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say IPv6 couldn&#x27;t have been done in a backward compatible way.  I can think of ways to do that, and dozens of pros and cons - even though I haven&#x27;t been in networking for 20 years and so I&#x27;ve forgotten a lot.')
