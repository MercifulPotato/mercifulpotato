No one would complain if spies from your own country stole from a rival nation during a war (hot or cold). The US used to steal technology from Britain and the rest of Europe.[0]<p>The more you magnify on any country&#x27;s history, the more prevalent shady dealings comes up. This goes doubly so for superpowers. It seems that at some point in time, everyone has done unscrupulous things to get ahead and we often forget to be introspective.<p>On a personal anecdote, I dabble in fashion design and it continually baffles me as to what is considered &quot;homage&quot; when large, established companies blatantly rip off designs. Large companies like H&amp;M or Zara can literally steal pieces from famous designers, make it worse and cheaper and sell it in malls worldwide. Obviously, when an Asian brand does the same thing, it&#x27;s a knockoff. Peeves me to no end.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;industrial-revolution-spies-europe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;industrial-revolution-spies-eur...</a>')
