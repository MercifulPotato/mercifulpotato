If we were to quantize modulation &quot;styles&quot; to match, say, a set of DAW operations in a dropdown list, we&#x27;ve made the work of writing a piece easier.<p>We extend that ease for each aspect of music-writing that gets a similar dropdown menu in the UI. That ease accelerates the production of music.<p>I find it fitting on HN to insist the common practice period was comparatively unproductive and inefficient. :)')
