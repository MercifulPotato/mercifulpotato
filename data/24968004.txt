People are harder to deal with. It&#x27;s just easier to fork! ;)<p>&gt; Why temporary? The developers and users of TDE may prefer the way KDE3 does things or Qt3 or whatever that wouldn&#x27;t work with anything that came after.<p>I agree. While I wouldn&#x27;t be a fan of it, I can understand changes are harder to accept for people (including me sometimes.)<p>&gt; MATE is an interesting case - IMO MATE should have forked Gtk+ 2 instead of switching to Gtk+ 3 because Gtk+ 3 has a different &quot;feel&quot; to it that -again, IMO- is much worse (and feels a bit sluggier) than Gtk+ 2. This would also help the ton of other projects that at the time were still stuck in Gtk+ 2 and would waste a lot of time down the road to converting their code to Gtk+ 3 while also preserving Gtk+ 2 as a stable API for GUI applications that was still in widespread availability.\n&gt; Of course it is too late now.<p>Never thought about it this way. I totally agree with you. It was GTK2 which should&#x27;ve been forked and maintained.')
