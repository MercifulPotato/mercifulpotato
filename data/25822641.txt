About half of them seem to die because of the power supply and the other half because of problems with the LEDs themselves. This surprised me a lot because it seems to mean that the lifetime of both the transformer and the LEDs is pretty similar.<p>The failure of the LED element itself (in the model that I put under a microscope) was an internal wire burning  through. The LED elements actually contained two LEDs in series connected by a tiny wire.<p>I assembled a working LED bulb from two broken ones that had failed in different ways. Not that I would ever dare to use such a thing in normal operations.')
