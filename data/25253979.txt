In python&#x2F;numpy, the sub-par linear solver will probably fail or be extremely slow on large linear systems (because the scipy developers are a bunch of anti-GPL fanatics that refuse to use the state of the art linear solvers because of license issues).  But yes, you have nice strings and dictionaries at your fingertips; too bad they are completely useless for numerical computation.')
