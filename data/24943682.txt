There were three events (one actual, two simulated) in which the Waymo vehicle was struck by a pedestrian or cyclist. In each instance, the Waymo Driver decelerated and stopped, and a pedestrian or cyclist made contact with the right side of the stationary Waymo vehicle while the pedestrian or cyclist was traveling at low speeds.&quot;<p>&quot;in each of the 3 actual and simulated events in which a pedestrian or cyclist struck the Waymo vehicle at low speed, the Waymo vehicle had decelerated and stopped immediately prior to the contact or simulated contact in a way that may have differed from the cyclist’s or pedestrian’s expectations. This illustrates a key challenge faced by AVs operating in a predominantly human traffic system and underscores the importance of driving in a way that is interpretable and predictable by other road users.&quot;<p>(Disclosure: I work for Google, a sibling company of Waymo, speaking only for myself)')
