Sure. Saying that TODAY they are &quot;inferior in rights&quot; is just a LIE.<p>That is why B&#x27;tselem&#x27;s post is an OPNION and not a peer reviewed article.<p>The biggest proof of it all is how none of the European sanction Israel. If it so obvious that it such a one sided power dynamic, then France, Britain and Germany would act on it a long time ago. But they don&#x27;t. Since it is not.<p>You might think that &quot;I am resisting the truth&quot;, but I&#x27;m just a spoiler to everywhere outside the Internet sphere. No one really think Israel is an apartheid state (majority). And using hyperbolae will not convince anyone. I really don&#x27;t care what happen a long as peace is achieved but this is not the way.')
