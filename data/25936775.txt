It has been used many times to discriminate against blacks. What makes you think it can&#x27;t be used to discriminate against other groups, like for example r&#x2F;WallStreetBets?<p>Of course we can&#x27;t say for sure. But at the same time we can&#x27;t say for sure that specific policemen were actually racist when they attacked black people, or if they would do the same thing against white people in similar situation.
