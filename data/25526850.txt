I realise we have to go through a process, but there&#x27;s a bus load of dead people and grieving families and friends waiting and waiting. This delay to justice is awful and I couldn&#x27;t imagine being on the receiving end of it. There&#x27;s also a good chance it&#x27;ll just end with &quot;multiple failures, sozlol&quot; and a couple of fines and everyone jogs on. The whole thing is just disgusting.')
