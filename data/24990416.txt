The results and discussion are usually the least interesting parts and figures are usually meaningless without seeing how the data used to generate those figures were collected.<p>The methodology tells you exactly what the people who wrote the paper did. It&#x27;s where you can see whether they used a sample size of 10 vs 1000, what methods they used to sample their data, the accuracy levels they used in analyzing their data, it&#x27;s also how a study may be replicated.<p>Without reading the methods, you can&#x27;t be sure about any other thing in the paper.<p>That&#x27;s the problem i see with a lot of news reporting on science papers. They use the gp&#x27;s method of reading. Abstract, images and maybe results if they&#x27;re really trying.<p>That&#x27;s how you end up with a lot of sensationalist, contradictory science headlines.')
