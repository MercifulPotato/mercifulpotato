I never adopted it for myself or my company, but I did get a chance to have lunch with Larry Wall and talked to him about Perl. This was back when Perl was quite a young and promising language for a certain class of problems.<p>Perl had very good performance, despite being a &quot;scripting&quot; language, because so many of the tasks that a typical shell script might need to do were supported by built in features in the language (for example handling regular expressions, interacting with command line arguments, exec&#x27;ing other programs).<p>Today, once a shell script requires very much logic, I&#x27;m inclined to use Python. I know Python and find programming in it easier than Perl and bash and other shells. Furthermore, other programmers understand Python better than bash.')
