Dispatch <i>can happen</i> at compile time, and in fact <i>does</i> for type-stable code. But the dispatch is on run-time types, not static types.<p>(The fact that you can have static dispatch on dynamic types is a pretty subtle point that hurts my head, but the upshot is that you get semantically dynamic dispatch with static performance as an optimization.)')
