Item(by='dehrmann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608505321, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25489935, text='&gt; If we do not pay for news, news has to be financed through online advertising<p>Agreed.<p>&gt; which is basically selling personal data for profit<p>Not necessarily. Mostly untargeted display ads don&#x27;t. They could profit from personal data as much as TV or newspaper ads. They also yield a lot worse; my point is that it&#x27;s possible to run ads that don&#x27;t actually use personal data.<p>My bigger concern with ad-funded journalism is it encourages stories and headlines that get clicks, not stories that are important. Journalism isn&#x27;t supposed to be entertainment.')
