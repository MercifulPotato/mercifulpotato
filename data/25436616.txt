The AIR-FI attack introduced in this paper does not require Wi-Fi related hardware in the air-gapped computers. Instead, we show that an attacker can exploit the DDR SDRAM buses to generate electromagnetic emissions in the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi bands and encode binary data on top of it. We also show that nearby Wi-Fi receivers, such smartphones, laptops, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, can receive and decode the modulated data, and then send it to the attacker via the Internet.</i><p>No built-in Wi-Fi hardware required, only user-space access needed, and works with-in VMs.')
