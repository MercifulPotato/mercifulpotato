We don&#x27;t have RCTs that prove that jumping out of an airplane with a parachute is safer than jumping out of a plane without one. And yet everyone packs a chute when jumping out of a plane. Why is that so? Because we have priors based on our understanding of physics and biology that hitting the ground slowly is less likely to kill you than hitting the ground fast.<p>The same is true for vaccines; we have lots of them and we can make an educated guesses about how new ones work, even if new vaccines may not always behave the same as old ones. When you have to make decisions under uncertainty you can&#x27;t refuse to incorporate educated guesses just because you don&#x27;t have rigorous p&lt;0.05 peer-reviewed proof confirming those hypotheses.')
