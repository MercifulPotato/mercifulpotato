I&#x27;d also say a 2009 intel macbook is obsolete but the truth is, add an SSD into that and it&#x27;s probably still fine under linux so maybe 2009 isn&#x27;t obsolete for some users just yet (although i think apple no longer support that hardware). 2015 is modern, intel performance just hasn&#x27;t changed that much since 2015.')
