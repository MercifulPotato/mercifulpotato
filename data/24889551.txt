Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=[24890014], score=None, time=1603657206, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24889247, text='&gt; And that’s the sort of thing that most news organizations would gate reporting on.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. The Steele Dossier (&quot;Trump pays Russian Hookers in Moscow to pee on him&quot;) wasn&#x27;t treated special in any way, and it was much more questionable at the time than this story (where the unclear part is what they got for their bribes, not whether they payed his son for access to the VP). Of course, one argument might be &quot;we&#x27;ve learned from our mistakes&quot;, but I believe that&#x27;s a bit too obvious.<p>&gt; I dunno; there’s an interesting discussion here if you can tone down the fire in your belly about conspiracies.<p>I don&#x27;t think it needs a conspiracy theory, the coordination was very public. That there&#x27;s political corruption in the US is also not news, it&#x27;s the reason why children of politicians are making giant sums of money, politicians being paid tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to give a speech etc. That&#x27;s normal, there&#x27;s not much to be found, I believe.<p>Discussion of the suppression is not encouraged here: even a story about the suppression of the story was pretty much immediately suppressed on HN.')
