So the wine needs some oxgen to get to its best. The question only is: when is the optimal point reached? Depending on the wine and if you don&#x27;t explicitly air it, it should indeed take till the next day to get to its best.<p>Fun fact: while it is said that whisky doesn&#x27;t need to breathe, I always find freshly opened bottles somewhat disappointing and do think they get a little bit better over the first week open and then stay at the level for long times.')
