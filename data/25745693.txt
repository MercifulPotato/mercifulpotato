The remaining required percentage of the population would have to get immunity from getting sick.<p>This is what I was getting at in the grandparent post. 50% -&gt; 60% and 85% -&gt; 95% might both seem like they protect 10% more of the population, but the qualitative effect on the spread of the pandemic and be quite different.  60% might be enough to get herd immunity (with masks and social distancing), while 50% is not. Both 85% and 95% are definitely enough to get herd immunity, so to some extent that added protection matters less.')
