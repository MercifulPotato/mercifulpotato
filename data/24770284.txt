I am creating a more reliable and cost-effective way to order drone photography. Using Google Earth, we visually plan drone missions, generate pre-programmed flights, then have licensed pilots fly them. Using automated flights allows us to save money on pilot costs. In addition to offering lower prices than our competitors, we provide clients the Google Earth views before we fly in order to ensure they get exactly what they need. DroneHub offers up to 25 images and 2 videos for just $90.')
