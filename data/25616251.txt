Do you have any recommendations of tools or methods to reduce this variance?<p>comment b) we&#x27;re definitely trying to do this but we&#x27;re not there yet - most of our metrics don&#x27;t meet goals we set.  Instead the blocking goals must be &#x27;don&#x27;t make it any worse&#x27;, which is doable -&gt; but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily make anything better yet (thus all the questions about what is most annoying that we can fix first).<p>Hopefully point (b) is clear - I&#x27;m not saying &quot;our performance is great&#x2F;good&#x2F;acceptable&quot;, just the best I can do (as a PM) is try to figure out what to prioritize to fix.')
