All of our historic vaccines came from very bad circumstances and they were tested on people without any real guards, starting with Jenner&#x27;s famous Horsepox treatments.<p>I&#x27;m fine with this vaccine being available for people who want it, but as someone who is low risk, I really hope this doesn&#x27;t become mandatory. A lot of people aren&#x27;t old enough to remember the Swine Flu vaccine and all the complications from that.<p>No one is talking about the safety here and that&#x27;s disturbing. I don&#x27;t see how a vaccine can be listed as safe with less than a year of testing. Traditionally it&#x27;s an 8~12 year process.')
