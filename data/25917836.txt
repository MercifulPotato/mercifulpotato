It seems like client web pages cannot directly view the DNS information for a given domain name. So I would think embedding identifying information in something like a CNAME or TXT record directly wouldn&#x27;t work.\n2. I suppose a tracker could try to create unique records for a given domain name and then use request&#x2F;responses to&#x2F;from that domain to get identifying information. But this seems highly dependent on being able to control the DNS propagation. Short of my ISP trying this trick on me, I&#x27;m not really sure who else could manage.<p>I&#x27;m sure I am missing things in this brief analysis. I&#x27;d love to hear what others think about this cache.')
