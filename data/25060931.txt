My grandparents went to the Church, got married, there was a banquet at the hall, people brought food. That&#x27;s it.<p>But how hard is it to understand that people want to honour their commitment in some way?<p>&quot;Why do we have big awards ceremonies for those people (artists, citizens, soldiers), it&#x27;s so expensive!&quot;<p>Some (most?) people would want to honour that commitment. Many people who don&#x27;t, just don&#x27;t find themselves in the right conditions, but would otherwise.<p>But beyond the ceremony, marriage is a social institution, not a &#x27;piece of paper&#x27;.<p>(Personally, I have a hard time grasping why people struggle with this)<p>A marriage is something &#x27;that is built&#x27;, the ceremony is just part of that, it takes time, effort, input to build a relationship, it&#x27;s not just &#x27;something that happens&#x27;.')
