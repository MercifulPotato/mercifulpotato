In AWS we can do that becase they&#x27;re encrypted with a KMS key and unless a user&#x2F;role has permission to decrypt with that key it can&#x27;t decrypt the secret. This does assume that AWS aren&#x27;t lying about encrypting things, and that their employees can&#x27;t access our KMS keys.<p>We currently use Gitlab for our CI&#x2F;CD pipelines, but using our own runners in our own AWS account. So if we want to deploy a staging environment from there, it&#x27;s actually deploying from an AWS role that we control, we&#x27;re not leaking any secrets to Gitlab or anywhere else.<p>I&#x27;m just wondering how people get around this in Layer&#x2F;any hosted CI&#x2F;CD setup where you can&#x27;t have your own runners inside your AWS account. Especially because they don&#x27;t replace the production deploy, so ultimately those secrets are staying in AWS - perhaps in addition to wherever they need to go with Layer.<p>FWIW I did find something about secrets in the docs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;layerci.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;layerfile-reference&#x2F;secret-env#secret-env" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;layerci.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;layerfile-reference&#x2F;secret-env#secr...</a> - but I&#x27;m not sure how you get secrets in from that.')
