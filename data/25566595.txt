I don&#x27;t know philosophy and English is not my language but I&#x27;ll try to generalize:<p>Living organisms take resources that they can, specially if there&#x27;s a net positive gain from it. This happens because those that gain the most net positive tend to reproduce more and hence these traits (i.e. tendency to take resources which are a net benefit) gets passed on. Does evolutionary theory disagree with this?<p>Humans are just a special (as opposed to general, I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s anything &quot;special&quot; special about humans) case of it.<p>Let&#x27;s say that there were just two human tribes. If the tribes are not equally powerful, the powerful one will kill most of them and take all the resources and the women.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine a case where they are almost equally powerful. Then, conflict would cause mutual destruction and it makes it worth it to have an understanding between them... in which they don&#x27;t kill each other and not take each others&#x27; stuff.<p>You could argue such cost benefits between families in tribes or individuals in families from the same framework.<p>None of this needs &quot;morality&quot;. You could argue that the very set of rules which make for an optimal balance between individual, family, tribal and inter-tribal interests is in fact &quot;morality&quot;... but when the resources and the power balance changes, whatever &quot;morals&quot; people thought existed will disappear and will be replaced by new set of &quot;morals&quot;.')
