Yes, they&#x27;d describe roughly how something should work, but the actual implementation would be super buggy, ignoring any corner cases, etc. People who stopped doing any hands on work more than a decade ago, and are just coasting without touching any code, by having more an architect&#x2F;mentor&#x2F;org-expert role.<p>If someone feels &quot;insulted&quot; by having to actually write code suggests that you&#x27;re looking for a role where you aren&#x27;t expected to actually write code. That&#x27;s fine, but probably not what they&#x27;re looking for.<p>Also, I&#x27;d advice you to be little more open to a fact, that someone with less experience than you is asking you questions. That&#x27;s not a great attitude to find good jobs at big IT companies, that are often full of young, often brilliant people.<p>edit: typo')
