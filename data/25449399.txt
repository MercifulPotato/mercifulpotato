As long as Bezos is willing to burn billions they will keep on going. But that also means they don&#x27;t have fear of failing, so they keep on doing things slowly. Elon on the other hand was and still is relentlessly pushing his companies to a breaking point. Model 3 production hell was a great example - do or die for Tesla, with crazy production lines in tents, flying machines from Germany in matter of days etc. Starship program is also managed as if the world was ending tomorrow with every other prototype ending with a big boom. The big pivot from carbon fiber to steel is example of agility, not failing for sunken cost fallacy and optimizing for rapid development speed.')
