I made the (evidently correct) assumption that most people would know that the median income is lower than $50k and the average. Grandparent&#x27;s &quot;barely rich&quot; figure doesn&#x27;t even hit the (high-earner overburdened) average, yet is higher than the income the median earner brings home.
