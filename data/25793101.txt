If this ships as described, I&#x27;m ordering one on Day 1 and then I&#x27;m NEVER going to use this Touch Bar MBP again.<p>Touch Bar was a stupid idea.  It should have been optional, not default.  Had it been optional from the start, there&#x27;s no way it would still be an option, it would be discontinued years ago.  Because few people would be ordering a Touch Bar MBP after they tried it for an ownership cycle.')
