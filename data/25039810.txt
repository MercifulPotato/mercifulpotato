As far as I know, this language doesn&#x27;t allow recursion or even while loops. Only Python like for loops over bounded collections are allowed.<p>The language is very similar to Python so it&#x27;s extremely easy to learn for many people.<p>This language is used as a configuration language for the Bazel build system [2]. Ensuring that scripts will run is a very nice property for configuration languages, giving a nice balance between flexibility and sanity.<p>I would love to have a similar configuration language but based on Clojure instead of Python.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.bazel.build&#x2F;versions&#x2F;master&#x2F;skylark&#x2F;language.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.bazel.build&#x2F;versions&#x2F;master&#x2F;skylark&#x2F;language.ht...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bazel.build&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bazel.build&#x2F;</a>')
