I only know it was a raspberry pi because it&#x27;s often stuck in the boot screen with the raspberry pi logo at the top. My pihole runs for months without issue, but this kiosk was down really often. I wonder why, maybe the sd card is not reliable enough, or maybe it&#x27;s the climate fluctuation like you mentioned because the kiosk is outdoor?')
