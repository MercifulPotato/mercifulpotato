Bit.ly had such a system a few years ago called &quot;Bundles&quot;, which they shut down.<p>I often see interesting lists on Twitter or in articles, but keeping track of all this is sometimes complicated. That&#x27;s where I got the idea.<p>So I created Multy over a weekend and was thrilled to see that I could make a functional site, no matter how small, in such a short period of time.<p>I still have a lot of ideas to improve it, such as adding private links, or a very simple statistics system.\nI would like as much as possible not to create an authentication system and keep the concept as simple as possible.\nI haven&#x27;t necessarily thought about monetization, but there may be some ideas! I didn&#x27;t create it to make a fortune anyway.<p>I would like to have your opinion on its current version, and on the evolutions I could bring to it.<p>Thank you for reading me and taking the time to test Multy!')
