This question is difficult for both sides.<p>The business often gets in my way with budgets. I can spend it all on some strange behavior that I detect in the application. I like to spend my time like that. The more experience I get the more time I could spend, even on simple applications. The rabbit hole goes ever deeper.<p>When am I satisfied that I delivered good work? When I find a number of high impact vulnerabilities. Doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t still more to be found, like I said you could go on and on, but it does mean that I fixed some bad. Sadly I have a fixed budget, and sometimes I find nothing, those are bad days.<p>In my experience customers are also satisfied with a report that contains few or no impactful findings. But an empty report is no guarantee that there really isn&#x27;t anything to be found.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to balance the desire to dive deep and to provide broad coverage. I once got bit by that.<p>I found and clearly documented no less than 3 absolutely critical issues (price adjustment in an e-commerce website). Felt pretty good about that test. Until, in production, someone else found an additional authentication bypass. Oops. I wasn&#x27;t focused on that due the aforementioned input validation issues and got blinded by trying to find more of those. It&#x27;s not easy.')
