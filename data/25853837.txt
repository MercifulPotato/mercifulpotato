Consider the ajax pattern:<p><pre><code>  b = a\n    .filter1()\n    .filter2()\n    .filter3()\n    .filter4();\n  if (b.foo()) {\n      return a.filter5();\n  } else {\n      return a.filter6();\n  }\n</code></pre>\nFor visual programming, AFAICT you have to feed `a` downstream <i>twice</i>: once to filter5 and once filter6 in preparation for the conditional branch. That requires one of the following:<p>* intersecting lines, which are way more visually complicated to read than the code above (and can quickly create visual ambiguities which as a class do not exist in a text-based language)<p>* one line which loops under the bottom of one of the downstream objects, which is visually distracting (especially if you have more than two branches)<p>edit: clarification')
