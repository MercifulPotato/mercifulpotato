It&#x27;s coming from three economists -- Barrero, Bloom, and Davis -- only one of whom is at Stanford, Bloom.  Barrero is at ITAM in Mexico, and Davis is at Chicago (he does have an affiliation with Hoover).<p>It should go without saying that a single professor does not speak for Stanford, or vice versa.  For all we know everyone else at Stanford thinks Bloom is an idiot.')
