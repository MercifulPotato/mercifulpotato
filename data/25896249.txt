Seeing a huge influx of SPACs in renewable energy. Jump in at the beginning and the most you can lost is 10$ if the SPAC fails. When it receives a letter of intent(LOI) you&#x27;ll see a big boost to the stock price. When the definitive agreement (DA) is announce there is another 20% jump. After the merge and symbol change, the price drops and then slowly comes up.<p>With so many coming out, just keep jumping to new SPACS as the LOI or DA is announced. Just wanted to share my experiences.<p>EDIT:\nNikola and QuantumScape (NKLA&#x2F;QS) are the big ones that got attention. Every SPAC is hoping to make a run like QS; 10$ went all the way up to 100$ at one point. NKLA was a scam, but brought a lot of attention')
