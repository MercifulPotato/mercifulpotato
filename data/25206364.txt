Most of the regions went to one company but that hasn&#x27;t been too much of a problem. The 2nd largest city went to a competitor etc.<p>These companies now own part of the fibre network but don&#x27;t necessarily sell to consumers. ISP&#x27;s buy time off the fibre due to something that was done in the early 2000s with the advent of DSL called &quot;Unbundling the local loop&quot;. \nThis means anyone can setup an ISP and sell to you using the &quot;governments&quot; fibre. This has resulted in plenty of competition and meant that NZ has gone from lagging behind many countries to now far exceeding.<p>Datacaps were the bane of many 2000s internet consumers 25gb for $x with 256kbs download etc. when USA connections were unlimited 256kbs for half the cost.<p>Another interesting thing that&#x27;s happened with the rollout of fibre across the land, business connections are now very similar in price to consumer connections. You can also now get business connections to your home and without any additional infrastructure.<p>Just a few years ago a business connection might cost you 2000NZD a month and require an expensive install. Now that the only difference is a SLA, you&#x27;re looking around 150NZD in comparison to a 100NZD &quot;home&quot; connection.<p>Something I think NZ has done well and could be a good model for other countries.')
