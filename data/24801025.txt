This reminds me of the insanity that some project managers use to estimate their completion dates. They say something will take 1 year. Then after 2 months they have done 1 month of work and then update their total estimate to be 13 months instead of 24. And I&#x27;d argue that its even worse for Kurzweil&#x27;s prediction because in that case its an exponential growth factor thats off - not a constant factor.<p>Want a prediction to sell a book? Singularity by 2029. Want the truth? The singularity won&#x27;t happen by 2029.<p><i></i>Note: I&#x27;m using 10 years here because the predictions from 2020 were not graded, and the last timeframe for graded predictions was ~2015')
