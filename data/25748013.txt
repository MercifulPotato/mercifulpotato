The automated import takes care of avoiding duplicates and making sure nothing is missed compared to doing it manually.<p>I&#x27;ve done accounting with just spreadsheets before and I hated how easy it would have been to make an accidental edit and not notice.  Manually exporting and importing CSV files is fatiguing and error prone as well.<p>I  find this similar for invoicing software: you could keep a spreadsheet of who you need to invoice, if you sent it, if it&#x27;s been paid, sending late reminders etc. but there&#x27;s a lot of freedom to make mistakes and mistakes here are high impact. Invoicing software automates many of the steps, forces you to follow a set process and gives loud warnings if you deviate or make unusual edits.')
