And I will agree that currently native interop from the JVM is more expensive than it should be, but they&#x27;re working on it.<p>&gt; They want to AOT compile, but their runtime and libraries rely a lot on runtime reflection.<p>Easily solved by just declaring what you reflect upon or using runtime agents to find it. It&#x27;s more difficult than a language than was designed to do it from the start, but eventually all of the big libraries will have it declared already.
