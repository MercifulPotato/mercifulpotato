But I went to a university with a high proportion of Chinese students, and it was really striking how much that feature was used (in apps that supported it obviously).<p>I&#x27;m just speculating, but I wondered if it was at least partly because of the tonal nature (roughly speaking: four intonations for each vowel, rendering completely different words, not just subtle changes in tone&#x2F;emphasis) of mandarin, and relatively large number of different characters, making vocal communication more efficient than written; to an even greater extent than that may be true of English, for example.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure what I&#x27;m saying. Maybe it&#x27;s not good to burn one market, maybe it is good to focus on excelling in others if (if!) the alternative is mediocrity everywhere, I don&#x27;t know. Your comment just reminded me and I thought it was vaguely interesting.')
