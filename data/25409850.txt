It seems like a very loosely defined concept. What specific changes or additions to raw ingredients are happening and how do these make the food less healthy?<p>Simply saying &quot;processed food is bad&quot; to me seems like a fallacious overgeneralization along the lines of &quot;natural is good&quot; or &quot;chemicals are bad&quot;.')
