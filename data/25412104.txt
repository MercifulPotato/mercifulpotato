This statement alone suggests to me that I should stop typing.<p>Impeachment was on the grounds of national security, not partisan poltics. At least one Republican Senator agreed. You can beg to differ.<p>Originalism is exclusively a fantasy based in the observer&#x27;s desires and perceptions of what they think the Framer&#x27;s would have wanted. It would be better if we prioritized the actual values of liberty, justice, etc, and the real outcomes of government policy we can all observe, instead of what we would like to believe people who have been dead for centuries may have believed. Wouldn&#x27;t they likewise have worried more about solving the problems they faced in the present?<p>The Constitution is a living document whether we&#x27;d like to accept that or not. It is fundamentally not the same as it was in the beginning, and it is a changeable document. Originalism from, my perspective, is almost <i>always</i> leveraged to maintain institutional control in the hands of a small, wealthy, and white group. We&#x27;d only have white landowners voting, after all, if the Constitution never changed.<p>I&#x27;m curious if you think that letting the Senate stand as an unchanged institution, for example, without ever adding more states as we have in the past to resolve political impasses, will lead to less of a partisan divide or more. What will happen in 20 years, when government has continued to be paralyzed by an Upper House that will fundamentally not accept the legitimacy of its opposition, as I have seen personally under Mitch McConnell (let&#x27;s be clear, they cannot be seen to negotiate with a black man, otherwise they will be primaried)?<p>You keep suggesting that Democrats are somehow going to turn into a different party than they are, while not producing evidence, all the while the GOP continues its slide into rank despotism. The House Minority leader himself signed onto the absurd Texas lawsuit. I have seen no evidence that voters who participate in the Democratic primary will tolerate any degree of the election disruption that GOP leadership repeatedly rams down our throats (again, to save their skins in their gerrymandered districts).')
