A couple of unique features- we automatically identify potential cleaning issues so that you’re spending more time fixing issues rather than finding them, and any dataset you connect to Phiona can be exposed as a private API, so you can share data with others without sharing your DB credentials or exposing proprietary transformation logic. And of course, you can automate workflows on a schedule or invoke them via webhook!<p>We currently offer a hosted option, but are in closed beta for on-premise and VPC deployment so that your data and blueprints stay private.<p>Would love to hear what you all think- happy to answer any questions in the comments!')
