Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[24973267, 24972677, 24975317], score=None, time=1604347384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24972233, text='You have to include transfer density to account for platform load factors, and Times Square&#x27;s situation of having 5 of the 7 Midtown Manhattan lines transferring there, all of them having both express and local platforms, on top of the massive local draws for boarding, and the location of the Port Authority&#x27;s bus terminal virtually guarantees that it&#x27;s going to the busiest station complex in perpetuity.<p>By contrast, the Hudson Yards station is a terminus station of a single line. That means traffic is largely going to be directly from the single platform entrance (there&#x27;s only one bank of escalators to the surface) to the waiting train, or vice versa. Even if it&#x27;s potentially going to be busy, there is very little need for platform loitering, and certainly not for the massive overbuild of platform and mezzanine that exists today.')
