It was a startup, with strictly volunteer moderators. It was an early &quot;social networking&quot; thing; honestly more like &quot;a BBS with some primordial social features&quot;. But hey, sounds like your hypothetical to an extent.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean I know anything.<p>Just means I&#x27;m sympathetic to the plight of folks trying to make that sort of thing a reality. For the record, I&#x27;d sure like to give it another try at some point myself.<p>Anyway, intent matters here, to an extent. Parler advertised itself as a more or less moderation-free space.<p>That&#x27;s quite different thing from Twitter and FB, with their codes of conduct and actual moderation teams. I mean, the line may be fuzzy, but it&#x27;s there. I&#x27;ll be the first person to say that Twitter and FB <i>suck</i>, and moderation efforts for advertising-driven user content mills are probably eternally doomed because their very business model dictates that their user-to-moderator ratio is always going to be laughably huge; far too large to enable effective moderation barring some kind of generational leap in AI moderation tools.<p>But there is at least the semblance of a good-faith effort there from those two, as much as I dislike them.')
