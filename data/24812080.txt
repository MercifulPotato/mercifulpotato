If we use abstraction, perhaps we need to recognize that abstraction does not absolve us of the responsibility for auditing the implementation, and that abstraction has not only value but also cost.<p>To make this easier across so many dimensions, we probably want to simplify our stacks and minimize our dependencies and supply chains far more drastically than we do.<p>There&#x27;s also a cost to all this understanding, and it comes down to what the business values. Security or velocity. But perhaps you can get both, especially as you design for simpler systems.')
