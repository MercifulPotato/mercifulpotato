There are (and were) devices that are very repairable, that aren&#x27;t so locked down and closed, but few actually care about this when they spend money and it soon goes away when companies realize how little consumers care about it. Saying you wish for X, Y, and Z is worth as much as it costs to say that, which is absolutely nothing. Actually paying money for stuff cuts through the bullshit consumers tell their friends or the internet about what they want or where their priorities are.<p>My points apply to Apple as well, consumers wanted this and continued buying devices like this. I don&#x27;t doubt that some people complain about various flaws in the products they buy but it&#x27;s largely meaningless because they clearly don&#x27;t care enough about these flaws to put their money where their mouth is. No one forced them to buy hard-to-repair, locked down Apple products when there were more open alternatives, they simply decided that repairability is so unimportant they&#x27;d still buy Apple products over a product that is more repairable.<p>It&#x27;s one thing if Apple were dishonest or consumers were somehow forced to buy Apple, but they&#x27;re not. There&#x27;s nothing actually stopping consumers from buying the phone they want. Consumers aren&#x27;t being harmed, they&#x27;re getting what they really want.<p>This is the choice I lose with this: the ability to buy a product that is locked down and tightly integrated&#x2F;controlled by Apple. It&#x27;s a choice millions of consumers have already willingly made. I&#x27;m personally living happily without buying Apple&#x27;s locked down products for myself, I and every other non-Apple consumer didn&#x27;t need the government to make this choice for me. I don&#x27;t want the government to remove a choice that millions of consumers have made on their own.')
