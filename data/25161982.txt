I have a plumber that I trust; he wasn&#x27;t the cheapest. I have an electrician that I trust; he wasn&#x27;t the cheapest. I have an insulation contractor; he was FAR from the cheapest but did an excellent job, so he&#x27;ll get the return call as well. [He was the only one who didn&#x27;t make obvious blunders in the bidding process; my favorite was the one who recommended I pay an extra $1000 for him to spray foam my rim joists; said it was the best money I could ever spend. I have a structural brick house with no rim joists, so I took him down to the basement to have him point out what he was proposing to do; hilarity ensued, of course]. I wish I could find a good HVAC contractor. I&#x27;m 0 for 2 so far there.')
