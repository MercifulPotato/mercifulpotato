The “proximity” I find appealing is that a component is either a function of data (“props”) returning the rendered structure, or an encapsulation of props and state returning the same... and in those cases (especially with static type checking) makes it easy to understand and navigate data flow, in a way that a template separate from its data types usually isn’t. Of course it’s good to separate the business logic from the rendering, but that still produces a more clear understanding of the data flow.')
