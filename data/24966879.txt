On the 3DMark Wild Life test, the iPhone 12 hit 39 frames per second, while the iPhone 11 Pro Max scored an even higher 42 fps. But when we switched to the off-screen version of the test, the iPhone 12 Pro notched a higher 51 fps to the iPhone 11 Pro&#x27;s 42 fps.&quot;<p>So if you don&#x27;t have more details then i do, the basic assumption, you should make, is that its much easier to put much more silicon in a MBP than in a Smartphone and the chances, that a MBP is loosing against a Smartphone, would be very weird and very unrealistic.<p>And this has nothing to do with if someone likes apple or arm or whatever.<p>It is also not very easy to compare something like this if you don&#x27;t know if there is a feature set difference and if one GPU can control 2-3 displays and the other only works for one display.')
