The IBM-compatible PCs were firmly entrenched by this time, so the VIC-20 was obsolete but still functioned.<p>I spent many hours playing with it.  Once I discovered the User I&#x2F;O port, I realized its true power.  It wasn&#x27;t a powerful computer on its own, but the fact that it could easily interface with the real world gave it abilities that the PC clones of the era didn&#x27;t have.<p>This Raspberry Pi PC reminds me of that VIC-20.  Like the VIC-20, it&#x27;s got a User I&#x2F;O port and encourages tinkering.  Unlike the VIC-20 I had, this is a modern computer that can be used for everything that we expect a modern computer to do.<p>I hope this encourages a new generation of tinkerers!')
