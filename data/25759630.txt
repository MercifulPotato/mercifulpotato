That the main developers brush aside requests that are important for most people or ignore them and don’t respond on those would make it quite frustrating for the users who care enough to write.<p>Signal could do a lot better in connecting with the community of users who care to connect. Remember that the users have a stake in this, so dismissing their feedback as “this is free, don’t ask for more” is actually condescending. Without users and users who evangelize the product in their circles, no such project can expand or thrive.<p>Signal team, you could also practice being nicer and more attentive.')
