I know it&#x27;s, ah, <i>controversial</i> to say that Van Halen&#x27;s songs in the Sammy Hagar era were by and large their best, but -- even though I think David Lee Roth was the better singer (Hagar sounds oddly like he&#x27;s straining all the time) -- I&#x27;m just more likely to go back to the &quot;Van Hagar&quot; songs. I know Hagar&#x27;s suggested they were writing as a group during that period more than the band was previously, but I know he&#x27;s not exactly an unbiased source there.')
