Many of the left-wing protests have turned into violent riots.<p>Here are some more details on this one:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elonnewsnetwork.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;march-in-graham-ends-with-police-pepper-spraying" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elonnewsnetwork.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;march-in-gra...</a><p>The original rules of the event were violated and the main road was blocked near a polling location.  Police officers warned the crowd multiple times to go a different way, but nobody listened.<p>I also have to laugh at the person in this article claiming that diverting a protest that is blocking people from getting to the polling station is somehow &#x27;voter intimidation&#x27;.<p>They used non-lethal force and arrested the violators.  I see no problem here.<p>They also clearly sprayed it onto the ground as a warning.  The article makes it sound like they were spraying into the faces of the crowd, which is just not true.')
