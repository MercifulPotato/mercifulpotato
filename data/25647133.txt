I&#x27;m aware that there are legal requirements for this type of data collection for law enforcement use, but sharing it with customers seems strange.<p>ISP&#x27;s have been been doing this for eons, not just for law enforcement, but for marketing as well.<p>To be honest, I think it&#x27;s refreshing that they are willing to share the data they have about the customer with the customer.  I think if more providers did that it would be eye opening to end users what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes.')
