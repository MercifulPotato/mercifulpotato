I think that it either doesn&#x27;t, or you add some really awkward schema language with XML namespaces ...<p>I just translated my .travis.yml to JSON, and I learned that<p><pre><code>    deploy:\n      on:\n        branch: master\n</code></pre>\ngets translated to {&quot;deploy&quot;: {&quot;true&quot;: {&quot;branch&quot;: &quot;master&quot;}}} because &quot;on&quot; is a synonym for true.  I&#x27;d call that unstructured.  It also has problems with keys that start with -, etc.<p>Also, all of the languages are often used with say Go templates, which makes them more unstructured.  They&#x27;re no longer statically parsable, which is &quot;table stakes&quot; for doing anything else (validation or static analysis).<p>I took some pains to make shell statically parsable [2], and I think it&#x27;s now a better foundation than these  config languages, per my other comment here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25483270" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25483270</a><p>I think HCL is probably a lot better, but it also seems to be the least used!  It&#x27;s structured, and has its own mechanism for expressing duplication that&#x27;s not the equivalent of a 70&#x27;s-style #include.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;.travis.yml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;.travis.yml</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;07.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;07.html</a>')
