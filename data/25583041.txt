Just because.<p>From the perspective of someone who rides a motorcycle, the #1 thing you need to do to not crash is to anticipate what all vehicles around you might possibly do.<p>For example, I always avoid riding in another car’s blind spot for obvious reasons.<p>The problem (for motorcyclists) will now be trying to adapt to understand what a Tesla might do and where a Tesla’s blind spots might be - and once you add in the idiosyncrasies of other AVs I could see it being really difficult to ride safely around AVs.<p>It’s fairly easy to anticipate actions of another human, and not as easy to anticipate when actions are decided by an algorithm.<p>FWIW I think the above also applies to cyclists.<p>(I suppose this becomes a non-issue if the assumption is that AVs will be so superior to human judgement as to never strike another motorcycle or cyclist - 5x safer sounds like a starting point)')
