What if I store &quot;evil message&quot; in my database and publish &quot;good message&quot; to the PNL?<p>Unless the end recipient of &quot;evil message&quot; is also logging to the PNL, (Which is hard, they&#x27;re supposed to be a dumb client) nobody will ever contradict the server. I could round-trip the messages through the PNL. Make the recipient pull them from there instead of the server. But that sounds like extra risk.<p>It&#x27;s a tricky problem, and in the end I&#x27;ll have to cut lots of corners for convenience. That makes me sad.')
