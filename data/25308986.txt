Nobody suggests that at all. People who support more progressive taxation point to things like the New Deal and the strong progressive taxation coupled with public investment in infrastructure and education that propelled the United States forward.<p>You&#x27;re making that exact argument in fancier words. &quot;strong progressive taxation coupled with public investment in infrastructure&quot; implies that the problem is not enough money. So take more money from people who have lots of money and let the government spend it.<p>The US spends more per-pupil on education than almost every other country [1], with worse outcomes in most cases. The corrosion inhibitors that would have prevented the Flint water crisis cost $140 per day. That&#x27;s not a misplaced decimal point. That&#x27;s One Hundred and Forty dollars. Do we need to revamp the entire US tax system to come up with a 140 bucks? No. The money is there, what&#x27;s needed is some competence in how it&#x27;s applied.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.manhattan-institute.org&#x2F;issues-2020-us-public-school-spending-teachers-pay" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.manhattan-institute.org&#x2F;issues-2020-us-public-sc...</a>')
