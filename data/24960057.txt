And that&#x27;s Starfish.<p>Basically, Starfish is a wallet that can work well with Vapor. You just keep it on, and everything will &quot;just work&quot; frictionlessly. That said, the reason why it&#x27;s &quot;Starfish&quot; and not &quot;Vapor Wallet&quot; is because Vapor is wallet agnostic. Vapor is a protocol and will support signing with all types of Bitcoin wallets and all types of signature schemes, in a plug-and-play manner. The Starfish approach is one of the options, which provides a seamless UX and provides more privacy and convenience.<p>Vapor is coming soon, just wanted to release Starfish first in order to avoid confusion.<p>You can already build some super interesting stuff with Starfish alone. The Vapor layer will make them more &quot;persistent&quot; by providing ways to wrap everything in a Bitcoin transaction format.')
