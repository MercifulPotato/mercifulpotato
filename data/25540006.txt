In Spacewar, it&#x27;s an exact square and all of it is shown on-screen, including immediate transitions to the other side (which is replicated here), while in Computer Space, it&#x27;s also a square area, but the visible screen area is just the standard NTSC 4:3, including a vertical off-screen area and an invisible bit of horizontal blanking at the side(s), where the saucers may hide, while still attacking you. Personally, I find the latter more difficult or even irritating.')
