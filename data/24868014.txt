Item(by='int_19h', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603449532, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24866156, text='I recently got a Palm m125, brand new in box, from eBay, for tinkering purposes.<p>The biggest hassle was setting up sync with the desktop, because that requires their app and drivers. But even that was ultimately a solvable problem on Win10.<p>But the old Palm apps install and work just fine, if you can find them. A more annoying problem is that a lot of them were shareware, and authors have long since moved on. But even with what&#x27;s free, it&#x27;s a handy little device; I can&#x27;t think of many other AAA-powered gadgets that are capable of compiling C apps for themselves!<p>As far as battery life goes, I&#x27;ll just quote one Amazon review from 2001:<p>&gt; Another negative feature with this specific model is the poor battery life. The m125 requires 2 AAA batteries (included), however they only last aprox. 2.5 weeks under normal use (compared to the 1-2 months of the m105 and most other PDA&#x27;s).<p>Sigh.')
