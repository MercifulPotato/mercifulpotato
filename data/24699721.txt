By modern standards it&#x27;s insane, but at a time where binary to decimal conversions could be a serious performance concern it might have made sense. For instance if you had a date in &quot;hours, minutes, seconds&quot; and wanted to add or subtract one of these TIME values, you could do it without a single multiply or divide.<p>Now I was 8 when MySQL first released in 1995, so I can&#x27;t really comment on whether that choice really made sense back then. 1995 does seem a bit late for BCD shenanigans, but maybe they based their design on existing applications and de-facto standards that could easily go back to the 80&#x27;s.')
