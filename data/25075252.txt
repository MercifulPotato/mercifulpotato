Also the on-board nvidia graphics card, while nice, was also a big power hog and that system had bad battery life until I turned it off. After a couple of years, the battery puffed up and started pushing up on the trackpad until it was unusable. Really soured me on Dell&#x27;s build quality, and I can&#x27;t recommend them at all, even though I admire their support for linux drivers.')
