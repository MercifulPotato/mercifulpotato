Item(by='doonesbury', descendants=None, kids=[25309173], score=None, time=1607120504, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25304893, text='There is an emotional appeal here, which complains that ivory tower types are too goody-two-shoes to accept mother nature doesn&#x27;t ship the wine and pate we thought we deserved. It&#x27;s a Trump like whining session about the entitledness of the realist camp. It&#x27;s not compelling. I too personally rather doubt the wave function is real, however, much remains to be learned.<p>For example (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-020-72817-7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-020-72817-7</a>): where NPRF means non-preferred reference frame:<p>&quot;Herein, we make progress on that front by extending NPRF to include the measurement of another fundamental constant of nature, Planck’s constant h. As Steven Weinberg points out, measuring an electron’s spin via Stern–Gerlach (SG) magnets constitutes the measurement of “a universal constant of nature, Planck’s constant”3, p. 3 (Fig. 1). So if NPRF applies equally here, everyone must measure the same value for Planck’s constant h regardless of their SG magnet orientations relative to the source, which like the light postulate is an empirical fact. By “relative to the source” of a pair of spin-entangled particles, we mean relative “to the vertical in the plane perpendicular to the line of flight of the particles”4, p. 943 (Fig. 2). Here the possible spin outcomes ±ℏ2 represent a fundamental (indivisible) unit of information per Dakic and Brukner’s first axiom in their reconstruction of quantum theory, “An elementary system has the information carrying capacity of at most one bit”5. Thus, different SG magnet orientations relative to the source constitute different “reference frames” in quantum mechanics just as different velocities relative to the source constitute different “reference frames” in special relativity. Since NPRF leads to the counterintuitive aspects (“mysteries”) of time dilation and length contraction in special relativity, it is perhaps not surprising that NPRF produces a “mystery” for quantum mechanics associated with the measurement of h as well.&quot;<p>There is yet room to grow in QM. I definitely agree with the the original paper&#x27;s argument on how and why the focus has moved away from foundations, and why the Copenhagen interpretation gets more emphasis than it should. Since this is a very hard nut to crack, the human organizational impulse is to shut up and do. And for new comers who can&#x27;t do, all they can do is verse themselves in Copenhagen so at least they can do that.')
