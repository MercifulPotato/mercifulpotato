Item(by='rsynnott', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602180560, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24720059, text='&gt; I think the goal with the vacuum is to get to even higher speed rail which can compete with airplanes for speed and convenience.<p>But... they already do, at least for short flights. LA to SF is about 600km, or a little under two hours by a &#x27;normal&#x27; (ICE or similar) high speed system (1.5 hours by maglev). It&#x27;s about 1 hour 20 minutes by plane, so by the time you check in, get through security, get on and off, get to and from the airport, the train definitely wins.<p>Something like this might theoretically compete with long distance flight, I suppose.')
