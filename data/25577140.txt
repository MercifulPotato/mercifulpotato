When devs like Greg Maxwell and Adam Back social engineered the GitHub repo away from the original contributors they more or less killed the idea of Bitcoin as a currency and have since been pushing the idea that it is a &quot;settlement&quot; layer, or something like digital gold, not Digital Cash as it was intended.<p>Without any real world use case and intentionally high fees Bitcoin, like Tesla, is pointlessly overvalued by people who could care less about the underlying technology and just hope to get rich off the hype train and sell to a greater fool.<p>Real users and developers moved to projects like Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Monero years ago. All that are left are fan boys and marketers.')
