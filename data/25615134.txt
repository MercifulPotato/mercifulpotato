As usual people fail to come up with good metrics and incentives and it&#x27;s Goodhart&#x27;s law all the way. Some problems just can&#x27;t be solved by technology. But that never stopped anyone from trying over and over again... hyping their overfit tech to non-tech people.<p>I think the actual problem is with management on the employer side, not the job boards. They need to bite the bullet and accept they need real human interactions to measure productivity and reward it case to case.')
