Item(by='athenot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603799295, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24903475, text='&gt; But &quot;Follow the Japanese art of forest bathing&quot; is a much better headline than &quot;try going for a walk in the forest&quot;.<p>Though poorly-worded, it can challenge us to look at mundane things with a fresh point of view.<p>Yes it&#x27;s still a simple walk in the forest. No, there&#x27;s no magical Avatar-style glow of light envelopping us and varying with each step we take in the forest.<p>But in a world where everything is edulcorated by marketing and by superlatives (think Instagram &quot;perfectness&quot;), it can be easy to loose sight of how wonderful a simple walk in a humble forest can be.<p>The same trail in the same woods will never look the same twice. Same trees that don&#x27;t move, yet things change in subtle ways with both fauna and flora which evolve within this life-sustaining playground.<p>I have never heard this described as &quot;the Japanese art of forest bathing&quot;, yet that describes a walk in the woods rather well.<p>Of course, like any new novelty that comes our way, it&#x27;s always possible to just cargo-cult it because it sounds cool and not realize what it&#x27;s trying to get at. And you are right, this is further encouraged by the wellness clickbait. But I&#x27;d like to suggest it&#x27;s possible to look beyond that.')
