At the outset I had most of the warehouse to myself and I walked around the warehouse talking out loud to myself to solve my programming problems.  Once the warehouse was populated with workers and I was stuck to my desk I realized how much I needed that walking.  Now that I&#x27;m working from home I do laps around my kitchen while solving tough problems.')
