I found it kind of funny. But there&#x27;s a lot he could&#x27;ve done better.<p>My top recommendation would&#x27;ve been to find someone in medicine as a co-founder. This could&#x27;ve helped him find flaws in the economic model faster. I still think his project has amazing potential, except that it&#x27;s going to have to go through a couple of iterations. For example - what if he somehow integrated this information to make it so that it&#x27;s easier to connect customers to future doctors and take a affiliate fee?<p>Also imagine if we had a better medical search engine. There&#x27;s so much information in medicine that is still blocked off to consumers. The author mentions that consumers do not want to go through the details - maybe we can make something that can dumb it down for people and put a directory of doctors who can help explain further?')
