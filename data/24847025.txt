And I also saw some that then use `pkgconfig`[2] as a fallback.<p>I already fixed several `vcpgkg` ports as I started using this myself in several of my crates.<p>1. A package manager is only ever as good as its coverage of  people&#x27;s needs - packages wise. Forget usability, CLI, etc. If it covers the packages I need (and can actually build them) I&#x27;m happy to bite those bullets.<p>2.
