In the river&#x2F;stream flood modeling space, the US Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; HEC-RAS program [1] is king. It&#x27;s a critical part of FEMA&#x27;s National Flood Insurance Program. HEC-RAS is free, but it&#x27;s not open source, and USACE doesn&#x27;t appear to have any plans to make it so.<p>HEC-RAS is a Windows-only GUI application. Supposedly USACE has an internal Linux version, not publicly available. HEC-RAS has a limited COM API, but it&#x27;s not officially documented. I suspect that the API was exposed unintentionally. Most of the input files are text, but the format is very strange (very old-school), again with no official documentation. I spend much of my days reverse-engineering HEC-RAS file formats in order to make the process of building flood models more efficient and less error-prone. Other developers like me exist at competing civil engineering firms, working on similar reverse engineering projects and secret sauce tools for HEC-RAS.<p>If HEC-RAS was made open source, it would be a game changer. We&#x27;d be able to accomplish so much more. If the input&#x2F;output files were officially documented, it would be a game changer. FEMA would benefit tremendously.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hec.usace.army.mil&#x2F;software&#x2F;hec-ras&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hec.usace.army.mil&#x2F;software&#x2F;hec-ras&#x2F;</a>')
