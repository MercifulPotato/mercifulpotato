They are (currently) slow, have high transaction fees, but most importantly the non-refundability of crypto transactions is a bug, not the feature crypto proponents suggest.<p>However, as a <i>store of value</i> (e.g. &quot;digital gold&quot;), I think crypto has real potential. There is a reason crypto is very popular in places with hyper-inflationary monetary systems like Venezuela and Iran. And compared to actual, physical gold, crypto is almost <i>better</i> in every way: it is much more easily transferred and stored, and the ledger means establishing &quot;provenance&quot; is not an issue. Yes, it&#x27;s obviously currently extremely volatile, but it&#x27;s not hard to imagine that volatility lessening over time.')
