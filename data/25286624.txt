If it were secure to install arbitrary code on a computer, we&#x27;d have more apps. If it were easy to compile across platforms and handle every weird OS call, we&#x27;d have way, way more apps.<p>Browsers are essentially a translation layer with some security guarantees and even there, on both counts they aren&#x27;t perfect. They&#x27;re merely better than the alternative.<p>If you ever want to disrupt the entire industry, make something that is easier to code for and more secure than a web browser. If it&#x27;s faster too, then that&#x27;s gravy.')
