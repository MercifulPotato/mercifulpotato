Whether it <i>should</i> be is not relevant. Given how liberals widely seem to hate &quot;America&quot;[0], I was remarking that avoiding mentioning Christmas (by a well-known woke company) comes off as being motivated by hatred of American culture. If one&#x27;s motive is really to be inclusive rather than to display hatred, there are ways to be inclusive that don&#x27;t look like hate.<p>If it&#x27;s a religious holiday to you, then that&#x27;s great. That&#x27;s a good reason for not wanting it to be considered part of American culture, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it is.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;30&#x2F;i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;30&#x2F;i-can-tolerate-anythin...</a>')
