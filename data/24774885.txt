Item(by='netcan', descendants=None, kids=[24778843], score=None, time=1602669182, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24773384, text='I tend to agree, but with some reservations.<p>One difference between centralisation due to monopolies and centralization due to other things (government planning, industry-scale unions, etc.) is that monopolies are highly profitable regardless of efficiency.<p>Going broke is what usually kills things.<p>The macrofinancial situation, currently, is telling. We are obviously in the midst of a recession. Huge industries are in meltdown: hospitality, air travel, physical retail, etc. They are literally producing far fewer goods and services... stuff that people normally consume.<p>OTOH indexes are up. Why, because the profits of H&amp;M or RyanAir are miniscule compared to fb or amzn regardless.<p>Consider what &quot;<i>increases efficiency .., lowering the prices and making products more affordable</i>&quot; means for fb or google. There are no prices, except ad prices. We can&#x27;t even think about consumer benefits (more, better goods) in a meaningful way. What does more facebook even mean? Is it beneficial to anyone?<p>This matters because &quot;more resources to fb, less to Ryanair&quot; is the market working normally. Since fb doesn&#x27;t consumer capital, all that happens is a stock price change.')
