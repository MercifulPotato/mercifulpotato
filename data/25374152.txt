Some of the voices seem to be slightly behind my ear but because it doesn&#x27;t try anything extreme it doesn&#x27;t fail like the average video game HRTF demo.<p>On top of that they put distinct reverb on the voices because a huge part of the &#x27;surround&#x27; experience of sound is how the sound interacts with the space it is in.<p>But with my eyes closed and listening hard I hear a lot of richness in the zoom recording too;  the Spatial Audio is louder at times then the zoom recording and that is hard to control but unfair because you have to get terribly loud before most people don&#x27;t prefer the louder sound (i either made the excuse I was afraid to blow the speakers or i planned ahead and palmed OSHA ear plugs -20db before you say Uncle)')
