Great.  Glad you agree.<p>&gt;  everyone except for EPIC<p>So epic gives a larger revenue share to game devs.  Great.  And Apple&#x27;s actions are preventing this revenue share increase to game developers, for that game store, at the very least.<p>&gt; You are the not the arbiter of what is a valid example.<p>What?  Even you agree that epic is giving game developers a large revenue share.  That is an example right there, that exists.<p>&gt; isn&#x27;t representative of a whole<p>Its representative of at least one example though!  So that means that Apple is preventing at least 1 competing app store that would have a better revenue share, for game developers.  That single example, is an example of harm done to game developers.<p>&gt; If* it is proven so in court than I may agree with you.<p>So then your previous statement about who &quot;deserves&quot; the money could be invalid.<p>&gt; You keep on pretending that there is only one phone manufacturer<p>Anti-competitive practices do not require a literal singular monopoly, for them to be illegal.  Instead, all that is required is them having significant market power.  Which Apple clearly has.<p>&gt; Your opinion isn&#x27;t a fact.<p>Ok, then your opinion, of Apple &quot;deserving&quot; anything is also not a fact, because the court case could prove that the actions are anti-competitive.<p>You cannot at all say that Apple &quot;deserves&quot; this money, if the courts prove their actions to be anti-competitive.<p>&gt; You want the market to be legislated because you don&#x27;t like Apple.<p>No, it is because philosophically I want game devs to get more of the revenue split.  Why?  Because they developed the game.<p>&gt; If people argued from the fact that there should be able to sideload applications.<p>What?  Thats basically what this is about.  Allowing other competing app stores on the platform.')
