Back then the worst part of the handheld was the screen. It was a cheap TFT screen with very poor viewing angles. The console is also not very comfortable, my (adult) hands start to hurt after about 1h of playing. In the end, as too many gadgets before, ODroidGo is gathering dust in one of the forgotten boxes in my home...<p>The most difficult part, during the assembly process, was connecting the &quot;ribbon&quot; from the main board to the screen. Be careful as it is way too easy to lock the ribbon than to unlock it from the socket.<p>Not all games are working, but I managed to run both Mario and Wario (GBC) on it. Some games are not working, some you can play but the save feature is not working. The battery life is impressive, comparing to my smartphone.')
