Item(by='todd8', descendants=None, kids=[25885501], score=None, time=1611405045, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25878149, text='I had to pay a large (too large) an amount to purchase an extra parking space when I bought my condo. I personally didn&#x27;t need the space all the time, but guests to the condo didn&#x27;t have to hunt for parking on the street in an area with busy nightlife. I figured that when I sold the condo the parking space would raise the value of the condo, maybe not enough to make up for the cost but enough to be worth having the parking spot and it&#x27;s convenience.<p>It turned out that in the building there were owners of units with two cars but only one space that wanted to rent unused parking spots. I didn&#x27;t do this but there were posting where condo owners could find people to pay for the right to use otherwise unused parking.<p>All this seems a bit off topic, but couldn&#x27;t electric chargers be handled the same way. Pay for the cost of a charger to be installed in one&#x27;s designated parking spot and &quot;resell&quot; the improvement to the next condo owner. One could even allow others to use the charger while being reimbursed for the electricity. Of course being the owner of a unit in a condo building isn&#x27;t the same as leasing an apartment and dealing with a large company that owns the apartment building.')
