US has over 31M small businesses. How many do you need to conclude it&#x27;s an option? 99.9% of businesses in the US are small businesses (obviously, since you only need one person to make a small business and 100K persons to make a Walmart). If normal folks can&#x27;t afford it, who are all those? I know several people having businesses, in what way they are not &quot;normal&quot;? Not all of them are rich (in fact, most of them aren&#x27;t, most are making a good living, some better than others, but none I know are billionaires so far) but how this is not normal? I think your picture here is very skewed.')
