The brand I have is called &quot;32 degrees cool&quot;, but I think they have other brands now like Bench, that sell this same blend of material, black or white color.<p>Compared to an a cotton undershirt the difference in comfort is amazing. Basically you don&#x27;t feel any of the stitches, or anything pressing on your armpits. And its super light weight. You can sleep in it, its so comfortable.<p>And its also cheap, 3 or 4 pack for under $20.')
