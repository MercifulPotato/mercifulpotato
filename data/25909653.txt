It seems to me that nobody wants to step out of the safe model of targeted advertising, since it does work well enough, and so there haven&#x27;t been big enough attempts at contextual advertising to really say one approach is better.\nAs an anecdotal test, I went to cnx-software.com and disabled my adblocker. The site has roughly 13 ads, 3 served by Google, the rest custom. Google tried to sell me toothpaste, while the custom ads are for things I&#x27;m actually tangentially interested in, like SoMs, embedded devices and assembly services. This kind of advertising obviously has a large overhead for the site admins right now, but I could definitely imagine an AdSense-like service that would distribute ads based on processing the site&#x27;s contents.')
