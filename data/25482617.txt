Item(by='danso', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608423342, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25482058, text='That the reporter was credulous enough to believe the faker&#x27;s story to be &quot;most likely&quot; true is the very thing that she needs to answer for.<p>Sorry, but &quot;sources in US and Canadian intelligence saying they believed he was a member of ISIS&quot; is just <i>not</i> a foundation of evidence, especially since the NYT refuse to describe the sources beyond the vaguest of terms (e.g. we have no idea whether one U.S. source is just agreeing that he&#x27;s heard rumors from another U.S. source). Do we really need to reiterate the long history of the U.S. intelligence bureaucracy doing things like putting children on the no-fly list?<p>The main thing that matters is the documentable evidence that the NYT had access to. Like his passport stamps and social media. To quote from the NYT&#x27;s investigation [0]:<p>&gt; <i>But far from proving Mr. Chaudhry’s jihadist bona fides, at least one of the pictures was a brazen copy of widely available news photography, The Times’s examination found. The original image had been taken months earlier by a photographer for the official Russian news agency, Tass, and had been distributed by Getty Images, one of the world’s biggest suppliers of photographs...</i><p>&gt; <i>Other images Mr. Chaudhry provided as evidence that he had gone to Syria — specifically, snapshots he said he had taken of armed men at the beach, whom he described as his “fellow fighters” — also proved to be identical to photographs that had been posted on Twitter years before by Syrian antiwar activists, The Times’s examination found. And as with other images, Mr. Chaudhry misrepresented — or perhaps didn’t actually know — where, and sometimes when, they had been taken.</i><p>So either the NYT went ahead with publishing this full fledged project <i>knowing</i> that Mr. Chaudhry, the subject, had stolen photos and claimed them as his own. Or, they went ahead and accepted his social media photos as evidence, without even doing a cursory reverse image search – which is unconscionable given the severe and immediate doubts raised by Mr. Chaudhry&#x27;s passport.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;world&#x2F;middleeast&#x2F;caliphate-chaudhry-hoax.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;world&#x2F;middleeast&#x2F;caliphat...</a>')
