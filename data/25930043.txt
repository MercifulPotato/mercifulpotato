Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611764204, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25924927, text='&gt; This is not even close to a semblance of socialism, this is your government trying to live by the ideology of &quot;free market everything&quot; and patching the holes created by this ideology with a more expensive (and dumber) solution.<p>I&#x27;m not an ardent capitalist, but I think education is an area that would have been better off without government tampering, or perhaps with less-clever tampering. The good bit about our student loan program is that it normalized higher education (perhaps too much to the extent that many would have been happier and more successful in the trades). The bad bit is that government put all risk on the students, allowing for students to elect into programs that wouldn&#x27;t have a good return on investment--something that virtually no bankers would have signed off on. As a result, two things happened: 1. millions of students annually opt into careers with poor job prospects on the other side and 2. the price of higher education inflated (something like tenfold) to meet the availability of student loan money (and without any corresponding increase in value) because the system isn&#x27;t steering students (and their loan money) toward programs that deliver. I think if we allowed students to default on their loans, we would see loan prices fall 80% or more ($8K instead of $40K).')
