They aren&#x27;t expressive enough. You can do it with &quot;tagged&quot; DFAs, which I believe are equivalent to transducers. In that case, I would imagine minimization would work just fine, it would just probably be ineffective. The paper that came out of the re2c project is good here.[1]<p>But sure, I think it&#x27;s just a matter of adding features where most uses of them will result in pretty poor performance. In RE2&#x27;s case, state blowup manifests by thrashing its hybrid NFA&#x2F;DFA cache, which slows it down considerably and eventually will push RE2 to fall back to the NFA simulation.<p>And I&#x27;m actually not sure off the top of my head how complement&#x2F;intersection impact the Thompson NFA construction. That has to be reasonably fast and space efficient on its own.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;re2c.org&#x2F;2017_trofimovich_tagged_deterministic_finite_automata_with_lookahead.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;re2c.org&#x2F;2017_trofimovich_tagged_deterministic_finit...</a>')
