Specific syntax is never going to be the thing I remember that puts all the pieces together.<p>As you continue programming in a given language, you automatically memorize low-level things like syntax and idioms. That&#x27;s not something that everyone needs or wants to practice explicitly with flashcards or whatever (that&#x27;s not how I learn, anyway). But memorization of syntax is absolutely critical to achieve &quot;fluency&quot; in the programming language, just as in human language.<p>Imagine a monolingual English speaker learning German and scoffing at their classmates&#x27; attempts to internalize the grammar rules. You can Google or look all that stuff up in a few seconds! But having to pause and look up every conjugation or word ordering is exactly what prevents the learner from actually communicating clear ideas at a useful speed in their target language.')
