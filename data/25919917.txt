It <i>used</i> to be so much better ... it used to recognise the words I use and more often than not it picked up my mistakes and let me just carry on but it just seems to be getting worse and worse. I’ll be typing something fairly innocuous and it’ll suggest a name from my phone book of somebody I haven’t contacted in years or it will insist on turning fairy cogent sentences into nonsense. Like why? I heard that a while ago they replaced whatever it was that worked with some kind of machine learning algorithm but here’s the thing it just doesn’t learn I’m having to correct it again and again for frequently used words - even T9 was better at this stage. Everyone I know is having similar problems and I can’t understand how this isn’t more of a thing? Maybe it’s to do with anytime you search for anything on the topic you’ve to go through pages and pages of linkspam and apples own support forums are ghost towns filled with disingenuous sock puppets pretending everything is just fine. I’ve come across a couple of stack exchange and Reddit posts but nobody there seems to be any the wiser. Surely there’s some smart guys on here who have some idea what’s going on and is there any hope ever of apple demonstrating any awareness of this or any willingness to fix it? I mean can we not just go back to what they had in 2012? That worked fine!')
