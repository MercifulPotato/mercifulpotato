Do you do code-reviews <i>after decompiling build output</i>? If you’re a sane person, probably not - so you’d fall for this too.<p>An automated tool might have more of a chance, but again it’s kinda hard to have one that runs on binaries. If it runs after build, it’s typically some input&#x2F;output checker, which would not detect code like this.<p>It’s a hard problem and I think it has just demonstrated that the security of build-related infrastructure should be taken more seriously than it currently is.')
