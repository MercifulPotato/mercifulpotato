Even the hit at the back of the throat and oral fixation (which is what I craved, <i>not wanted</i>).<p>I specifically <i>wanted to</i> stop for 5 years. I did not have the willpower to push through cravings. I <i>wanted to</i> stop smoking, I <i>needed to</i> have a smoke.<p>Addiction is not a matter of wants or desires, that&#x27;s what gets you addicted. Addiction is a biological bug.
