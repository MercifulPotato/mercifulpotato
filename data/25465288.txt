The critical position (&quot;Yermolinsky offered a pawn as bait...&quot;) arises on move 18.<p>It&#x27;s not spectacular - I would say mundane, but you can&#x27;t say that when someone beats a top GM in just 24 moves. What Yermolinsky overlooked is a famously missable type of move - a backwards move to a square that was occupied at the start of the variation - but still trivial for a player of his class.<p>It looks to me like he did not like his position after move 16 and sought these complications partly as a bluff. The computer says Black&#x27;s position is not all that bad after 16...dxe5 or 18...dxe5, but he will have to either defend a passive position with a weak d-pawn or sacrifice a pawn in a different way.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lichess.org&#x2F;oLuNYymZ&#x2F;white" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lichess.org&#x2F;oLuNYymZ&#x2F;white</a>')
