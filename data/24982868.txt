Although the verification would also be something that could easily be done by a human as well.<p>Your points of failure here are a) trusting the DNS system, which is acceptable for most use cases, and b) trusting the package manager, which is a similar situation to a above.<p>There are a few types of dns records that are meant for this already, depending on the specific, but probably a txt record is fine and I think what most people do now, though I could be wrong about that.')
