Personally, I&#x27;m astonished by the amount of great tools available for free to everyone and the sheer amount of labor that people put there in their free time.

Especially that it&#x27;s potentially a very lucrative market, as you could cell this IDE in millions and not worry about the future, whatever it would be.<p>[1] I know that most contributions to Linux are made by professionals on payroll, it doesn&#x27;t change much overall.')
