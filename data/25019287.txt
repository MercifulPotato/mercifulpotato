I have had it pointed out to me before, however, that the USA can vote in whomever they please,  and it is none of our business.<p>But American companies sell us our books and films (understatement), take cuts of our credit card payments,  make us coffee, organize our taxis. All of this seems to be with preferential tax treatment.  All of these things could be done without the US, but the US is our partner in peace,  so it is tolerated.<p>And here is the rub, this works so long as the USA is a legitimate ally.<p>And then came Trump, telling us that we don&#x27;t spend enough on Nato (with US defence companies) and threatening our peace. I believe this has lead to a situation where the US is seen less as a partner and more as a bully,  a colonial overlord demanding tribute. I think the next 20 years will see a shift in this kind of trade to the EU and to the East.<p>The USA can be insular if it wants,  but it can&#x27;t do so and expect everything to be the same as it has been for the last 50 years. An insular US is a declining US. Your new President has a terrific amount of work to do to undo this damage...')
