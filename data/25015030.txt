There is no requirement to contribute back to <i>the community</i>, just the requirement that changes (or rather, the source with your changes) be made available to your users. This means they could mail CDs of their code to their paying customers <i>only</i>, if they so choose. A far cry from &quot;contributing back to the community&quot;, closer to something like &quot;a pain in the ass.&quot;')
