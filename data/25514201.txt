Later joined another startup, bought shares just after 1 year cliff, got acquired 6 months later. Made about $80k.<p>Taxes can be tricky. For each stock, you have:<p>* strike price: your cost<p>* fair market value: the &quot;value&quot; of your stock when you buy, usually set by a 3rd party<p>When you buy your stocks, you pay taxes on your virtual gain (fair market value - strike price). So you may have a huge tax bill to pay years before you can make any real profit.<p>On the other side, in the US, if your stocks qualify as small business stocks (you bought your stock when company had &lt; $50M in assets and hold them for 5 years), you pay no federal taxes on first $10M.<p>If you buy your share early, less taxes to pay, possible QSBS, but might be a loss. If you wait longer, your options might expire (typically after 10 years), higher tax bill (as FMV increases) but less uncertainty about the value of your stocks.')
