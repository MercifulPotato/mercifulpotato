Once those laws were undermined or removed its doctrines and practices were able to be challenged, and now we see greater numbers of non-believers in formerly Christian countries as a result.<p>There&#x27;s certainly dogma in that example but not the sort you were positing.<p>As I&#x27;ve pointed out elsewhere, you&#x27;ve time limited the results for no apparent reason. That a lie can get halfway round the world before truth has a chance to get its trousers on does not obviate the power of truth and the power to speak truth.')
