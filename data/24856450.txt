Here are some comments:<p>&gt; 4. Zero calories vs low calories when doing a low-carb diet doesn&#x27;t really make a difference<p>That&#x27;s not so clear cut. At the very least, anecdotal evidence indicates that zero calories reduces appetite much more than low calories does (to the point of elimination usually). This may have to do with smells or flavors of food, or may have to do with the activity level of some digestive processes. There is some evidence (from Cabanac&#x27;s experiments, for example), that the calories are secondary, and smells+flavors are much more important than the amount of calories.<p>&gt; 5. When your body runs out of body fat it can easily source, it starts eating muscle. That&#x27;s not just your arms and legs, that&#x27;s things like your heart.<p>Yes, but it starts with unused muscles first, and does that before or in parallel with fat. Luckily, your heart is in constant use, so it gets eaten last. This is the reason that you must exercise while fasted if you don&#x27;t want to lose muscles.<p>&gt; 7. When you come out of ketosis, you should do it slowly. Transition from a high fat, low carb, small protein to increasingly more carbs and proteins. Grabbing a take-out or ribs and ice cream defeats the point.<p>Total agreement here, and one should be aware of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Refeeding_syndrome" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Refeeding_syndrome</a><p>&gt; 8. Fasting only really works over short periods. When your body realizes something is wrong your survival mechanisms kick in, you go into starvation mode. Your metabolism drops and you start conserving energy rather than burning it.<p>Define &quot;short&quot;. Seems to be 14-30 days before any significant drop in metabolism not attributable to &quot;no need to digest&quot;, if you are active. In my experience, one DOES conserve more energy - e.g., a friend remarked that I lifted my legs less when running while fasted, and that my motions were otherwise &quot;more energetically economical&quot;. But e.g. my body temperature was <i>higher</i> than usual.')
