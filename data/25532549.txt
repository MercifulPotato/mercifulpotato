To your question about how I managed this, I&#x27;d attribute it half to having prepared well for this: oriented my undergrad and masters to be a split of CS and applied math, with heavy emphasis on prob&#x2F;stat, graph theory, vector&#x2F;discrete math, the sort of things that I got a sense were good to have on a toolbelt; and half to using these in progressively more involved &quot;Data-oriented jobs&quot; that didn&#x27;t require upfront credentials: adminning petascale clusters, helping researchers utilize them, working in industry spaces heavily overlapping ML, data science tooling, and data&#x2F;textual processing.  Eventually you&#x27;ll build up a track record such that the PHD isn&#x27;t necessary to demonstrate that you can deliver good work in that space.<p>To be evenhanded, I absolutely would have trouble getting a &quot;pure research&quot; position as a PI, or running a lab.  But I&#x27;ve never really wanted that, and never really regretted (actually, felt quite vindicated by) my choice to stop at a Masters degree.  Again, I just want to emphasize: the most important question to me would be figuring out what YOU want, and whether a PHD is a non-starter to open those doors.<p>(For instance, I was told years ago it was not realistic to get a job at MSR without a PHD, except as a research-SWE, not a full scientist.  This may have changed but I assume it&#x27;s still roughly true; my wife has run up against similar issues in biotech where to get the &quot;Scientist&quot; title, even if you have the same competencies built up over time in practice, you need a PHD.  This is slowly changing over time, especially as programming becomes more critical and the phd system continues to be... a bit disfunctional, but that&#x27;s a slow slow change.)')
