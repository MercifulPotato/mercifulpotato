Sometimes the wave functions of all the electrons interfere constructively, so you see a bright spot, and sometimes deconstructively, so you see dark. Depending on the orientation of things, this results in the images of &quot;atoms&quot; that you see in the picture. As the crystal changes shape and size, the interference patterns change, which partially explains why it disappears and reappears a few times. There&#x27;s a bit more going on than that, but the physics of what&#x27;s happening in a TEM image is really neat.')
