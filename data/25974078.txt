If you are holding 21 and they shut the game down in the middle that is illegal. HALF of robinhood users bought and were holding GME. They were holding 21 and Robin Hood shut them down in the middle, turning their winning hand into a losing hand. That is the difference.<p>When they bought the stock they had absolutely no reason to think the brokerages would stop selling shares.<p>They were selling call options that are in the money at $500, while simultaneously not actually allowing GME to go to $500. That is outrageous.<p>Right before robin hood shut down GME they closed people&#x27;s positions out at a price of over $2000 per share. The holders literally broke through the sells and were forcing the short squeeze to happen. Robin hood then forced GME into the floor. That is absurd and should absolutely be illegal. It is a crooked casino. They should&#x27;ve been forced to close out everyone&#x27;s position at the ask price, but they didn&#x27;t want to so they cheated.')
