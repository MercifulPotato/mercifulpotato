Using this deterministic approach, Jinx aimed to increase the frequency of occurrence of elusive shared memory bugs, sometimes called Heisenbugs.&quot;<p>[...]<p>&quot;Jinx was implemented as a hypervisor, giving it the ability to observe the effects of all elements of the software environment on thread interleaving.
