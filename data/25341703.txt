An AR15 and a Glock.  The AR was fun to shoot.  Kind of nerve-wracking holding a weapon that could kill someone but fun none the less.<p>The Glock was another story.  It kicked like crazy and you could really feel the power of each shot in your arms.  I didn&#x27;t have any fun shooting it and I was a more than a little terrified I was going to hurt someone.  Even when it was empty I had so much unease just setting it down on the table.<p>Seeing those police officers enter someones home with their guns drawn and pointed was... a new feeling.  I had an immense sense of dread just knowing how much power was behind those guns.  The thought that someone was pointing it at children is just beyond my comprehension now.  For what?  Allegedly logging into a website?<p>If shes guilty, go to jail, pay the fine, whatever.  But the level of escalation to even walk through the front door with your gun drawn.  The level of... I don&#x27;t know... disrespect?  Hatred?  I can&#x27;t even begin to describe to someone who doesn&#x27;t know just how much force and how casually its being shown.<p>Truly, these officers are a disgrace to Florida.  The people who trained them are a disgrace.  And the people who empower them to behave this way are a disgrace.')
