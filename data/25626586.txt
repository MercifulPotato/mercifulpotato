There&#x27;s a lot of software in particular that gets around by word of mouth alone.<p>Necessity for advertisement seems correlated to how unclear it is what advantage your product has for the consumer. If you make something that&#x27;s like X but twice as fast or twice as cheap you don&#x27;t need advertisement.')
