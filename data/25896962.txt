Podcasts don&#x27;t work either because their is no visual component.  I need to be able to <i>imagine</i> the visual, even if I&#x27;m not watching it.  Somehow, that&#x27;s important.  Maybe it stimulates that part of my brain to prevent it from creating visual dreams.   I suppose there&#x27;s a general rule in the brain that when you&#x27;re listening and watching something, that part of your brain goes into input-mode rather than compute-mode.<p>There are two important takeaways here.<p>1. I&#x27;ve (for myself) obviated the need for sleeping pills (the solution my colleagues have taken).<p>2. There are seemingly no ill effects to preventing my brain from dreaming naturally for over six months.<p>If you really think about that 2nd point, this means that it would be possible to create sleep specific programming.  One could use it to incorporate messages to ones self.<p>Many in this sub-thread are thinking they can use it to learn new things - typical HN!  ...but since novel content wakes your mind, I think it would be more valuable to program motivational content.  Content that reinforces your core principles and might help you focus yourself in the subsequent day.  It might even be possible to have a small portfolio of programming if you&#x27;re expecting&#x2F;planning a different type of day.<p>Obviously, I&#x27;m going through a temporary crisis, so I cannot pursue this, but someone should.')
