If you don&#x27;t own&#x2F;maintain your entire deployment stack (right down to the bare-metal servers that your code is running on) you need to have some kind of plan for being able to migrate to a new vendor (whether because of a TOS violation or just the original vendor shuts down).<p>I don&#x27;t know the technical details of the Parlor setup, but depending on how integrated they were with the AWS ecosystem, (e.g. using Lambda executors instead of just running services on EC2) moving off of AWS could mean huge changes to their architecture....<p>That being said, even in the best case scenario this kind of migration would be very expensive (S3 data egress fees??) and a 24 hour timeline seems absurd!  Can anyone with experience in this area speak to if this kind of accelerated timeline is normal when it comes to web-hosting TOS violations? I just cannot imagine signing a contract with a hosting company that would allow them to unilaterally cancel my service with only 24 hours notice. (Admittedly, the NYT article references prior communication between Parlor and Amazon, so this is obviously not totally out-of-the-blue.  Still, 24 hours from the final decision to account-deactivation seems insane for an enterprise offering....<p>(To be clear, I am not trying to argue for or against Amazon&#x27;s decision to drop Parlor&#x27;s account. I am just shocked that their AWS contract allows such a limited migration window for something like a TOS violation.)')
