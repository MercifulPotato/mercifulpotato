But it&#x27;s equally unlikely, and too starry-eyed, the tech nerd version of the kind of dream the stereotypical bus-arriving Midwestern teenagers had of &quot;becoming famous in Los Angeles&quot;.<p>How about merely building a business? Think small indie developer or Basecamp at best, vs Facebook and Amazon.')
