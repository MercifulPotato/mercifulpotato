You have breadth at the top and then depth in one subject area.<p>I think the ideal balance probably varies from person to person.  Some people really enjoy going deep on a subject (these are the kinds of people who get PhD&#x27;s).  I personally can&#x27;t keep my interest on one thing for too long so I end up with a lot of breadth, but I make sure there are a few subjects I revisit a lot so that I manage to build some depth.')
