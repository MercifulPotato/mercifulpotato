I&#x27;m a die-hard Linux user and open source proponent. I wouldn&#x27;t touch the M1 with a thirty-nine and a half foot pole.<p>But with all that said... I kind of like articles like these. I enjoy seeing people happy with good tech because <i>I</i> like good tech. It pleases me that there are people getting this much enjoyment out of innovative and (I&#x27;ll admit it) quite impressive hardware. So rock on, Apple fans. But when there&#x27;s a Linux computer that is even a bit better, I hope you can tolerate me shouting from the rooftops, because you bet I will be!')
