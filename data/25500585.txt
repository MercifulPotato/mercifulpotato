They will make carOS, the UX that is built into other companies&#x27; cars.<p>Basically, they will build software, the steering wheel, the whole from dash, maybe even a backseat interface, and internal software (excluding hardware drivers), and standardize the UX across every automaker.<p>Kinda like what Android did for phones, but Apple will enforce stricter regulations for carOS.')
