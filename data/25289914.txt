Item(by='aeontech', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607010194, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25289774, text='&gt; What happens to these people when full equality is achieved?<p>Thank you, I needed a laugh this morning. Humans are going to be humans, and will always find ways to treat each other in inventively bad ways.<p>If you are trying to say that these positions should not exist... I disagree. The study of ethics and the profession is not a new thing or a &quot;cottage industry&quot;.<p>Of course people in these positions are sometimes going to attract outrage and cause conflict - if they didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d suspect they were just there to &quot;rubber stamp&quot; whatever the companies were doing - yep, all good here, sure, we&#x27;re doing x, y and z thing that people criticize us for, but our ethics committee says we&#x27;re all good, so you can all put down your pitchforks and go home now.<p>It&#x27;s their job to be a thorn in the side of authority. Sometimes it&#x27;s justified, sometimes not, there&#x27;s always room for interpretation and disagreement, some of these people are good at their jobs and some are not - but dismissing the entire thing as &quot;fake outrage to promote their jobs&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem right.')
