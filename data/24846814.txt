There are many advantages to encoding state changes in sql, but the database logic isn&#x27;t strictly tied to the specifics of the cart logic. However trying to decouple these domains fully will create many more problems. There&#x27;s plenty of fuzzy problems like this that interleave the technical and business.<p>I fail to see how ANY part of a project would fail to be of interest to a stakeholder. They don&#x27;t much care whether a failure emanated from code you have labeled of interest to them or not. You certainly can&#x27;t make much money without supporting the business logic with—apparently—non-business storage. Even if you can patch up the leaks in this semantic distinction between these two domains the use of such a distinction is not clear in any general sense.<p>These abstractions are to help the coder reason about complex systems and they don&#x27;t always work. You then need to invent better abstractions.')
