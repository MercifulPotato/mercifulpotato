It can be a little annoying if you have notification sound on your phone stealing the attention, but generally it works pretty well.<p>But again, simple multipoint support seems to be pretty rare. I think the newest WH-1000X M4 finally added it, the Microsoft Surface headphones also have really good ones, and that&#x27;s kinda it.<p>Some devices like Samsung instead use a fast switch, I think that&#x27;s what Apple is doing here too?')
