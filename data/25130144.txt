I don&#x27;t remember subversion being acting this unintuitively.<p>I always hear problems that someone couldn&#x27;t clone a repo as the repo got big and it&#x27;s only 2GB in size and random blogs tell you to run git config command to fix which isn&#x27;t even available on Windows if the user is only using a GUI tool and the other solution is to edit a .gitconfig file which Windows have problem handing files with dot at the beginning, commits creates a conflicting branch because I pushed before I pulled files I didn&#x27;t even touch, and push randomly fails on people but it works on a retry etc etc.<p>People just figured Linus&#x27; work is a magic bullet to everyone&#x27;s problem but I guess people jumped on it with no evaluation and we&#x27;re all bleeding from this.<p>We need a better tool than git.<p>I miss tools like bazaar when they mention their goal was being user friendly which is important.')
