Unless they are actively <i>helped</i>, taking away one trigger event at one point in their life is not the same as them being saved from suicide until age 95.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>also, suicide and other deaths of despair are far more socially costly</i>&quot;<p>and &#x2F;more fixable&#x2F;. Hopeless -&gt; suicide is a pattern that cognitive behavioural therapy can work on. It shouldn&#x27;t be the case that society has such poor mental health support that &quot;their life fell apart which lead to their suicide&quot; leads to this kind of life or death trade of &quot;who should die to prevent their life falling apart?&quot; instead of &quot;help with the mental health part so they can survive their life falling apart&quot;.')
