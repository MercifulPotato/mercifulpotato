I disputing the fact that it was done without consideration, reform, or reason.  There&#x27;s ample evidence that they heavily debated each part of the British government that they adopted.<p>The fact is, the founders remedy for a corrupt president was impeachment.  They made that perfectly clear.  Corruption included things like misusing the pardon power (High crimes&#x2F;Bribery).<p>What they didn&#x27;t anticipate was the fact that we&#x27;d end up with a 2 party system equally spitting the country where neither side would remove their president from office.  The put a LOT of faith in &quot;honor&quot; and the fact that the general electorate would punish dishonorable leaders.  They did not expect things like wedge issues.')
