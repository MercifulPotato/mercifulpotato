High school and even early twenties, we are still developing, and not everyone is going to develop to full adulthood by their early 20s. Anything that influences brain chemistry at that young age - be it drugs, hormones, etc. - is going to have lasting effect. I hope this leads to more studies about people who started later in life, say 30.')
