I would love to have no 3rd party cookies (or at least none from FB or Google) but every solution I can afford has built-in analytics and FB pixels. So far I have tried many &quot;buy buttons&quot; and wasted a lot of time experimenting with Gumroad and Payhip. Surely there is a system like Gumroad, that doesn&#x27;t force my customers to be tracked.\nAny help or suggestions would be appreciated,\nThanKs')
