I was assigned to room, say, 309, to a teacher whose name I didn&#x27;t recognize. But I knew the teacher in room 309, and she even taught physics. So, I approached her, and asked, &quot;I&#x27;ve been assigned &#x27;Ms. Stewart&#x27;, but it lists her as being in your room. Do you know what the correct room number is, Ms. Cook?&quot; Right room; it was her maiden name, of course.</i><p>I&#x27;m reasonably certain one of those two &#x27;Ms.&#x27; instances should be &#x27;Mrs.&#x27;.')
