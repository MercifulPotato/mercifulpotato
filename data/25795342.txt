It’s amazing how much victim blaming HN does on almost any topic.<p>Separately, IMO, previous girlfriends or friends, etc. won’t go out of their way to spit on someone’s grave. I think the exception is when someone finally feels safe to speak out that they were abused or if the person was a true POS.<p>Not sure why the default logic in this case is to automatically assume the exes are bad mouthing the deceased just because they can.
