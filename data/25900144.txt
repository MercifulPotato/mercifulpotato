More specifically, the key where Z would physically be on a Qwerty keyboard, regardless of what keyboard layout you have actually selected. Same goes for [R]eset.<p>Was almost surprised that a little web game gets this right when many native apps don&#x27;t. I just checked the last three Sokoban-likes I played (Stephen&#x27;s Sausage Roll, Baba Is You, A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build) and they all follow the currently active layout. Which admittedly is way better than the really annoying games that memorise the layout that&#x27;s selected when you launch them and have to be completely restarted if it wasn&#x27;t the one you wanted.')
