According to the lawsuit at some point they started declining buying back USDT, due to the lack of real dollars in their bank account. That&#x27;s clearly a fraud, since they were assuring their customers they have sufficient reserves.<p>Also, the reason they were at some point missing $850M was because that money was seized in various countries as coming from drug cartels. Seems like there&#x27;s a lot of rope to hang them with.')
