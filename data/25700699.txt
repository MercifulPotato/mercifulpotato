Civilians should be able to keep or carry a firearm without a license.<p>2. No civilian should be able to keep or carry a firearm.<p>In America licenses are not generally required to purchase handguns, rifles, or shotguns except in the more restrictive states. And each year more and more states are trending towards being able to carry without a permit as well.')
