It was done in secret because it was illegal. It was fixed by the government, no unions required. Nor could one have helped. A union would not have fixed that unless it had developed some mechanism to discover the conspiracy via other means than the ones the government used.<p>In fact to claim a union could have avoided this situation is backwards: unions <i>create</i> cross-firm wage fixing agreements as part of their core policy goals.<p><i>The facts are that white collar employees that are union members have higher pay[2]</i><p>Averaged across all industries, yes: because they engage in industry-wide wage fixing. That&#x27;s great if you can&#x27;t command a high rate yourself, sucks if you can as you&#x27;re chopped down to their level.<p>But we&#x27;re not talking about all industries, we&#x27;re talking about the tech industry. And if you compare the tech industry vs other industries, there are no unions (except this one) and there are high wages.')
