Item(by='meetups323', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610414195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25739403, text='&gt; Actions require consequences.<p>So what happens when dems launch a counteraction? Well that&#x27;s an action, it has &quot;action&quot; right in the name. And actions require consequences, so looks like reps are going to have to launch their own counteraction. And so on and so on for all eternity. That&#x27;s the ball game.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is we need someone in power to drop the ball and leave the stadium. Someone to say &quot;wrongs have been committed but fuck it -- its more important to the country for everyone to get back together than it is to strike back in revenge&quot;. And suddenly the reps have no more action enacted against them. And thus no more consequence is required to be enacted from their side.<p>The idea that we need a spectacle of constant political brawl to keep the public entertained doesn&#x27;t need to be true.<p>Thats my endgame. Whats yours?')
