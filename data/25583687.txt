Same thing with spinning up industrial capacity in a new area.<p>Also, IIRC, a lot of the tricky high tech in jet engine production isn&#x27;t so much in the engines themselves, but in the manufacturing process of the components and materials.  That means reverse engineering will only get you so far.')
