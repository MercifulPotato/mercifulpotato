The general argument is:<p>1) Depictions in popular media, even if people know they are unrealistic, become anchors for how we imagine certain cultures. Knowing the depiction is unrealistic does not help against this.<p>2) a song of ice and fire &#x2F; Game of Thrones are often praised for their realism. This makes the wholly unrealistic depictions here worse. Not only might this cause subconscious anchoring. It could also lead people to consciously conclude &quot;this might be how it was&quot;.\nIf not, this presumption of realism might lead to less critical reading.')
