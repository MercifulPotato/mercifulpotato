The construction feature was really novel and I used it too as a kid, but it doesn&#x27;t really exist as a &quot;game design&quot; - it&#x27;s software first, kind of like flight simulators. Early flight sims aren&#x27;t very well remembered, although they can have a retro  aesthetic appeal. [0]<p>Lode Runner, on the other hand, is still Lode Runner in all its forms. It isn&#x27;t a simulation of anything - the game pieces have a concrete, Chess-like logic to them. It&#x27;s hard to improve upon just by adding &quot;stuff&quot; as the 1994 version did. And the game is easy enough to clone that many people, myself included, played people&#x27;s clones of it.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;BEkDRa--YaY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;BEkDRa--YaY</a>')
