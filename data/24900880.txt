There&#x27;s a lot more physical evidence behind the Hunter Biden Laptop Story (and its censorship) than there was behind, oh I don&#x27;t know, the impeachment of the President last January.<p>I must assume you have personal possession of exculpatory physical evidence. Please share your physical evidence that discredits the physical evidence you don&#x27;t like unearthed by the New York Post<p>Please downvote me if you have no evidence it was faked or know there&#x27;s no evidence or want to see the NY Post story discredited because Trump should be replaced at any cost.<p>Also note: other news publications, like the Washington Post, claiming that the hard drive data is &quot;not verified&quot; without any evidence beyond their own reputation, which itself is long since forfeit, is not evidence.')
