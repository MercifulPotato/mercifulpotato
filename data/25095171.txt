I&#x27;ve been to Taiwan twice, and I&#x27;d much prefer to use an old chip a while longer than for this lovely, open nation to be invaded by a totalitarian regime. There is only a few things preventing an invasion, mainly that the US would like to keep this &quot;unsinkable carrier&quot;, and TSMC. As Xinjiang shows, only international pain will do to make the world react to China&#x27;s actions, and TSMC might be able to cause that.')
