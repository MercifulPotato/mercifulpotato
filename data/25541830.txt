The point is there is no way to positively identify all basic block entry points on x86 (especially due to its variable-length instructions). That means that there is always the possibility that the AoT didn&#x27;t catch everything, and then your plug-in takes a novel uncached codepath at some point, the JIT fires, and you get a real-time constraint violation and a drop out.<p>Also, audio companies sometimes like to use &quot;fun&quot; DRM&#x2F;copy protection systems.<p>Besides, audio apps themselves doing JIT would not be unheard of. For example, that&#x27;d be a very efficient way of implementing a modular synth. Those apps could JIT in a realtime-safe way; Rosetta can&#x27;t (it doesn&#x27;t have enough info).')
