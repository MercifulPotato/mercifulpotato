Item(by='lambda_obrien', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607886228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25406467, text='I like Haskell because of the reasons here already said: it&#x27;s more like math, so it&#x27;s easy to reason about, and it&#x27;s got a lot of cool features that make programming in higher levels of abstraction easy. The downsides are that the tooling is hard to learn at first and it&#x27;s hard to understand and reason about the compiler because it&#x27;s so advanced, so you really have to know Haskell well in order to create the most efficient programs. I think strict types and functional style is the future of software, since it&#x27;s designed for abstractions and today&#x27;s software is all about abstractions. Security wise, a strict type system with type driven development can be great, limiting the user while giving greater freedoms overall.')
