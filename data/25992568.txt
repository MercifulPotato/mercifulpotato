Your employer likely shares important details about your employment, including your title, job duration, and wages, with third party credit agencies to fulfill these requests. Unfortunately, this process is not transparent for employees and can be slow and error-prone for employers and verifiers.<p>Truework is building a modern, consent-driven employment and income verification platform to give employees visibility and control into how their employment information is shared with others. We are growing quickly and currently handle thousands of verifications every month, which has enabled the approval of billions of dollars in loans and helps employees in regulated professions (e.g. nursing) start work more quickly than before.\nOur engineering team is still small, which means you’ll play big a part in shaping the future of Truework, and your work will have a significant impact and visibility. We leverage Django and React (Typescript), our infrastructure runs on AWS.
