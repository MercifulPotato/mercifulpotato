I&#x27;ve followed this as well, and through much more authoritative sources, but in this case your own example was the direct cite. You said &quot;the photo from Germany&quot; which must refer to the one there captioned &quot;Starlink in TÃ¼bingen, Germany&quot;. But that photo clearly depicts a deployment train, <i>not</i> Starlink satellites fully deployed. Because they don&#x27;t line up in a train like that in final operational status. That trains might be visible in photographs for a few weeks out of a 5 year lifetime is a very different argument. The caption also does not state what generation they were.<p>&gt;<i>the surfaces of these satellites are often made of highly reflective metal</i><p>Which is generic hogwash. We&#x27;re not talking about &quot;surfaces often made of&quot; we&#x27;re talking about <i>Starlink</i>, specifically. Which, as again <i>your own link</i> states:<p>&gt;&quot;More recent satellites have visors to block sunlight from reflecting from parts of the satellite to reduce its albedo further.&quot;<p>Operational satellites won&#x27;t be in a train, will be oriented in ways that reduce reflections, and they&#x27;re actively working on measures to further mitigate albedo. And a core aspect of Starlink is that they have a rapid lifecycle. The impact will probably not be zero, but that must be weighed against the benefits. And the benefits are huge.<p>&gt;<i>But sure, you call me an &quot;entitled and dismissive urbanite&quot;.</i><p>I will indeed, because that is how you are acting. Your &quot;Where do you live? In most of Europe and SE Asia you can get gigabit broadband&quot; is flat out INSULTING. I (nor SpaceX for that matter) do not in fact live in Europe or SE Asia (and of course you&#x27;re implying those outside &quot;most of&quot; are unimportant even there but whatever). I live in America near the Canadian border. I&#x27;ve been fortunate to have 5&#x2F;1 ADSL from 2000 up until a few years ago with an ISP who were at least local and nice and only charged $45&#x2F;month for it. Just 40 miles away I know people paying $270&#x2F;month for 10 megabit service. Others have dial-up or horrible GEO sat internet options or nothing. Many friends in Canada are in the same boat, and that&#x27;s in the developed part! Take a look at the official Canadian Government National Broadband Internet Service Availability Map:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ic.gc.ca&#x2F;app&#x2F;sitt&#x2F;bbmap&#x2F;hm.html?lang=eng" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ic.gc.ca&#x2F;app&#x2F;sitt&#x2F;bbmap&#x2F;hm.html?lang=eng</a><p>Take some time to go through a few of the layers if you like, but maybe for an initial gut check go to &quot;Aggregated Presentation&quot; and take a look just at &quot;5&#x2F;1&quot; coverage. And then look at all the empty spots. You can live within 20 miles of the <i>national capital</i> and not even be able to be certain of 5&#x2F;1 internet. America is in a similar boat, though without as reliable data because the FCC coverage maps are ludicrously generous to industry right now (if even a single household in an entire census block has broadband, the census block is &quot;covered&quot; yet even then massive numbers aren&#x27;t).<p>Frankly, even if it really did come down to your subjective feelings about &quot;the night sky&quot; versus decent broadband options for the entire planet? Well you lose. I personally don&#x27;t think it will be that bad long term, because nobody wants it to be zero sum. There will be continued improvements in lowering albedo, and Starship&#x27;s massive reduction in space access costs will allow vast new space-based telescope efforts. Heck, we might even ultimately actually get fiber and&#x2F;or decent WISPs all over the planet, and thus be able to reduce constellations to just what is needed for marine&#x2F;air.<p>But the biggest &quot;light pollution&quot; sources for most of the public are ground lights, and astronomers are going to have to accept some compromises for a while because universal broadband is really genuinely important.')
