Superchargers use a specific protocol to communicate with the car for purposes of billing -- tied to the Tesla account associated with the car. I don&#x27;t think the plug itself is different than a normal Tesla plug (other than being beefier, perhaps?) but I could be wrong.<p>For normal Tesla wall chargers, like one that might be installed at someone&#x27;s house, I think there are adapters that might work for the Leaf, but I have no experience with them.<p>That said, other than Tesla, I think there <i>is</i> standardization. Especially with Electrify America. But, Tesla&#x27;s network is so convenient and widespread that it is currently a big selling point for the brand, in my opinion.')
