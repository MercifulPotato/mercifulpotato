I agree odds would be slim, but this can potentially set a precedent for others to do similar things. Imagine, in the future, a new company comes up with similar add-in claiming to scan ads, and take more data than needed. Facebook needs to be careful of that too. (though i think that is not the reason they are shutting this down, just that privacy is favorable to them in this case :)). There has to be a better way to do this, and that needs serious discussion.<p>Also, as an aside, the add-in records the following things: country, age, gender, language etc. and the text of the ad. Not so clear what happens when ads have personal info (or friends&#x27; names) attached like xyz likes page. Payload seems to suggest they take every bit of info so it could include that as well maybe.')
