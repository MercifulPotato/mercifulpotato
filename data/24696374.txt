Note that each person is only counted once regardless of repeat tests. This means that where someone tests positive after receiving a negative test result on a previous day, they would be counted in the new positive cases for that day but in the number of people newly tested on the day they first received a test result.&quot;<p>So if I were tested in August as I had a cough, and it came back negative, but now I have a temperature, and test positive, I wouldn&#x27;t count as a newly tested person.<p>The 697 new cases would include my number, but the 5445 newly tested people wouldn&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s very possible for new cases to outnumber newly tested people, so dividing one number by another makes no sense at all.<p>It&#x27;s concerning that the Scotish government are linking these two numbers.')
