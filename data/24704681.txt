Google and other high-paying tech companies have been lobbying for this change for years. There are only 85k&#x2F;year slots for H1B visas and they are awarded by lottery. High-paying tech companies generally have a high hiring bar and don’t find all that many candidates, so they don’t submit all that many applications to the lottery, and as a result their candidates get swamped out by the hordes of applications from body shops like Tata. This change will drive a lot of applications from low-paying companies out of the pool, and high-paying companies will be able to hire a larger share of the candidates they submit applications for each year.')
