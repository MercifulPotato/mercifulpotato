Clippy runs it&#x27;s lints in an early pass of the compiler&#x2F;checker. Many IDEs&#x2F;editors will automatically `cargo check` under the hood to grab errors. Then when you run `cargo clippy`, that part of the compilation is already cached and so clippy doesn&#x27;t give you any output :(<p>To my knowledge (it&#x27;s been a while since I looked) fixing this behavior is blocked on cargo stabilizing something and has been for literal years.<p>That point of frustration aside, it&#x27;s worth it...Clippy is an absolutely amazing piece of software. Both for pedagogy and normal development.<p>EDIT: Just dug up the issue.  If you&#x27;re on nightly you can use `cargo clippy -Z unstable-options` to avoid the clean&#x2F;rebuild. Hopefully stuff gets stabilized soon.
