Nothing fancy needed, can get decent framerate on SPI bus running at 16 MHz. Anything above this range gets super ugly: no good displays exist and if they do, they&#x27;re expensive or outdated (800x480 resolution is basically impossible to obtain). Furthermore, driving this display requires crazy shit like multiple SPI channels (QSPI), or some neutered version of DSI protocol...impossible to find docs for and if they have docs, theyre in Chinese.<p>Then there are ultra high resolution displays, for e.g. cell phone market or laptop screens. You&#x27;re now looking an entirely different beast. MIPI&#x2F;DSI hardware support is required and a bunch of NDAs, need dedicated GPU and a proper linux running.<p>Ideal display tech would be 5&quot;inch diagonal, OLED (low power consumption), 800x480 (or similar) and can be run using ARM Cortex-M4 or similar microcontroler arch. That would open up opportunities for so many device categories that doesn&#x27;t exist today. Imagine a VT100 terminal clone running on 8&quot; 1024x768 resolution screen with a cheap ESP32 + display driver chip. Or a slightly more beefy Cortex-M7 running zephyr&#x2F;linux. So many things we could build.')
