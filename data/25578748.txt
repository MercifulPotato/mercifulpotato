Both sides have their views on that claim emerge from their underlying worldviews around how racism, discrimination, gender stereotypes, and things inject themselves into human interactions and what levers exist for affecting those influences.<p>My use of &#x27;sects&#x27; in this example was a bit of a misnomer, I consider the situation going on here to just be a conflict that&#x27;s emerging due to these divergent worldviews that is localized around a specific community and domain, and the rift is cast in stark relief when situations like this finally manifest.')
