That way, software publishers can check an append-only independently-run log to see what has been signed with their keys.<p>I suppose there is a risk that an attacker could prevent users from receiving security updates by DoS&#x27;ing the transparency logs, but that should be harder than just DoS&#x27;ing the servers that host the software updates themselves.  Large organisations could also maintain mirrors of these logs on their internal networks, which would help with privacy&#x2F;latency&#x2F;availability, and the logs should ideally be available as Tor hidden services too.<p>For non-critical updates, the log checking routine should require that the update&#x27;s hash had been in the log for a certain period of time, long enough for the software publisher to notice and raise the alarm to their users.  Updates marked as critical should default to stopping the software from running until the necessary period had elapsed, for which the workaround would be a fresh install of the newer version by whomever has the admin privileges to do that.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mozilla.org&#x2F;Security&#x2F;Binary_Transparency" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mozilla.org&#x2F;Security&#x2F;Binary_Transparency</a>')
