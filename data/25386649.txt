Item(by='jan_Inkepa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607699731, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25385286, text='It doesn&#x27;t have to be related to his philosophical output to be interesting, and we don&#x27;t have to reduce Wittgenstein to his philosophical output (though this blurb in the exhibit tries to relate it to his philosophy, it doesn&#x27;t specify details of what the effect of his teaching experience on it was).<p>I do find it interesting to see the contents of an old dictionary designed to be relevant to children in rural Austria transposed to a modern American setting, though I don&#x27;t know how much that&#x27;s played up.  The dictionary IIRC contained a lot of dialect words also (though other than Eichk√§tzchen I didn&#x27;t see so many in the photographs).  I also kinda like the drawings.  I think this direction would&#x27;ve been better than trying to relate it to his philosophical output, but ah well.<p>Another missed opportunity seemingly absent from the art is that he was not the world&#x27;s kindest teacher: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Haidbauer_incident" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Haidbauer_incident</a><p>&gt; The Haidbauer incident, known in Austria as Der Vorfall Haidbauer, took place in April 1926 when Josef Haidbauer, an 11-year-old schoolboy in Otterthal, Austria, reportedly collapsed unconscious after being hit on the head during class by the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.[1]<p>I guess the more I think about it the more I come around to your assessment that the engagement isn&#x27;t so deep as it could be...<p>(Though, all that said, I do actually kinda like the drawings!)')
