The state steps in when there is abuse or neglect - do you oppose &quot;breaking up families&quot; even then, or do you concede that sometimes it&#x27;s the right call?<p>Is it not <i>possible</i> that in the context of immigration there can also be situations where it needs to happen? (e.g. communal housing could put children in the vicinity of harmful people, or fake families with human traffickers posing as parents)')
