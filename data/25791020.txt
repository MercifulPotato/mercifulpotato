That&#x27;s still true today, and it will likely be true in ten years as well.  Unless we reach a point where that changes (and most software can fit its restricted paradigm), we should compare apples to apples.  If we were talking solely about GPU performance, I would be more inclined to agree with claims about &quot;80x more processing power than 10 years ago&quot; etc, though.')
