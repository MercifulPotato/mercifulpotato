It&#x27;s the only time I CAN have a power nap, but it works wonders.<p>I fully 100% support the general notion expressed here that if we find outselves in a risky position as a driver, we  should do <i>something</i> to mitigate that risk. I don&#x27;t think &quot;don&#x27;t drive&quot; is always in every circumstance a achievable recourse though, so a power nap can mitigate risk significantly.')
