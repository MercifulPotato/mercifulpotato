Building new housing, no matter how large, would be a losing proposition, as you&#x27;d have to pay for the land, which is expensive, and building lots of apartments would increase the supply, reducing the value of your land and building.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in a european city without rent control and mostly even without zoning laws (less than 20% of kiel are affected by Bebaungspl√§nen) and yet rent was even higher and supply even lower. Hundreds of hotels, lots of luxury apartments, but for the average citizen, nothing got built.<p>Capitalism doesn&#x27;t optimize for producing the most supply, it optimizes for increasing the value of your assets. And if the best way to do so is by artificially limiting the supply, that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s gonna happen.')
