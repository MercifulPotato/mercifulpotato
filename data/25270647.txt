Have some respect for the man who invented Garbage Collection!<p>But more importantly, do you think a lot of uranium has disappeared in the last 13 years?  Has the use of uranium increased by an order of magnitude in the last 13 years?  Have we forgotten how to extract uranium from low grade ore in the last 13 years?  No?!  Then how the hell is the age of this web site (13 years) or Bernard Cohen&#x27;s book (35 years) even relevant?<p>&gt; My comment referred to commercial viability.<p>Don&#x27;t move the goal posts!  You specifically wrote &quot;Uranium is finite&quot;, and the counter point is that it is <i>practically infinite</i>.  As McCarthy points out, this doesn&#x27;t even depend on seawater extraction, because low grade uranium ores (phosphate ores, later Conway granites) are plentiful.')
