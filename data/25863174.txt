I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s part of what&#x27;s happening here.<p>so, the new old guys are brought in at market and higher  - otherwise how you&#x27;d bring them in? - ie. it sounds like at the scale of at least 3x+ of the current engineering comp at Intel. Lets see how that would sit the the current engineers at Intel. I don&#x27;t think it would result in high collaboration and team cohesion.<p>Also Intel issue seems to be process node, not the &quot;architecture&quot; per.se., and one can wonder how several years gap may affect one&#x27;s utility at solving intricate issues of current node.<p>Anyway, fab to fabless is a classic paradigm shift , and Intel just fails to grasp it and to adapt.')
