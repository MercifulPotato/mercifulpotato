I really, really do. I see the value in Emacs Lisp vs. vimscript immediately, though I feel that Lua in neovim is making up ground there.<p>I&#x27;ve tried evil-mode a few times over the years. Most recently I tried Doom Emacs twice. I _really_ want to experience the hype of org-mode. I want something like org-mode in my life. I am a heavy notes taker and I can see the value org-mode offers and I am willing to make the jump for it alone... But, I can&#x27;t figure out how to get a proper workflow in Emacs that gets me to where I am in vim today. I just can&#x27;t get it to click.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve been using vi(m) since the early&#x2F;mid 2000s and my workflow is almost entirely terminal based for almost everything that I have ever done as a professional and hobbyist programmer. To the point that I feel like I cannot be <i>as</i> productive in ecosystems that are GUI based.')
