Medical workers do not make up large percentage of COVID-19 deaths, less than 1% in the US. I don&#x27;t know what the numbers are for other types of essential workers, but I doubt it&#x27;s a lot different, since the majority of deaths fall largely on people 55+ years old.<p>Another factor that should be accounted for, but I&#x27;ve not seen in any official policy, is the people who&#x27;ve contracted the virus and recovered. While there is research showing that the human immune response to SARS-COV-2 may persist for years[0], even if that&#x27;s not true we do know that it lasts for 6+ months as shown by the small amount of confirmed reinfections[1]. So put those people at the end of the line.<p>We really should write down the objective and then work out the way to achieve that objective. If the objective is to preserve the maximum amount of life years, then the criteria should heavily bias toward people older 55+ and people with comorbidities. Being a front line health care worker is very honorable and should carry a lot of respect, but it may not be the truly relevant criteria for maximizing the preservation of life.<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bgr.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;18&#x2F;coronavirus-immunity-years-antibodies-b-t-cells-la-jolla&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bgr.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;18&#x2F;coronavirus-immunity-years-antibo...</a>  \n1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;joshuacohen&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;though-rare-the-number-of-reinfections-with-covid-19-is-growing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;joshuacohen&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;though-r...</a>')
