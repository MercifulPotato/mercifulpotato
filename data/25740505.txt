Item(by='xoa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610411312, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25740120, text='&gt;<i>The GDPR absolutely does apply outside of Europe.</i><p>No, it doesn&#x27;t, as you yourself admit two sentences later when you write:<p>&gt;<i>You&#x27;re pointing out that they may not be able to enforce the law against an entity that does not operate in the EU.</i><p>Yes, which by definition means the law does not apply to that person to entity. That is the fundamental nature of law and sovereignty.<p>&gt;<i>The law itself says so.</i><p>Completely irrelevant, in the same way it&#x27;s irrelevant if you or I order some societal change on our say so. Law is about power. And again, also in the exact same way that it&#x27;s completely irrelevant if Pakistan or whomever have blasphemy laws on the books they say apply to everyone, China laws against &quot;disrupting society&quot; or someone sues a US entity under the UK&#x27;s very plaintiff friendly libel laws. They can all be told to pound sand.<p>&gt;<i>But even if a company doesn&#x27;t operate in the EU today, it may want to in the future. Or it may want to be acquired by a company that does. The future is unknowable, so I&#x27;d imagine they were advised to follow the law, even if there would be no immediate consequences to breaking it.</i><p>Sure, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the law &quot;applies&quot;. A company can voluntarily take whatever actions it wishes that it believes may benefit it in the future, but a core point of <i>law</i> is that it&#x27;s <i>INvoluntary</i>. Since the GDPR doesn&#x27;t apply to anyone outside of EU jurisdiction (or under treaties giving it local effect), they may choose to run it because they think it&#x27;s a good idea, or not. Those within EU jurisdiction do not get that choice.')
