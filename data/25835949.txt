Item(by='slg', descendants=None, kids=[25837078], score=None, time=1611077331, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835350, text='&gt;Over the summer, some were waxing poetic about how &quot;riots are the language of the oppressed&quot; and arguing that burning someone&#x27;s business to the ground isn&#x27;t violence but rather &quot;just property damage&quot;.<p>When you put violence against property and literal murder on the same moral footing you are being an apologist for more severe violence.  Property can be replaced.  Businesses can have insurance.  The murdered police officer and the 4 other dead people aren&#x27;t coming back.<p>People really need to stop equating BLM with what happened on 1&#x2F;6.  Not all violence is created equal.  1&#x2F;6 was much more egregious.')
