He did very well and stayed cool.<p>Myself, I don&#x27;t think I handle the heat very well.  In executive reviews, I never quite understand what VPs are asking, because the way they phrase questions is always kind of flawed and it makes me think of 5 ways to answer based on 5 possible interpretations of their question, and invariably (<i>every time!</i>) I start answering and then am asked to stop because that&#x27;s not what they asked.  I also get pretty stressed&#x2F;nervous before big exec reviews (it just always feels like an exposition of any personal failure), and my brain has seized once or twice.  I supposed I&#x27;m not cut out for being in the line of fire.  So much for my dreams of being CEO of a mega- tech company! :-)<p>Maybe goes without saying that I&#x27;m envious of my peers who can waltz into the fiercest review and not flinch while they state their case.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear from others on this.')
