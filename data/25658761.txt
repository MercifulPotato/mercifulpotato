More and more, people focus on the ways that things aren&#x27;t their fault or focus on things that they can&#x27;t change. It&#x27;s to a point where IMO people are basically treating themselves and each other as children, with the tired old mantras that children often use: it&#x27;s not my fault, they started it, everyone else is doing it too, etc. It doesn&#x27;t matter too much to me. I&#x27;ve always focused on the ways I can improve myself and my life without worrying too much about how things could have been better if XYZ. But I do think the people who participate in this aspect of infantilization culture may be holding themselves without even realizing it.')
