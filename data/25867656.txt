I put in the work mostly before my day job every day. And on weekends. It was successful from a usage standpoint. Tens of thousands of people used Graphite. And for a period of time, it was successful from a revenue standpoint. I was getting about $20k per month in grant money from the protocol Graphite was built on.<p>I’m hoping to recapture that with my new side project, Perligo. I haven’t launched yet, so we’ll see how it goes. But my main advice would be start small. Small things don’t take a ton of time. Graphite was super small at first. Grow as your time allows.')
