If it is, then try and get a different IP address.<p>I spun up a hosted server on Digital Ocean and received an IP address. I checked several black lists from a few email testing&#x2F;troubleshooting sites [0] and [1] and all was groovy; my IP address wasn&#x27;t on any list.<p>I got a bunch of 521 bounces when I tried emailing a neighbor who had an att.net address.<p>So, I checked the troubleshooting websites, and my IP address was listed as clean.<p>My logs said I should forward the error to abuse_rbl@abuse-att.net, so I did.<p>Those emails were never delivered, because abuse-att.net had its own blacklist. I was getting 553 errors. In the logs, the message from their server told me to check <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipcheck.proofpoint.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipcheck.proofpoint.com</a>.<p>Proof point runs their own blacklist that some enterprises use (e.g. att and apple [3]). I checked their list, and lo and behold, my IP address from Digital Ocean was blocked [2]. Digital Ocean wasn&#x27;t able to remove the IP address from their blocklist and suggested I spin up a new droplet with a different IP address.<p>I didn&#x27;t want to do that, so I sent Proof Point an email that went unanswered; the email asked them to remove my IP address. I forgot about the issue for five or six months (this is a personal server), and ran into the issue again a few months ago. So I sent Proof Point an email again, this time with different wording emphasizing that &quot;my clients&quot; were having delivery issues. Within a day, they removed my IP address from their block list.<p>So, my main suggestion is to check if your IP address is on any of the blacklists as well as Proof Point&#x27;s list <i>before</i> you start on your server. If it is, then try and get a different IP address.<p>Does anyone have more &quot;enterprise&quot; lists, like Proof Point, to check?<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mail-tester.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mail-tester.com&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mxtoolbox.com&#x2F;blacklists.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mxtoolbox.com&#x2F;blacklists.aspx</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipcheck.proofpoint.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipcheck.proofpoint.com</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;email&#x2F;comments&#x2F;6toxzr&#x2F;ip_blocked_by_proofpoint&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;email&#x2F;comments&#x2F;6toxzr&#x2F;ip_blocked_by...</a>')
