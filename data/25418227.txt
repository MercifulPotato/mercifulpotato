Obviously, if you can afford to, many people will be better off in the long term having it paid off, but going from making $4,208 a month at a $49,500 salary, then getting a small raise to $50,000 and making $3,493&#x2F;month is not something a lot of people can afford.  Especially when you consider how that $715&#x2F;month you&#x27;re losing by bumping your income could be going to debt that won&#x27;t expire if you just wait out the 5 years under that cap.  This is especially true if you&#x27;ve had a few years under $50,000 before even having the chance to edge up over $50k.  It can very much be in your financial interest to not take a raise, if offered.')
