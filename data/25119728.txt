IME it&#x27;s all fine to run all these on low-resource single instance in practice, it&#x27;s just the target audience for the &quot;minimum configuration&quot; isn&#x27;t really your homelab tinkerer or even SMB&#x2F;small start-up. Consider that Hashicorp&#x27;s revenue streams are consulting, enterprise licenses and, since recently, hosted PaaS. If a penny-pinching user comes with replication issues because of resource contention they can just point to those docs. RedHat does the same thing for minimum recommendations for a lot of linux software that in practice will work perfectly fine on much smaller machines.<p>Your single host mode DO box is most likely perfectly fine. You just won&#x27;t have the availability benefits during downtime of that instance but, well, duh.<p>I guess the one practical catch is that if you feel strongly about security and noise neighbor issues, you really should at least separate out Consul Server&#x2F;Vault Server&#x2F;Nomad Server into separate machines.<p>Just whatever you do, make sure to run an odd number of servers (1 is better than 2, 3 is better than 4), or you may run into split-brain grief. Clients are fine to scale as you see fit as they don&#x27;t partake in raft consensus. So you can have a single instance &quot;client&#x2F;server&quot;, but if you add just a single new instance to schedule jobs on, make it&#x27;s a pure client.<p>I have a dozen Nomad clients and about 20 jobs at home. My active Nomad leader is yet to use over 300 MiB RAM, 10% CPU or 0.2 load on RPi-equivalents, even during leader rotation and restarts. It&#x27;s only when you start to have very high throughput of evaluations and allocations and start to put pressure on raft that you may need to increase your raft_multiplier to make it more relaxed with timeouts.<p>Tl;dr take the minimum configuration advice with a heap of salt.')
