May have been a hardware issue with the card. This was on a Windows system which previously had an Nvidia card which anecdotally seemed to cause issues, though I did run Display Driver Uninstaller in safe mode, etc. That being said it&#x27;s hard to tell how many people actually had issues given how vocal people are when they do. I&#x27;d expect the vast majority of people had no issues.<p>Also the previous generation RX 580 cards were very stable.')
