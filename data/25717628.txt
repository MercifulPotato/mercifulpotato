I would also add that variation of the physical constants over the span of a few decades is not very likely in the grand scheme of the universe.<p>It’s the same reason that nothing in your life materially changed when we switched the definition of the kilogram last year, unless you are a metrologist ;). The variations being discussed here have to fundamentally be below our current measurement uncertainties and our current measurement uncertainties are very very small.')
