For example:<p>1. All the other rich countries have steadily increased health expenditure per capita, and for some reason this really accelerated in the US around the early &#x27;80s. But the money looks like it mostly went to things that didn&#x27;t increase life expectancy. Maybe this was a Reagan thing?<p>2. The US had the highest cigarette sales until the mid &#x27;70s, but is now one of the lowest per capita. This is actually one of the things that the US has done better than its counterparts, e.g. Japan and Germany have higher cigarette sales per capita. However the death rate from smoking remains the highest, probably due to a combination of other factors such as poor healthcare.<p>3. Around the late &#x27;90s, the US really started to pull away from the rest of the rich countries in terms of death rate from opioid overdoses. Some of this spilled over into Canada, but they were able to keep it somewhat under control.<p>4. For deaths from both obesity and road accidents, the US just hasn&#x27;t made the same sort of gains as the others since 1990.')
