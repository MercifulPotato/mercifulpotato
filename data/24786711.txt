I miss it greatly, but also, it was the wild west, which was awesome when I was essentially living in the woods secluded from the outside world. The freedom was intoxicating. It ended up shaping my entire life.<p>I&#x27;ve watched the Internet grow and evolve into what it is and spent the majority of my free time participating in it from 1993 until today and probably until I die.<p>The thing is, the problem has always existed but its now being scaled up. There were kids pretending to be adults and puffing up their chests at the expense of decency. There was child porn. There were racists. There were pockets of criminals. There weren&#x27;t many flat out idiots because using the Internet required at least a mononom of intellect to participate.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s still early for the Internet, but America is just getting dumber while the Internet is getting easier and easier to use. How does it get better before it gets much worse?')
