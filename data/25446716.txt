Item(by='sradman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608144806, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25444303, text='The following *PCR Vs Rapid Antigen&quot; 7min YouTube video [1] is the best summary of the Michael Mina $Dollar-a-Day-Lick-a-Stick strategy that I&#x27;ve come across.<p>I find it fascinating how this seemingly simple idea has been received. We have this $30 test that wraps the paper strip antigen test in a disposable digital device that communicates via Bluetooth to a smartphone app, a $5 Abbott BinaxNOW [2] that wraps the paper strip in a folding card with a QR code that requires a technician, and the home Lucira test [3] that requires a prescription and a doctor to remotely monitor its application. We seem to be regulating for the lowest common denominator: those unable to follow a set of relatively complex instructions. I understand that the outcomes are more critical than furniture from Ikea or a cake recipe but still.<p>There is a market for things like digital pregnancy tests because they reduce the ambiguity and user errors but it also seems unfair to prevent availability for simpler tools for people who are capable of following instructions.<p>It seems to come down to marketing (messaging, packaging, and positioning). The Lick-a-Stick is not &quot;a&quot; test but a &quot;test regiment&quot; analogous to say a regiment of antibiotics. A positive test should be confirmed with second rapid antigen test and then an official PCR test if possible (or serum antibody tests after recovery). I think we should also refer to the paper antigen tests as &quot;non amplified&quot; compared to RT-PCR and RT-LAMP. The word &quot;rapid&quot; can apply to both styles and confuses the matter. Non amplified tests require active viral loads which is a feature not a bug (no pun intended).<p>I think there is also a technical aspect. There should be standardized samples that can be used to certify the operating range of any test. Compared to the allies response in WWII, the Western world seems to have lost the ability to 1. identify problems, and 2. attempt to solve the problem. I thought that C.P. Snow&#x27;s Two-Cultures [4] was behind us but now I&#x27;m not so sure.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;jqdvawSUmlA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;jqdvawSUmlA</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abbott.mediaroom.com&#x2F;2020-08-26-Abbotts-Fast-5-15-Minute-Easy-to-Use-COVID-19-Antigen-Test-Receives-FDA-Emergency-Use-Authorization-Mobile-App-Displays-Test-Results-to-Help-Our-Return-to-Daily-Life-Ramping-Production-to-50-Million-Tests-a-Month" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abbott.mediaroom.com&#x2F;2020-08-26-Abbotts-Fast-5-15-Mi...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lucirahealth.com&#x2F;#the-test-kit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lucirahealth.com&#x2F;#the-test-kit</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Two_Cultures" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Two_Cultures</a>')
