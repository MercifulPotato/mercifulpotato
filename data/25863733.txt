Further, margins are CRAZY THIN - meaning maintaining profitability is really difficult in an environment of increasing competition from Uber &#x2F; Google, among others. (Ex: Uber bought Postmates, as the latter had similar margin difficulties.)<p>My read is that this type of move was planned as an option for Instacart for a while, and Prop 22 maybe pushed up the timeline slightly.<p>EDIT: not sure why I&#x27;m getting downvoted. I know the article tries to build this narrative as much as possible (without even mentioning Prop 22) but then doesn&#x27;t even provide the financial details that show that Instacart has really tight margins - and if they&#x27;re trying to IPO, at this rate they&#x27;re going to stumble there.')
