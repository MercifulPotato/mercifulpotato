Most water used by an industrial society is used in agriculture</i><p>Oh that&#x27;s a good point. So for comparison, a ton of wheat takes about 1300 cubic meters of water, so 8x the water per ton as lithium. That wheat sells for about $200, so lithium is using orders of magnitude less water per dollar of revenue. This comparison makes lithium mining look even more environmentally friendly than comparing it to urban use does. Of course these are all estimates based on brief internet research so the true numbers could be different.<p>I couldn&#x27;t figure out from Google where exactly the CO2 emissions from lithium mining comes from - that sort of thing would have been great for the actual professional article to provide.')
