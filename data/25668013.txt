WhatsApp is now part of the Facebook family of companies. Our Privacy Policy explains how we work together to improve our services and offerings, like fighting spam across apps, making product suggestions, and showing relevant offers and ads on Facebook. Nothing you share on WhatsApp, including your messages, photos, and account information, will be shared onto Facebook or any of our other family of apps for others to see, and nothing you post on those apps will be shared on WhatsApp for others to see.<p>This is hypocrisy!!<p>Edit: The word &quot;onto&quot; in the privacy policy is so dubious. They said we aren&#x27;t sharing anything onto Facebook. Probably it didn&#x27;t mean they weren&#x27;t snooping our data.')
