Seems like this isnâ€™t just an American deficiency? true elsewhere too re the cost?<p>In the past 3 months, 5 people (all women..only one American) have informed me that they take intra muscular shots of iron. Two of them as often as once a month.<p>It seems really odd.<p>Also..worthy for the annals of what-the-fuckery : [..] The hospital initially had billed more than $14,000 per vial of Injectafer. Since her treatment was in network, Rothenberg&#x27;s insurance plan negotiated a much cheaper rate: about $1,600 per vial. She received two vials. Insurance paid a portion, but Rothenberg still owed the hospital $2,733, based on what was still unpaid in her family&#x27;s $9,000 deductible.[..]<p>[..] Doctors are supposed to recommend infusions only if patients don&#x27;t respond to iron pills or dietary changes, Pollock says. Instead of steering patients toward &quot;unnecessarily costly&quot; infusions, physicians should determine the underlying cause of low iron and treat that directly.<p>Injectafer, which Rothenberg received, is one of the most expensive infusions, retailing for more than $1,000 a vial. And, as Rothenberg learned the hard way, hospitals can charge privately insured patients whatever they choose. Insurers then negotiate that hospital &quot;list price&quot; down.<p>An analysis of private insurance claims conducted by the Health Care Cost Institute, an independent research group funded by insurers, found that in 2017, private health plans paid $4,316 per visit, on average, if a patient received Injectafer infusions. Feraheme, the next most expensive infusion drug, cost private plans $3,087 per visit, while the other three on the market were considerably cheaper. Infed was $1,502, Venofer $825 and Ferrlecit $412, the institute found, in an analysis for Kaiser Health News.[..]')
