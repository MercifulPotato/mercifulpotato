You are still oversimplifying the issue. In reality, both options are just modifying chances, and both options entail a huge number of second order effects. This needs to be weighed. It&#x27;s not as simple as saying &quot;well option A is literal death, so the other must always be better&quot;. And pointing that out does not mean I&#x27;d die to save a handful of jobs.<p>The flu also kills hundreds of thousands of people, and it does so each and every year. So should we be in permanent lockdown? After all, it&#x27;s <i>lives</i> versus a handful of jobs.')
