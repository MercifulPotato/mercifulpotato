You shouldn&#x27;t trust the airlines or other people, or the distancing &#x2F; testing measures they employ before being there.<p>I personally think about the viral load, which I think isn&#x27;t well researched.<p>My intuition is that the measures currently in play help reduce the viral load well enough. Flight attendants are decently vigilant about enforcing mask wearing or have been enough so that the threat of them enforcing it is real enough, even with the glaring exceptions for food service.<p>So that means exposure is likely, but too much exposure is mitigated in a variety of ways. If you want to totally avoid exposure at all, you should not fly, just as it has been.<p>If you want to take your chance, and focus more so on not spreading it further, trying to help keep your local R0 below 1, then I think it this is very practical.')
