Taking Amphetamine daily for years in reasonable doses essentially has no long term negative effects. In that way, similar to coffee.<p>When I think about that, it&#x27;s kind of mind blowing.<p>For that matter, it is also crazy that we don&#x27;t start giving children coffee at younger ages to help focus — since there are no known negative effects. It&#x27;s just a cultural trope that it stunts growth, etc. It took ages before people recognized that there weren&#x27;t really health downsides to coffee. We are so trained to expect that &quot;every up has a down&quot; — but what if that&#x27;s just a relic of Calvinism and we are inhibiting our full potential because of misplaced fears?')
