I have a Prius. I&#x27;m not too thrilled at the idea of buying a 2nd car (truck), and i don&#x27;t want to drive <i>only</i> a truck.. so how am i to get the supplies?<p>Sounds like a silly question, but yea - things are just big. And i always thought i can&#x27;t bother if i don&#x27;t have a truck. Especially with the ~$70 overhead on shipping i see from lowes, home depot, etc. And i&#x27;m not aware of any local (wood) places that deliver.<p>Am i missing anything obvious?')
