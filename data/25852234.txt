It&#x27;s like a hybrid of some classic-Algol-style, C-style, and Haskell-style (particularly at the function&#x2F;struct declarations), but mostly C-style.<p>That he seems to have thought deliberately about stepwise refactoring is actually pretty nice. This is hard to do in many languages (where refactoring-to-function&#x2F;method is often a wholesale endeavor). Doing it stepwise means you can iterate and test more deliberately throughout the process, and is nicer if you&#x27;re not using a refactoring tool beyond your text editor.<p>In the end, reading the example code caused me no headaches, it was as clear as any other C&#x2F;Algol-derived language.')
