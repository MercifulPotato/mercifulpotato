The general picture about when and how things will go to hell did not play out. This is the single thing I care about most - that disaster scenario did not happen in two-three weeks, despite being predicted many times. And most of the time it wasn&#x27;t a &quot;balanced&quot; prediction like &quot;if we are unlucky millions die, but most likely only few thousands&quot;; it was more often than not pure fear mongering.<p>Also, I think it&#x27;s really uncharitable to use the word &quot;fixate&quot; here.')
