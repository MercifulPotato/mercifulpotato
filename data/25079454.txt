You are going to want a ~1MW supply to a parking lot with even 30 or so chargers.<p>That&#x27;s not a trivial thing to suddenly install. Often will require significant new ducting and cabling to be ran from far away.<p>Even before EV rollout getting a 1MW supply can take years from the power company.<p>You also have another problem that cities do not have enough transmission capacity from the main grid to them to handle 2xing power supply.<p>It&#x27;s definitely doable but really is going to be similar to building today&#x27;s power grid out all over again. Everything needs doubled.')
