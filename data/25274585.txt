I think they didn&#x27;t have to collect sales tax on any cross-state transactions (tax is owed at the point of delivery). Whereas brick and mortar stores almost never make transactions with their customers across state borders.<p>According to Wikipedia [0] they only had to collect sales tax in all states since 2017 after some &quot;Amazon laws&quot; were introduced? That sounds later than I expected.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Amazon_tax" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Amazon_tax</a>')
