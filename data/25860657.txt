Crashed while compiling (looking at you, msvc) are also bad, but less serious.<p>In any case, you&#x27;d be surprised how many bugs a useful compiler may have.<p>For the record, I consider the three compilers I mentioned, having observed all sorts of bugs in then almost yearly, very high quality compilers.<p>We can mostly just work together to add to the mountain of regression tests that safeguard our open source compilers.<p>Maybe formal verification will some day produce bug-free toolchains, but we are not there yet for the production grade optimizing compiler.')
