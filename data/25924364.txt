It&#x27;s not even the biggest. Some video formats it can&#x27;t even compete in because competitors are so far and away superior.<p>I think you really mean that YouTube is a <i>popular</i> site. But it is certainly not <i>the</i> site going by site size. That would be FB. Not the most engaging either with snapchat and tik tok out there. It&#x27;s certainly better than the other &quot;also rans&quot; like daily motion though.<p>(Actually, now I think about it, I&#x27;m not even sure I would say it is necessarily &quot;better&quot; than DM. Maybe a better phrase would be &quot;seems to be more popular&quot;?)')
