Researching the bigger picture, tying together the concepts of representation, rendering, analysis, manufacturing, etc. is my rabbit hole.<p>For those of you that don&#x27;t know, mkeeter has developed Libfive--a well-regarded project which performs isosurface extraction of implicit functions to triangular meshes--so we can render them with OpenGL or print them on a 3D printer, for example.  The implicit functions can be implemented at several language layers, including C, C++, and Scheme.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;libfive&#x2F;libfive" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;libfive&#x2F;libfive</a>')
