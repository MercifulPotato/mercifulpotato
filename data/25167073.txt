You get better performance than an SD card, something that can arguably get &quot;SSD-like&quot; performance in short bursts, and you don&#x27;t have to jury-rig an external SSD to the Pi. Doesn&#x27;t offer the same durability as a full-size SSD but might be good enough (and cheap enough to try IMO).<p>There&#x27;s also endurance microSDs made for constant writing -- and I bought one for my current Pi 4 -- but I don&#x27;t have enough experience with those to say whether it solves the Pi corruption issues.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samsung.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;computing&#x2F;memory-storage&#x2F;usb-flash-drives&#x2F;usb-3-1-flash-drive-fit-plus-256gb-muf-256ab-am&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samsung.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;computing&#x2F;memory-storage&#x2F;usb-flas...</a>')
