And the mismatch between trading and settlement here obviously caused some problems (note, though, only at the hip fintech brokers, not at the old fashioned  brokers that insist that your trades in a cash account settle before you trade again).<p>However, may I suggest that the better solution to this mismatch is not to speed up the settlement infrastructure (well, that too, to an extent), but to slow down trading??<p>A couple of auctions every day instead of continuous limit order book trading and a Tobin Tax on trades would eliminate a lot of rent seeking, simplify lots of things, and hardly affect the fundamental functions of the capital markets at all (maybe improve them).')
