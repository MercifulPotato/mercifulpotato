Worst case scenario here is downtime, which is a far stretch from &quot;completely fucked&quot;. It very much sounds like the databases that you work with and the databases that the article writer works with are used for two very, very different purposes. The author made no mentions about SLO-type requirements, so I think it&#x27;s fair to say that SLO isn&#x27;t a huge priority. But that can be mitigated, like I said, with a hot&#x2F;warm&#x2F;cold standby.<p>Do you think it&#x27;s a bad idea to use something like PostGIS  because it uses functions that live on the database?')
