Such a bore.<p>By the way, lets look at some other circumstances:<p>Suspension of habeas corpus. Abraham Lincoln, Civil War. Half of country wants to clock the other half. Total existential threat.<p>WWI. Schneck v. United States. Cornerstone and terrible case for limiting free speech in order to silence opposition to the bloody draft.<p>WWII:Japanese internment camps. Labor cracked down on for striking and shutting down <i>most of the wartime manufacturing supply chain</i>. Existential threat.<p>2001: 3 buildings hit with aircraft. All liberties around airtravel  basically cancelled. Heavy intensification of SIGINT intensifies, birth of widespread dragnet surveillance programs.<p>2020: A bunch of people waltz into the Capitol pissed as all hell because their concerns were not taken seriously. Rest of country is just fine. Suggestions to yeet civil liberties because think of the Congresspeople who had to continue their meeting elsewhere!<p>One of these is not like the others. Further, Congress is getting what it deserved. With the way they&#x27;ve spent years delegating increasing chunks of lawmaking to the Executive branch, ain&#x27;t it grand the way they get reminded of why checks and balances were there in the first place?')
