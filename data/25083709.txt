There are a lot of tech companies that were profitable at time of IPO and that did not include the first statement.<p>Just because it has become standard operating procedure for tech companies to go public with a business model of &quot;lose money on every sale, but make up for it in volume&quot; (with a hope that they can sustain predatory pricing long enough to dominate the market) doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s ever less interesting. It&#x27;s a fairly recent phenomenon and IMO will never get old to comment about every time there&#x27;s a notable IPO.')
