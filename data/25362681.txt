Their IPO is quite an achievement.<p>I&#x27;m curious to see what the state of aggregated food delivery will be in, say, 2024. Not too far in the future, but long enough for losers to start giving up.<p>My current understanding is that DoorDash-like start-ups are consistently in the red. The upfront expenditure on engineering and marketing for a 3-sided marketplace is huge. The business model would be to take a bit from each transaction and achieve profitability on volume. Thus, a winner-takes-all (or few-takes-all) situation seems inevitable.<p>It seems there&#x27;s many players right now in the space, and the only differentiator I see thus far is restaurant selection and price.<p>I may be in my own bubble, but I have <i>no loyalty</i> to DoorDash, UberEats, GrubHub, etc. I usually flip through each app to compare prices and pick the lowest one.<p>As an investor, how would you differentiate these food delivery start-ups?')
