Item(by='owenversteeg', descendants=None, kids=[25145000], score=None, time=1605731438, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25140319, text='I personally don&#x27;t drink much (a small fraction of the average alcohol consumption) but I disagree strongly with that wording. While it may not be wrong scientifically speaking that there isn&#x27;t any level of alcohol consumption with no negative effects whatsoever, using the same thinking you could also say things like &quot;there is no safe distance to ride a bicycle&quot;. This kind of black and white approach has absolutely no place coming from a supposed public health authority like the WHO.<p>Furthermore, occasional, moderate alcohol consumption has pretty minimal risks, all things considered, and eliminating every little thing in your life with low risk would leave you with an impossibly dull existence. You wanna live the safest possible life? Don&#x27;t go anywhere (cars are terribly dangerous and biking has its risks too), don&#x27;t have too much of a social life (other people can infect you with all kinds of things, even in normal years the flu kills 700k people&#x2F;year), don&#x27;t go near water, don&#x27;t even go anywhere you might slip (fall deaths kill tens of thousands annually in the US!) And don&#x27;t even think of running off to a farm somewhere to escape it all (more than half of all workplace fatalities occur on farms!) At some point, you just have to live, dammit, because living life in fear is not living life at all.')
