Was the fundamental theorem of calculus something discovered by man (i.e created by God) or something created by man?<p>He thought it was both something created by man, and yet also something discovered.<p>Our mathematical constructs seem to me to describe things as they are, like discoveries, but it’s like we could only understand the discovery by creating a new way to think about things.\nWhat’s most fascinating is they’re not just constructs that are true in that they’re predictable and can be tested, but they have a. absoluteness to them that is this is true or nothing is true.')
