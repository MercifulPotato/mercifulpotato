Similarly with black[0] for Python. I used to care terribly about style, until I realized I just care about consistency and readability. Otherwise I don&#x27;t give a shit, and having a tool available to everyone makes such a difference. This goes for other tools too, like static checkers, linters, even CI. I&#x27;ve been on projects where anyone could run the whole CI pipeline (which included the aforementioned static checkers, unit tests, even a doxygen run to check for undocumented things) on their dev machine before submitting, and not waste anyone&#x27;s time with things better done by a computer. Wish every project could be like that.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;black.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;black.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;</a>')
