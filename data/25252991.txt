In higher level jobs, not so much. But to really teach the dialect we would have to agree on a &quot;standard&quot; version, which would be very hard, as the dialect is highly regional and there is strong accentism within the dialect. The safest bet would be to live in Stuttgart for a few years, here you get a light mix of all the variants and Standard German.<p>But as in any language, perfectly learning a dialect as nearly impossible even for a native speaker. I can understand and imitate Swiss German, but only because it&#x27;s the same dialect family (Alemannic German).')
