In part 1, I discuss the current status and near-term prospects for quantum computing and quantum simulation. In part 2, I emphasize the opportunity to advance our understanding of quantum field theory, high energy physics, and nuclear physics using quantum simulation platforms. In part 3, I describe some recent and ongoing work developing classical and quantum algorithms for simulating high-energy scattering in quantum field theory, particularly in one spatial dimension.')
