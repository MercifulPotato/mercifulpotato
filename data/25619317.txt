BER uses the charge state of DNA (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;100&#x2F;22&#x2F;12543" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;100&#x2F;22&#x2F;12543</a>) to help find thymine dimers, and 5G radiation is in just about the right frequency range to excite nuclear DNA and induce a current in DNA.  I would be looking for a higher rate of mutation in the UV + 5G case over UV control, and no effect in 5G &#x2F; control without UV.<p>What is interesting about this experiment is that 1) it&#x27;s easy. 2) you would never detect this using normal procedures to assess mutagenicity, because normal techniques assume that the harm comes from direct mutation effect of the radiation; in this case the harm (if it is there) would come as a secondary effect, by inhibitng proper repair in the presence of a previous insult.  Moreover, typical lab experiments (rightly) attempt to reduce outside effects (especially mutagens), so it&#x27;s less likely it would have been discovered by accident.<p>Incidentally <i>I&#x27;m</i> sick and tired of people saying &quot;it&#x27;s non-ionizing and therefore not dangerous&quot;.  This is a very reductive statement that belies a complete lack of understanding of biophysical chemistry.')
