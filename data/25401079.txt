Item(by='kwhitefoot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607803030, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25398169, text='&gt; using a fast charger all the times can damage batteries. \nIs this actually true?<p>A Google search suggests that there are lots of studies showing that 25 fast charging cycles wrecks the battery but I have driven my Model S from Norway to the UK and back three times which is about 12 k km altogether and I used Tesla chargers exclusively on the journey.  The practical range is about 300 km so I must have charged much more than 40 times in addition to all the times I have charged on journeys from Oslo to Trondheim and back.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant degradation in range.<p>But who actually does it on ordinary days when not doing a road trip?  I have had that 2015 Model S for three years and I only use the Superchargers when I know that I will travel more than a couple of hundred kilometre in a day; otherwise I can keep the car charged at home (usually just to 80% unless I plan a long trip and I usually charge again before I get to 20%.  Plugging in to an ordinary domestic socket every couple of days is enough and takes seconds.')
