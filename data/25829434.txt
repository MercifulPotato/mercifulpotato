But, I get what you are saying.<p>Consider an extreme straw man example of roman numeral system winning over everything just because of the inertia. The decimal system is great innovation because, it gave us succinct way expressing idea of numbers.<p>Not all languages are like that, but certain languages allow and encourage certain style of programming like OOP for java, though it is a multi paradigm language. I think inertia plays a big role here too. Java is always going to be OOPy language for the most part, because it is what community is built on.<p>Most problems in trying to understanding and communicating is going to be about concepts not the language. The syntax is probably some work, but half a day of work. But, I often do not find it hard to read the code in some other language, I get it once I see the code. But, even after seeing some code, I find it hard to come with code in that language. Because, that is the hard part. jq is one such language. Even though it is niche. When after reading docs, I find it so hard to combine all the small parts of it to make sufficiently large program. That will take, however similar the syntax is.<p>That is the reason, some particular style of programming dominating a language community. We got settle on something. Language is geared towards solving problems and introducing features for certain style. And that helps. It gives a coherent outlook to language and the community.<p>That is what I mean when I say, fragmentation is inevitable. Not everybody wants to understand all different ways of doing things. Even if the concepts seem understandable, thinking in terms of them is much harder for people. Multiple language for different dominant style  seems to be a saner alternative than single language with all the different style.')
