Item(by='maxsilver', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605296314, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25083161, text='&gt; Tablets are becoming another version of PCs, especially with all the Apple news lately.<p>That&#x27;s what Apple wants people to think, but in the real world I&#x27;d argue that&#x27;s highly suspect.<p>iPads are closer to glorified entertainment consoles than anything else. (They&#x27;re 100% locked down, just like a video game console. Their compatibility is artificially limited, just like video game consoles. They&#x27;re sold exactly like video game consoles, on game console lifecycles, with a game-console-like business model and revenue sources). Apple itself seems to agree, Apple claims the iPad is a video game console in their legal fight with Epic when defending Apple&#x27;s monopoly over the software market.<p>If anything, it would make slightly more sense to compare iPad sales to Nintendo Switch sales, than to compare iPad sales to Laptop &#x2F; Desktop PCs.')
