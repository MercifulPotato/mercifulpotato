The average citizen has no idea how hard they&#x27;re being exploited.<p>&gt; Privacy should be a right, the control of my personal information should be mine and consent to have it should be able to be withdrawn at any time.<p>Also agree, but the government has shown they have an interest in making that <i>not</i> happen.
