Add this CSS:<p><pre><code>  *, ::before, ::after {\n    animation-delay: var(--delay);\n  }\n</code></pre>\n… and this JS:<p><pre><code>  var d = new Date();\n  document.documentElement.style.setProperty(&quot;--delay&quot;,\n    -(d.getHours() * 3600 +\n      d.getMinutes() * 60 +\n      d.getSeconds() +\n      d.getMilliseconds() &#x2F; 1000\n     ) + &quot;s&quot;);\n</code></pre>\nI think this would do it. It roughly matches what I did a few years back for an analogue CSS-only (except for this) clock.<p>However, this does still have a weakness: if the browser is suspended (e.g. machine in standby) it gets out of sync. It doesn’t care about leap seconds, either. You could fix these things by triggering this position update every so often, but that would be missing the point of it.')
