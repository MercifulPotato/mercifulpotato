Similar you tend to not need to turn the GC at all for writing UI applications like that, the defaults are just good enough. Lastly while dart can be dynamically typed (EDIT: it&#x27;s opt-in dynamic typing instead of opt-in static typing) it&#x27;s typed statically &quot;good enough&quot;. I love static typing (e.g. rust, scala) but in difference to type script I haven&#x27;t run into any major gotchas when using dart. It feels very Java-ish just without the bad parts of java tbh.')
