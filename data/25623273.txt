However, what I observed with Android’s Google (or is it called Google News?) app last year was a tight feedback loop: after talking a little about %SUBJECT% near the phone, and refreshing the feed within the next minute or two, a relevant article from past few days showed up.<p>(Similar to Vice’s article I linked, but faster.)<p>Again, the owner of the device saw that as a convenience feature and consciously did not set the phone up to prevent it, which made me feel a little old-fashioned and unnecessarily paranoid.<p>Also, unlike Vice’s article, in the scenario I have witnessed the recording did not <i>necessarily</i> have to leave the phone: the news app could have kept a large cache of recent articles and locally pick the ones matching the %SUBJECT% that we spoke about.<p>I am inclined to believe that Google, given their business model and scale, is unlikely to store voice data insecurely or insufficiently de-anonymized, so I’m primarily worried about third-party apps getting access to always-on microphone without visual feedback. (Hopefully it’s not very likely and app stores have tools to detect nefarious uses of relevant APIs at review stage.)')
