If you&#x27;re not near the coast, you probably will never experience an earthquake.  As the recent quake in Massachusetts shows, however, earthquakes can happen almost anywhere.<p>Also, fun fact, the chances of a &#x27;Cascadia megaquake&#x27;, or a full rip of the Cascadia subduction zone, is about 1 in 6 over the next 50 years.  That will produce a 9.0 extending from the Mendocino triple junction off the coast of Cape Mendocino, CA to Canada.  It&#x27;s the same type of earthquake that destroyed Fukushima.  You&#x27;ll have to be pretty far inland to avoid the shaking from that.')
