Everyone, male or female, going off for a couple years of either military training, domestic work (building trails, cleaning up after natural disasters), or international work (Peace Corps on steroids). As an earlier poster said, it&#x27;d mix people up across classes and geography. When you get out, you get $10k in your pocket and a plane ticket anywhere in the country. I&#x27;m way past 18 now but as the person proposing it, I&#x27;d be entirely willing to go take part :)')
