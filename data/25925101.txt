If you have personality, this all can be fun.  If not, and there is no shame in that, do your best to communicate it back anyway.  If you mean it, chances are others will grok that meaning.  Good as it gets.<p>Be humble.  One upside of working with people who may be smarter, wiser through experience, is the good tends to rub off.  More good happens when you seek it too.<p>Seek this in your life when you need or want to grow.  Truth is, others often see something like that and think back to their own growth and it is fun to see and be a part of.  This is true for the ones growing as well as those helping them grow.<p>Have some faith.  You are smart enough.  The rest is just work, and we all have our work to do.  It varies, amd there is no shame in that either.<p>Right here is where many of us would write, &quot;past or younger me...&quot;, but I won&#x27;t.<p>I won&#x27;t, because I happen to have had good mentors, some of whom ended up long term friends, who I ended up helping in like kind later on as my own body of experiences accumulated.<p>I am sharing what was given to me.<p>Do think about your questions and the answers.  This can be confusing, how many ways to ask, how many times, what if...?<p>I resolved this with some help, and the help is make damn sure others you seek help from, but in general just others, know you are working for it.  And if you truly are, not just leaning on others, instead seeking to own it, your questions will be the right or good questions.<p>And when it is your time to share what you got out of this free ride here, you will have become one of those good, or better people. Amplify the good and pass the idea of making good people better along.<p>This is a powerful idea.  And it does not carry any weight of judgement or blame.  Good people work for it, whatever it is, and when they do that while also being good humans in that work, the good in everyone, the team, get amplified.<p>Yeah, I know.  This all seems shallow.  Maybe it is!<p>All I can tell you is I got a lot of consideration and opportunities in my life playing it this way.  You are likely to experience the same.  Others you share it all with will too.  Did not really make enemies either.  One never knows who may be working with, or for who.<p>I like to think it is infectious in the best of ways.  Has been in my experience so far, and in this way we often have more ability to shape our world than we may believe.')
