There are scripts named the same but vary due to each project being different so I can&#x27;t use $PATH (unless I export it every single time I change projects and open a terminal for it)<p>Commands are relative and sometimes these can be executed by other things. Other scripts, cron, etc. depending on the environment and the use. So, first step, cd into the correct directory and then run everything relative to it.')
