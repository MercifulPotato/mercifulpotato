This means a great deal of the language&#x27;s standard functionality can be implemented as if it were in &quot;user space&quot;.   Macros, readtables, method combinations, setf expanders and generalized places, for example.<p>IMO, if Common Lisp were to be extended (it probably won&#x27;t be, at least officially, as there&#x27;s no money for another whack at a standard) I think it would be best even if more &quot;internal&quot; features were surfaced this way, and made available for user extension.')
