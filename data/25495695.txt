Very few employees are paid in any financially complex way.<p>It depends on the class of workers. I&#x27;d agree with you w&#x2F;r&#x2F;t most wage earners being paid in transparent manner. But I think the GP comment was referring to technology workers (given the context of HN.) In the case of tech workers, many are paid in very complex ways.<p>If you have illiquid stock options in a private company, and especially if you have taken a below-market salary as many startup employees have, your compensation is about as complex as a CDO. Just like a CDO there are multiple tiers above you that need to be paid out before you ever get paid.<p>Unlike a CDO, where you can actually pull up the details on the tiers above you (tranches), at startups as employees, you dont get to see the cap table, so the whole maze is invisible too!<p>Worse, unlike a CDO where you can sell at any time, here you have to exercise and hold stock for some far-away liquidity event that usually doesnt happen. So you have an invisible maze, and then a pot of gold at the end, perhaps. Or not.')
