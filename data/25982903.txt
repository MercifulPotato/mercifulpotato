And factor in the Health cost of Transportation related ICE pollution and that makes good financial sense for the credits to continue as the goal for the credits creation extends beyond only Tesla&#x27;s business model.<p>The Heath affects of over a Century on ICE pollution must be part of the math as well. And one need only look at the degradation of Building Facades and Statues and the cost there in Urban areas from ICE related pollution and that&#x27;s more billions spent there over the years as well.')
