Steve Yegge said it most concisely back in 2006 [1]: &quot;At Google, projects launch because it&#x27;s the least-energy state for the system.&quot;<p>The problem is that when one dedicates so much optimization power to shipping, there&#x27;s less left over for things like maintenance and support. That might not be a huge deal for any individual product, but in the aggregate it sets a higher bar for keeping an initiative running — which presents externally as an excessive proclivity for killing products.<p>That perception, in turn, erodes user trust in the continuing existence of Google&#x27;s portfolio of non-flagship products. And <i>that</i> leads to even fewer of those products clearing the bar for maintenance funding, because users are less willing to commit to using a product that may be discontinued.<p>Google&#x27;s shipping-first bias was probably a huge advantage for them in the early days. But sometimes a company outgrows aspects of its culture.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steve-yegge.blogspot.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;09&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steve-yegge.blogspot.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;09&#x2F;</a>')
