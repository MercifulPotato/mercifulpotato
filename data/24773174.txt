So we built Canopi for coding newbs like me. What makes Canopi awesome is you can share your data with people and they can use it in their projects but cant steal it. We&#x27;re early days but the roadmap is awesome. Imagine safely sharing realtime data sources, connecting public data. Building your own AI and deploying to production. AI is no longer developer driven, its now democratised and by boosting diversity its now less biased.\nPlease have a play with the frontend proto, share your feedback and watch this space!')
