So in the CASP competition, when teams are given a sequence, do their algorithms do something like the following?<p>1. Search database for homologs of given sequence\n2. Look at MSA and correlated mutations of homologs\n3. Look for similar correlated mutations in given sequence<p>I imagine 1-3 could somehow be embedded in a NN after training on a protein database.<p>&gt; What do you mean by &quot;proximal&quot;? Close in space, or similar in structure?<p>I mean close in space.')
