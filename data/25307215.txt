This would be immensely useful. In my studies I found that I naturally gravitated to classes of problems I was already good at, because that way I could avoid the mental pain of learning new techniques. I really needed a roadmap that lead me to what I actually needed to study, and that showed me where I was strong and weak. But as you said, they never make it super clear which techniques a problem uses, and how those techniques build on and relate to other techniques.<p>I&#x27;m really glad you bring it up, because I had actually been pondering ideas for making a better programming training site based on the idea of a skill graphs (similar to an RPG), repetition to build muscle memory, clear progress tracks based on the graph of skills, and greater insight into your strengths&#x2F;weakness&#x2F;progress with metrics.<p>As far as enumerating techniques, I&#x27;d need a good deal of time to work on that. I think there are two classes, the macro, being data structures&#x2F;algorithms and what type of problems they apply. And the micro, which is more implementation specific techniques. Things like using a loop with two pointers into the same structure (ie: find a cycle in a linked list).')
