The hypothesis is that it makes them <i>feel</i> warmer, similar to how drinking alcohol makes you feel warmer in a blizzard. I imagine the sensation (if true) might be maladaptive to the extent they forgo other behaviors that protect them from the cold, but humans have gotten really far tending to our physical pleasure while often ignoring their unhealthy causes.<p>EDIT: A better example: by all accounts (laymen, primatologists) wild chimpanzees apparently <i>hate</i> rain. If chimpanzees had the choice, all things being equal (e.g. safety, access to food, mobility, etc) a chimpanzee would always choose to sleep under a roof in rainy weather. Yet as far as we can tell they&#x27;re otherwise well adapted to the rain, including to sleeping in the rain.')
