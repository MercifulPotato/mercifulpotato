Apple limits amount of data it&#x27;s using about you, but they use your data to deliver those ads to you.<p>They let you control also using your personal data for it, but they use well known industry dark pattern - you need to opt out. Which is very cynical, given that they force others now to get explicit opt-in from users.<p>Note - I&#x27;m not saying that Apple is as bad others. But they totally do use your data to make more money.')
