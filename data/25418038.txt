That&#x27;s enough of a difference that it will disrupt under glass growing. If that&#x27;s all it does it is already well worth the investment, if it does more than that that would be an amazing bonus (but I&#x27;m not counting on it for reasons that you&#x27;ve already touched on).<p>I disagree with that &#x27;feeds some restaurants&#x27;, regular consumers take in far more in terms of leafy greens, tomatoes, cucumbers and a raft of other vegetables besides than the restaurants do (in particular right now, but also under more normal conditions).<p>If anybody cracks the staple foods under glass problem with any degree of efficiency that would <i>really</i> be a game changer but this vertical farm option is already quite impressive from what I&#x27;ve seen. There are some interesting trials underway in NL by people that at least seem to know what they are doing.')
