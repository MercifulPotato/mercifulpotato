There isn&#x27;t a global best algorithm or setting. Depending on whether you are a server or a client, whether you are on a connection that offers high banwidth, low latency, both or none, depending on the application (streaming, torrenting, VoIP), some configuration will be better than another.<p>If I recall correctly, delayed acks and tcp delay are there to provide higher throughput and prevent network congestion â€”think downloading from an ftp server as fast as possible, without causing trouble to the rest of the channel&#x27;s tenants.<p>The solution provided works very well for a specific problem, HAProxy talking to a backend application, but would probably make things worse if you were to use it for your laptop from your shared home connection.')
