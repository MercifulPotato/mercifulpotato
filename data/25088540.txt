Additionally the quality of the hardware (specification&#x2F;cost aside) far exceeds the alternatives.<p>I HATE the way that apple are going. Their products are absolutely fantastic, but it is evident that the direction is to lock-down the &quot;computer&quot; as they have done their mobile ecosystem. I hope that legislation and regulation will tear their walled garden (and others!) apart. Then we can get back to bashing peoples OS for being not our own - rather than for being the authoritarian minefield they have become.')
