Anyway, from the beginning it easy to see that competing against something like AWS S3 would be super super hard if not impossible.<p>With a low token price, electricity costs, hardware costs and your ISP asking about your absurd bandwidth use, I would be shocked if anyone can actually make a profit on this.')
