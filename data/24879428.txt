It is difficult to see how it could cover everything. If the prophets were adding interesting technical details on how the universe fits together hopefully some P = NP tips or guides to fission or somesuch would be further up on the priority list than the state of salvation of alien souls.<p>I&#x27;m not religious at all, but I don&#x27;t see why the Catholic worldview would have problems with the idea that aliens exist and God has made some sort of arrangement for them. Maybe god just compartmentalises civilisations really well, god has many talents.')
