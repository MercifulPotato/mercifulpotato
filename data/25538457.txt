I have friends at a wide variety of tech companies - Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Tableau, AirBnB, and more.  All of us know, in broad terms, what the others do.  We don&#x27;t discuss trade secrets or specific unannounced projects, but we&#x27;re able to talk about things like &quot;X works on Storage Spaces for Windows, Y works on WebXR, Z works on security, etc.&quot;<p>We&#x27;re also all able to talk freely about what aspects of our jobs and employers we like and don&#x27;t like.  This is valuable information - for instance, I&#x27;ve heard enough first person anecdotes from various teams to know that I&#x27;m not interested in working for Amazon unless all other avenues to pay my mortgage have failed.<p>The Apple experience sounds like my interview with the NSA years ago.  All of my attempts to ask any questions were met with a &quot;no comment&quot; for the most part.  Very frustrating experience.  I walked away with not much more idea of what a job there would be like than you could get from reading Wikipedia.')
