Item(by='manfredo', descendants=None, kids=[24750984], score=None, time=1602464438, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24750262, text='If your takeaway is that we&#x27;re on track to solve energy storage with lithium ion batteries, then you have severely misinterpreted the situation.<p>Remember 300 GWh is <i>global</i> battery production. 4.5 TWh is 9 hours of storage for <i>just</i> the United States. Furthermore, actually using this quantity of batteries would entail ceasing the use of lithium ion batteries for electric vehicles and electronics - not a realistic option. Furthermore batteries only last a few hundred to a thousand cycles, depending on depth of discharge. These batteries need to be replaced every 3-5 years if they&#x27;re being used for diurnal use (cycled 365 times a year), not 15. If you produce 300 GWh of batter every year and hook it up to the grid you&#x27;ll only reach 0.9 or 1.5TWh of battery storage - the first batteries you add will have worn out before 15 years. This can be extended if you reduce depth of discharge. But that entails building an over-capacity of storage. E.g. if you&#x27;re only withdrawing or storing half the energy you can increase the lifespan, but then you need to build 2 TWh for every 1 TWh of actual storage that can be used.<p>Global daily energy consumption is 60TWh. If we want to provide 12 hours of storage then this amounts to 30 TWh. If this is cycled daily, a battery with a life of 2,000 cycles (which is very, very good) then we&#x27;d need to be contributing 5.5 TWh of batteries to grid storage every year. Most lithium ion battery production is expected to be dedicated to electric vehicles, with grid storage making up only ~10% of produced lithium ion batteries [1].<p>And 12 hours of storage is likely only enough to get us to ~80% renewables. 100% renewables is estimated to require 3 weeks of storage [2].<p>We&#x27;re not anywhere close to solving grid storage with lithium ion batteries, even <i>if</i> we assume its exponential growth will be sustained.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;energycentral.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;ec&#x2F;world-battery-production" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;energycentral.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;ec&#x2F;world-battery-production</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pv-magazine-usa.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;01&#x2F;12-hours-energy-storage-80-percent-wind-solar&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pv-magazine-usa.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;01&#x2F;12-hours-energy-stora...</a>')
