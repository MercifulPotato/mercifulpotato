There is nothing Mac-like about it, it is just bland, weird, and terrible. MacOS does not force you to use the Launchpad, for example. The menu bar is still here. The Dock works as it always had. To me one of the worst developments of the Mac UI recently is the disappearance of title bars, but this was a thing in Gnome long before it caught on at Apple.<p>A decently configured KDE or XFCE is much better, and much closer to how a Mac works.')
