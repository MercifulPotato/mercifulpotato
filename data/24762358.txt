Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602564378, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24760969, text='<i>&gt; Zoning allows people that do not own land to decide what can be done with it.</i><p>Land ownership, at least in every US jurisdiction I have experience in, is not that simple. Yes, technically my wife and I &quot;own&quot; our house and the plot of land it sits on. We have a title deed filed with the county clerk. (I&#x27;m leaving out the fact that we have a mortgage because the lien holder on the mortgage doesn&#x27;t really have any rights that are relevant to this discussion; for our purposes here it would be the same if we owned the house and land free and clear.) That gives us a whole bundle of rights connected with the house and land, but it is not absolute &quot;ownership&quot; in the sense you appear to be using the term. The city, the county, and the state all have rights that don&#x27;t go away just because someone buys the house and land; after all, they were all there long before we got there, and they all played a role in building the house and improving the land, not to mention all the infrastructure--roads, sewers, electricity, water, telephone, Internet. Our house and land aren&#x27;t just sitting there in a vacuum; they are part of a community that is bigger than us and that has some ownership rights over the whole community that have to be balanced against the rights of individuals within the community.<p>Someone who really, really doesn&#x27;t want to put up with any of that can go out to a highly rural jurisdiction and buy a plot of land that&#x27;s far enough from all neighbors that they can basically do whatever they want.<p><i>&gt; single-dwelling has almost nothing to do with such high minded purposes, and exists almost entirely to keep higher income home owners away from lower income renters or mixed-income housing.</i><p>Sorry, not buying it. You&#x27;re welcome to build your own community that works the way you want it to if you don&#x27;t like any existing communities. But you don&#x27;t get to just declare by fiat that communities that don&#x27;t work the way you prefer are evil.')
