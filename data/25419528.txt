Item(by='ntsplnkv2', descendants=None, kids=[25419607, 25420372], score=None, time=1607963850, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419260, text='&gt;Sure, but critique is the easy part of anything (including philosophy). You do need to understand how a nuclear bomb works in order to eg design an effective monitoring program. And not just how it works, but how it is built.<p>That&#x27;s just logistics - it comes after your philosophical understanding of the item. We don&#x27;t have to monitor things that aren&#x27;t bad. We monitor nuclear proliferation because we&#x27;ve already made a philosophical judgement on it. It came first.<p>&gt; But we haven&#x27;t!!!<p>The United States is an open market system. What drives most innovation is the free market, not the government. The government is almost always reactionary by nature. Software engineers have free choice to work on what they please. They choose to work for big money on insidious technology and they know it. You can&#x27;t just blame someone else.<p>&gt; So, no, technologists have not been at the healm of the United States. On the contrary, non-technical people -- lawyers and business people, mostly -- have been managing a highly technical world for decades. That&#x27;s why we had no economic policy to manage the impact of automation in the 1990s. It&#x27;s why we still have no climate policy. And it&#x27;s why we had a complete dearth of privacy regulation in the early 2000s.<p>This logic is circular. We live in a highly technological world that can only be created by scientists&#x2F;engineers, but they have no power. So how did we get to this highly technological world if they had no influence or power? Clearly they had power and clout - to suggest otherwise is just, well, wrong. No one is holding a gun to any software engineer&#x27;s head in the US. None of them have to work on adtech. But they do, to make money, more than most people need. So spare me that we need more of these types of &quot;philosophers&quot;.<p>We don&#x27;t have climate policy because people stand to lose money, just like we have software engineers that refuse to take pay cuts to work on actual helpful technology instead of adtech.')
