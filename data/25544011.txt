Whenever a journalist &quot;doesn&#x27;t understand&quot; something that could be learned with a simple google search, it&#x27;s not stupidity, it&#x27;s malicious.  In this case the journalist is pretending to write a story about Palantir winning a contract, but really writing a part of the continuing story &quot;Palantir (and the tech industry in general) is evil and powerful and you should be scared.&quot;')
