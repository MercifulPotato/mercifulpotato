France&#x27;s are lower, but Germany&#x27;s decarbonization is working well.<p>It is also incorrect to assert that the majority of Germany&#x27;s power costs are due to the extra power plants. The majority of the costs are taxes and fees which have nothing to do with the extra power plants.<p>You have numerous falsehoods in your post, your analysis is incorrect, and your conclusions are false.')
