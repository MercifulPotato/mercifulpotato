In general, the longer a statement the less interesting it is. The easier it is to prove with simpler statements, the less interesting it is. And if it&#x27;s superceded by a more general rule it is less interesting.<p>For example, an automated theorem prover can easily prove many statements of the form &quot;A or not-A or (any long statement)&quot;. Those are all uninteresting tautologies that should be discarded.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to theorize about improving these heuristics with AI methods, there is some work along these lines like ENIGMA-NG.')
