Makes it easier to edit by hand if needed, keeps things aligned, and keeps files small.<p>You have to be careful about when you move, scale, group, ungroup, etc. But I have found it pretty reasonable to stay on nice round numbers with inkscape. I feel like inkspace is BETTER for that than say illustrator.<p>Worst case you can export as &quot;Optimized SVG&quot; and reduce the number of decimals. Make sure you check it after though since it can change the design when rounding.')
