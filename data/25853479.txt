From what I&#x27;ve seen, some people get so put off by the different way of editing that they struggle, they find vim a very slow way to do what they were doing before vim - character based editing, moving around with arrow keys, highlighting, inserting, and deleting maybe with some block commands for things like selecting a word or more by using the shift key or ctrl key.  Maybe with the help of the mouse to highlight things and edit.  The thing with vi&#x2F;m is there is a language that allows you to do similar editing but has many many combo effects, once you understand how things combo together, all kinds of things can be done really quickly.<p>There&#x27;s no real killer feature though, there&#x27;s lots of cool features, one that often doesn&#x27;t get mentioned much is that you can filter text through external programs, this combos with all the motion commands and other things, so very quickly you could write a snippet of markdown and change it into html by running it through pandoc, or write your own command line tools that do custom things, like querying things from your own apis &#x2F; databases etc.  Its powerful, because it combos with the rest of the vi&#x2F;m language so you can use it in really creative ways.')
