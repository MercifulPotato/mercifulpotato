It&#x27;ll be called the war on domestic terrorism (or extremism, whatever branding works best), again by the people that claim to love human rights. And it&#x27;ll be as fake as the war on drugs and the foreign war on terrorism, with one goal in mind: to wipe out as many civil liberties as possible (including and particularly going after encryption, privacy, speech&#x2F;expression). Nothing can stop what they&#x27;re about to do, unfortunately. And you can be certain that big tech is fully onboard, you can already see that in their behavior, just like they all lined up so nicely for PRISM et al.<p>You know what all of these people - big state, deep state, military industrial complex, big corporate, whatever you call them by, the whole lot of various power interests that are persistent in DC - hated the most about Trump (far more than his character or policies)? His chaos, how he made a mess of everything, made a mess of <i>their</i> system, made it impossible to make progress on their various goals, such as continuing the pursuit of things like banishing encryption. They made almost zero progress on that under Trump, very little got done. It&#x27;s really difficult to get things done with that much chaos. Well, they&#x27;ve reset the board back to the way they like it, and are about to get back to making big gains again.<p>And when they say it&#x27;s some powerless clown in a buffalo hat trying to pull a coup, they&#x27;re actually the ones attempting a power coup - seizing more power, seizing an opportunity to install new levers in place to control people and curtail rights. Never waste a good crisis, as with 20 years ago and the Patriot Act.')
