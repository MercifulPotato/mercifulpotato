My bias is it&#x27;s hard to interpret things without empirically predictive power as meaningful.<p>It&#x27;s strange for me because I can see the rift between people as a tangible thing, where micro-classes have used the internet to become alien to one another, to where neighbours have developed completely different ontologies that are irreconcilably foreign. I think the problem is even those of us looking to bridge it keep looking for ways to repair it instead of forward to the ways in which it eventually heals.<p>Youtube is doing this because they think they&#x27;re going to win. I&#x27;d just like to take the other side of that bet.')
