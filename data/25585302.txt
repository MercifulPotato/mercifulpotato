But what constitutes &quot;careful&quot; matters here. For example if a city chooses to offer robotaxi discounts to people with bad driving records (before some cutoff date to avoid perverse incentives) then even an average taxi fleet could be a net-benefit even though the taxis do not perform better than the general population. And that&#x27;s just in terms of lives saved, not counting the other benefits of having cheap transportation.')
