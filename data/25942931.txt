I have been an iOS developer for a decade now. I realized long ago that most iOS apps are made of the same parts, and most iOS development work is consists of building the same things again and again.<p>That became even more evident since SwiftUI came out, where I find myself typing the same code again and again. Code snippets somehow alleviate the problem but have never been entirely satisfactory.<p>I was frustrated enough to make a macOS app to take away all that repetitive work (which I made in SwiftUI). The app allows you to structure a full app with a few clicks and then generate code you can export and run in Xcode.<p>I released the MVP some time ago, which allowed only to structure an app&#x27;s navigation flow. Still, that was already a huge time saver for me. I am now adding more and more features to the app, to include the most common code iOS developers write.<p>The app is not very flexible yet, so there are limits to what you can do, but I am slowly working towards a more powerful editor. My objective is to, at least, get to a tool you can use to build a wireframe quickly, which you can then transform directly into an app that needs only minor tweaks (at least, UI wise).')
