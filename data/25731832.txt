Git provides a zero cost (in time and money) way to share your full work with audibility; where fixing mistakes continuously is expected and not something to be embarrassed about; where people can instantly clone to reproduce and test better ideas upon your work; where collaborating with proper attribution is done automatically, et cetera.<p>Look in any fieldâ€”epidemiology, computer science, physics, chemistry, medicine, et cetera. If the leading experts aren&#x27;t using git yet, look for the ones that are. They will be the leading experts of tomorrow.')
